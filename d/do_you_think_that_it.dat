"Countess," [...] he answered, [...] "it is {{very strange}} {{to me that you}} should so long have been ignorant of the truth. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for the sake of Theos I have planned for the {{overthrow}} of Ughtred of Tyrnaus? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for your brother's sake that I have smoothed his way to the throne? No! My reward has always been clear before me. I have looked for it always at your hands." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, my dear friends, {{let me ask}} you as {{reasonable}} beings, <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> hearing me or any man preach, {{can save}} your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sitting over a book for an hour a day, or all day long, will save your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins are washed away in Christ's blood, when they are there still, and you are committing them? Would they be here, and <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> them, if they were put away? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins can be put away out of God's sight, if they are not even put out of your own sight? If <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> wrong, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God will treat you as if <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> right? Cannot God see in you what you see in yourselves? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be clothed in Christ's righteousness at the very same time that he is clothed in his own unrighteousness? Can he be good and bad at once? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be converted--that is turned round--when he is going on his old road the whole week? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man has repented--that is, changed his mind--when he is in just the same mind as ever as to how he shall behave to his family, his customers, and everybody with whom he has to <b>do?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man is renewed by God's Spirit, when except for a few religious phrases, and a little more outside respectability, he is just the old man, the same character at heart he ever was? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is any use in a man's belonging to the number of believers, if he does not do what he believes; or any use in thinking that God has elected and chosen him, when he chooses not to do what God has chosen that every man must do, or die? ...|$|R

[...] "Without a penny, indeed! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would dance {{attendance}} upon him {{if he were a}} poor man? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Laura would ever have looked twice at him?

6000|$|... "I am a man," [...] he said, [...] "and {{things are}} known to me which a woman would {{scarcely}} discover. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is quite fair to send Lady Redford out motoring with Mrs. Mannering?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was {{not like}} you," [...] he said gently; [...] "it was really very clumsy indeed {{to take for granted}} my {{presence}} here. I have great faith in you and your methods, my friend, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would have been altogether wise for me to have slept here alone with unfastened door--under the circumstances?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Leonard," [...] she said, [...] "but I think I must go and fetch father now. You {{can walk}} with me there, if you will. It {{has been very good}} to see you again.

6000|$|... "Somewhere {{about seven}} {{millions}} of francs," [...] Sogrange declared. [...] "There are few men in Paris more extravagant than I, and I {{think that we}} Frenchmen know what extravagance means.

"Frank," [...] {{she broke}} in, suddenly, {{and he started}} as {{for the first time}} for years she called him by his Christian name, [...] "you are an old friend of ours, and you promised me that you would always be my friend. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is right to be trying to throw dust into my eyes? Don't you think, on the contrary, that as a friend you should speak frankly to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that it is, Ned. Your mother must be really fond of this man or she would not have married him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> conduces to the comfort of her home to see the {{constant}} antagonism which prevails between you and him? Is it not the fact that this ill temper under which she suffers {{is the result of the}} irritation caused to him by your attitude? Do you not add to her burden rather than relieve it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't {{you see the}} truth?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "My {{uncle was}} murdered. Why? What was the motive? Robbery! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{for the sake of}} the twenty pounds or so that he had on him, and which were found untouched? The man Rowan was in South Africa with my uncle,--he knew his business. It was no {{ordinary}} quarrel, this. I tell you that Rowan robbed my uncle of something--I don't know what--but something which was the backbone of this letter!" [...] she exclaimed, dashing it upon the table,--"something which justified him in staying at the Universal, something which must be found!" ...|$|E

Even Miss Abbeway is forced to admit that any one less likely to sympathise with our aims {{it would be impossible}} to find. At the same time, if we do arrange an interview for you, use any arguments you can think of. To tell you the truth, our whole calculations have been upset by not discovering the packet upon his person. He was on his way to Downing Street when our agents intervened, and we never doubted that he would have it with him. When will it be convenient for you to pay your visit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then perhaps," [...] she answered, {{with a new}} coldness in her tone, [...] "perhaps I {{really do}} not care. No, don't {{interrupt}} me. I think that I am a little disappointed in you. You appear to be amongst those strong enough in all ordinary matters, but who seem to think it quite natural and proper to give in at once and play the weakling directly--one cares. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> makes for happiness to force oneself into the extravagant belief that love {{is the only thing}} in the world worth having, and to sacrifice for it independence, self-respect, one's whole scheme of life. I cannot do it, David. Perhaps, as you say, I do not really care--but I cannot do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} foolish, Terence," [...] she said, almost with a laugh, [...] "as foolish {{as you were}} at Coimbra. Do you think that I should have said what I did, then, if I had not meant it? Did you not save me, {{at the risk of}} your life, from what would have been worse than death? Have you not been my hero, ever since? Have you not been the centre of our {{thoughts}} here, the great topic of our conversation? Have not your father and I been as proud as peacocks, when we read of your rapid promotion, and the notices of your gallant conduct?

6000|$|... "I would sooner die here, at your feet, this moment, {{and know}} that you must follow me within an hour, than see you married to such a one as that. You shall never marry him. Though I went into court myself and swore that I was that lord's mistress,--that I knew it when I went to him,--that you were born a brat beyond the law, that I had lived a life of perjury, I would prevent such greater disgrace as this. It shall never be. I will take you away where he shall never hear of you. As to the money, it shall go to the winds, so that he shall never touch it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is you that he cares for? He has heard of all this wealth,--and you are but the bait upon his hook to catch it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two--three, {{if there}} are to be two or three sad years! I will wait for you till you are as grey as old Peter, and I have not a note left in my throat. I will stick to you like beeswax. But I will not have you here hanging about me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not be {{pleasant}} {{for me to have}} a lover to congratulate me every day on my little triumphs? Do you think that I should not be proud to be seen leaning always on your arm, with the consciousness that Mr. Moss would be annihilated at his very first word? But when a year had passed by, where should I be? No, Frank, it will not do. If you were at Morony Castle things would go on very well. As you choose to assume to yourself the right of interference, we must part." ...|$|E
