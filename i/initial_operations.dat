30|$|For the {{treatment}} of non-functioning parathyroid carcinoma, {{it is crucial to}} perform radical excision in the <b>initial</b> <b>operation.</b> It is difficult however to achieve a definitive diagnosis of this disease pre-operatively unless we keep this disease in mind, as it exhibits neither hypercalcemia nor PTH elevation. Radical excision should not be performed in the <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> in approximately 86 % of cases [1]. The lesions on the right recurrent nerve, muscular layer of the esophagus, and the membranous wall of trachea were all resected with the tumor during the <b>initial</b> <b>operation.</b> In our case, lymph node recurrence in the right neck occurred after 9 and 25  months from the <b>initial</b> <b>operation,</b> and irradiation to the neck was required after the second lymph node dissections. No distal metastasis occurred, and the patient is still alive.|$|R

5|$|In July 1942, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea towards the Philippines or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of Europe first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. By agreement among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into the South West Pacific Area, under General Douglas MacArthur, and the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area but the <b>initial</b> <b>operations</b> in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion.

5|$|The Hungarian {{occupation}} of Yugoslav territories {{consisted of the}} military occupation, then annexation, of the Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje and Prekmurje regions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Kingdom of Hungary during World War II. These territories had all been under Hungarian rule prior to 1920, and had been transferred to Yugoslavia {{as part of the}} post-World War I Treaty of Trianon. They now form part of several states: Yugoslav Bačka is now part of Vojvodina, an autonomous province of Serbia, Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are part of modern-day Croatia, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day Slovenia. The occupation began on 11 April 1941 when 80,000 Hungarian troops crossed the Yugoslav border in support of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia that had commenced five days earlier. There was some resistance to the Hungarian forces from Serb Chetnik irregulars, but the defences of the Royal Yugoslav Army had collapsed by this time. The Hungarian forces were indirectly aided by the local Volksdeutsche, the German minority, which had formed a militia and disarmed around 90,000 Yugoslav troops. Despite only sporadic resistance, Hungarian troops killed many civilians during these <b>initial</b> <b>operations,</b> including some Volksdeutsche. The government of the newly formed Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, subsequently consented to the Hungarian annexation of the Međimurje area, which dismayed the Croat population of the region.|$|E

This is a retrospective review of our experience in infants and children with AIO. Patients and Methods. The records of infants and children with AIO between January 2001 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed for age at diagnosis, sex, <b>initial</b> <b>operation,</b> interval between <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> and presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. Results. 44 infants and children were admitted with AIO. There were 28 males and 16 females who had 46 episodes. Their ages at presentation ranged from 1 month to 12 years (mean 5. 4 years), while their ages at <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> ranged from 2 days to 12 years (mean 4. 15 years). Time elapsed from <b>initial</b> <b>operation</b> to presentation ranged from 7 days to 8 years (mean 1. 5 years), and 66 % developed AIO within 1 year from <b>initial</b> <b>operation.</b> Appenedecectomy was the commonest operation (29. 5 %). Four (9 %) responded to conservative treatment. The other 40 (91 %) required surgical intervention. Twenty-nine had release of adhesions only, while 10 (25 %) had resection of small intestines and one underwent stricturoplasty. Two developed recurrence and one died. Conclusions. AIO is rare in the pediatric age group and the majority becomes symptomatic within 1 year of operation. Appendecectomy is the commonest operation leading to AIO. The place of conservative treatment is limited and to obviate delay and decrease the chance of intestinal ischemia, they should be treated early with surgical adhesiolysis...|$|R

After <b>initial</b> <b>operations</b> in the English Channel from July 1940 onwards, operations against the coast of occupied Norway from the Shetland Islands began in November 1942 and continued throughout the war in Europe. In total 30 motor torpedo boats served in the Royal Norwegian Navy during the war years.|$|E
25|$|A {{long period}} of {{training}} followed on the Atherton Tablelands, as inter-Allied politics resulted in limited opportunities for the employment of Australian troops throughout 1944 and into 1945. As a result, {{it was not until}} mid-1945 that the 2/32nd went into battle again. The Borneo campaign ultimately proved to be their final involvement in the war. During the <b>initial</b> <b>operations</b> to capture Labuan, the battalion remained in reserve, and only came ashore on 12 June. The battalion was transported from Labuan to Padas Bay four days, on 16 June, via landing craft, and following this took part in capturing Weston the next day. The 2/32nd subsequently patrolled towards Beaufort and then throughout early July advanced towards Papar. The main advance was made along the railway line with a flanking move being provided by one company that conducted an amphibious landing to the south; after these moves, the town was subsequently taken on 12 July 1945.|$|E
25|$|When Spain went to {{war with}} revolutionary France in mid-April 1793, Captain General Antonio Ricardos faced a {{strategic}} problem. With Bellegarde dominating the main road into France, the Spanish commander had to surround, besiege, and capture the place before he could use the main road as a supply route for his invading army. Accordingly, Ricardos crossed the Pyrenees 20km to the southwest with 4,500 soldiers and descended on the village of Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans. In the first skirmish of the War of the Pyrenees, the Spanish evicted the 400 French defenders. Continuing his left hook, Ricardos' 4,400 troops fell upon a French force at the town of Céret on the Tech River. The French, 800 regulars and 1,000 National Guards with 4 cannon, panicked and fled. Between 100 and 200 Frenchmen became victims of Spanish musketry and steel, while another 200 drowned trying to cross the Tech. Ricardos reported only 17 men wounded. During the <b>initial</b> <b>operations,</b> the Spanish commander placed a detachment near Bellegarde to keep Boisbrulé and his garrison from raiding Spanish supply convoys.|$|E

25|$|After un-assembled {{planes were}} strafed {{on the ground}} on May 30 at Ekron {{airfield}} the fighters were moved to makeshift strip located around the current Herzliya Airport. The airfield was used {{as it was a}} bit back from the front-lines, and was clandestine since it was a purpose built strip, that was constructed after the beginning of hostilities, in between the orange orchards around Herzliya, and didn't appear on published maps. The Israeli Air Force scored its first aerial victories on June 3 when Modi Alon, flying Avia D.112, shot down two Egyptian Air Force DC-3s which had just bombed Tel Aviv. The first dogfight against enemy fighters took place a few days later, on June 8, when Gideon Lichtaman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. During these <b>initial</b> <b>operations,</b> the squadron operated with a few planes versus almost complete Arab theater Air supremacy and the airplanes were parked dispersed between the orange trees. The fighters were moved in October to Hatzor Airbase from the Herzliya strip in due to its unsuitability in rainy conditions, probable loss of clandestine status, moving front lines which made former British bases safe for use, and a shift in the balance of air superiority towards the Israelis.|$|E

40|$|Biliary atresia (BA) is a {{congenital}} malformation or an evolutive inflammatory process which, without treatment, leads to cirrhosis, hepatic failure and death {{within two years}} of birth.

BA {{has become the most}} frequent indication for liver transplantation (LT) in children. With LT, survival expectancy is 90 %. Results of the operation designed for BA remain unsatisfactory, and seem to depend on the age of the infants, as well as on other factors such as liver histology, and centre experience. Since 1989, onset of the paediatric hepatic transplantation program in Geneva, to July 2000, 20 children have been referred for initial treatment of BA, and 26 for possible hepatic transplantation after initial treatment done in another centre.
