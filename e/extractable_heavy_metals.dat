40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} fly ash on <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> uptake by rice and Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn {{availibility}} in contaminated acidic soil were investigated in this study. The fly ash was added at 0, 20 and 40 g·kg- 1 dry weight soil, respectively. The {{results indicated that}} the addition of 20 g·kg- 1 fly ash significantly improved dry weights of leaves, stems and roots of rice. While at the rate of 40 g·kg- 1 fly ash, the dry weithts of leaves and stems of rice decreased. It was also showed that the application of fly ash substantially increased soil pH values from 4. 0 to 5. 1 and 6. 4, and the higher increment was improved by the higher dosage. Further more, the addition of fly ash substantially decreased the avalibility of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> and the higher amendment dosage resulted in the lower NH 4 NO 3 <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations. These results demonstrated that the application of fly ash at 20 g·kg- 1 might be an effective strategy to decrease rice metal uptake and remediate <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contaminated acidic soil...|$|R
30|$|Biosolids {{are known}} to contain high total {{concentrations}} of trace and toxic elements, which exist in more pronounced concentrations in charred product (Bridle and Pritchard 2004; Lu et al. 2013). One detrimental effect of biosolid including waste derived biochar use is the accumulation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> concomitantly reduction of crop growth at higher application rates (Walter et al. 2006; Singh and Agrawal 2007). Ammonium nitrate extractable fraction was used to estimate the bioavailability of micro-nutrient/heavy metals in the biochar which {{was used as an}} amendment in this study. In our case, even the highest biochar rate (30  t ha− 1) did not induce reduction of yields, as yields were always statistically (P <  0.05) higher than or equal to the lower biochar rates, indicating lower phytotoxicity effect as a consequence of very low NH 4 NO 3 <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> fractions (Additional file 1 : Table S 3) and phyto-availability of the metals for the test crop. However it is crucial to investigate the long-term effects of the biochar on dynamics of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> in amended soils (Woldetsadik et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in soils {{is a potential}} risk that may keep organic farmers from using biowaste compost. As the ecological effects of metals are related to mobile fractions rather than to total contents in the soil, we measured the total (aqua regia <b>extractable)</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contents, the readily available water soluble and the potentially bioavailable LiCl-extractable fraction of soil <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in a field experiment after ten years with total applications of 95, 175 and 255 t ha- 1 biowaste compost (fresh matter). Total soil contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb in the compost treatments were not significantly {{higher than in the}} unfertilized control. Total Zn contents increased in the treatment with the highest application rate. In the mobile fractions Cd and Pb were not detectable. Cr, Ni and Zn contents were in the range published for unpolluted soils in other studies and did not show any differences according to treatment. Easily exchangeable Cu (in LiCl extract) was increased with compost fertilization. In several crops, lower Cd contents were measured with compost fertilization than without fertilization. Potatoes which had received mineral fertilizer had significantly higher Cd contents. Crop Zn contents were increased in the compost treatments. In conclusion, fertilization with high quality biowaste compost at such rates and after ten years of application gives no cause for concern with regard to both total <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contents and available <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> fractions...|$|R

40|$|All the {{regulations}} that define a maximum concentration of metals in the receiving soil {{are based on}} total soil metal concentration. However, the potential toxicity of a heavy metal in the soil depends on its speciation and availability. We studied the effects of heavy metal speciation and availability on soil microorganism activities along a Cu/Zn contamination gradient. Microbial biomass and enzyme activity of soil contaminated with both Cu and Zn were investigated. The results showed that microbial biomass was negatively affected by the elevated metal levels. The microbial biomass-C (C-mic) /organic C (C-org) ratio was closely correlated to heavy metal stress. There were negative correlations between soil microbial biomass, phosphatase activity and NH 4 NO 3 <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> The soil microorganism activity could be predicted using empirical models with the availability of Cu and Zn. We observed that 72 % {{of the variation in}} phosphatase activity could be explained by the NH 4 NO 3 -extractable and total heavy metal concentration. By considering different monitoring approaches and different viewpoints, this set of methods applied in this study seemed sensitive to site differences and contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of heavy metals on the size and activity of microorganisms in soils.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increasing}} rates of Pb, Zn and Cu on <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> levels, barley yields, basal respiration and {{the activities of}} catalase, urease, invertase and acid phosphatase were investigated in two soils in a 2 -year greenhouse experiment. In the first year, barley yields were decreased by increasing additions of Pb, Zn and Cu. In the second year, increased yields were recorded at lower rates of addition of all three metals in both the chestnut and chernozem soils. Yield depressions were most marked for added Cu and least marked for Pb but, in contrast, accumulation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in grain, in excess of recommended limits, was most pronounced for Pb and did not occur for Cu. Increasing rates of all three metals caused a decrease in basal respiration; the degree of inhibition was generally greater in the second than in the first year. After 1 year of incubation, increasing rates of addition of metals reduced all tested enzyme activities. However, after 2 years, the pattern of response was more complex, with increases in enzyme activities being noted at lower rates of addition of all three metals. In general, invertase and urease activities were more markedly inhibited by <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contamination than those of catalase and phosphatase. Ammonium acetate-extractable <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in soils were less after 2 years than 1 years reaction time due to their transformation into less labile forms.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} the {{development}} of sustainable soil amendments to meet the increasing demand for arable soils around the globe, coupled with the degradation of these soils from excessive concentrations of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> Coal fly ash and biosolids are two underutilised waste resources that when mixed and applied to <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contaminated soils have the potential to reduce the impact of the <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contamination while providing essential nutrients for plant growth. Coal fly ash and biosolids mixtures have the potential to increase the nature and concentration of soil carbon levels. This thesis examines the potential of coal fly ash, a waste product from the power generation process, to reduce the solubility and plant-availability of three <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> of concern, Cd, Cu and Zn in an acidic podosol. The effectiveness of coal fly ash to achieve this aim was determined using a series of: ␣ <b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> sorption studies and leaching trials, ␣ Pot trials using corn grown in a sandy soil containing artificially high concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn, and amended with coal fly ash and/or biosolids mixtures, ␣ Lysimeter trials using intact soil cores containing a sandy soil with artificially high concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn, and amended with coal fly ash and/or biosolids mixtures, ␣ Batch and lysimeter trials examining the nature and concentration of soil carbon in intact soil cores containing a sandy soil amended with coal fly ash and/or biosolids mixtures. The results indicate that coal fly ash is capable of reducing the potential of Cu, Cd and Zn to leach from soils, as well as provide a substrate for the sorption of the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> and reducing their availability. Results from the pot trials, including plant biomass production, soil chemical attributes and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentration by plants indicate that the coal fly ash and biosolids mixture were successful in increasing plant biomass production and reducing <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> mobility. The addition of the amendments to the lysimeter soil cores did not lead to leaching of Cd or Cu, but Zn was present in the leachate of the lysimeters for all soil cores. The addition of the presence of the coal fly ash and biosolids had varying effects on TCLP and DTPA <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations of the soil layers, with all soluble <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations below regulatory values for <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in waterways. However, the addition of the <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> spikes caused a large increase in TCLP and DTPA <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations within the soil profile, although the lysimeters receiving the Zn spike were the only lysimeters to have any discernible <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> in the leachate. Both soil amendments were effective in reducing the potential leaching capacity and plant available concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn, with the capacity of the coal fly ash /biosolids mixture proving the most beneficial. This was despite the amendments adding higher total concentrations of each of the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> compared to the unamended soil. The capacity of the coal fly ash to sorb a plant-derived form of organic matter was examined using batch trials. Lysimeter trials were also undertaken, with the top half of some of these lysimeter cores amended with coal fly ash and/or biosolids. At the completion of the lysimeter study, the soil cores were dissected into 2 cm horizontal sections which were analysed for total C, C:N ratios, as well as selected UV-VIS spectrometer absorbance values at selected depths within the soil cores. The capacity of the coal fly ash to sorb DOM was demonstrated, but appears to be a pH dependent relationship. The addition of the coal fly ash / biosolids mixture to the lysimeter soil cores led to an increase in total C concentrations, as well as an impact {{on the nature of the}} carbon within the soil profile. However, there were no discernible changes in the soil carbon characteristics below the level of amendment in any of the treatments. The results highlight the effectiveness of using coal fly ash /biosolids mixtures as soil amendments in <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contaminated soils in reducing the potential risks of these soils contaminating surface or groundwater resources. The results also demonstrate the usefulness that coal fly ash and biosolids mixtures have as soil amendments in rehabilitating <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contaminated soils and the effectiveness of using coal fly ash / biosolids mixtures as soil amendments in retaining soil carbon...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of potentially toxic elements (PTE) and their mobility in soils were {{studied in the}} district of Ravenna (Italy), due to the presence of numerous and long established industrial sites, along with intensively cultivated agricultural land and high vehicular traffic. Extractions of soil samples, collected from the surface and subsurface horizons of an urban park, a suburban pinewood and arable fields, were performed with water and 10 mmol LMWOAs solution, consisting of acetic acid, formic acid, citric acid and malic acid at a ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 : 1. Pseudo-total soil content of heavy metals was estimated by aqua regia digestion. <b>Extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb) and pseudo-total metal contents were used to estimate the solid/solution distribution coefficients (Kd) of PTE in order to assess the environmental risk with respect to plant uptake and/or leaching throughout the soil profile to groundwater. The soils were analysed for pH, particle size distribution, cation exchange capacity, carbonate content, Fe, Al and Mn oxides and organic C content. Due to the natural enrichment in soil organic matter under the pinewood the determination of active humic substances, namely humic and fulvic acids, in the upper horizons were also performed. The results were interpreted using linear and multiple linear correlation and regression analysis.

30|$|During {{the process}} of immobilization, heavy metals in soils are removed using {{amendments}} from soil solution either through adsorption, complexation, and precipitation reactions, thereby rendering the metal(loid)s unavailable for human and plant uptake and leaching to groundwater [6]. One of these promising amendments is biochar, which is a porous, carbonaceous product obtained from the pyrolysis of organic materials. Numerous materials {{can be used as}} feedstock. Rice husk, as one of the major crop residues, showed a great ability to remove various heavy metal pollutants and increase in crop yield [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Every autumn across the world, diminishing daylight hours and falling temperatures induce trees to shed leaves in billions of tons. One of the prevalent trees worldwide is the maple tree which is easily accessible. Hence, fallen maple leaves might be a promising feedstock to use as soil amendment. However, the application of biochars on immobilization of heavy metals has not been systematically investigated to any extent [12]. Red mud, a reddish-brown colored solid waste produced from the aluminum industry, is known as a cheap adsorbent for the removal of toxic metals. Lee et al. [13] reported that adding red mud as a good adsorbent for the adsorption of Cd, Pb, and Zn significantly decreased the amount of soluble and <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in soil. Moreover, steel slag is considered as an appropriate soil agent to reduce the migration of toxic elements to plants and groundwater [14, 15].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the distribution, bioaccessibility, and phytoavailability of heavy metal (loids) in long-term contaminated soils within the vicinity of a lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) smelter in Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia. Thirty-two representative surface (0 – 100 mm) soils were collected from the region surrounding the smelter. The soils were analysed for aqua regia <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb), bioaccessibility using a simplified physiological-based extraction technique (SBET), and phytoavailability using 1 M NH 4 NO 3 extractions, together with key soil properties known to influence metal speciation and availability. The area was found to be potentially contaminated with heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) with many soil samples exceeding the Australian Health Investigation Levels for ‘Standard ’ residential areas. Lead bioaccessibility ranged from 32 to 100 % of the total Pb concentration, with bioaccessibility increasing as metal loading increased. Heavy metal phytoavailability was strongly related to soil pH for Cu (r 2 = 0. 84, P < 0. 001), Pb (r 2 = 0. 70, P< 0. 001), and Cd (r 2 = 0. 66, P < 0. 001), implying that the phytoavailability of these heavy metal was mainly governed by soil acidity. Most significantly, the presence of multiple metals was found to influence metal phytoavailability. For example, the presence of Pb significantly influenced the phytoavailability of Cd (r 2 = 0. 89, P< 0. 001) and Zn (r 2 = 0. 78, P < 0. 001) in mixed heavy metal contaminated soils...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} and chemical fractionation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> retained in mangrove sails receiving wastewater were examined by soil column leaching experiments. The columns, filled with mangrove soils collected from two swamps in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China, were irrigated {{three times a}} week for 150 days with synthetic wastewater containing 4 mg l(- 1) Cu, 20 mg l(- 1) Zn, 20 mg l(- 1) Mn and 0. 4 mg l(- 1) Cd. Soil columns leached with artificial seawater (without any <b>heavy</b> <b>metals)</b> were used as the control. At the end of the leaching experiments, soil samples from each column were divided into five layers according to its depth viz. 0 - 1, 1 - 3, 3 - 5, 5 - 10 and > 10 cm, and analyzed for total and <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> content. The fractionation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the surface soil samples (0 - 1 cm) was investigated by the sequential extraction technique. In both types of mangrove soils, the surface layer (0 - 1 cm) of the columns receiving wastewater had significantly higher concentrations of total Cu, Cd, Mn and Zn than the control. Concentrations declined significantly with soil depth. The proportion of exchangeable <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in soils receiving wastewater was significantly higher than that found in the control, about 30 % of the total <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> accumulated in the soil masses of the treated columns were extracted by ammonium acetate at pH 4. The sequential extraction results show that in native mangrove soils (the soils without any treatment), the major portion of Cu, Zn, Mn and Cd was associated with the residual and precipitated fractions with very low concentrations in more labile phases. However, in mangrove soils receiving wastewater, a significantly higher percentage of Mn, Zn and Cd was found in the water-soluble and exchangeable fractions. Copper appeared to be more strongly adsorbed in mangrove soils than the other <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> In general, <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> accumulation in the surface mangrove soils collected in Hong Kong was higher than those in the PRC, although the metals in the latter soil type were more strongly bound.

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> mobility, {{bioavailability}} and toxicity depends {{largely on}} the chemical form of metals and ultimately determines potential for environmental pollution. For this reason, determining the chemical form of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> and metalloids, immobilized in sludges by biological mediated sulfate reduction, is important to evaluate their mobility and bioavailability. A modified Tessier sequential extraction procedure (SEP), complemented with acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneous extracted metals (SEM) measurements, were applied to determine the partitioning of five <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (defined as Fe, Ni, Zn and Cu, and the metalloid As) in anoxic solid-phase material (ASM) from an anaerobic, sulfate reducing bioreactor into six operationally defined fractions. These fractions were water soluble, exchangeable, bound to carbonates (acid soluble), bound to Fe-Mn oxides (reducible), bound to organic matter and sulfides (oxidizable) and residual. It {{was found that the}} distribution of Fe, Ni, Zn, Cu and As in ASM was strongly influenced by its association with the above solid fractions. The fraction corresponding to organic matter and sulfides appeared {{to be the most important}} scavenging phases of As, Fe, Ni, Zn and Cu in ASM (59. 8 - 86. 7 %). This result was supported by AVS and SEM (Sigma Zn, Ni and Cu) measurements, which indicated that the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> existed overwhelmingly as sulfides in the organic matter and sulfide fraction. A substantial amount of Fe and Ni at 16. 4 and 20. 1 %, respectively, were also present in the carbonate fraction, while an appreciable portion of As (18. 3 %) and Zn (19. 4 %) was bound to Fe-Mn oxides. A significant amount of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> was also associated with the residual fraction, ranging from 2. 1 % for Zn to 18. 8 % for As. Based on the average total <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> (TEHM) values, the concentration of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the ASM was in the order of Cu > Ni > Zn > Fe > As. If the mobility and bioavailability of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> are assumed to be related to their solubility and chemical forms, and that they decrease with each successive extraction step, then the apparent mobility and bioavailability of these five <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in ASM increase in the order of Cu v As v Ni v Fe v Zn.

The effects of adding dried, ground, alum {{water treatment}} sludge (10 % w/w) to the feedstock for composting municipal green waste alone, green waste plus poultry manure, or green waste plus biosolids were determined. Addition of water treatment sludge reduced water soluble C, microbial biomass C, CO 2 evolution, extractable P, and <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> during composting. The decrease in CO 2 evolution (i. e., C sequestration) was greatest for poultry manure and least for biosolid composts. The effects of addition of water treatment sludge to mature green waste-based poultry manure and biosolid composts were also determined in a 24 -week incubation experiment. The composts were either incubated alone or after addition to a soil. Extractable P and heavy metal concentrations were decreased by additions of water treatment sludge in all treatments, and CO 2 evolution was also reduced from the poultry manure compost over the first 16 - 18 weeks. However, for biosolid compost, addition of water treatment sludge increased microbial biomass C and CO 2 evolution rate over the entire 24 -week incubation period. This was attributed to the greatly reduced extractable heavy metal concentrations (As, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) present following addition of water treatment sludge, and thus increased microbial activity. It was concluded that addition of water treatment sludge reduces concentrations of extractable P and heavy metals in composts and that its effect on organic matter stabilization is much greater during the composting process than for mature compost because levels of easily decomposable organic matter are initially much higher in the feedstock than those in matured composts...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the growing numbers of contaminated sites, concerns about proper management with reduced environmental footprints have been raised. In the present study, mining of highly contaminated sediments to recover valuable elements such as metals and nutrients is proposed as sustainable approach, both through enhancing resilience of ecosystems and remediation, beside probable turnovers. Thereby, in order to evaluate feasibility of metal recovery, fractionation of thirteen heavy and trace metals (Fe, Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in Oskarshamn harbor and Malmfjärden semi-enclosed bay surface sediments taken from five polluted locations in Kalmar County in southeast of Sweden was studied. The dissolution experiment by a modified BCR (Community Bureau of Reference, now SM&T) sequential extraction procedure (BCR-SEP) {{was used to determine}} the partitioning of elements. Oskarshamn and Malmfjärden sediments showed highest mobility for Zn and Cd, which can be leached out easily by small changes in environment conditions, whereas Al, Ba, and Hg in both sites, beside Cr and Fe in Malmfjärden exhibited high percentage in residual fraction. Moreover, total digestion results turn out that Oskarshamn in comparing to Malmfjärden sediments tended to result in larger contents of total <b>extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (except Al), which is strongly attributed to factories, wastewater treatment plants, and ships traffic in Oskarshamn basin and diffusive sources in Malmfjärden. Despite the smaller magnitude of pollution in Malmfjärden relative to Oskarshamn, besides dredging and removal of sediments, in situ remediation techniques such as capping, using amendments and phytoremediation could be suggested. The results indicated that among different metals in the sediments, particularly in Oskarshamn, Cu and Pb followed by As, Cr and Ni can be considered for future sediment mining...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of heavy metals and their availability to plants were studied {{with respect to}} the particle-size fractions of soil. Soil samples with a range of chemical and physical properties were collected from 10 different rural regions of China. <b>Extractable</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (Ni, Co, Cu and Pb) in the soils using different extractants are compared with the metal contents in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) grown on the soils in a greenhouse study. Correlation analysis showed that 0. 1 M HCl gave the best estimate of plant-available Ni and Co, while DTPA was most suitable for Cu and Pb. Seven of the soils were partitioned into five particle-size fractions: coarse sand (> 500 mu m), medium sand (125 - 500 mu m), fine sand (50 - 125 mu m), silt (2 - 50 mu m), and clay (< 2 mu m). The metals were characteristically enriched in the clay and one of the sand fractions. Extraction studies on each size fraction indicated that fine sand gave a large amount of extractable Ni, Cu, and Pb and medium sand gave high extractable contents of Co. The extractable amounts of Co and Pb were also high in the clay fraction. With regard to the relative contribution of different size fractions, silt was found to be the major fraction responsible for metal availability, primarily due to its abundance in all the soil samples. For Ni, Cu, and Pb, clay and fine sand fractions also had a significant influence on metal availability. For Co, after the silt fraction, the dominant fraction responsible for its availability was clay followed by the medium sand fraction. From the soil textural data and extraction data of each size fraction, it was possible to infer the relative importance of the fractions {{with respect to the}}ir contribution to metal availability...|$|E

Resultsshowed that values of dry weight (DW) of roots, shoots and total plant of spinach grown on Abou-Rawash and El-Nobaria soils significantly increased by using all the organic manure sources (sewage sludge(SS), banana and cotton composts (BC and CC)) and rates (11, 22, and 44 t/fed)) as compared with control treatment. Thehighest dry weight of roots, shoots and total spinach plants grown on both soils were obtained by using cotton compost (CC) followed by banana compost (BC) and sewage sludge (SS) in decreasing order (CC > BC > SS). The obtained results revealed that DW of spinach plants grown on sandy calcareous soil of El- Nobaria was higher under all the organic manure treatments than those obtained from sandy soil of Abou-Rawash. Moreover, dry weight of spinach plants grown on Abou-Rawash and El-Nobaria soils significantly increased by increasing the application rate from all the used organic manures up to 44 t/fed. Organic manures (SS, BC and CC) led to more significantly increases in the concentration of Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Ni in both roots and shoots of spinach plants grown on Abou-Rawash and El-Nobaria soils as compared with control treatment. Theconcentration of Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Ni in roots and shoots of spinach plants grown on sandy and calcareous soils were higher when SS {{was applied to the}} tested soils in comparison with the addition of the other organic composts (BC and CC). The tested sources of organic manures could be arranged due to their inducing effect on Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Ni concentrations in roots and shoots of spinach plants grown on both soils in the following decreasing order: SS > CC > BC. The efficiency of studied materials on <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations was varied in accordance to sources and rates of application and / or the part of the grown plant. All the concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Ni in spinach plants grown on Abou-Rawash and El-Nobaria soils werewithin the normal ranges of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> in plants and did not reach the phytotoxic levels obtained in the literature. The highest values of <b>extractable</b> and total <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the two tested soils after spinach plantation were attained by using sewage sludge (SS) following by BC and CC in decreasing order (SS > BC >CC). The values of extractable and total of studied <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the used soils after spinach plantation follow the order: Zn > Cu > Pb > Ni > Cd. It could be concluded that all the obtained values of DTPA-heavy metals in the used soils are in the normal range and less than tolerable levels of all studied <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> and could be used as the background level of the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in uncontaminated soils of Egypt...|$|R
40|$|It was {{examined}} in this study that magnetic beads, which are assumed to be environmentally functional, could be effective in processing <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> that are water pollutants. For the purpose, magnetic beads containing carboxyl groups, which has strong binding force with <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> are mixed with each Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu and Cr(III) solution, then stirred in pH 6. As a results of the process, it was proven that <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> bind quickly with magnetic beads through the reaction. In order to analyze <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentration, magnetic beads bind with <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> were collected by external magnetic force and dissolved in acid. The graphite furnace AAS was used to get <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentration melted in the acid solution. The results showed that <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> extractions by magnetic beads were influenced by the type and the concentration of a <b>heavy</b> <b>metal,</b> and over 90 % of a <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> can be extracted in ppm level save for Cr(III). It was also examined in the study whether <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> extraction is influenced when other ions exist in each <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> solution. According to experi-ment, adding other <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> to a solution did have little influence on extracting an intended <b>heavy</b> <b>metal.</b> But in case salt or <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> chelate was added, Ni extraction changed sensitively although extracting other <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> were influenced only when the concentration of an added substance is high. In conclusion, it was shown that magnetic beads could be used to treat wastewater with relatively high <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentration...|$|R

25|$|Fungi exhibit {{detoxification}} {{mechanisms that}} ensure <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in their cells do not exceed a certain threshold. These mechanisms include reducing <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> uptake, promoting <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> sequestration and storage within the cell, and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> excretion. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> uptake {{can be reduced}} by sorption and metabolic inactivation at the cell wall and apoplast level. Ectomycorrhizal fungi also {{have the ability to}} bind considerable amounts of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> yet it remains unclear if binding is an effective way to prevent <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> to enter fungal cells. Once inside the cell, <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> can be immobilized in organo-metal complexes, made soluble, transformed into metallothioneins, involved in metal sequestration and/or stored in vacuoles in chemically inactive forms. Antioxidant detoxification systems may also be in place, reducing the production of free radicals and protecting the fungal cell. Fungi can export metals from the cytoplasm to the apoplast. This differential efflux efficiently discards <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> from the cell and is also known to occur in plants. It has also been shown that ectomycorrhizal fungi growing in <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> rich soils often exhibit <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in their sporocarps in addition to other mycelial tissue.

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> such as cadmium, copper, lead, {{chromium}} and mercury, {{are important}} environmental pollutants, particularly {{in areas with}} high anthropogenic pressure. Their presence in the atmosphere, soil and water, even in traces can cause serious problems to all organisms, and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> bioaccumulation in the food chain especially can be highly dangerous to human health. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metals</b> enter the human body mainly through two routes namely: inhalation and ingestion, ingestion being the main route of exposure to these elements in human population. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metals</b> intake by human populations through food chain {{has been reported in}} many countries. Soil threshold for <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> toxicity is an important factor affecting soil environmental capacity of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> and determines <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> cumulative loading limits. For soil-plant system, <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> toxicity threshold is the highest permissible content in the soil (total or bioavailable concentration) that does not pose any phytotoxic effects or <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the edible parts of the crops does not exceed food hygiene standards. Factors affecting the thresholds of dietary toxicity of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> in soil-crop system include: soil type which includes soil pH, organic matter content, clay mineral and other soil chemical and biochemical properties; and crop species or cultivars regulated by genetic basis for <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> transport and accumulation in plants. In addition, the interactions of soil-plant root-microbes play important roles in regulating <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> movement from soil to the edible parts of crops.
