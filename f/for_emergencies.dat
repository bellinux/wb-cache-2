5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township <b>for</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920â€“21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready <b>for</b> <b>emergencies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Magistrates {{were elected}} officials, serving {{as representatives of}} the people {{for the conduct of}} public business. There are two broad {{categories}} of magistrates, the ordinary magistrates such as the consuls, products of the republican constitution, and the extraordinary magistrates such as the dictators, remnants of the monarchial constitution and reserved primarily <b>for</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Each magistrate held potestas, the authority to exercise the office's powers conferred by custom or statute. The most powerful magistrates, such as the extraordinary magistrates, consuls, and praetors, held a kind of authority known as imperium, the authority to command in a military or judicial sense.|$|E
5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. The {{first step was}} to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved <b>for</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|A bitumen-surfaced second runway {{was built}} at No. 1 Airstrip by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, {{after which the}} {{original}} runway was only used <b>for</b> <b>emergencies</b> and taxiing. The minefield around No. 3 Airstrip was lifted and the airstrip was completed, with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers. A new wharf, known as Liles' wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction, was built in September and October 1942. This was capable of handling Liberty ships. Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States, reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days' sailing time plus the time taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships. PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942, and a transhipment and staging area, overhaul facilities for PT boats, a destroyer base and Station Hospital were also constructed. Milne Bay {{was used as a}} staging area for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943, and the New Britain Campaign in December. The base at Milne Bay remained operational {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Groves made {{critical}} {{decisions on}} prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation and acquiring raw materials {{needed by the}} scientists and engineers. By the time he assumed command of the project, {{it was evident that}} the AA-3 priority rating that Marshall had obtained was insufficient. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved <b>for</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide an AAA rating on request for critical materials to remove bottlenecks. Groves went to Donald M. Nelson, the chairman of the War Production Board and, after threatening to take the matter to the President, obtained a AAA priority for the Manhattan project. It was agreed that the AA-3 priority would still be used where possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, the LISPC {{approved}} $37,000 (1947USD) {{to construct}} a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. The gas station, one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who {{took control of the}} parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in traffic patterns, the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became a problematic place for people parking and walking up the Meadowbrook and Loop to fish on the bridges. According to the New York State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or <b>for</b> <b>emergencies.</b> However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal to fish from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Littorio was {{inactive}} for {{the first}} six months of 1943 due to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. Only enough fuel was available for Littorio, Vittorio Veneto and their recently commissioned sister , but even then the fuel was only enough <b>for</b> <b>emergencies.</b> On 19 June 1943, an American bombing raid targeted the harbor at La Spezia and hit Littorio with three bombs. She was renamed Italia on 30 July after the government of Benito Mussolini fell from power. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, Italia and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be interned for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. One Fritz X hit Italia just forward of turret no. 1; it passed through the ship and exited the hull, exploding in the water beneath and causing serious damage. Roma was meanwhile sunk in the attack.|$|E
40|$|Objectives A {{cross-sectional}} {{investigation was}} designed to assess the quality of local government plans <b>for</b> public health <b>emergencies</b> and to determine whether relevant regulations <b>for</b> <b>emergency</b> plans are in place. Methods Sixty-six municipalities were selected randomly using stratified sampling, and a questionnaire investigation on emergency plans was conducted in these municipalities. Results The findings show that approximately 50 % of emergency plans omitted important content; less than 50 % of municipalities had established three regulations <b>for</b> <b>emergency</b> plans. Conclusions Based on the analysis, the quality of existing public health emergency plans is not sufficient. More than 50 % of municipalities lack regulations <b>for</b> <b>emergency</b> plans. Suggestions regarding the responsibility of government at different levels are made. First, central government should draw up a set of standard development procedures and a standard template <b>for</b> <b>emergency</b> plans. Secondly, local governments should revise their plans. Thirdly, local govern-ments should establish regulations <b>for</b> <b>emergency</b> plans as soon as possible...|$|R

The first major fire occurred on November 25, 1897, started accidentally by dance-hall girl Belle Mitchell. She also accidentally started a second major fire on October 14, 1898 which, {{in the absence of}} a fire brigade in Dawson, destroyed two major saloons, the post-office building and the Bank of British North America at a cost of $500,000 ($400 million). The worst fire occurred on April 26, 1899 when a saloon caught fire in the middle of a strike by the newly established fire brigade. Most of the major landmarks in the town were burned to the ground: 117 buildings were destroyed, with the damage estimated at over $1 million ($810 million).|$|E
