30|$|QA {{programs}} are recommended for all diagnostic radiology facilities. A QA program consists of planned and systematic actions providing confidence that a facility will produce consistently high-quality images with minimal exposure. The program has to guarantee periodic checks of all {{components of a}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>x-ray</b> <b>system.</b> It relies on a clear definition of responsibilities of the team members and starts with the specifications of the equipment for purchase. Monitoring and maintenance include {{a series of tests}} that can be performed by different assigned people; they are directed to x-ray generation, exposure, detector performance, post-processing and viewing at a workstation. QA programs use different adapted procedures for different radiological procedures and thus will differ for radiography, CT and fluoroscopy. Images are compared to standards of acceptable image quality. In case of a problem, corrective actions must be in place. The QA program is incomplete without records, a manual and systematic training for all persons involved in it. Finally, it has to be reviewed periodically for all components.|$|E
30|$|In 1935 {{nearly all}} {{clinical}} <b>X-ray</b> <b>systems</b> advertised in Radiology and the British Journal of Radiology {{were of the}} shockproof type. However, it was well into the forties before all electrically unsafe systems were replaced by safe units. According to Grossmann [38, 39], the majority of deep-therapy systems and a considerable percentage of dental systems were shockproof around 1933, {{but the number of}} electrically safe surface-therapy and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>systems</b> was still small.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 There {{has been}} a large {{increase}} in the number of three-phase <b>diagnostic</b> <b>x-ray</b> <b>systems</b> installed in hospital special-procedure rooms during the last decade. The reason for this is the capability of three-phase systems of making possible the very short exposure times and increased tube loading required for some of the recently developed radiological procedures. Analysis of the voltage waveforms indicates that x-ray beams produced by three-phase systems have a higher effective energy and a higher exposure rate than those produced by single-phase equipment operated at the same kilovoltage and tube current. This study compares dose distributions for single- and three-phase <b>x-ray</b> <b>systems</b> operated under conditions similar to those used in medical radiography. Depth-dose data were taken using thermoluminescent dosimeters in a tissue equivalent (Mix D) phantom at 40, 60, 80, 100, 125, and 150 kVp. Measurements were made at 1 cm intervals from the incident phantom surface to a depth of 13 cm, and at 2 cm intervals from 13 to 25 cm. The source to phantom surface distance was 30 inches. Curves of equivalent kilovoltage, which would provide approximately the same radiographic results, were derived for single- and three-phase systems. The data were normalized for equal exposures for various phantom thicknesses related to the energy used, and dose differentials were determined for both equal and equivalent kilovoltages...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>X-rays</b> are {{the largest}} {{man-made}} source of radiation exposure to the general population, contributing about 14 % of the total annual exposure worldwide from all sources. Although <b>diagnostic</b> <b>X-rays</b> provide great benefits, that their use involves some small risk of developing cancer is generally accepted. Our aim was to estimate the extent of this risk {{on the basis of}} the annual number of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>X-rays</b> undertaken in the UK and in 14 other developed countries. METHODS: We combined data on the frequency of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>X-ray</b> use, estimated radiation doses from X-rays to individual body organs, and risk models, based mainly on the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, with population-based cancer incidence rates and mortality rates for all causes of death, using life table methods. FINDINGS: Our results indicate that in the UK about 0. 6 % of the cumulative risk of cancer to age 75 years could be attributable to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>X-rays.</b> This percentage is equivalent to about 700 cases of cancer per year. In 13 other developed countries, estimates of the attributable risk ranged from 0. 6 % to 1. 8 %, whereas in Japan, which had the highest estimated annual exposure frequency in the world, it was more than 3 %. INTERPRETATION: We provide detailed estimates of the cancer risk from <b>diagnostic</b> <b>X-rays.</b> The calculations involved a number of assumptions and so are inevitably subject to considerable uncertainty. The possibility that we have overestimated the risks cannot be ruled out, but that we have underestimated them substantially seems unlikely...|$|R

40|$|The point spread {{function}} (PSF) of {{a translation}} invariant imaging system is its impulse response, which cannot always be measured directly. This {{is the case}} in high energy X-ray radiography, and it must be estimated from images of calibration objects indirectly related to the impulse response. When the PSF is assumed to have radial symmetry, it can be estimated from an image of an opaque straight edge. We use a non-parametric Bayesian approach, where the prior probability density for the PSF is modeled as a Gaussian Markov random field and radial symmetry is incorporated in a novel way. Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior estimation is carried out by adapting a recently developed improvement to the Gibbs sampling algorithm, referred to as partially collapsed Gibbs sampling. Moreover, the algorithm we present is proven to satisfy invariance with respect to the target density. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of these methods on radiographic data obtained from a high-energy <b>X-ray</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> at the U. S.

For obtaining entrance surface doses, a numerical dose determination method has been applied in Japan.

As {{a part of our}} quality control procedures, we recorded the entrance surface air kerma, tube voltage, and half-value layer measurements made for four <b>diagnostic</b> <b>X-ray</b> tubes over a 103 -week period.

The sensitive area of {{the first one is}} 7 mm 2 × 450 μm and the second one is 10 mm 2 × 450 μm. The first detector is cooled by a double-stage Peltier element, while the second detector is cooled by single-stage Peltier element. Each one is equipped with a field-effect transistor (FET). In the detector from Amptek, the FET is mounted separately, while in the detector from PNDetector, the FET is integrated on the chip. The nominal energy resolution given by the producers of the first and the second one is 136 eV@ 5. 9 keV (at - 50 °C) and 132 eV@ 5. 9 keV (at - 20 °C), respectively. Owing to many advantages, the investigated detectors are good candidates for soft X-ray measurements in magnetic confinement devices.

40|$|Although {{clinical}} research is prevalent in chiropractic medicine, very little research {{exists on the}} business related aspects of chiropractic medicine and practice. Consequently, because business courses are limited in chiropractic education, a new chiropractor must establish and operate a private practice with limited business knowledge, often resulting in poor financial decisions. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to provide the new private practice chiropractor with optimal decisions that he or she can make enabling and guiding their financial success. Forty private practice chiropractors were contacted by telephone in Kentucky and Ohio with populations of 17, 000 or less. A total research sample of ten chiropractors completed a structured survey of twenty-one questions using SelectSurveyASP Advanced software. Beginning in the 1970 s, there has been a continuous rise in the debt acquired from chiropractic school, from an average of $ 25, 000 to an average of $ 143, 750 in the 2000 s. The average amount of money that the sample needed to begin their private practice was $ 135, 000. To cover their monthly expenses, the sample needed to earn an average of $ 4, 200. The sample overwhelmingly agreed that the three most important attributes to a private practice chiropractor's success were receptionists/office managers, billing and collection specialists, and massage therapists. The sample also felt that for a new chiropractor to succeed, he or she must purchase a chiropractic table, <b>diagnostic</b> instruments, an <b>x-ray</b> <b>system,</b> transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit, ultrasound unit, and a heat/cold therapy unit.
