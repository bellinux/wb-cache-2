These majorities require certain consensus in collective preferences to declare an alternative as the winner. More precisely, individuals show preference intensities in the unit interval among each pair of alternatives and it is required that the winner alternative obtains a <b>diference</b> in the sum of the intensities with respect to the loser alternative. This <b>diference</b> is a real number located between 0 and the total number of voters. We introduce the values of the required threshold for which majorities based on <b>diference</b> in support lead to transitive and triple-acyclic collective decisions with a probability of 1. Ourresults improve the previous theoretical ones since they require softer thresholds to reach consistent collective decisions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the <b>diferences</b> that {{immigrants}} have in the Spanish labour market. Immigrants in Spain come from a diversity of continents (Africa, South America, Eastern Europe, Asia, etc.), and there are substantial <b>diferences</b> in characteristics not only among continents but also among countries in each continent. Using a quantile regression method of decomposition we estimate these <b>diferences</b> that are reflected in the labour market and in particular are mirrored in the wage, so some immigrants are more discriminated or segregated that others because they have less advantage. For example Argentineans and Peruvians have the same origin and culture but we can find <b>diferences</b> in the wage that they receive in the Spanish labor market, or for example Moroccans have a advantage with respect to the Rest of Africans, due to the geographical proximity to Spain. So when we study the pay gap and the gender pay gap we need to take into consideration the origin of immigrants. We also want to study how the integration of immigrants evolved across years, whether the wage gap that we find in the first episode of work between immigrants and natives disappears or continues to be present in the Spain labour market.

BS 5628 : Part 1 : 20051, the existing British Standard on unreinforced masonry was replaced by EN 1996 - 1 - 1 : 20052 and its associated National Annex 3. In this paper comparisons between these British and European standards have been undertaken to evaluate <b>diferences</b> between strength predictions with respect to vertically loaded walls. Standard size clay and calcium silicate bricks and aggregate concrete and aircrete blocks 215 mm high and of thickness: 100, 140, 190 and 215 mm are included. Initially comparisons to highlight <b>diferences</b> between the various separate procedures, which feed into the wall strength design procedures in each code, are undertaken. Comparisons of wall strength are made to indicate the overall <b>diferences</b> between the two codes when predicting wall resistance. Results indicate that each of the separate procedures that make up the overall design difer, {{and in the case of}} estimating unit characteristic strength <b>diferences</b> of up to 50 % exist. More importantly though, the overall design resistance of vertically spanning walls when compared using the two codes difer by up to (and in one case more than) 50 %. Whilst it is acceptable that individual components of the design process could difer, when combined to give an overall wall strength, they should be broadly similar. This is not the case. However, it should also be noted that in this paper some unit strengths outside what may be expected in practice are included. Nevertheless, the majority of the comparisons could and do arise in industry. Furthermore, this study only examines wall resistances, the impact of how loads are determined...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} precept of the scientifc {{method is}} reproducibility of methods and results, {{and there is}} growing concern over the failure to reproduce signifcant results. Family dogs have become a favoured species in comparative cognition research, {{but they may be}} subject to cognitive <b>diferences</b> arising from genetic (breeding lines) or cultural <b>diferences</b> (e. g. preferred training methods). Such variation is of concern as it afects the validity and generalisability of experimental results. Despite its importance, this problem has not been specifcally addressed to date. Therefore, we aimed to test the infuence of three factors on reproducibility: testing site (proximal environment), breed and sex (phenotype). The same experimenter tested cognitive performance by more than 200 dogs in four experiments. Additionally, dogs’ performance was tested in an obedience task administered by the owner. Breed of dog and testing site were found to infuence the level of performance only mildly, and only in a means-end experiment and the obedience task. Our fndings demonstrate that by applying the same test protocols on sufciently large samples, the reported phenomena in these cognitive tests can be reproduced, but slight <b>diferences</b> in performance levels can occur between diferent samples. Accordingly, we recommend the utilisation of well-described protocols supported by video examples of the whole experimental procedure. Findings should focus on the main outcome variables of the experiments, rather than speculating about the general importance of small or secondary performance outcomes which are more susceptible to random or local nois...|$|R
