Howard had {{previously}} claimed that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> every girl he had been with, but had not done so. Back at her apartment, she questions whether she can marry him. She is also upset at Penny, who originally set her up with Howard.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky and Portman first {{discussed}} a ballet film in 2000, {{after the release}} of Requiem for a Dream, though the script had not yet been written. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> a love scene between competing ballet dancers, and Portman recalled, [...] "I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself." [...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
50|$|Cristina {{is still}} deliberating {{reconciling}} {{her relationship with}} Owen, however has not completely forgiven him. Owen stops to tell her how well his therapy is going and how much progress is being made, but Cristina cuts him off by asking if <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> not visiting his mother even though she lives {{only a few miles}} away.|$|R

50|$|John {{wakes up}} in {{hospital}} surrounded by his friends and mother. His mother wishes <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Stan's abusive behaviour before, and says that she loves him. John finally feels that his mother really knows him, because she decides to leave Stan.|$|R
500|$|Tessa, and Kirsch's {{character}} Richie, {{were designed}} as MacLeod's mortal companions and contacts. Tessa and MacLeod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other. Adrian Paul commented that MacLeod spent twelve years with Tessa without wanting another relationship and that [...] "...she {{was a very}} important part of his life". Vandernoot thought that [...] "...the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> himself (...) because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. She trusted him entirely and he trusted her." [...] Tessa is thus MacLeod's only mortal lover who knows of his immortality.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{recommended}} {{his friend}} George Harrison {{to be the}} lead guitarist. Lennon thought that Harrison—then 14 years old—was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played Raunchy for Lennon and was asked to join. Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became [...] "The Beatles" [...] in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, Germany and were desperately {{in need of a}} drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them. Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the trip, pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead. After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug, as well as amphetamines, as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.|$|E
500|$|At {{the scene}} of the car accident, Oswald's boss suffers an oddly timed heart attack; Oswald then saves his boss by using his {{electrical}} powers as a makeshift defibrillator, much to the paramedics' surprise. The agents question Sharon at the hospital, who claims that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> his powers. The agents also go through Oswald's medical records, showing that he exhibited acute hypokalemia—electrolytic imbalance in his blood. Oswald is brought in for questioning by the agents, but he proclaims his innocence and is eventually released by the skeptical, unfriendly local sheriff, much to the agents' dismay. Later, at the arcade, Zero is closing down for the night, and turns off the power. However, the Virtua Fighter 2 machine does not turn off. When Zero goes to investigate, the machine shuts off, except for the jukebox next to him (playing [...] "Hey Man, Nice Shot", a song Oswald was listening to earlier). Knowing Oswald is now hunting him, Zero runs outside and claims he did not betray Oswald to the agents; he is then suddenly struck by lightning and dies. It is then revealed that Oswald is standing on the arcade rooftop.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{was there}} any {{consciousness}} in her talk as she related to me what <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> his mother and sisters, and his dreary sense of piteous loneliness, till we had adopted him as a brother-- in which capacity I trusted that she viewed him.|$|R

60|$|This {{was hardly}} the kind of {{response}} that the handsome and clever society girl before him {{had been in the}} habit of receiving, but it amused her. Her fellow-guest was decidedly original. But <b>he</b> hadn't <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Rushbrook, and it struck her that his opinion would be independent, at least. She reminded him of it.|$|R
500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine." [...] However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.|$|E

Nancy Buirski, picture editor on the foreign desk of The New York Times called Marinovich, how Marinovich wrote. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the picture by Carter with the words: [...] "an image of a vulture stalking a starving child who had collapsed in the sand." [...] He gave her Carter's phone number and the picture was published in March 26, 1993 in The New York Times. The caption to the picture read: [...] "A little girl, weakened from hunger, collapsed recently along the trail to a feeding center in Ayod. Nearby, a vulture waited. (Kevin Carter)".|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a healthy}} {{competition}} between Nilsson and tenor Franco Corelli {{as to who}} could hold the high C the longest in Act II of Turandot. In one tour performance, after she outlasted him on the high C, he stormed off to Rudolf Bing during the next intermission, {{saying that he was}} not going to continue the performance. Bing, who knew how to handle Corelli's tantrums, suggested that he retaliate by biting Nilsson on the neck when Calaf kisses Turandot in Act III. Corelli didn't bite her but he was so delighted with the idea that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Bing's suggestion. She then cabled Bing, informing him she had to cancel the next two performances because she had contracted rabies.|$|E

60|$|Of {{these the}} letter {{received}} from Jessie was to our hero the most important, {{and it must}} be confessed that he read it a number of times. The girl was greatly interested in all that <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> his work, and she said she hoped he would become a great civil engineer, and that she certainly trusted he would not have any trouble with the Mexicans.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{the truth}} <b>about</b> his boyhood, his {{ambition}} {{to be an}} artist, his renunciation to his father's hope, {{his career as a}} clergyman, his failure in religion, and the disgrace that had made him a wanderer.|$|R
2500|$|Once back home, Chandra {{forgot about}} {{his promise to}} Krishna. One day Krishna {{appeared}} in the garb of a boy before a woman at Kaina, {{and asked her to}} give Him food. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the commitment made to Him by King Chandra. The boy then disappeared. When this incident was conveyed to the King, he realized his lapse and immediately came to Kaina to find the jackfruit tree to make the images of Krishna. However, with the first strike of an axe the tree started bleeding, forcing him to stop cutting. He appeased the tree by offering worship, following which he uprooted the tree without trouble and had it carried away to make the images. In another version it is said that in 1778, after the tree was cut it was moved along the Iril River but after a short distance of travel the tree got bogged down in water; this place is known as [...] "Urup". Even with the help of elephants it could not be pulled out of water. Then the king himself started helping people in pulling it when it surfaced out of water. Then an aarti was performed in reverence of Govindajee; this place is known as [...] "Arapti".|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was sixteen}} years old, Ferré {{enrolled}} at the University of Puerto Rico's campus in Río Piedras. She subsequently moved to the Orden De Las Siervas Misioneras De La Santisima Trinidad (Congregation Of The Missionary Servants Of The Most Blessed Trinity, MSBT), where she resided while studying. While in the university, Ferré developed an interest in opera and literature. She continued practicing tennis, eventually practicing with Rebekah Colberg. Shortly after completing her first semester, Ferré returned to her home, where she was informed {{that her mother was}} in critical condition. Her mother died the next morning, moments after her son Luis arrived from the United States. Ferré resumed her studies with intensively and during this time she also worked and played tennis. Her health was affected because of her strenuous activities and after she went to her doctor and had a radiology done, she was told that she had damage in her lungs and was recommended that she take one year of rest. The condition worsened and she moved to Adjuntas briefly, until the symptoms completely disappeared one month later. Jose Ferré (her brother) became a member of Luis Muñoz Marín's government. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the details of Operation Bootstrap and Operation Serenity. Interested in this second project, she organized a group of delivery boys and shoe shiners and founded a candy distribution system. Ferré and some friends also preached to workers in sugar plantations, often visiting their houses in the evening. She left her family's house to join a convent shortly after her 21st birthday, after receiving permission from her father. Before entering the convent, she decided to swear a chastity vow. After arriving in Philadelphia, she spent her first year involved in a series of religious activities, including some [...] "spiritual exercises" [...] where she was only allowed to speak in the confessional. Her first mission took place {{in the small town of}} Norton, Virginia. There she met with the priest of a community of Polish miners and together they performed a series of domestic labors. She continued working on other missions, receiving occasional visits from her siblings. She eventually joined a Novitiate in New York City. In this convent, she was one of the few novices that knew how to drive an automobile and served as the convent's driver. While in New York, Ferré felt symptoms of appendicitis, and was rushed to a Philadelphia hospital.|$|E
