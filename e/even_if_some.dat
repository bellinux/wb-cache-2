5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>some</b> beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|Ochre is {{reported}} from some early MSA sites, for example at Kapthurin and Twin Rivers, and is common after c. 100 ka. Barham argues that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>some</b> of this ochre {{was used in}} a symbolic, color-related role then this abstraction could not have worked without language. Ochre, he suggests, could be one proxy for {{trying to find the}} emergence of language.|$|E

After the death of Constantine, the Wallachian plain and Moldavia fell under the domination of the Tervingi branch of the Gothic nation, as evidenced by the existence of a substantial Gothic kingdom in the mid fourth century. Transylvania appears to have been dominated in the fourth century by another, probably Germanic group, the Taifali. However, the Taifali appear also to have been under Gothic suzerainty.|$|E
25|$|The Windows Registry {{contains}} multiple sections where {{modification of}} key values allows software {{to be executed}} automatically when the operating system boots. Spyware can exploit this design to circumvent attempts at removal. The spyware typically will link itself from each location in the registry that allows execution. Once running, the spyware will periodically check {{if any of these}} links are removed. If so, they will be automatically restored. This ensures that the spyware will execute when the operating system is booted, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>some</b> (or most) of the registry links are removed.|$|E
25|$|The classicist John Burnet doubts this account, however, as both Diogenes LaÃ«rtius and Cicero wrote {{hundreds}} of years later and as no such persecution of Protagoras is mentioned by contemporaries who make extensive references to this philosopher. Burnet notes that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>some</b> copies of the Protagoras books were burned, enough of them survived to be known and discussed in the following century. A claim has been made that Protagoras is better classified as an atheist, since he held that if something {{is not able to}} be known it does not exist.|$|E

25|$|As president, McDonald {{emphasized}} enhancing fringe benefit. The {{election of}} Dwight D. Eisenhower {{as president and}} the advent of Republican majorities in the United States Congress (at least from 1952 to 1954) made expansion of social programs unlikely <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>some</b> later occurred. To compensate, McDonald focused negotiations on benefits such as unemployment compensation, health insurance, pensions, tuition reimbursement, and more. Throughout the 1950s, however, McDonald often felt an intense rivalry with the Auto Workers (UAW). The UAW often won better wage and benefit packages than the Steelworkers, and were able to obtain the closed shop. McDonald's negotiating stands often reflected the interunion jealousy.|$|E
25|$|At that time, however, Mende was not {{provided}} the civil and religious capital of GÃ©vaudan. In fact the power was always dependent of two entities: The county and Viscount of GrÃ¨zes. The Viscount, {{property of the}} King of Aragon, was recovered by the King of France in 1258. The bishop had great power as a vassal, but he didn't have the total legitimacy of some Royal officials. This situation ended from 1307 with the Act of parÃ©age between Bishop Guillaume VI Durand and King Philip IV. Indeed, it definitively fixed the possessions of the king {{and those of the}} bishop, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>some</b> disputes persisted.|$|E
