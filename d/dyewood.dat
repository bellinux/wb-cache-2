25|$|Brazil, {{which is}} named after reddish <b>dyewood</b> (pau brasil), has long been famous for the wealth of its {{tropical}} forests. These are not, however, as important to world markets as those of Asia and Africa, which started to reach depletion only in the 1980s. By 1996 more than 90% of the original Atlantic forest had been cleared, primarily for agriculture, with little use made of the wood, except for araucaria pine in Paraná.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, {{patterns}} shifted in Yucatán and Tabasco, as the English took territory the Spanish claimed {{but did not}} control, especially what became British Honduras (now Belize), where they cut <b>dyewood</b> and in Laguna de Términos (Isla del Carmen) where they cut logwood. In 1716–17 viceroy of New Spain organized a sufficient ships to expel the foreigners, where the crown subsequently built a fortress at Isla del Carmen. But the British held onto their territory in the eastern portion of the peninsula into the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, the enclave supplied guns to the rebellious Maya in the Caste War of Yucatan.|$|E
500|$|Producing fast {{black in}} the Middle Ages was a {{complicated}} process involving multiple dyeings with woad or indigo followed by mordanting, but {{at the dawn of}} Early Modern period, a new and superior method of dyeing black dye reached Europe via Spanish conquests in the New World. [...] The new method used logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum), a <b>dyewood</b> native to Mexico and Central America. Although logwood was poorly received at first, producing a blue inferior to that of woad and indigo, it was discovered to produce a fast black in combination with a ferrous sulfate (copperas) mordant. [...] Despite changing fashions in color, logwood was the most widely used dye by the 19th century, providing the sober blacks of formal and mourning clothes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dyewoods</b> {{refers to}} a number of {{varieties}} of wood which provided dyes for textiles and other purposes. Some of the more important include: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes we loaded <b>dyewoods</b> and rubber; {{sometimes}} we lent money to ambitious politicians {{in return for}} unlawful trading privileges, and now and then engaged in business that was something {{like that of the}} old adventurers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are romantic, father," [...] she said. [...] "I don't think Harry {{is taking}} his ancestors' path. They were hard and {{reckless}} men and traded in flesh and blood. You trade in rubber and <b>dyewoods,</b> don't you, Bob?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Barros's {{call was}} taken up by Pedro Magalhães Gandavo, who titled his 1576 history of [...] "Santa Cruz, vulgarly called Brazil". Gandavo opens with an {{explanation}} of the [...] "ill-conceived" [...] Brazil name, noting its origin in the <b>dyewood</b> [...] "which was called brazil, for being red, akin to embers", but insists on using the Santa Cruz name in the rest of his book, in order to [...] "torment the Devil, who has worked, and continues to work, so much to extinguish the memory of the Holy Cross from the hearts of men".|$|E
2500|$|From 1502 to 1512, the Portuguese {{claim on}} Brazil was leased by the crown to a Lisbon {{merchant}} consortium led by Fernão de Loronha for commercial exploitation. Loronha {{set up an}} extensive enterprise along the coast focusing on the harvesting of brazilwood. A <b>dyewood</b> that produces a deep red dye, reminiscent {{of the color of}} glowing embers, brazilwood was much in demand by the European cloth industry and previously had to be imported from India at great expense. Loronha is estimated to have harvested some 20,000 quintals of brazilwood on the Brazilian coast by 1506. [...] By the 1510s, French interlopers from the Atlantic clothmaking ports of Normandy and Brittany began to also routinely visit the Brazilian coast to do their own (illegal) brazilwood harvesting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of islands named [...] "Bracile", [...] "Hy-Brazil", or [...] "Ilha da Brasil" [...] on maps {{as early as}} the c. 1330 portolan chart of Angelino Dulcert sometimes leads etymologists to question the standard etymology. While most of these islands of Brazil are found off the coast of Ireland and may be taken to stem from a Celtic rendering of the legendary Isle of the Blessed, the 1351 Medici Atlas places one Brazil near Ireland and a second one off the Azores near Terceira Island. That use may derive from its four volcanoes or reference its dragon's blood, a red resin dye. Regardless, the initial names of present-day Brazil were Ilha de Vera Cruz ("Island of the True Cross") and thenafter it was discovered to be a new mainlandTerra de Santa Cruz ("Land of the Holy Cross"); this only changed after a Lisbon-based merchant consortium led by Fernão de Loronha leased the new colony for massive exploitation of the costly <b>dyewood</b> which had previously been available only from India.|$|E

25|$|From the {{tropical}} {{forests of the}} inland regions come <b>dyewoods,</b> hardwoods, and rubber. About 20% of the state’s territory is forested, with 220,000 of temperate forest and 1,200,000 hectares of tropical forests. Logging in the state produces 128,254 m3 of wood products per year. The most exploited species include pine, oyamel, cypress and oak. Some tropical hardwoods are harvested as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{asymmetrical}} {{skirt and}} handwoven top {{are part of}} a design series with the overarching purpose to explore natural dyes from trees as well as taking inspiration from their color and texture. The particular aims of this design were to investigate tree leaves bundled and steamed on fabric and to experiment with thickened <b>dyewoods</b> painted onto yarn to create gradients...|$|R

60|$|Two {{weeks later}} the Enchantress was {{steaming}} across a sea that was flecked with purple shadow and lighted by incandescent foam. Macallister lounged in the engine-room doorway, Grahame sat smoking on a coil of rope, and Walthew, {{wrapped in a}} dirty blanket, lay under the awning. His face was hollow, his hair damp and lank, and his hands, with which he was clumsily rolling a cigarette, were very thin. The deck was piled with a load of <b>dyewood,</b> which they had bought rather with the object of accounting for their cruise than for the profit that might be made on it.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the principal industry of the state was stock raising, which dates from the first settlement in 1674 by Domingos Afonso Mafrense, who established a number of cattle ranges. A secondary industry was the raising of goats, which were able to stand neglect and a scanty food supply. Agricultural products were cotton, sugar and tobacco. Forest products included rubber, carnauba wax and <b>dyewoods.</b> Exports included hides, skins, rubber, wax, tobacco and cotton.|$|R
5|$|In 1825, Talbot {{joined a}} weaving firm {{established}} by {{his older brother}} Charles in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as a carder and finisher, and quickly rose to become superintendent. His brother moved to Lowell in 1838, selling the Williamsburg mill, and began processing <b>dyewoods</b> in rented space at a local mill, while Thomas remained in western Massachusetts, working in area mills and continuing his education at an academy in Cummington. In 1840, the two brothers established C.P. Talbot & Co., a business partnership that lasted until Charles died in 1884. The business started out processing <b>dyewoods</b> {{for use in the}} textile industry, but expanded into other industrial chemical processing in 1849. The brothers acquired the Concord River water rights of the defunct Middlesex Canal Corporation in 1851, and in 1857 they established Talbot Mills in North Billerica, Massachusetts, in partnership with the Belvidere Mill Company. The business was successful, and the brothers acquired full control of that business in 1862. Thomas focused on the textile business while Charles continued to manage the dye and chemical interests, expanding the facilities in 1870 and again in 1880.|$|R
30|$|In summary, the PAS mordant {{influenced}} the color cast subtly {{of the selected}} <b>dyewoods</b> before and after exposure to light and laundering. For black walnut, the mordant had a warming effect that remained after exposure to light, but not after laundering. Osage orange was also warmer with the mordant, but the shift was not maintained after exposure to light and laundering. The mordant had a yellowing effect on eastern redcedar that became similar to nonmordanted with exposure to light but remained after laundering.|$|R
50|$|Eliezer {{was born}} in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, the son of Mesinor Pierre Cadet, a wealthy <b>dyewood</b> manufacturer. He {{attended}} the College of Saint-Louis de Gonzague and subsequently supported himself as a car mechanic in Paris. Here he met Nancy Cunard.|$|E
50|$|He {{became the}} founder and first {{president}} of Hord Color Products in Sandusky, Ohio in 1920. There he helped pioneer color processes and products. In 1928, Mr. Cole {{went to work for}} the American <b>Dyewood</b> Co. in Chester, Pa., where he developed recycling of the paper in telephone directories.|$|E
50|$|The armadas also loaded less glorious spices {{found in}} Indian markets, notably locally-grown ginger (the {{principal}} 'filler' cargo), cardamom and tamarind, balms and aromatics like Artemisia indica (wormwood), Socotra aloe, galbanum, camphor and myrrh. Also {{brought back from}} India were dyes like lac, indigo and <b>dyewood</b> and precious ornamental objects and materials like ivory, ebony and pearls.|$|E
30|$|Two of {{the three}} <b>dyewoods</b> used in this study, eastern redcedar and Osage orange, were {{selected}} due to their status as an invasive species. Eastern redcedar had an increase in stock volume of 23, 000  % on surveyed Kansas lands from 1965 to 2005, effectively decreasing the value of undermanaged pastureland (Moser et al. 2008). Once planted for its excellent properties as a living fence line, the Osage orange can be a nuisance to cattlemen as they tend to invade pastureland (Rutter 2013). Even though Osage orange and eastern redcedar are currently invasive, this status {{would need to be}} monitored to ensure environmentally balanced harvesting.|$|R
30|$|This {{study did}} not measure tannin {{concentration}} of the sawmill waste nor amount of PAS in the residual mordant solution. Measuring tannin amounts in future studies will provide difficult to find tannin information on regional <b>dyewoods</b> and assist in understanding the role of tannin in interpreting colorfastness data. Future analysis of the chemical composition of pre- and post-mordant solution will provide data on the actual amount of PAS remaining in the waste water and thus assist in understanding of {{the environmental impact of}} a manufactured metallic aluminum mordant. Finally, {{there is a need to}} better understand social impacts of natural dyes upon the dynamics, health, knowledge, and wealth creation for families, communities, and cultural traditions.|$|R
50|$|Colbert's {{market reforms}} {{included}} {{the foundation of}} the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs in 1665 to supplant the importation of Venetian glass (forbidden in 1672, as soon as the French glass manufacturing industry was on sound footing) and to encourage the technical expertise of Flemish cloth manufacturing in France. He also founded royal tapestry works at Gobelins and supported those at Beauvais. Colbert worked to develop the domestic economy by raising tariffs and by encouraging major public works projects, and to ensure that the French East India Company had access to foreign markets, so that they could always obtain coffee, cotton, <b>dyewoods,</b> fur, pepper and sugar. In addition, Colbert founded the French merchant marine.|$|R

5000|$|The early {{settlers}} {{continued to}} live much as they had in Bermuda, fishing, hunting turtles, whales, and seals, finding ambergris, making salt on the drier islands, cutting the abundant hardwoods of the islands for lumber, <b>dyewood</b> and medicinal bark; and wrecking, or salvaging wrecks. The Bahamas were close to the sailing routes between Europe and the Caribbean, so shipwrecks in the islands were common, and wrecking was the most lucrative occupation available to the Bahamians.Wrecking ...|$|E
50|$|Their main {{occupation}} was cutting logwood, a <b>dyewood</b> {{in high demand}} in Europe. The centre of their activity and the primary point of export was Belize. Under Article XVII of the Treaty of Paris (1763), British cutters were {{for the first time}} given the right to cut logwood in Yucatan unmolested, within agreed limits. Such was the enthusiasm of the cutters that within a few years the European market was glutted, and the price of logwood collapsed.|$|E
50|$|Unable {{to abolish}} the duties on the passage of goods from {{province}} to province, Colbert did what he could to induce the provinces to equalize them. His régime improved roads and canals. To encourage companies like the important French East India Company (founded in 1664), Colbert granted special privileges to trade with the Levant, Senegal, Guinea and other places, for the importing of coffee, cotton, <b>dyewoods,</b> fur, pepper, and sugar, {{but none of these}} ventures proved successful. Colbert achieved a lasting legacy in his establishment of the French royal navy; he reconstructed the works and arsenal of Toulon, founded the port and arsenal of Rochefort, and the naval schools of Rochefort, Dieppe and Saint-Malo. He fortified, with some assistance from Vauban, many ports including those of Calais, Dunkirk, Brest and Le Havre.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine color properties of three regional <b>dyewoods</b> in the form of sawmill waste with and without a mordant treatment of potassium aluminum sulfate on wool yarn. The dyes were derived from Kansas black walnut (Juglans Nigra), Osage orange (Maclura pomifera), and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) and sourced from a sawmill in central Kansas, USA. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of an aluminum mordant use on dye concentration, hue, and colorfastness to light and laundering. Findings from the study will contribute to the understanding of sawmill waste as a dyestuff and use of an aluminum mordant with select sawmill waste, which may influence decision making for future research and dye practice by dye and handcraft artisans. Sawmill and timber owners can benefit economically as sawmill waste becomes a value-added product. Furthermore, this research contributes to the dialogue of how plant dyes can impact aspects of the triple bottom line in niche markets.|$|R
60|$|The others, {{so far as}} Kit could see, were {{squares of}} mud, {{for the most part}} whitewashed, {{although}} some were colored pink and cream. The glare they reflected was dazzling, but a row of limp palmettos ran between them and the space in front of the presidio, and here and there Kit noted rounded masses of vivid green. Except for the splash of the fountain, all was very quiet, and although the shadows had lengthened it looked as if the half-breed citizens were still enjoying their afternoon sleep. Now and then a barefooted sentry noiselessly passed the arch. He wore a dirty white uniform and ragged palm-leaf hat, but carried a good modern rifle, and Kit knew where the latter had come from. The country was rich with coffee, rubber, sugar, and <b>dyewoods.</b> Its inhabitants, however, for the most part, preferred political intrigue to cultivation; its government was corrupt, and prosperity had vanished with the Spaniards' firm rule.|$|R
50|$|While Curaçao {{emerged as}} a center of the slave trade, Bonaire became a {{plantation}} of the Dutch West India Company. A small number of African slaves were put to work alongside Indians and convicts, cultivating <b>dyewood</b> and maize and harvesting solar salt around Blue Pan. Slave quarters, built entirely of stone and too short {{for a man to}} stand upright in, still stand in the area around Rincon and along the saltpans as a grim reminder of Bonaire's repressive past.|$|E
50|$|The {{kingdom of}} Orungu {{developed}} a broker culture {{thanks to their}} position on the coast. In the 17th century, the Dutch dominated the coastal trade and ivory was the major export. The Orungu were a metal-working and boatbuilding culture, which allowed them to dominate the riverine trade. Maritime commerce was divided among the non-royal clans and included trades in Ivory, beeswax, <b>dyewood,</b> copal and ebony. By {{the start of the}} 19th century, the tiny but wealthy kingdom was able to import slaves from the interior.|$|E
50|$|Early January 1501 - While in Cochin, Cabral {{receives}} missives {{from the}} rulers of Cannanore (Canonor, Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and Quilon (Coulão, Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and <b>dyewood).</b> They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of PAS on hue and colorfastness had mixed results. The PAS mordant had a warming effect {{on all of}} the <b>dyewoods</b> that was minimized for black walnut after laundering, while eastern redcedar’s cast was reduced after light exposure. Regardless of mordant type, Osage orange darkened from a golden yellow to a tan/brown following exposure to light. Colorfastness to light was enhanced with a PAS mordant for black walnut and eastern redcedar, while Osage orange had a significant difference from laundering but not for light. While any improvement to colorfastness is viewed as positive, the mixed results and subtle overall visual color difference from mordant use {{may not be enough to}} convince dyers to use a metallic mordant with tannin dyestuffs. The use of a mordant does mean another step in the dyeing process that uses water, energy, and may release unbound mordant chemicals into disposal systems, impacting both the environment and health of communities. Further, introduction of metallic mordant use may impact the cultural heritage of traditional dye practices. Conversely, understanding and utilizing a metallic mordant to shift color, improve lightfastness, and understand long term color results may create social value through new knowledge, as well as economic gain by addressing consumer concern over colorfastness of natural dyes.|$|R
50|$|In 1699, Henrietta Marie sailed from England on {{the first}} leg of the {{triangular}} trade route with a load of trade goods, including iron and copper bars, pewter utensils, glass beads, cloth and brandy. The ship sailed under license from the Royal African Company (which held a monopoly on English trade with Africa), in exchange for ten percent of the profits of the voyage. It is known to have traded for African captives at New Calabar on the Guinea Coast. The ship then sailed on the second leg of its voyage, from Africa to the West Indies, and in May 1700 landed 191 Africans for sale in Port Royal, Jamaica. Henrietta Marie then loaded a cargo of sugar, cotton, <b>dyewoods,</b> indigo, and ginger to take back to England on the third leg of the triangular route. After leaving Port Royal on 18 May 1700, the ship headed for the Yucatán Channel to pass around the western end of Cuba to avoid the pirates infesting the passage between Cuba and Hispaniola) and to catch the Gulf Stream, the preferred route for all ships leaving the Caribbean to return to Europe. A month later, Henrietta Marie wrecked on New Ground Reef near the Marquesas Keys, approximately 35 miles west of Key West. There were no survivors, and the fate of the ship remained unknown for almost three centuries.|$|R
30|$|The {{economic}} {{bottom line}} is the value of financial, physical, and human capital, as well as the economic benefit to the surrounding community and society (Elkington 1998). The growth and maintenance of black walnut trees are encouraged in Kansas as a cash crop, due to both a desirability as a hard wood and an edible fruit (Moser et al. 2008). Whether <b>dyewoods</b> are harvested due to the maintenance of pastureland or because of economic significance, sawmill waste from their timber could be a sustainable color source for textiles while adding value to a local byproduct. Using byproducts and waste from agriculture, forestry, and the food industry as natural dyes, may lower costs of natural dye production while consuming another industry’s waste (Shahid and Mohammad 2013). Dye waste pulp from the Indian Trapa fruit skin was effective in absorbing chromium contaminated groundwater (Vankar et al. 2008). Mill waste from manufacturing have traditional uses such as paper products, particle board, and mulch but have been further explored for less conventional projects such as bio-oil, making bricks, and as an absorbent for water pollutants (Falk 1997; Crini 2006; Turgut and Algin 2007; Rout et al. 2009). Despite these varied uses wood products are often sent to the landfill or combusted for energy and fail to contribute any added value to their life cycle (Puettmann and Wilson 2007). Other markets and applications for natural dyes include colorant for cosmetics, food, beverage, hair, leather, paint, lacquers, and ink (International Symposium and Exhibition of Natural Dyes 2011; Shahid and Mohammad 2013).|$|R
