25|$|One {{of those}} making anti-Semitism charges against Cockburn was <b>Harvard</b> <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> Alan Dershowitz. In November 2005, Dershowitz {{wrote to the}} National Catholic Reporter that Cockburn's CounterPunch web site was anti-Semitic. This was in {{response}} to a review of Norman Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah by CounterPunch contributor, Israeli academic Neve Gordon. Cockburn had previously accused Dershowitz, in 2003, of plagiarism, and, in October 2005, of supporting torture. Cockburn and Dershowitz each denied the other's charges. Dershowitz also claimed that Cockburn was one of three writers (along with Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky) engaged in an attempt to discredit him, which Cockburn also denied.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the entry on September 15 of <b>Harvard</b> <b>Law</b> <b>Professor</b> Elizabeth Warren into the Senate campaign, Khazei issued a direct challenge to the other Democratic candidates — and specifically to Warren — to forego campaign funds from corporate lobbyists and all Political Action Committees. He pledged to do so himself. The Boston Globe's Noah Bierman reported that Khazei was leading the field of Democratic candidates in campaign funds as of the previous reporting period (June 30, 2011) with a reported total of $920,000, but that Senator Brown had a dramatic lead over all of the Democrats, having amassed about $9.6 million in campaign funds as of June.|$|E
25|$|Celebrated writers, artists, and {{academics}} pleaded for their pardon {{or for a}} new trial. <b>Harvard</b> <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> and future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter argued for their innocence in a widely read Atlantic Monthly article that was later published in book form. Sacco and Vanzetti were scheduled to die in April 1927, accelerating the outcry. Responding to a massive influx of telegrams urging their pardon, Massachusetts governor Alvan T. Fuller appointed a three-man commission to investigate the case. After weeks of secret deliberation that included interviews with the judge, lawyers, and several witnesses, the commission upheld the verdict. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in the electric chair just after midnight on August 23, 1927. Subsequent riots destroyed property in Paris, London, and other cities.|$|E

25|$|Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, {{who also}} {{served in the}} U.S. Senate and was the First Lady of the United States, {{became the first woman}} to {{formally}} launch a major candidacy for the presidency. Clinton made the announcement on April 12, 2015, via a video message. While nationwide opinion polls in 2015 indicated that Clinton was the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, she faced extreme challenges from Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who became the second major candidate when he formally announced on April 30, 2015, that he was running for the Democratic nomination. September 2015 polling numbers indicated a narrowing gap between Clinton and Sanders. On May 30, 2015, former Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley was the third major candidate to enter the Democratic primary race, followed by former Independent Governor and Republican Senator of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee on June 3, 2015, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb on July 2, 2015, and former <b>Harvard</b> <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> Lawrence Lessig on September 6, 2015.|$|E
