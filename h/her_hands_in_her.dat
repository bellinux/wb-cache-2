500|$|In an {{interview}} for Billboard, Beyoncé stated that despite having another concept for the album, she was ultimately influenced by her fans to name the album 4. She described the number four as being [...] "special" [...] to her, as her and Jay-Z's birthday, several other family and friends' birthdays, and her wedding anniversary fall {{on the fourth day}} of the month. The cover of the standard edition was revealed on Beyoncé's website on May 18, 2011. Shot on the rooftop of the Hôtel Meurice in Paris, Beyoncé is looking into the distance with her arms raised over her head, wearing smokey eye makeup, thick gold cuffs and a fox-fur stole by cult French designer Alexandre Vauthier, embellished with Swarovski crystals by the Lesage embroidery house. The cover of the deluxe edition was shown on June 16, where Beyoncé is dressed in a tight-fitting blue-purple dress by French designer Maxime Simoens, holding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hair. For its artwork, she opted for clothing made by lesser-known designers. The promotional and interior-package images for 4 were shot at the same time.|$|E
60|$|The lady folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap, {{and looked}} at me steadily.|$|E
60|$|Jo {{immediately}} sat up, put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pockets, {{and began}} to whistle.|$|E
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, {{took out}} the key, and hesitated at the last moment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shall I mend your frock!' was Wilmet's first greeting, {{as she put}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, and {{produced}} a little housewife.|$|R
60|$|She was brought, {{and stood}} with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sister's. Louisa had {{observed}} {{her with her}} arm round Sissy's neck, and she felt the difference of this approach.|$|R
60|$|Rose sat rigidly {{still in}} her chair, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap, holding the letter.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} in a rocking chair, and {{clasping}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap, rocked slowly back and forth.|$|E
60|$|She got {{a little}} back of the others, and sat looking wistfully out over the bay, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Amy, [...] "I'll {{enable you}} to lose that £20 immediately;" [...] and so she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket and pulls out her purse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whom can he mean? The {{letter is}} to you, my dear. I protest {{he is making}} love to your mother before my face!" [...] cries papa to Hetty, who only gives a little sigh, puts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>hand,</b> and then withdraws it.|$|R
60|$|Alice had no {{idea what}} to do, and <b>in</b> despair she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} Squire attentively, while Ida folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap and sat still {{with her eyes}} fixed upon the fire.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{groaned and}} clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> greater anxiety now, all lesser fears were forgotten. She turned and threw herself before the Commander.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{like to tell}} you," [...] said Chrissie, folding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap. [...] "I know you’ll be cross. You’re so unreasonable." ...|$|E
50|$|However, {{things may}} be looking up. Koganemaru, {{the son of an}} intergalactic billionaire has been kidnapped. This may be the chance that Maris needed to become financially independent, as she figures that he'll be so indebted to her that he might ask for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> marriage.|$|R
60|$|That ring manifestly {{occupied}} {{her thoughts}} a great deal. She kept pausing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> work and regarding it, and when Capes came round to her, she first put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap and then rather awkwardly {{in front of}} him. But men are often blind to rings. He seemed to be.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Woodbourne {{instantly}} {{caught up}} {{the little girl}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms, {{and sat down on}} the sofa with her on her lap, while Winifred buried <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket-handkerchief, screaming and sobbing violently. Fido slunk away under the sofa; and Elizabeth hastily made her way through the circle of ladies who surrounded Mrs. Woodbourne.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lapham {{sat down}} with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap, {{and stared at the}} smile on her husband's face, where he sat facing her.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank back}} to her chair, folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap and fell into meditation. The faintest of flushes crept into her wax-like cheeks.|$|E
60|$|She began {{mechanically}} {{to rearrange}} her hat and veil; and after that, sitting upright, {{to watch the}} cross streets with feverish anticipation, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap.|$|E
6000|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, {{and there}} was Harry's pencil, which she had {{borrowed}} {{in the morning and}} forgot to return, and also the piece of paper on which she had made her calculation of the cost of Aunt Matilda's board. The back of this would do very well for a note. So she wrote on it: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't allow it; I won't have my {{premises}} spoiled. Go for the locksmith, there's {{one about}} a mile from here. But avast!" [...] putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> side pocket, [...] "here's a key that'll fit, I guess; let's see." [...] And with that, she turned it in the lock; but alas! Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Woodward again sat down, {{and taking}} <b>her</b> daughter's <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own, caressed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Five years," [...] {{said the}} old woman, shaking her head and folding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap. [...] "How long do you say you’ve been looking for Captain Jackson?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was Mr. May as a pug dog begging, too lifelike and too impossible. The {{audience}} shouted. Alvina {{sat with}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap. The Pug {{was a great}} success.|$|E
60|$|Before Elsie could stammer forth her gratified acceptance, a {{young woman}} with gold glasses on her bony nose and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> jacket pockets seized her arm and drew her aside.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> stopped <b>in</b> <b>her</b> work, and {{she looked}} at him with incredulous astonishment.|$|R
60|$|Breathlessly interested, Mrs. Milroy leaned forward, and twined <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> caressingly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> daughter's hair.|$|R
60|$|The glad light <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes seemed}} to promise a greater meed than all the gold in the Mono claim. He was aware of a {{movement}} of <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap next to his. Under the screen of the tablecloth he thrust his own hand across and met a firm grip of woman's fingers that sent another wave of warmth through him.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} her. She {{was dressed in}} a wool jacket and boots, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pockets. A cloud of steam came from her mouth and nostrils. Her breast was rising and falling.|$|E
60|$|She {{searched in}} the pocket of her gown, drew out a pair of black lace mittens, put them on with the stoniest and steadiest composure, and then quietly crossed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the many}} virtues of this admirable woman was invincible courage. She did not faint; {{she did not}} cry out; she sat quietly down again, folded <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap, and said calmly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|There was silence. The {{mother sat}} with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> folded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> apron, her face set, thinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me the jeweller's docket," [...] {{he said at}} last. Nina {{hesitated for}} a moment, and then he {{repeated}} his demand in a sterner voice. [...] "Nina, give me the jeweller's docket." [...] Then she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket and gave it him. She was very averse to doing so, but she was more averse to refusing him aught that he asked of her.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman stood}} with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bosom, {{and the same}} deadly smile on her thin lips.|$|R
