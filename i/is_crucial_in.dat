5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>in</b> the development of his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>in</b> two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{function}} delegated by a public authority <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>in</b> determining whether such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan (1975), it was accepted that the Board could establish a committee in order to investigate and conduct preliminary inquiries, {{and that it was}} not practical for the whole body to be engaged in such a task. On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E

25|$|The {{involvement}} of the endocannabinoid system {{in the development of}} metabolic syndrome is indisputable.

25|$|Stability <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>in</b> {{practical}} applications of Nash equilibria, since the mixed strategy of each player is not perfectly known, but {{has to be}} inferred from statistical distribution of their actions in the game.

25|$|What <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>in</b> {{setting the}} level of {{formality}} in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an email message to a friend and client, updating {{the status of a}} legal matter, is appropriately informal.|$|E
25|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{carried out}} in the Barnett Shale is done by pumping a mixture of water, sand, and various chemical additives (to affect viscosity, flow rates, etc.) into the well bore at a sufficient pressure to create and propagate a fracture in the surrounding rock formation down hole. This <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>in</b> low permeability rock as it exposes more of the formation to the well bore and greater volumes of gas can be produced by the increased surface area. Without hydraulic fracturing, the wells would not produce at an economically feasible rate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, an appeal is the act of a player on the fielding team asking an umpire for a {{decision}} regarding whether a batsman is out or not. According to Law 31 of the Laws of Cricket, an umpire may not rule a batsman out unless the fielding side appeals. On many occasions when a batsman has otherwise technically been out, the fielding team neglects to appeal so the umpire can not declare him out. An appeal may be made at any point before the bowler starts his run-up for the next ball. A bowler's appeal combined with the wicket keeper <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>in</b> umpire's decision.|$|E
