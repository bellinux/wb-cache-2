500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> wanted. I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
500|$|For their fifteenth studio release, Twentieth Century (1999), {{the band}} {{recorded}} {{a cover of}} [...] "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You" [...] by the boy band 'N Sync in 1999, {{in a move that}} was considered an attempt to [...] "stay relevant." [...] The single nonetheless hit number one in Canada, number three on the US country charts, and number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100. When It All Goes South (2001) followed in 2001. [...] "If I never did another CD, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> will always point to as the one that I was happy with the most," [...] said Owen {{at the time of its}} release. Despite this, the album's singles did not fare well in comparison to past successes, with only the title track becoming a top 15 hit, representing the band's last career peak.|$|E

500|$|In 1952, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} John Wayne {{again in}} Ford's romantic comedy-drama film, The Quiet Man. Shot {{on location in}} Cong, County Mayo, Ireland, O'Hara cited the film to be her [...] "personal favourite of all the pictures I have made. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> am most proud of, and I {{tend to be very}} protective of it. I loved Mary Kate Danaher. I loved the hell and fire in her." [...] Malone notes that she rarely appeared in an interview without mentioning this fact. O'Hara was disconcerted with Ford's harsh treatment of Wayne during the production and constant ribbing. Though Ford generally treated her very well, on one occasion when filming a cart scene in which the wind in her eyes made it difficult to see, Ford yelled [...] "Open your damn eyes" [...] and O'Hara flipped, responding with [...] "What would a bald-headed son of a bitch like you know about hair lashing across his eyeballs".|$|E

The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> had the most kick out of in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure."

The band were disappointed with the relative lack of success of the album and its singles—none of which managed to chart inside the Top Ten of the UK Singles Chart—and went on [...] "pop strike" [...] as a result. Because of this the group's next record was the all-Welsh language, lo-fi, Mwng, which the group recorded simply for the joy of making music.

And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending a lot of people inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> want."
