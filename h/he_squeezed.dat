5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of Corpus Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded Corpus Christi and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. <b>He</b> <b>squeezed</b> out of the cockpit, swam ten feet to the surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E
500|$|After a {{dramatic}} Atlantic Ocean recovery, Commander Shepard observed that he [...] "...didn't really feel {{the flight was}} a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop." [...] Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and [...] the capsule was lifted partly {{out of the water}} to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. <b>He</b> <b>squeezed</b> out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier [...] The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{commissioned}} an ensign. [...] He {{spent two years}} as a naval aviator in training, first at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida through September 1959, and then at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, during which time {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant, junior grade. He earned a reputation as a party man, as he drove a Corvette, dated an exotic dancer named [...] "Marie the Flame of Florida", spent all his free time on the beach or in a Bachelor Officer Quarters room turned bar and friendly gambling den, and, as he later said, [...] "generally misused my good health and youth". He began as a sub-par flier: he had limited patience for studying aviation manuals, and spent study time reading history books instead. [...] He was not assigned to the elite units flying fighter aircraft, and instead became a pilot of attack aircraft. [...] During a March 1960 practice run in Texas, he lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. [...] Although momentarily knocked unconscious by the impact, <b>he</b> <b>squeezed</b> out of the cockpit and swam ten feet to the surface, escaping without major injuries. [...] He graduated from flight school at Corpus Christi in May 1960. [...] He joined squadron VA-42 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia for five months of further training on the Skyraider.|$|E

He has subsequently denied on several occasions making the statement.

2500|$|On 15 April 1909, Whiting took Porpoise out {{for what}} his crew of six {{thought would be}} a routine run. After Porpoise leveled off in Manila Bay {{at a depth of}} 20 feet (6.1 meters), Whiting {{informed}} his crew that he was convinced that a man could escape from a submarine through a torpedo tube and that he intended to test the idea on himself. <b>He</b> <b>squeezed</b> into Porpoises 18-inch (460-mm) tube and clung to the crossbar which stiffened the outer torpedo tube door as the crew closed the inner door. When the crew opened the outer door and seawater rushed in, Whiting hung onto the crossbar, which drew his elbows out of the tubes mouth, and then muscled his way out using his hands and arms. After 77 seconds, he was free of the submarine and swam to the surface; Porpoise soon surfaced and recovered him. Reluctant to speak about the incident in public [...] in Porpoises log that day, Whiting simply commented, [...] "Whiting went through the torpedo tube, boat lying in water in normal condition, as an experiment..." [...] he nevertheless informed his flotilla commander, Lieutenant Guy W. S. Castle, who submitted a report on how the feat had been accomplished.|$|E
2500|$|Melkonian was an Armenian {{nationalist}} and {{a revolutionary}} socialist. Throughout {{his life he}} sympathized with Marxism–Leninism, which was also the ideology of ASALA. Vorbach wrote in 1994 that his writings [...] "expose him as an Armenian nationalist and a committed socialist of the Marxist-Leninist variety." [...] According to his brother he [...] "had not always been a communist, {{but he had never}} been an ex-communist." [...] Melkonian hoped that the Soviet Union would [...] "reform itself, democratize, and promote personal freedoms" [...] and did not abandon hope in Soviet Armenia {{until the end of the}} Soviet era appeared inevitable. Philip Marsden wrote that his career [...] "reveals the profound shift in radical ideology—from revolutionary Marxism to nationalism." [...] Marsden adds that in the 1980s his ideology came into conflict with a growing nationalism: [...] "With ever greater difficulty, <b>he</b> <b>squeezed</b> the Armenian question into the context of left-wing orthodoxy, believing for instance that Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union would be a terrible error." [...] In the 1980s he advocated for the Soviet takeover of Turkey's formerly Armenian populated areas and its unification with Soviet Armenia. In the 1980s, while in a French prison, he called for the creation of a guerilla force in eastern Turkey which would unite Kurdish rebels, left-wing Turks, and Armenian revolutionaries. Vorbach summarized his views on Turkey: ...|$|E
