500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore. Because I just, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I would never win after that." [...] He went on to call the game, [...] "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." [...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|E
500|$|With Indicud, {{on several}} tracks Cudi took a {{backseat}} in vocals to rather showcase his production skills. [...] "The {{focus was on}} producing the record for Kendrick, I wanted to shine as a producer first. I wanted to show that side off {{more than anything else}} and that's why I had my one verse then let Kendrick go ape-sh-- crazy all over the rest of it." [...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to hear him say something a little bit more thoughtful, and he did that — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's central story {{theme is}} the [...] "pursuit of the almighty dollar". Missions {{follow the lead}} characters' efforts to plan and execute {{complicated}} heists to accrue wealth for themselves. The team focused on money as the central theme {{in response to the}} 2007–08 financial crisis, as its effects turn the main characters back to a life of crime. [...] "We wanted this post-crash feeling, because it works thematically in this game about bank robbers", Houser explained. The positive reaction to Grand Theft Auto IVs [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] missionin which an elaborate heist is coordinated and executed by lead protagonist Niko Bellic and accomplicesencouraged the team to develop the story around the heists. Houser said that while [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] was well-received, the team had not captured the thrill of the robbery to their best abilities and wanted Grand Theft Auto V to achieve it. He explained, [...] "We wanted to have a couple of really strong bank robberies...It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> was a good device that we'd never used in the past. Repeating ourselves is a fear when we're doing games where part of the evolution is just technological".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero and filmed in Los Angeles, California. Spears first contacted Piliero {{and asked him to}} put together a concept for the video. The main idea for Marrs Piliero came from the lyric [...] "be a little inappropriate", which stood out for him, but {{he did not want to}} make a video about sexual inappropriateness. Piliero wrote the opening press conference scene as a tribute to the film Half Baked (1998), which he is a fan of. He explained, [...] "That scene resonates with everyone as the epitome of the greatest way to quit your job, and just blow people off. [...] I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> would just be such a perfect way for her to tell the reporters to eff off." [...] Marrs Piliero first asked actor Kellan Lutz to co-star the clip with Spears; however, Lutz turned down the role, saying that [...] "there were a couple of weird things about the part that didn't make sense", including the scene where he was going to pour milk on himself. Piliero then thought of asking one of the stars of Half Baked, Guillermo Díaz, to be part of the video, explaining that it [...] "would make it come full circle." [...] Piliero watched all of Spears' videos and wanted to pull what he loved from them, but also give it something fresh. Piliero felt that all of her references to the paparazzi in her previous videos had been more of a statement than an action, and for [...] "I Wanna Go", he wanted her to have the opportunity to fight back.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E
2500|$|Troubled by new acts he {{felt were}} imitating Radiohead, Yorke {{believed}} his music had {{become part of}} a constant background noise he described as [...] "fridge buzz", and became hostile to the music media. He told The Guardian: [...] "I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that." [...] He suffered from writer's block, and could not finish writing songs on guitar.|$|E

2500|$|After {{seeing them}} at SXSW, Robin Hilton of NPR's All Songs Considered {{described}} their sound as [...] "gloriously loud fuzzy rock." [...] All Songs Considered featured the band's song “Yeah, I’m Okay With My Shit Life.” Hilton went on saying that there's been lot of comparisons between Generation X and the Millennials over the years, they’re exactly the same, nothing’s changed. He expanded, [...] "The complaint about Gen Xer's were they’re lazy and don’t care. They’re the whatever generation. And I felt like when I {{was watching a}} lot of the younger bands at South by this year I really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> vibe is coming back. The whatever rock, and I loved it." [...] Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton coined the genre name of 'Whatever Rock'/Shrug Rock, naming Bethlehem Steel as their source.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{for many}} years Mona had made it a {{practice}} to enroll in occasional college-level courses, {{it was in the}} mid 1960s that she completed both a bachelor’s and a master's degree from Queens College. [...] She then taught remedial reading at two Queens elementary schools for eight years. [...] As she recalled, “Every time I would feel mentally stagnant, I would just go take a course at Hunter or [...] [...] [...] any school downtown. And I loved anthropology, I took a lot of courses in that; I loved psychology and I took a lot of courses in that; anything that I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to do. So it was not until later years that one of the teachers at Queens College talked me into matriculating. And I’m glad he did because when I did graduate, I graduated magna cum laude.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon {{as a way}} of subverting the cliché of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film". Whedon stated [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] was the first incarnation of Buffy in his head, [...] "the idea of a seemingly insignificant female who in fact turns out to be extraordinary." [...] When asked how he came up with the name of [...] "Buffy," [...] Whedon states [...] "It was the name that I could think of that I could take the least seriously. There is no way you could hear the name Buffy and think, [...] "This is an important person. To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> kind of thinga B movie. But a B movie that had something more going on. That was my dream." [...] Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting [...] "You don't understand. It has to be this. This is what it is." [...] Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the [...] "final girl" [...] character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton's words, [...] "she... gets to have sex with boys and still kill the monster".|$|E

2500|$|Wolverine makes a brief {{appearance}} in [...] as Weapon X. Having somehow been captured by Stryker at some point, {{he has been}} given an adamantium skeleton and subject to brutal mental conditioning, leaving him operating on a more feral state than a human level. When some of the adult X-Men are captured by Stryker's men, Jean, Scott and Kurt Wagner are able to infiltrate Stryker's base and find Logan's cage, with Jean sensing the human mind underneath the conditioning and releasing him {{so that he can}} help. After Weapon X tears his way through Stryker's forces, the three teens find him at a small side-exit to the base, Jean's telepathy to restore some of Logan's human memories before he runs off into the snow. Writer Simon Kinberg explained that the character was originally intended to have a larger role in the film, saying [...] "There was always a notion that we wanted Wolverine to be in the movie. We wanted {{to find a way to}} feature him in the film, partly because Bryan [...] and I love Hugh [...] so much. We love the character, obviously, and he’s such a huge part of the franchise. There were a lot of iterations of how Wolverine would enter and exit the movie. There was a version when he was going to come in at the midpoint of the film and be like the drill sergeant for the kids and take over as their leader. And we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> stepped on Jennifer Lawrence's role in the movie and becoming their leader".|$|E
