Especially for hyperelliptic curves, this often enables the computation of ranks of <b>Jacobians,</b> even when the 2 -Selmer bound does not bound the rank sharply.

For curves of genus 2, we also demonstrate a connection with degree 4 del Pezzo surfaces, and show how the Brauer-Manin obstruction on these surfaces can be used to compute members of the Shafarevich-Tate group of <b>Jacobians.</b> We derive an explicit parametrised infinite family of genus 2 curves whose <b>Jacobians</b> have nontrivial members of the Shafarevich-Tate group.

40|$|Abstract. We study abelian {{varieties}} defined over function {{fields of}} curves in positive characteristic p, focusing on their arithmetic {{within the system}} of Artin-Schreier extensions. First, we prove that the L-function of such an abelian variety vanishes to high order at the center point of its functional equation under a parity condition on the conductor. Second, we develop an Artin-Schreier variant of a construction of Berger. This yields {{a new class of}} <b>Jacobians</b> over function fields for which the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture holds. Third, we give a formula for the rank of the Mordell-Weil groups of these <b>Jacobians</b> in terms of the geometry of their fibers of bad reduction and homomorphisms between <b>Jacobians</b> of auxiliary Artin-Schreier curves. We illustrate these theorems by computing the rank for explicit examples of <b>Jacobians</b> of arbitrary dimension g, exhibiting <b>Jacobians</b> with bounded rank and others with unbounded rank in the tower of Artin-Schreier extensions. Finally, we compute the Mordell-Weil lattices of an isotrivial elliptic curve and a family of non-isotrivial elliptic curves. The latter exhibits an exotic phenomenon whereby the angles between lattice vectors are related to point counts on elliptic curves over finite fields.
