50|$|During 1971 {{the spring}} rates and damper {{settings}} were altered {{along with the}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>bushes</b> which reduced the bounciness of the ride and low speed ride harshness which had generated press criticism {{at the time of}} the Cortina Mark III's launch.|$|R
5000|$|The HT Monaro can be {{distinguished}} from the HK by the adoption of plastic grilles (previously metal), a round speedometer instead of [...] "strip" [...] style allowing for bringing the tachometer into the main instrument cluster {{instead of on the}} floor console, rubber <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>bushes</b> instead of the HK's sintered bronze, and larger taillights where the turn indicators also wrapped around the now slightly undercut edges. Bodywork 'go-faster' stripe designs (delete options) varied for each series; HK stripes were offset to the driver's side of the bonnet (hood) and bootlid (trunk), the HT had two broad stripes down the centre of the car. HT also had twin air scoops / vents incorporated into their bonnet, which served no real purpose in delivering air into the engine bay.|$|R
50|$|A <b>front</b> <b>{{suspension}}</b> fork {{is common}} on high-end, contemporary-styled European city bikes. This {{is often a}} coil/oil or air/oil suspension fork with adjustable compression and rebound. A traditional roadster has no <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> or a spring-based <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> that has more limited travel and adjustability.|$|R

50|$|Gaiters are pleated rubber tubes {{enclosing}} the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> {{tubes of}} some motorcycles and mountain bikes with telescopic front forks. Gaiters protect the sliding {{parts of the}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> from dirt and water.|$|R
50|$|The GMT400 series {{introduced}} independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> The 2WD models used {{coil springs}} and 4WD models used torsion bars in the <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> All models used a live axle and leaf springs in the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The IFS 100-series {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> failures in operating conditions where the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> was prone to hitting the bump stops. Several companies produce strengthened lower wishbones to prevent cracks from developing.|$|R

50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>suspension</b> {{consists}} of MacPherson struts and the rear suspension is independent semi-trailing arms. In 1982, the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> was upgraded to include twin-pivot lower control {{arms and the}} geometry of the rear suspension was revised.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} central seating position, the Dynamic was also {{ahead of its time}} in having {{independent}} wishbone <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> As with current supercars, the upper elements of the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> were mounted directly onto the engine.|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, {{it is first necessary}} to {{determine the}} tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> linkage and half is being transmitted through the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> springs.|$|R
25|$|Both {{rear and}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> were {{completely}} redesigned for the CSR. The <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> has double wishbone, fully adjustable, inboard springs and dampers, improving aerodynamics. The rear suspension is also upgraded to a double wishbone, fully independent system, replacing the De Dion tube design.|$|R
5000|$|Transverse {{leaf spring}} and solid axle <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> of early Ford cars {{is a type}} of {{automotive}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> that has been most common in early Ford Motor Company products. [...] "Suicide front axle" [...] is a term that has been used for it.|$|R
50|$|BMW {{has been}} an {{innovator}} in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm).Some BMWs started using yet another trademark <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.|$|R
50|$|The 321 was {{introduced}} {{at the start}} of 1939 as a successor to the BMW 320. It sat on a shortened version of the BMW 326 chassis. The 321 differed from the 320 in its <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> its larger tyres, and its styling. While the 320 used <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> derived from the BMW 303, with a high mounted transverse leaf spring and lower control arms, the 321 used the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> from the 326, with upper control arms and a low mounted transverse leaf spring.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> became adjustable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>suspension</b> was MacPherson-like with torsion bars {{instead of}} springs, to allow {{room for the}} wide V6 and the {{optional}} air conditioning. The height of the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> is adjustable, using eccentric cams in {{the ends of the}} torsion bars, where they are attached to the body.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, BMW {{announced}} the K1200S, incorporating a new <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> {{based upon a}} design by Norman Hossack. BMW recognised this fact but paid Hossack no royalties. BMW named its new <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> the Duolever. As of 2009, the Duolever is on the K1300S, K1300R and K1300GT.|$|R

5000|$|A {{beam axle}} {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used type of <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> due to its appearance when exposed without fenders on a vehicle with open <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> Independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> is rarely used and most rat rods use a 1928-1948 Ford I-beam axle, with a transverse leaf spring. Although any rear axle {{can be used in a}} rat rod, the Ford rear end has been preferred for years due to the availability of spare parts.
