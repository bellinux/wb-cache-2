2500|$|Single {{cross-sectional}} {{studies on}} consumers {{have been published}} noting multiple associations. Blood serum levels of PFOA were {{associated with an increased}} time to pregnancy—or [...] "infertility"—in a 2009 study. PFOA exposure was associated with decreased semen quality, increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels, and increased occurrence of thyroid disease. In a study of 2003–2004 US samples, a higher (9.8 milligram per deciliter) total cholesterol level was observed when the highest quartile was compared to the lowest. Along with other related compounds, PFOA exposure was associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a study of US children aged 12–15. In a paper presented at the 2009 annual meeting of the International Society of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Epidemiology,</b> PFOA appeared to act as an endocrine disruptor by a potential mechanism on breast maturation in young girls. A C8 Science Panel status report noted an association between exposure in girls and a later onset of puberty.|$|E
2500|$|The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a {{factsheet}} that outlines 6 different studies. [...] In 1990 the United States Congress {{requested the}} National Cancer Institute {{to conduct a}} study of cancer mortality rates around nuclear plants and other facilities covering 1950 to 1984 focusing on the change after operation started of the respective facilities. [...] They concluded in no link. [...] In 2000 the University of Pittsburgh found no link to heightened cancer deaths in people living within 5 miles of plant {{at the time of}} the Three Mile Island accident. [...] The same year, the Illinois Public Health Department found no statistical abnormality of childhood cancers in counties with nuclear plants. [...] In 2001 the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering confirmed that radiation emissions were negligibly low at the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. [...] Also that year, the American Cancer Society investigated cancer clusters around nuclear plants and concluded no link to radiation noting that cancer clusters occur regularly due to unrelated reasons. [...] Again in 2001, the Florida Bureau of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Epidemiology</b> reviewed claims of increased cancer rates in counties with nuclear plants, however, using the same data as the claimants, they observed no abnormalities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>{{epidemiology}}</b> is {{a branch}} of epidemiology concerned {{with the discovery of}} the environmental exposures that contribute to or protect against injuries, illnesses, developmental conditions, disabilities, and deaths; and identification of public health and health care actions to manage the risks associated with harmful exposures. <b>Environmental</b> <b>epidemiology</b> studies external factors that affect the incidence, prevalence, and geographic range of health conditions. These factors may be naturally occurring or may be introduced into environments where people live, work, and play. Environmental exposures are involuntary and thus generally exclude occupational exposures (covered by occupational epidemiology) and voluntary exposures such as active smoking, medications, and diet.|$|E
