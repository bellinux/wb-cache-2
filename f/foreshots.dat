50|$|Benrinnes {{employed}} {{some unusual}} production techniques. Between 1974 and 2007 the distillery used a unique partial triple distillation process. In this process the feints from the wash still, the weaker parts of feints {{of the spirit}} still, and the feints from the low wine still itself are distilled in a low wines still, while the spirit still is fed by the <b>foreshots</b> and {{the heart of the}} wash and low wine still, and its own <b>foreshots</b> and strong feints. The necks of the stills are cooled by worm tubs, a technique that is no longer very common.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{liquid to}} emerge from the spirit {{condenser}} as the spirit still is heated is the undesirable <b>foreshots,</b> and these are directed from the spirit safe to the low wines and feints receiver for re-distillation. [...] But gradually the undesirable methyl alcohol content reduces and what emerges is the spirit that will end up as whisky. The distiller has to judge the right moment to redirect the flow of product to the spirit receiver instead of the low wines receiver. This is when the alcohol content, measured by a hydrometer in the spirit safe, falls to 75%, or when the emerging spirit no longer turns water cloudy, another test conducted remotely inside the spirit safe.|$|E
50|$|The third {{step in the}} {{production}} process is the distillation. There {{are two types of}} distillation processes used: in a pot still or in a column still. Distillation in a pot still is considered to be the traditional way of distillation (kisüsti pálinka refers to a pálinka distilled in a pot still no bigger than 1000 litres). Pálinka distilled in a pot still is always double distilled. In the first step, the alcohol is extracted from the fermented mash; the result is called alszesz (low alcohol). In the second step, the taste of the fruit is extracted from the fermented mash. The second distillation has the biggest influence {{on the quality of the}} pálinka and thus requires special skills. During the second distillation one distinguishes between előpárlat (<b>foreshots),</b> középpárlat (middle cut) and utópárlat (feints). The előpárlat is not used, even though much of the taste is contained in this cut. The középpárlat is the one that gives the body of the distillate.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{methanol}} is {{not produced}} in toxic amounts by fermentation of sugars from grain starches, contamination {{is still possible}} by unscrupulous distillers using cheap methanol to increase the apparent strength of the product. Moonshine can be made both more palatable and less damaging by discarding the [...] "foreshot"—the first few ounces of alcohol that drip from the condenser. Because methanol vaporizes at a lower temperature than ethanol it is commonly believed that the <b>foreshot</b> contains most of the methanol, if any, from the mash. Research shows {{that this is not}} the case and that methanol will be present until the very end of the distillation run. But the <b>foreshot</b> does typically contain small amounts of other undesirable compounds such as acetone and various aldehydes.|$|R
50|$|Sipsmith's {{first two}} spirits are a Barley Vodka and a London Dry Gin. These are {{produced}} in small batches {{of fewer than}} 300 bottles, from an English Barley mash that is created off-site. Each batch is made in a traditional manner with three cuts: the Head or <b>foreshot</b> is discarded; the Heart or core of the distillation run is retained; and the Tail or feints is discarded. The Heart of the distillation is diluted to its final bottling strength with Lydwell Spring water, one {{of the sources of}} the River Thames in the Cotswolds.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{recycling}} of <b>foreshots</b> and feints during batch distillation of marc has been evaluated. The distillation behaviour of ethanol and congeners {{was found to be}} unchanged by the recycle. Instead, the chemical composition of the middle-cut fraction obtained with recycle of <b>foreshots</b> and feints proved to be richer in ethanol (+ 4 %), higher alcohols (+ 7 %), esters (+ 13 %) and aldehydes (+ 10 %) ...|$|E
40|$|During two {{successive}} summer hands-on whisky making {{classes at}} the Bruichladdich Distillery on Islay in Scotland, two types of samples were taken and analyzed using GC/MS. Samples were taken periodically during the two stages of distillation, and of whisky that had matured for different periods of time in different character casks. HYSYS ® engineering software was adapted to the batch distillation processes using the samples for parameterization and validation. The pot stills were modeled as having equivalent trays and internal reflux from condensation of the less volatile components on the copper walls of the stills. The maturation samples {{are being used to}} elucidate the physical and chemical interaction between the toasted, charred, and previous used barrels and the maturing whisky. The effect of transforming the boiling phenomena in the wash still (1 st stage) from nucleate to film boiling to break the head was utilized. Phase separation was observed upon distillate condensation resulting in the transformation of the distillate in the spirits still (2 nd stage) from the first cut (<b>foreshots)</b> to the second cut (spirits cut i. e. product...|$|E
