5|$|On 1 December three {{prisoners in}} Armagh Women's Prison joined the strike, {{including}} Mairéad Farrell, {{followed by a}} short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In a war of nerves between the IRA leadership and the British government, with McKenna lapsing <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coma and {{on the brink of}} death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required.

25|$|Common sails {{consist of}} a lattice {{framework}} on which a sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according {{to the amount of}} wind available and power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ladder type arrangement of sails. Postmedieval mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions. The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.|$|E
25|$|When the Abarcas left Iguala {{after the}} mass {{kidnapping}} in September 2014, law enforcement began an investigation to locate all the properties {{owned by the}} couple and their families. Abarca had several properties in Guerrero and in other states, but authorities believed that he was hiding in Mexico City or Monterrey, Nuevo León. After ruling out Monterrey as a possible hideout, authorities concentrated on three properties in Iztapalapa where they believed the couple was hiding. Through the couple's real estate businesses, authorities were also able to link Berumen to the family once more and locate her properties in Iztapalapa. In one of the properties, investigators noticed something unusual: they regularly saw a woman (now known to be Berumen) going <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> property that {{was thought to be}} abandoned. Authorities then mounted an investigation and surveillance operation on Berumen before finally entering the property and arresting Abarca and Pineda.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Schuckardt {{joined the}} Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima, a group devoted to {{spreading}} {{the message of}} Our Lady of Fátima. In 1961, Schuckardt was stricken with typhoid; this {{was the beginning of}} a long succession of illnesses. He was <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coma for eight days. He experienced a remarkable recovery which he attributed to the intercession of the Virgin Mary. In January 1963, he was hospitalized with thrombophlebitis of the legs. The illness reversed itself to which Schuckardt again attributed to a miracle resulting from a promise he made to Our Lady of Fatima, promising her that he would use his legs to travel and spread her message. He gained considerable fame as a charismatic speaker for the Blue Army and was elected to its International Council in 1963 at the age of 26. Schuckardt was the only member of the Council who was not a national chairman. He was subsequently appointed to the position of International Secretary.|$|E

500|$|It is now {{generally}} {{thought that}} the Calcarea (sponges with calcium carbonate spicules) are {{more closely related to}} Cnidaria, Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Bilateria (all the more complex animals) than they are to the other groups of sponges. In 1866 it was proposed that Cnidaria and Ctenophora were more closely related to each other than to Bilateria and formed a group called Coelenterata ("hollow guts"), because Cnidaria and Ctenophora both rely on the flow of water <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single cavity for feeding, excretion and respiration. In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer (mesoglea in Ctenophora, mesoderm in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled [...] "Planulozoa" [...] because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the planula larvae of Cnidaria.|$|E
500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola {{said she wanted to}} hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath".|$|E

500|$|For the season-three premiere, the Smallville {{producers}} {{teamed up}} with Verizon to enable its registered users to view plot updates (as Daily Planet press releases), quizzes and games related to the show with Verizon product placement. Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles, a six-episode CGI series chronicling the early life of Oliver Queen, was released in a promotional tie-in with Sprint. According to Warner Bros. Television Group executive vice-president of worldwide marketing Lisa Gregorian, the promotional tie-ins got fans more connected to the show. On April 19, 2007 a tie-in with Toyota promoting the Yaris featured an online comic strip, Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom, as an interstitial program during new Smallville episodes. The interactive comic {{was based on the}} [...] "Justice" [...] episode, which follows Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone and Arthur Curry (the initial members of the [...] "Justice League" [...] in Smallville) as they seek to destroy LuthorCorp's secret experimental labs. The online series allowed viewers to investigate with the fictional team to win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five episodes, working with a team of artists on the illustrations. Nilson received the plot for each comic episode as Smallvilles production crew was filming its current television episode. Artist Steve Scott drew comic-book panels which were sent to Motherland, a consulting group. Motherland reviewed the drawings, telling Scott which images to draw on a separate overlay; this allowed objects to be moved <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> frame.|$|E
