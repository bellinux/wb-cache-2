5|$|Later {{studies of}} the {{events leading up to}} the tragedy <b>found</b> <b>several</b> factors {{contributing}} to the extent of the damage. A. Malheiro (2006) linked five major causes to damage from these earthquakes. The buildings most damaged by the earthquake were near fault lines on top of loosely packed soil. They tended to be of poor construction and did not conform to proper building code, nor had they been adequately examined.|$|E
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, {{located in}} The Hague, has <b>found</b> <b>several</b> {{individuals}} guilty {{of crimes against}} humanity perpetrated at Omarska. Murder, torture, rape, and abuse of prisoners was common. Around 6,000 Bosniaks and Croats were held in appalling conditions at the camp for about five months {{in the spring and}} summer of 1992, including 37 women. Hundreds died of starvation, punishment beatings and ill-treatment.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} <b>found</b> <b>several</b> {{shortcomings in}} the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E

5|$|Authorities {{were amazed}} by the {{similarities}} between Cox's actual crimes and his unpublished manuscript, The Associates, which they <b>found</b> <b>several</b> years before Cox was arrested. The novel's protagonist is 5ft 7in (170cm), has brown hair and blue eyes. Cox is 5ft 6in (168cm), has brown hair and green eyes. Both the protagonist and Cox drove a silver Audi TT, illegally acquired Tampa real estate worth $2.7 million, were alumni of the University of South Florida, had an intense fear of Interpol, and formerly worked as insurance seller.|$|E
5|$|Burns and Rigby <b>found</b> <b>several</b> prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals from the cave of Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. The bats in the sample were described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She <b>found</b> <b>several</b> living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact applicable to the Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Folding@home <b>found</b> <b>several</b> small drug {{candidates}} {{which appear}} to inhibit the toxicity of Aβ aggregates. In 2010, in close {{cooperation with the}} Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on biological tissue. In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several mutations of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid {{in the development of}} therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of Aβ oligomers. Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to research into synthetic explosives like RDX and HMX, the ERL investigated {{the properties of}} detonations and shock waves. This was initiated as a pure research project, without obvious or immediate applications. Kistiakowsky visited England in 1941 and again in 1942, where he met with British experts, including William Penney and Geoffrey Taylor. When Kistiakowsky and Edgar Bright Wilson, Jr., surveyed the existing state of knowledge, they <b>found</b> <b>several</b> areas that warranted further investigation. Kistiakowsky began {{to look into the}} Chapman–Jouguet model, which describes the way the shock wave created by a detonation propagates.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, Westland's {{experience}} with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor. Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings <b>found</b> <b>several</b> advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{took the}} gold to {{authorities}} who confirmed its worth. Lopez and others began {{to search for}} other steambeds with gold deposits in the area. They <b>found</b> <b>several</b> in the northeastern section of the forest, within present-day Ventura County. In 1843 he found gold in San Feliciano Canyon near his first discovery. Mexican miners from Sonora worked the placer deposits until 1846, when the Californios began to agitate for independence from Mexico, and the Bear Flag Revolt caused many Mexicans to leave California.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out by Namdal Police District and the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation (HSL). A conflict arose between the two as the latter {{in cooperation with the}} Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want a police investigation until after their report was finished. This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. The report found no technical problems with the aircraft. However, it <b>found</b> <b>several</b> pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines. No-one was charged after the accident, but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Widerøe.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 2 <b>found</b> <b>several</b> {{types of}} tectonic {{features}} on Enceladus, including troughs, scarps, and belts of grooves and ridges. Results from Cassini suggest that tectonics {{is the dominant}} mode of deformation on Enceladus, including rifts, {{one of the more}} dramatic types of tectonic features that were noted. These canyons can be up to 200km long, 5–10km wide, and 1km deep. Such features are geologically young, because they cut across other tectonic features and have sharp topographic relief with prominent outcrops along the cliff faces.|$|E
5|$|In {{this battle}} {{both sides of}} the {{conflict}} had paid a heavy price to achieve their objectives. After the battle, search parties <b>found</b> <b>several</b> hundred VC bodies within small arms range of the Special Forces compound and district headquarters, and another 126 VC bodies inside these compounds. Numerous other Viet Cong casualties had been evacuated or incurred in the fighting beyond the towns borders. In their efforts to recapture the district town of Đồng Xoài, the South Vietnamese military lost 416 soldiers killed in action, 174 wounded and 233 missing. In addition, over one hundred South Vietnamese civilians were believed to have been massacred by the Viet Cong during their brief occupation of the area. Total casualties sustained by U.S. military personnel included 20 soldiers killed or wounded, and 13 missing. According to Vietnam's official account of the Đồng Xoài campaign, the Communists claimed to have put 4,459 enemy soldiers (including 73 Americans) out of action. Furthermore, 1,652 weapons of various kinds were captured, 390 weapons and 60 vehicles were destroyed, 34 aircraft and 3 helicopters were shot down.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{government}} announcement appeared on television, Kujau took {{his wife and}} mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and hearing that Stern had paid ninemillion DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the forger agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they <b>found</b> <b>several</b> notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use {{a variation of the}} story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew all along that the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.|$|E

5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that <b>found</b> <b>several</b> bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nineteenth- and to {{a lesser}} extent twentieth-century attitudes often {{suggested}} that any well-constructed pre-modern road surface must be Roman, late twentieth-century archaeologists were more open to evaluating the structure within the context of a wider span of historical periods. After an early allowance by Phillips in 1853 that the causeway could be British rather than Roman there was little further investigation of such a possibility. In 1994, the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England began a review of the date or origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Detailed air photography of the Cawthorn camps in 1999 site failed to find evidence of a road leading towards Wheeldale Moor from the camps to which it is historically related, and the causeway does not obviously connect to the main Roman road network. Several writers around the turn of the millennium began to express doubt about the established narrative for the structure as a Roman road. Twenty-first century archaeologists then <b>found</b> <b>several</b> exemplars of other cambered, metalled roads that pre-date the Roman presence in Britain, and hence set precedence for the possibility of a pre-Roman origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Several sources from the mid-1990s onwards have suggested that the structure may be a pre-Roman (Iron Age) road of uncertain route or purpose.|$|E
