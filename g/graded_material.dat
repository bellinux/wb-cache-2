40|$|Abstract. There {{are much}} complex {{internal}} microstructures of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials,</b> and the mechanical parameters of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> structures varied {{with the space}} coordinates. Therefore, it is generally difficult to measure point by point macro distributions curves of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> properties based on available experimental conditions. The prerequisite for various analyses of the functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> structures is the determination of macro distributions curves of materials properties parameters. In practice, only the spatial distributions of different ma-terial components can be controlled {{in the course of}} materials production. Therefore, the functionally graded distributions curves need inversing and identifying by the materials components. In the pre-sent paper, the inversion and identification technique was put forward based on the positive static and dynamic analyses by the microelement method, which was applied to do the scale-span analyses for macro responses of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> structures based on the given materials components distributions in production...|$|R

5000|$|New {{materials}} {{can be defined}} as compositions of other materials. The element [...] is used to specify the proportions of the composition, as a constant or as a formula dependent of the x, y, and z coordinates. A constant mixing proportion will lead to a homogenous material. A coordinate-dependent composition can lead to a <b>graded</b> <b>material.</b> More complex coordinate-dependent proportions can lead to nonlinear material gradients as well as periodic and non-periodic substructure. The proportion formula can also refer to a texture map using the tex(textureid,x,y,z) function. Reference to material-id [...] "0" [...] (void) is reserved and may be used to specify porous structures. Reference to the rand(x,y,z) function can be used to specify pseudo-random materials. The rand(x,y,z) function returns a random number between 0 and 1 that is persistent for that coordinate.|$|E

50|$|In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a {{high-power}} laser {{is used to}} melt {{metal powder}} supplied to {{the focus of the}} laser beam. The laser beam typically travels {{through the center of the}} deposition head and is focused to a small spot by one or more lenses. The build occurs on a X-Y table which is driven by a tool path created from a digital model to fabricate an object layer by layer. The deposition head is moved up vertically as each layer is completed. Metal powder is delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head or can be split by an internal manifold and delivered through nozzles arranged in various configurations around the deposition head. A hermetically sealed chamber filled with inert gas or a local inert shroud gas is often used to shield the melt pool from atmospheric oxygen for better control of material properties. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment. The process supports a wide range of materials including titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and other specialty materials as well as composites and functionally <b>graded</b> <b>material.</b> The process can not only fully build new metal parts but can also add material to existing parts for example for coatings, repair, and hybrid manufacturing applications. LENS (Laser Engineered Net Shaping), which was developed by Sandia National Labs, is one example of the Powder Fed - Directed Energy Deposition process for 3D printing or restoring metal parts.|$|E

The generalized coupled thermoelasticity {{based on the}} Green-Lindsay model is used. The thermal and mechanical properties of the functionally <b>graded</b> <b>material</b> {{are assumed to be}} varied in the radial direction according to a power law variation {{as a function of the}} volume fractions of the constituents. The thermal and elastic governing equations are solved by using Galerkin finite element method. All the finite element calculations were done by using commercial finite element program FlexPDE.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} a polar {{orthotropic}} rotating solid disk with variable thickness made of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>material</b> is considered. A special stress distribution with the constant radial stress condition is proposed. Functionally <b>graded</b> <b>material</b> behavior {{is achieved by}} radially varying the degree of orthotropy (Jain, Ramachandra and Simha (1999). Rotating Anisotropic Disk of Uniform Strength, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 41 : 639 – 648). The thickness of the solid disk is also assumed to vary exponentially with any power of the radius. The natural frequencies of rotating disk are calculated by Rayleigh–Ritz method. The effect of this special stress distribution on increasing the natural frequency of transverse vibrations is demonstrated.

A compositional gradient, from 100 pct Ti 6 Al 4 V to Ti 6 Al 4 V- 38 pct Rene 88 DT, was achieved within a thickness of laser deposit of 54 mm. The solidification behavior and the phase evolution of the compositionally <b>graded</b> <b>material</b> were studied.

40|$|AbstractWith {{the focus}} on {{innovative}} manufacturing and application-oriented products considering lightweight construction functional <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> {{become more and more}} interesting. Due to the application matched functional gradation different local demands such as absorbability, abrasion and fatigue of structures are met. However the gradation has a remarkable influence on the crack propagation behaviour. According to the different fracture mechanical <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> the area of stable crack growth is more or less distinct and the crack velocity changes. In addition the crack propagation direction can be influenced by the gradation. Within this contribution the influence of a fracture mechanical gradation on the crack growth rate, the area of stable fatigue crack growth and the crack propagation direction is investigated. For the prediction of the crack growth behaviour in fracture mechanical <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> considering different loading situations (Mode I, Mixed Mode) a new concept was developed. This TSSR-concept can be applied to sharp as well as smooth material gradations. In addition results of experimental investigations of crack growth considering fracture mechanical <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{interaction}} of two collinear cracks in functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> subjected to a uniform anti-plane shear loading is investigated by means of nonlocal theory. The traditional concepts of the nonlocal theory are extended to solve the fracture problem of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> To make the analysis tractable, {{it is assumed that}} the shear modulus varies exponentially with the coordinate vertical to the crack. By use of the Fourier transform, the problem can be solved {{with the help of a}} pair of triple integral equations, in which the unknown variable is the displacement on the crack surfaces. To solve the triple integral equations, the displacement on the crack surfaces is expanded in a series of Jacobi polynomials. Unlike the classical elasticity solutions, it is found that no stress singularity is present near the crack tips. The nonlocal elastic solutions yield a finite hoop stress at the crack tip, thus allowing us to use the maximum stress as a fracture criterion in functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> The magnitude of the finite stress field depends on the crack length, the distance between two cracks, the parameter describing the functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> and the lattice parameter of the materials...|$|R
