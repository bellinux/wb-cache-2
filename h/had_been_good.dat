To determine the financial performance Rokan Hulu District Government used the financial ratio analysis of the region, especially the current ratio, cash ratio, debt to equity ratio, and the ratio of debt to income areas. The results showed that in 2010 the current ratio <b>is</b> less <b>good,</b> but the current ratio in 2011 - 2014 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> so that the Government Rokan Hulu is able to repay short-term debt through current assets. Cash ratio in 2010 showed less well, whereas in 2011 - 2014 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> this shows the Government Rokan Hulu is still able to satisfy the debt that must be met with existing cash and securities. Debt to equity ratio in 2010 - 2014 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> where it <b>is</b> marked by the trend of the ratio is less than 1 (one) year after year.

The power and influence that Edward I possessed allowed him to preside over a court to assess {{the merits of the}} claims to the crown and the military might of his kingdom meant he could enforce its decision. Assistance came at a price: the claimants had to acknowledge him as Overlord of Scotland. The most serious claims, in what became known as 'The Great Cause', were advanced by John Balliol, the half-English lord of Galloway, and Robert Bruce, lord of Annandale and grandfather of the future king. After lengthy deliberation, King Edward's court found in favour of Balliol.|$|E

25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of Sassanid rule in 224 an orthodox Pars-oriented Zoroastrian tradition would play an important part in influencing and lending legitimization to the state until its collapse in the mid-7th century. After Ardashir I had deposed the last Parthian King, Artabanus V, he sought the aid of Tansar, a herbad (high priest) of the Iranian Zoroastrians to aid him in acquiring legitimization for the new dynasty. This Tansar did by writing to the nominal and vassal kings in different regions of Iran to accept Ardashir I as their new King, most notably in the Letter of Tansar, which was addressed to Gushnasp, the vassal king of Tabarestan. Gushnasp had accused Ardashir I of having forsaken tradition by usurping the throne, and that while his actions 'may have been good for the World' they were 'bad for the faith'. Tansar refuted these charges in his letter to Gushnasp by proclaiming that not all of the old ways <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>good,</b> and that Ardashir was more virtuous than his predecessors. The Letter of Tansar included some attacks on the religious practices and orientation of the Parthians, who did not follow an orthodox Zoroastrian tradition but rather a heterodox one, and so attempted to justify Ardashir's rebellion against them by arguing that Zoroastrianism had 'decayed' after Alexander's invasion, a decay which had continued under the Parthians and so needed to be 'restored'.|$|E

Aspinall was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played.

He was reported to be a good friend of Sam Giancana, and the two were seen playing golf together.
