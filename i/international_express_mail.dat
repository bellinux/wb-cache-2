500|$|As the Pony <b>Express</b> <b>Mail</b> service {{existed only}} briefly in 1860 and 1861, there are {{consequently}} very few surviving examples of Pony <b>Express</b> <b>mail.</b> Also, {{contributing to the}} scarcity of surviving Pony <b>Express</b> <b>mail</b> is that the cost to send a [...] letter was $5.00 at the beginning, (about $130.00 to today's standards).

As this mail service was also a frontier enterprise, removed {{from the general population}} in the east, along with the largely unaffordable rates, there are consequently few pieces of surviving Pony <b>Express</b> <b>mail</b> in the hands of collectors and museums.

Along with development of e-commerce and <b>international</b> <b>express</b> <b>mail</b> services, the new agreement aims to develop hybrid mail in Russia for businesses, direct marketing and e-government services.

50|$|An <b>International</b> <b>Express</b> <b>Mail</b> Agreement and {{regulations}} were signed between the United States and Solomon Islands governments in Honiara and Washington, D.C. on 19 April and 27 June 1991, {{coming into effect}} on 1 August 1991. On 6 November 1998, a peace agreement was signed in Honiara between the United States and Solomon Islands governments. However, since the late 1990s, Honiara has been the centre of ethnic violence and political unrest in the country. The area around Honiara was the battle ground of rival factions during the unrest {{as a result of}} the dominance of Malaitans, who were outsiders, and the local Guadalcanal islanders.A coup attempt occurred in June 2000 which resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM). Violence was prevalent in the streets of Honiara, and although a peace agreement was made in October 2000, violence ensued in March 2002 when two diplomats from New Zealand and numerous others were murdered. Conditions became so bad in Honiara that in July 2003 Australian military and police units moved into the country to suppress the conflict, increase security, rebuild the damaged city and safeguard its shattered economic, political and legal institutions. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; the large Pacific Casino Hotel was also totally gutted. The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to rubble and ashes. Three National Parliament members, Charles Dausabea, Nelson Ne'e, and Patrick Vahoe, were arrested during or {{as a result of the}} riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The army part of RAMSI was removed and rebuilding took shape.|$|E
