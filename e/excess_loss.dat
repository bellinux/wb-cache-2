40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to develop the {{framework}} for an underwriting system for <b>excess</b> of <b>loss</b> reinsurance. A system is constructed and tested which builds on the strengths but avoids the most important practical limitations of existing judgemental or scientific methods. Key issues in the proposed method are the identification of underwriting decision criteria {{in the face of}} uncertainty and the important influence of the market in the decision process. The research involves the following stages. Firstly,. a conceptual framework is provided for tackling the problem effectively in a flexible but comprehensive manner. Secondly, a rigorous empirical examination of underwriting activities over a four year period is undertaken on data collected from an <b>excess</b> of <b>loss</b> underwriting agency operating in the London Market. Thirdly, from relationships established in the empirical investigation, an underwriting system is devised, subjected to sensitivity analysis, and tested in comparison with the performance of a professional <b>excess</b> of <b>loss</b> underwriter. From the research, the contribution to knowledge is as follows: 1) The first detailed study of <b>excess</b> of <b>loss</b> underwriters' actual decision­ making behaviour is provided; Z) Practical application of risk-theoretic techniques is demonstrated as being negligible among <b>excess</b> of <b>loss</b> un<;lerwriters; 3) Evidence is provided for the existence of a satisficing model for <b>excess</b> of <b>loss</b> underwriting decisions; · 4) An <b>excess</b> of <b>loss.</b> underwriting system based on market heuristics is constructed, tested and evaluated; 5) Wider implications of the fact that real units of trade may differ from how they are perceived by market operators are presented. and discussed.

50|$|TL is the {{transmission}} loss in decibels, MS and BS are respectively masking and ambient sound levels in decibels. The speech weighting factors W are those listed with Articulation Index. The first two ratings {{account for the}} high sound loss at frequencies that are important for intelligibility. ESL treats {{the difference between the}} masking spectrum and the background spectrum as an additional loss. The figure on the right shows the Speech Loss for a furniture panel with high STC; it is the <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> caused by sound diffraction over the panel. The Effective Speech Loss is higher and shows sound masking as if it were part of the partition. The masking level for this example was set at 47 dB(A) and the background level was 39 dB(A). This graph demonstrates the significant value of sound masking when it acts as an additional panel height. It is clear that the level used in the graph only would be necessary for low panel heights, but is excessive with higher panels. The graph also demonstrates the panel tradeoff with sound masking. Adding masking permits lower panels to achieve the same speech loss. Adding masking roughly permits a reduction of at least 12 inches in panel height so there can be a significant cost savings.The reflection of speech from a ceiling in an open office depends on the sound absorbing characteristics of the ceiling tile and the height of the suspended ceiling. Because ceiling tiles tend to absorb the higher frequencies better, the speech loss is relatively good, as seen in the figure on the right. It should be noted that an upgrade in NRC rating adds expense but not always appreciable speech privacy improvement. A goal of SL=20 for the ceiling would require the panel height to be at least 60-66 inches to balance the two paths with added masking, otherwise, the panel would be the weakest sound path. Higher ceilings also increase sound diffusion for masking speakers in the ceiling plenum, increasing acceptability.|$|E

The theoretical minimum <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> of the X coupler is 0. 73 dB, whereas its experimental value is 1. 0817 dB. CGC has a coupling region length of 24 μm.

These couplers are directional (X) coupler, cross gap coupler (CGC), and multimode interface (MMI) coupler. The couplers are simulated using the beam propagation method. The {{distance between the}} input/output waveguides is set to 10 μm considering the test of a single device in the following work. The total footprint of X coupler is 10 μmx 300 μm. The length of parallel film waveguide is 1 μm. After optimization, the minimum <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> is 0. 73 dB. CGC has a footprint of 10 μm x 300 μm, a coupling region length of 24 μm, and a minimum <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> of 0. 6 dB. Taper waveguides are used as input/output waveguides for MMI coupler.

40|$|Several years ago, the {{retrospective}} rating plan premium formula was modified {{with the intention}} of eliminating “overlap ” between its insurance charge and <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> premium components. Under the modified formula, the <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> premium is reduced via subtraction of an <b>Excess</b> <b>Loss</b> Adjustment Amount (ELAA). Now, the ELAA approach is likely to be supplanted by an alternative methodology, called ICRLL (Insurance Charge Reflecting Loss Limitation), under which the insurance charge is calculated net of overlap and no adjustment is made to the <b>excess</b> <b>loss</b> premium. ICRLL uses the standard system of equations, modified to correctly reflect the loss limit, along with a column shifting procedure to arrive at a better set of insurance charge values to use for solving the equations. The paper starts with an introductory discussion of overlap and a brief review of the literature. After that, the ELAA methodology is described and its vulnerability to inconsistency is explained and demonstrated. The final section of the paper is devoted to an exposition of the ICRLL procedure.

Identifying these individuals early on and treating them adequately remains a challenge. As binge eating directly affects food intake, the study of this symptom and its relation to bariatric surgery and its results is increasing, because it appears to have an influence on the results of surgery. This study aimed to see how binge eating changes, measured with the Binge Eating Scale, interferes in the % <b>excess</b> weight <b>loss</b> one year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 149 patients older than 18 years who were evaluated one year after undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The variation in the intensity of binge eating was measured with the pre- and postoperative Binge Eating Scale scores. The variation of one unit in the Binge Eating Scale implied an inverse variation of 0. 41 % of % <b>excess</b> weight <b>loss</b> (p< 0. 05). The correlation coefficient between the variation of binge eating and the % <b>excess</b> weight <b>loss</b> was - 0. 186 (p = 0. 033).
