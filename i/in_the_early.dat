5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{divisions of}} <b>the</b> egg {{appears to be}} the original condition for <b>the</b> ancestral bilaterians, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> Ecdysozoa and possibly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the arctometatarsus first evolved; {{it was not}} present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> tyrannosauroids like Dilong, but was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later Appalachiosaurus.
