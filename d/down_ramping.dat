30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  7, the PtG {{facility}} is operated in hours 1 – 6 while the gas-fired unit {{works for the}} rest of the day. It is observed in Figs.  5 and 6 that wind generation is relatively high in hours 1 – 6 where the system cannot provide enough <b>down</b> <b>ramping</b> capabilities to effectively utilizing available wind energy. In turn, PtG is called to help converting excessive wind energy into natural gas, which will prevent wind spillage and facilitate an economic operation. For the remaining hours where electrical load is relatively high, the gas-fired unit is operated to generate electricity and maintain power system security by providing up/down ramping capabilities to handle worst cases. It should be noted that power outputs of gas-fired unit and power consumptions of PtG facilities increase in worst cases.|$|E

Secondary permeability values at study sites will affect the flow of groundwater potential zones and take effect on groundwater flow patterns. The study was conducted at the location of the <b>ramp</b> <b>down</b> and <b>ramp</b> up Kubang Cicau at an elevation of 450 - 500 meters above sea level. Based on the analysis {{it was found that the}} flow of groundwater in the study site predominantly influenced by secondary permeability is influenced by the media cracks in the rocks.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a sharp density transition for electron injection in laser wakefield acceleration through numerical study. This density transition {{is generated by}} a detached shock wave induced by a cylinder inserted into a supersonic helium gas flow. In a Mach  1. 5 flow, the scale length of the density transition L_{grad} can approximately equal to plasma wavelength λ_{p} at the shock front, and can be further reduced with an increase of the flow Mach number. A density <b>down</b> <b>ramp</b> with L_{grad}≥λ_{p} can reduce the phase velocity of the wakefield and lower the energy threshold for the electrons to be trapped. Moreover, {{the quality of the}} accelerated beam may be greatly improved by precisely controlling of L_{grad} to be one λ_{p}. For an even sharper density <b>down</b> <b>ramp</b> with L_{grad}≪λ_{p}, the oscillating electrons in the plasma wave will up shift their phase when crossing the ramp, therefore a fraction of the electrons are injected into the accelerating field. For this injection mechanism, there is no threshold requirement for the pump laser intensity to reach wave breaking, which is a big advantage as compared with other injection mechanisms...|$|R

A hold-time ramp is applied at low temperature where the emitter sheet resistance remains nearly unchanged and recombination active defects are still mobile. We observed a significant enhancement of the effective minority carrier lifetime measured by the Carrier Density Imaging (CDI) and Quasi Steady State Photoconductance (QSSPC) methods. This improvement is explained by an increased diffusion of metal impurities into the gettering layer and by formation or growth of precipitates due to a lower solubility of impurities in silicon at low temperatures...|$|R

5000|$|Intake {{design was}} also a major issue. Normal jet engines can only ingest subsonic air, so for {{supersonic}} operation the air has to be slowed <b>down.</b> <b>Ramps</b> or cones in the intake are used to create shock waves that slows the airflow before it reaches the engine. Doing so removes energy from the airflow, causing drag. The key to reducing this drag is to use multiple small oblique shock waves, but this was difficult because the angle they make inside the intake changes with Mach number. In order to efficiently operate {{across a range of}} speeds, the shock waves have to be [...] "tuned." ...|$|R
