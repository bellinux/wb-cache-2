40|$|The European <b>flood</b> risk <b>management</b> {{plan is a}} new {{instrument}} introduced by the Floods Directive. It introduces a spatial turn and a scenario approach in <b>flood</b> risk <b>management,</b> ultimately leading to differentiated flood protection levels on a catchment basis. This challenges the traditional sources of legitimacy for <b>flood</b> risk <b>management,</b> which are predominantly founded on strong institutions and engineering solutions. Future <b>flood</b> risk <b>management</b> needs to incorporate stakeholders and citizens {{in the decision-making process}} because the choices for the <b>flood</b> risk <b>management</b> plan will be more normative and political. In terms of concepts of legitimacy, this means an increasing importance of throughput legitimacy, complementing input and output legitimacy. This change shares similarities with a paradigm shift in spatial planning around the 1970 s. Therefore, this contribution argues that <b>flood</b> risk <b>management,</b> according to the European Floods Directive, can profit from experiences and approaches in spatial planning...|$|R

The Red Cross appealed for $418,000 to support 15,000families for one month. A cash grant of $17,300 from the United Kingdom was received on November8. Two United States Air Force AC-130s from Subic bay naval base flew to Cebu carrying ready-to-eat meals. International funding reached $2.5million on November12, with grants of $1.05million, $1million, $188,000 from the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia respectively. Additionally, the United States provided 55,000 packages of food rations. This total nearly doubled two days later with grants from the United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme, World Vision International, Médecins Sans Frontières, Caritas, various branches of the Red Cross, and the governments of Canada and New Zealand.
