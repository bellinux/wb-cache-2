She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
5|$|Kanaka Dasa (whose {{birth name}} was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509–1609) of Kaginele (in modern Haveri district) was an ascetic and spiritual seeker, who {{according}} to historical accounts {{came from a}} family of Kuruba (shepherds) or beda (hunters). Under the patronage of the Vijayanagara king, he authored such important writings as Mohanatarangini ("River of Delight", 1550), written in dedication to King Krishnadevaraya, which narrates the story of Krishna in sangatya metre. His other famous writings are Narasimhastava, a work dealing with glory of God Narasimha, Nalacharita, the story of Nala, which is noted for its narration, and Hari Bhaktisara, a spontaneous writing on devotion in shatpadi metre. The latter writing, which is on niti (morals), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (renunciation), continues to be a popular standard book of learning for children. A unique allegorical poem titled Ramadhanya Charitre ("Story of Rama's Chosen Grain") which exalts ragi over rice was authored by Kanaka Dasa. In this poem, a quarrel arises between ragi, the food <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, and rice, that of the rich, as to which is superior. Rama decides that ragi is superior because it does not rot when preserved. This is one of the earliest poetic expressions of class struggle in the Kannada language. In addition to these classics, about 240 songs written by Kanaka Dasa are available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{annealing}} behavior <b>of</b> {{cold rolled}} Type 430 {{ferritic stainless steel}} is <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> this paper. <b>The</b> steel was cold rolled 79 %, then heated at 6 °C/s to <b>the</b> soaking temperature <b>of</b> 841 °C, which is just below the Ae 1 temperature. During heating, specimens were quenched from selected temperatures between 650 and 841 °C and after various times at 841 °C. These quenched samples underwent metallographic examination and micro-hardness determination. The results indicated that under the prevailing experimental conditions, the hardness appeared to correlate strongly with <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> recrystallization. <b>The</b> kinetics <b>of</b> recrystallization appeared to originate in the cold worked state, where three kinds <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> were found: (i) “smooth elongated, featureless ” of α-fiber orientation { 001 }; (ii) “irregular fishbone <b>grains</b> ” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> γ-fiber orientations { 111 } plus { 111 }; and (iii) “twisted <b>grains</b> ” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> η-fiber orientation { 001 }. It was found that <b>the</b> twisted <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> η-fiber {{were the first to}} recrystallize, with <b>the</b> fishbone <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> γ-fiber second, and the smooth elongated, featureless <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> α-fiber last. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> α-fiber orientation { 001 } and the η-fiber orientation { 001 } were replaced with <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> γ-fiber orientations as recrystallization progressed. These results are discussed in terms of recrystallization and texture development...|$|R

25|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} artistic technique in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood (unlike wood engraving where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe beechwood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of cherry wood was popular.|$|E
25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E
