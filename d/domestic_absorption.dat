40|$|The paper characterizes five {{operational}} {{versions of}} the macromodels of the Romanian transition economy, elaborated during 1995 - 2000 years. 	• The first (1996) was finalized after the author’s visit at the Hoover Institution. This version, {{as well as the}} following ones, took into consideration the peculiarities of transition economies, which can be regarded as, at least in the case of Romania, a weakly structured system. The main relationships of the macromodel referred to real output, consumption, investment, foreign trade, labour force, labour productivity, exchange rate, price indices, labour income, general consolidated budget, interest rate, and other monetary variables. 	• The second operational version of the macromodel (1997) underwent some changes as introduction of a special block for demographic variables, and the connection of the annual indicators to a monthly block for the evolution of export and exchange rate. Beginning with this version, there were published systematically predictions in the Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting. 	• The third operational version (1998) modified the previous as follows: a) improved estimation of the expected income of households, firms, and public budget; b) delimitation of the most important consequences of the budget deficits; c) more detailed elaboration of the possible scenarios concerning the future evolution of the Romanian economy. 	• The fourth version (1999) was characterized by such: a) the determination of the real output for the entire economy, without branch division; b) the estimation of the main components of the <b>domestic</b> aggregate demand (<b>absorption)</b> using econometric relationships; c) the determination of export using exclusively relationships reflecting the market conditions. 	• The fifth version of the macromodel (2000) introduced relationships concerning foreign direct investment, non-reimbursable foreign loans, public debt and total external debt. It was divided into three main blocks: a) output and absorption (aggregate demand); b) production factors and labour income; and c) financial and monetary variables. The 2000 version has been used in projection of the “Romania’s medium term economic strategy” for integration into European Union. The estimations of its subsequent updated forms (during 2001 - 2004) were included into yearly national “Pre-Accession Economic Programmes” of Romania. 	• The series of the 1996, 1998, and 2000 operational variants have been presented in the „Journal of Economic Literature (Volume 35, no. 2, June 1997, Volume 37, no. 1, March 1999, and Volume 39, no. 2, June 2001).

30|$|Different {{rationales}} are guiding these objectives: {{the rationale}} behind the quality acceleration and excellence objective is primarily an intrinsic one that assumes that international R&D cooperation improves the domestic science base, leading to faster and improved scientific progress as well as enhanced scientific productivity, and is also supportive for the professional advancement of the involved researchers (e.g. trough joint publications in acknowledged international journals). Behind this assumption stands the idea that only the ‘best’ (institutions and/or researchers) succeed also in international competitive procedures.c The rationale behind the extrinsic market and competition objective is to support the market entry of domestically produced technologies/innovations abroad {{as well as to}} support the access to and a quick uptake of technologies produced abroad within the <b>domestic</b> economy. Here, <b>absorption</b> capacities and the availability of efficient spill-over mechanisms are of importance. The rationale behind the resource acquisition objective overlaps partly with the two major objectives mentioned before. The access to information, knowledge, technology and expertise as well as to singular equipment/facilities and materials are in the focus. However, resource acquisition is not limited to different codified and tacit dimensions of technology transfer but extends to brain gain, gaining of solvent students (for universities) and increasingly also gaining research funds from abroad or from multilateral or international sources. The cost optimisation objective from a public S&T policy focus does not primarily mean to use cost arbitrages (e.g. lower wages in a foreign country) as this might be a rational argument of the corporate sector, but rather focuses on cost sharing approaches to create critical mass in a certain science arena, e.g. to establish large-scale research infrastructures, and it also includes the rational of risk sharing. The assumption behind the global or regional development objective is the comprehension that many risks have no frontiers (e.g. infectious diseases or climate change) or cannot be solved without international cooperation and solidarity (e.g. Millennium Development Goals) and, thus, have to be tackled through international R&D collaboration (e.g. research for development). Also, the science diplomacy objective often refers to global challenges and to development cooperation agendas. Fundamentally, it has two main rationales: firstly, to support through R&D cooperation other external policy dimensions in terms of science for diplomacy (e.g. non-proliferation of mass destruction weapons through keeping former weapon researchers busy with civilian R&D projects) and, secondly, to promote its own science base abroad in support of other objectives already mentioned above (e.g. to attract ‘brains’ or to promote a general quality trademark like ‘made in Germany’).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{starts with}} {{examining}} the standard concept of government expenditure multiplier and finds {{that in a}} model of open economy with government revenues and expenditures the multiplier definition is incorrect {{in so far as}} the import intensity component relates total imports to GDP, whereas part of imports serves as inputs in exported output. Therefore the value of imports should be related to the value of final output, which is the sum of <b>domestic</b> <b>absorption</b> and exports. Since for most countries final output is significantly larger than GDP, the value of the multiplier is correspondingly larger. Moreover, the paper argues that, the import intensity of exports being as a rule larger than that of <b>domestic</b> <b>absorption,</b> the import intensity of the latter - which is the import intensity relevant for the government expenditure multiplier - is lower than that of final output, which again raises the value of the multiplier. Next the value of the government expenditure multiplier in Poland in 2006 - 2008 is estimated on the basis of statistics of non-financial quarterly accounts by institutional sectors. The variations in the value of multiplier are found to depend heavily on changes in import intensity of <b>domestic</b> <b>absorption.</b> The value of the multiplier ranges between 1. 59 and 1. 70 if, {{in order to reduce the}} impact of seasonal fluctuations, it is calculated on a quarterly basis, for four consecutive quarters, and between 1. 62 and 1. 86 if, in order to make the calculations more suitable for economic forecasting, the quarterly coefficients year on year are used. Both sets of multiplier values are slightly higher than those assumed in other countries (1. 5 - 1. 6) which may be explained by the rather high import intensity of Polish exports. macroeconomics, principle of effective demand, fiscal multiplier, stabilization policy...|$|E

Since the exchange rate has other determinants besides <b>domestic</b> <b>absorption,</b> the assumption of twin deficits often does not hold.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} FDI inflows on external imbalances in the developing and transition countries in Asia during the period 1991 - 2011. To this end, we extend the conventional trade balance model by reformulating the determinants of exports and imports. Our empirical findings suggest that current FDI inflows increase trade deficits, leading to negative consequences for the host country’s macroeconomic stability. However, the coefficient estimated becomes negative when we lag the FDI variable, implying that FDI inflows worsen the trade balance first and then improve it. We also find that a real depreciation tends to worsen trade balances because the usual Marshall-Lerner constraint is magnified by the import content of exports. Lastly, higher <b>domestic</b> <b>absorption</b> and larger productive capacity in the manufacturing sector improve the trade balance.

In this respect, the Philippine experience is quite different from much of Asia where the growth rates of <b>domestic</b> <b>absorption,</b> exports, and imports rose or fell in tandem with gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
