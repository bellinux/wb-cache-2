5|$|Through the series, {{the cities}} used within the Crazy Taxi games have been {{influenced}} by real-world cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and Las Vegas. Certain versions of the Crazy Taxi game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, FILA, and Tower Records; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although {{this is one of the}} most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps because it <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the castle}} meres can still be seen to the west {{of the castle}}, {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is similar to that used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of how the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.|$|E
25|$|A {{reviewer}} {{commented that}} the interweaving of characters from Pelecanos' other novels <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of place and a story larger than the novels themselves. Pelecanos has commented that he deliberately interweaves characters from his novels {{to create a sense}} of a fictional universe that parallels the real world.|$|E

Sudden curves <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of surprise and allow new scenes to surprise the rider. The rides may also feature sudden ascents or descents {{to further the}} excitement.|$|R

25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of his fierce strength. His stance is set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks {{to be full of}} anxiety as if he knows that he should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E
25|$|Like most sans-serifs Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, {{with all}} strokes {{of the letter}} of quite similar width. This <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{simplicity}} and an absence of the adornment and flourishes seen in many more decorative sans-serifs {{of the late nineteenth}} century influenced by the Art Nouveau style. Modern type designer Martin Majoor has described the general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to the Didone serif fonts that were standard types in the nineteenth century, such as Didot and Walbaum. This is most visible in the quite folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’.|$|E

25|$|The {{fountain}} {{consists of}} three bronze figures of mythological Tritons holding up a platter. Two of the Tritons are sitting, while the third one is kneeling, and they are balanced on a seaweed base. The face of each Triton is visible when viewed from City Gate. Their posture <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of strength as well as spiral movement, which contribute to the monumentality of the fountain. The water jets were also designed in order to convey the sense of movement. The figures of the Tritons represent Malta's links with the sea, and their design {{was inspired by the}} Fontana delle Tartarughe in Rome. After the fountain's platter was damaged in the 1980s, a bronze pillar depicting a flight of seagulls was added to the fountain to support its weight. This will not be included once the current restoration is complete.|$|E

2500|$|Hadid {{designed}} a public housing estate in Berlin (1986–1993) and organised an exhibition, [...] "The Great Utopia" [...] (1992), at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Her next major project was a ski jump at Bergisel, in Innsbruck Austria. The old ski jump, built in 1926, {{had been used}} in the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics. The new structure was to contain not only a ski jump, but also a cafe with 150 seats offering a 360-degree view of the mountains. Hadid had to fight against traditionalists and against time; the project had to be completed in one year, before the next international competition. Her design is 48 metres high and rests on a base seven metres by seven metres. She described it as [...] "an organic hybrid", a cross between a bridge and a tower, which by its form <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of movement and speed ...|$|E

[...] "What it does is embarrass them for the moment... but then they'll go and get a different screen name and know to check things out a little more thoroughly next time."

Dembski has also stated that ID has little chance as a serious scientific theory as long as methodological naturalism is the basis for science. Although intelligent design proponents (including Dembski) have made little apparent effort to publish peer-reviewed scientific research to support their hypotheses, in recent years they have made vigorous efforts to promote the teaching of intelligent design in schools. Dembski is a strong supporter of this drive as a means of making young people more receptive to intelligent design, and said he wants [...] "to see intelligent design flourish as a scientific research program" [...] among a [...] "new generation of scholars" [...] willing to consider the theory and textbooks that include it.|$|E
2500|$|Martial arts {{have crossed}} over into sports when forms of {{sparring}} become competitive, becoming a sport {{in its own}} right that is dissociated from the original combative origin, such as with western fencing. The Summer Olympic Games includes judo, taekwondo, western archery, boxing, javelin, wrestling and fencing as events, while Chinese wushu recently failed in its bid to be included, but is still actively performed in tournaments across the world. Practitioners in some arts such as kickboxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu often train for sport matches, whereas those in other arts such as aikido [...] generally spurn such competitions. Some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners, and <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of good sportsmanship. Others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have diminished the combat effectiveness of martial arts or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than a focus such as cultivating a particular moral character.|$|E
