Along with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, he set up Farm Aid in 1985 to assist and {{increase}} awareness of the importance of family farms, after Bob Dylan's comments during the Live Aid concert that he hoped some of the money would help American farmers <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their farms through mortgage debt. The first concert included Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, B.B. King, Roy Orbison, and Neil Young among many others, and raised over $9million for America's family farmers.

5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials {{to convince them that}} the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{began their}} 2009 season {{in front of}} a sold-out crowd of 44,532 at Citizens Bank Park on April 5, playing against the Atlanta Braves. The Phillies, {{originally}} scheduled to play in the afternoon of April 6, earned the distinction of playing the opening game of the entire 2009 Major League Baseball season after winning the 2008 World Series. They lost the opener 4–1 to the division-rival Braves, whose new ace, Derek Lowe, pitched eight shutout innings. The Phillies lost the next game, and were <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> the following night and dropping to 0–3 before scoring eight runs {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning for a 12–11 come-from-behind win. The Phillies lost their first game in Denver, but came from behind again in their next two games to take the second series from the Colorado Rockies. The Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals in the opener of their third series, just hours after the death of Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas, but lost the third scheduled game of the series after the second was cancelled due to weather. In their series against the San Diego Padres, the Phillies dropped the first two games as well; during the second game, closer Brad Lidge blew his first save in a Phillies uniform, breaking his streak of 47 consecutive saves extending back to the 2007 regular season. The Phillies won the Sunday afternoon matinee against the Padres, 5–4, on a walk-off home run by Ibáñez after trailing the entire game.|$|E

25|$|The wild {{nature of}} Hobart Town's seedier side almost had a {{disastrous}} effect.

25|$|The {{closure of}} Women's Voice in 1982, reputedly because {{it tried to}} inject feminist {{thinking}} into SWP theoretical practice rather than gaining women members for the party, was a bitterly disputed action made by the leadership, a sharp debate taking place between those who believed {{the result would be}} to ignore the specificities of women's oppression, and those who believed that feminist theories were <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> contact with the united interests of men and women workers.|$|E

With Johanns' move to Washington, few high-profile Republicans stepped up to run against Nelson, as the state party focused its attention on the governor's race. The Republican nomination was won by Pete Ricketts, a former TD Ameritrade executive.|$|E

By contrast, ethnic family narratives tend to show the ethnic more in charge of his life, and perhaps <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his Jewishness altogether. Some stories show how a family member successfully negotiated the conflict between ethnic and American identities.|$|E

25|$|The narrator's {{standards}} for {{what constitutes a}} cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his life or another kind of deep trouble, {{in some parts of}} the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen—and in all these cases turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.|$|E
