50|$|The first {{failure was}} {{the launch of}} Courier 1A, an <b>experimental</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite,</b> on 19 August 1960 when the first stage shut down 30 seconds earlier than planned and was {{destroyed}} by the Range Safety officer. On 30 November, another launch involving a Transit satellite failed in practically identical fashion. This episode nearly created an international incident as parts of the Thor landed in Cuba. Cuban leader Fidel Castro subsequently sold off the Thor's engine to the Soviets and the Chinese received its thrust vectors, which ended up proving valuable to the latter's development of a ballistic missile capability. To prevent this from happening again, future Thor Ablestar launches had their flight paths modified to avoid passing over Cuba.|$|E
5000|$|In 1925, AT&T {{created a}} new unit called Bell Telephone Laboratories, {{commonly}} known as Bell Labs. This research and development unit proved highly successful, pioneering, among other things, radio astronomy, the transistor, the photovoltaic cell, the Unix operating system, and the C programming language. AT&T ranked 13th among United States corporations {{in the value of}} World War II military contracts. In 1949, the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit aimed at forcing the divestiture of Western Electric, which was settled seven years later by AT&T's agreement to confine its products and services to common carrier telecommunications and license its patents to [...] "all interested parties." [...] A key effect of this was to ban AT&T from selling computers despite its key role in electronics research and development. Nonetheless, technological innovation continued. For example, AT&T commissioned the first <b>experimental</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite,</b> Telstar I in 1962.|$|E
50|$|While the {{achievements}} of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) {{pale in comparison to}} the milestones set by the former Soviet Union and the United States, some experts believe Asia may soon lead the world in space exploration. China has been the leader of Asia's space race {{since the beginning of the}} 21st century. The first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region. At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.In January 2007 China became the first Asian military-space power to send an anti-satellite missile into orbit, to destroy an aging Chinese Feng Yun 1C weather satellite in polar orbit.

40|$|An {{increase}} in the demand for <b>satellite</b> <b>communications</b> {{has led to an}} overcrowding of the current spectrums being used - mainly at C and Ku bands. To alleviate this overcrowding, new technology is being developed to open up the Ka-band for communications use. One of the first <b>experimental</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellites</b> using this technology is NASA's Advanced <b>Communications</b> Technology <b>Satellite</b> (ACTS). In Sept. 1993, ACTS was deployed into a geostationary orbit near 100 deg W longitude. The ACTS system employs two Ka-band beacons for propagation experiments, one at 20. 185 GHz and another at 27. 505 GHz. Attenuation due to rain and tropospheric scintillations will adversely affect new technologies proposed for this spectrum. Therefore, before being used commercially, propagation effects at Ka-band must be studied. Colorado State University is one of eight sites across the United States and Canada conducting propagations studies; each site is equipped with the ACTS propagation terminal (APT). With each site located in a different climatic zone, the main objective of the propagation experiment is to obtain monthly and yearly attenuation statistics. Each site also has secondary objectives that are site dependent. At CSU, the CSU-CHILL radar facility is being used to obtain polarimetric radar data along the ACTS propagation path. During the expected two to four year period of the project, it is hoped to study several significant weather events. The S-band radar will be used to obtain Ka-band attenuation estimates and to initialize propagation models that have been developed, to help classify propagation events measured by the APT. Preliminary attenuation estimates for two attenuation events will be shown here - a bright band case that occurred on 13 May 1994 and a convective case that occurred on 20 Jun. 1994. The computations used to obtain Ka-band attenuation estimates from S-band radar data are detailed. Results from the two events are shown...|$|R

40|$|Plasma, vapor {{and debris}} {{associated}} with an impact or explosive event have been demonstrated in the laboratory to produce radiofrequency and optical electromagnetic emissions that can be diagnostic of the event. Such effects could potentially interfere with communications or remote sensing equipment if an impact occurred, for example, on a satellite. More seriously, impact generated plasma could end {{the life of a}} satellite by mechanisms that are not well understood and not normally taken into account in satellite design. For example, arc/discharge phenomena resulting from highly conductive plasma acting as a current path across normally shielded circuits {{may have contributed to the}} loss of the Olympus <b>experimental</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> on August 11, 1993. The possibility of significant storm activity during the Leonid meteor showers of November 1998, 1999 and 2000 (impact velocity, 72 km/s) has heightened awareness of potential vulnerabilities from hypervelocity electromagnetic effects to orbital assets. The concern is justified. The amount of plasma, electrostatic charge and the magnitude of the resulting currents and electric fields scale nearly as the cube of the impact velocity. Even for microscopic Leonid impacts, the amount of plasma approaches levels that could be dangerous to spacecraft electronics. The degree of charge separation that occurs during hypervelocity impacts scales linearly with impactor mass. The resulting magnetic fields increase linearly with impactor radius and could play a significant role in our understanding of the paleomagnetism of planetary surfaces. The electromagnetic properties of plasma produced by hypervelocity impact have been exploited by researchers as a diagnostic tool, invoked to potentially explain the magnetically jumbled state of the lunar surface and blamed for the loss of the Olympus <b>experimental</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite.</b> The production of plasma in and around an impact event can lead to several effects: (1) the plasma provides a significant perturbation to the ambient magnetic field via the electromagnetic pulse; (2) it supports the production of transient radiofrequency electromagnetic fields; (3) it charges ejected debris which, because of inertial separation, leads to significant electrostatic and magnetostatic field production; and (4) its high electrical conductivity provides a convenient path for discharge of the resulting high electrostatic fields. Effects (1) and (2) have been discussed by the authors elsewhere. Effects (3) and (4) will be discussed here. Typical studies of kinetic energy warheads focus on lethality as a function of impactor momentum or energy as they couple mechanically to the target. At high enough energies, however, additional physical processes come into play. Vaporization plays an important role and a partially ionized plasma can form. Impact-generated plasma, charged debris and magnetic fields have been characterized by laboratory hypervelocity impact experiments and are shown to be more abundant when certain easily ionized materials (such as alkali metals) are used in either projectile or target...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) is a NASA <b>experimental</b> <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> system {{designed}} to demonstrate on-orbit Ka-band communications and switching technologies {{that will be used}} by NASA and the commercial sector in the 21 st century.

The purpose of this report is to describe the ACTS power subsystem and the ACTS solar array and battery assemblies located within the power subsystem and then to document on-orbit measured performance from launch to mission end on April 28, 2004. Solar array and battery performance data is presented, and respective conclusions are drawn. The total solar array power available to the spacecraft was measured each year at the same time, and battery voltage performance was measured twice per year at the same times during peak solar eclipse. At the highest spacecraft power demand, the ACTS uses approximately 1113 W of electrical power during the low-burstrate experiment to operate all six satellite subsystems. After 10 years of on-orbit operation, solar array available output power normal to the Sun measured 1508 W, which represents 395 W of excess margin.
