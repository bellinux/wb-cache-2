40|$|The MAVIS II {{computer}} program {{provides for the}} modeling and analysis of <b>explosive</b> <b>valve</b> interactions. This report describes the individual components {{of the program and}} how MAVIS II is used with other available tools to integrate the design and understanding of explosive valves. The rationale and model used for each valve interaction is described. Comparisons of the calculated results with available data have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of using MAVIS II for analytical studies of <b>explosive</b> <b>valve</b> interactions. The model used for the explosive or pyrotechnic used as the driving force in explosive valves is the most critical to be understood and modeled. MAVIS II is an advanced version that incorporates a plastic, as well as elastic, modeling of the deformations experienced when plungers are forced into a bore. The inclusion of a plastic model has greatly expanded the use of MAVIS for all categories (opening, closure, or combined) of valves, especially for the closure valves in which the sealing operation requires the plastic deformation of either a plunger or bore over a relatively large area. In order to increase its effectiveness, the use of MAVIS II should be integrated with the results from available experimental hardware. Test hardware such as the Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR) and Velocity Generator test provide experimental data for accurate comparison of the actual valve functions. Variable Explosive Chamber (VEC) and Constant Explosive Volume (CEV) tests are used to provide the proper explosive equation-of-state for the MAVIS calculations of the explosive driving forces. The rationale and logistics of this integration is demonstrated through an example. A recent valve design is used to demonstrate how MAVIS II can be integrated with experimental tools to provide an understanding of the interactions in this valve...|$|E
40|$|A payload was {{designed}} {{which included a}} cryogenic oxidizer tank, a fuel tank, and burner section. Release of 30 lb of chemicals was planned to occur in 2 seconds at the optimum oxidizer to fuel ratio. The chemicals consisted of 17 lb of liquid fluorine oxidizer and 13 lb of hydrazine-barium salt fuel mixture. The fuel mixture was 17 % barium chloride, 16 % barium nitrate, and 67 % hydrazine, and contained 2. 6 lb of available barium. Two significant problem areas were resolved during the program: <b>explosive</b> <b>valve</b> development and burner operation. The release payload was flight tested, from Wallops Island, Virginia. The release took place {{at an altitude of}} approximately 260 km. The release produced a luminous cloud which expanded very rapidly, disappearing to the human eye in about 20 seconds. Barium ion concentration slowly increased over a wide area of sky until measurements were discontinued at sunrise (about 30 minutes) ...|$|E
40|$|MAVIS (Modeling and Analysis of <b>Explosive</b> <b>Valve</b> Interactions) is a {{computer}} program that simulates operation of explosively actuated valve. MAVIS was originally written in Fortran in the mid 1970 `s and was primarily run on the Sandia Vax computers in use through the early 1990 `s. During {{the mid to late}} 1980 `s MAVIS was upgraded to include the effects of plastic deformation and it became MAVIS II. When the Vax computers were retired, the Gas Transfer System (GTS) Development Department ported the code to the Macintosh and PC platforms, where it ran as a simple console application. All graphical output was lost during these ports. GTS code developers recently completed an upgrade that provides a Windows 95 /NT MAVIS application and restores all of the original graphical output. This upgrade is called MAVIS III version 1. 0. This report serves both as a user`s manual for MAVIS III v 1. 0 and as a general software development reference...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{evaluating}} the normally open normally closed, <b>explosive</b> actuated <b>valves</b> that {{were selected for}} use in the trajectory correction propulsion subsystem of the Thermoelectric Outer Planet Spacecraft (TOPS) program is presented. The design philosophy which determined the requirements for highly reliable valves that could provide the performance capability during long duration (10 year) missions to the outer planets is discussed. The techniques that were used to fabricate the valves and manifold ten valves into an assembly with the capability of five propellant-flow initiation/isolation sequences are described. The test program, which was conducted to verify valve design requirements, is outlined and the more significant results are shown...|$|R
40|$|The valve, {{especially}} as an overload safety valve for a mechanical press, has a mechanical {{lock on the}} valve piston (1) in the pressure medium flow path between an entry (7) and outlet (9) opening. The lock is a screw which is broken by a pyrotechnic or <b>explosive</b> action. The <b>valve</b> piston (1) has {{the structure of a}} step piston, where it is under loading from the pressure medium. USE - The safety valve is for protection of a mechanical press from damage through overloading. ADVANTAGE - The structure gives a more rapid opening action and the valve piston movement is dampened at the end phase of the opening operation. The system also prevents premature closure of the valve...|$|R
