"Instruction in agri-cultural mechanics is basic to all specialized programs in vocational agriculture " (Zurbrick, 1973). Zurbrick found that over 86 % of the employees in all agricultural job titles required one or more skills in agricultural mechanics.

Corrupted image is called the noisy image, and the corrected is called the de-noised image. We have different types of noises in the image processing like Gaussian noise, speckle noise, random noise, Salt&pepper noise etc. Among these the Salt and pepper noise is very <b>dangerous</b> <b>noise</b> compare to other noises. By using different algorithms we can reduce the noise from image. Now a days the color image processing is very widely used in image processing applications. In this project A modified decision based unsymmetrical trimmed median filter algorithm for the restoration of gray scale, and color images that are highly corrupted by salt and pepper noise is proposed. The proposed algorithm replaces the noisy pixel by trimmed median value when other pixel values, 0 ’s and 255 ’s are present in the selected window and when all the pixel values are 0 ’s and 255 ’s then the noise pixel is replaced by mean value of all the elements present in the selected window. This proposed algorithm shows better results than the Standard Median Filter (MF), Decision Based Algorithm (DBA), Modified Decision Based Algorithm (MDBA), and Progressive Switched Median Filter (PSMF).

Therefore, {{millions of people around}} the world are exposed to potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>noise</b> levels and consequently, there is an urgent, global need for legislation to adequately protect the auditory health of workers. Occupational noise legislation has been adopted in many of the countries with different degrees of comprehensiveness and varying levels of sophistication. This paper presents a global view of current legislation on occupational noise in the 22 countries that make up the Americas, that is, Latin America, Canada, and the United States. Upon analysis of the legislation, there are notable differences among countries in the defined values for permissible exposure limit (PEL) and exchange rate. Of the countries that have regulations, the majority (81 %) use a PEL of 85 dBA. A PEL of 85 dBA and the 3 -dB exchange rate are currently used by 32 % of the nations in the Americas. Most nations limit impulsive noise exposure to a peak unweighted sound pressure level of 140 dB (or dBC), while a few use slightly lower limits. However, 27 % of the countries in the region still have not established regulations with respect to permissible noise levels and exchange rates. This fact is leaving millions of workers in the Americas unprotected against occupational noise. Provide an overview and analysis of the current legislation on occupational noise in the 22 countries that make up the Americas.

Similar in spirit to classical neural networks, the error-resistance {{of the system is}} achieved by encoding the qubits distributed over the whole system. We therefore call our system a ''quantum neural network'', and present a ''quantum neural network model of quantum computation''. Qubits are encoded in a few quasi-degenerated low energy levels of the whole system, separated by a large gap from the excited states, and large energy barriers between themselves. We investigate protocols for implementing a universal set of quantum logic gates in the system, by adiabatic passage of a few low-lying energy levels of the whole system.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} non-contact measurement methods and analysis of rotors. The methods have been verified and applied to milling machine spindles in order to investigate the speed dependency in the milling machine spindle dynamic. The research was financed by the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova). Turning operations like milling are common in the automotive and aerospace industries where large metal work pieces are reduced to a fraction of their original weight when creating complex thin structures. During these operations {{it is important that}} unwanted behaviours such as excessive tool vibrations be avoided (this is normally called "chatter"). Chatter causes poor surface finish and/or material damage and can expose machine operators to annoying and/or <b>dangerous</b> <b>noise</b> levels. In order to predict processes parameters for a chatter free milling operation, knowledge of the properties of the dynamic system are essential. Normally the system dynamics are measured during no rotation; in order to include the influence of the spin speed the system must be analysed for all spindle speeds intended for the milling operation. This can be done either by measurement or modelling. Non- contact measurement techniques are however, often based on displacement sensors which {{do not have the same}} sensitivity as velocity or acceleration based methods. To improve the sensitivity in non-contact measurements of rotors a laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) based method has been developed. The developed LDV method is based on the reduction of the rotor surface structure and makes it possible to use single beam LDV measurements of rotors. These types of measurements were previously considered inaccurate but now have become feasible through the use of the method described in this research. Furthermore the dynamic properties of a high-speed-milling machine spindle were studied by a contactless dynamic spindle tester (CDST) developed by SKF. The measurements were substantiated by simulations using a finite element model (FEM) which confirmed the measurement results. The CDST measurements could be performed without violating safety regulations regarding human interaction with high speed spindles through the use of a magnetic excitation method. In the measurements conducted by the CDST a speed dependency in the spindle dynamic could be detected. By performing FEM simulations the major source of this dependency could be identified. The centrifugal force of the balls in the angular contact ball bearings was shown to have the largest influence on the overall dynamics compared to the gyroscopic moment of the rotor. The study performed indicates that predictions of high-speed-milling stability must include consideration of the speed dependency in the dynamic. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{occupational}} exposures in the United States; up to 22 million workers are exposed to <b>dangerous</b> <b>noise</b> levels each year. Excessive noise exposure can lead to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Exposure to high levels of noise may also be a contributing factor for a number of non-auditory outcomes, including injuries, cardiovascular disease, stress, and depression. This dissertation research focused on improving our understanding of the relationship between occupational noise exposure and NIHL by completing three distinct but related projects. Project 1 investigated the feasibility of using smart devices (iPods and iPhones) to accurately measure occupational noise in laboratory experiments and real-life workplaces. This project was divided into four experiments, three of which took place in a controlled laboratory setting, and one of which was a field test of the devices in two groups of workers. Experiment 1 demonstrated that certain combinations of applications and microphones could provide measurements within +/ 2. 0 A-weighted decibels (dBA) of a reference noise level. Experiment 2 showed that the best-performing microphone and application combinations could provide measurements within +/- 2. 0 dBA of a reference level across different generations of devices. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the 8 -hr time weighted average (TWA) measured by the smart devices was within +/- 1. 5 dBA of a paired noise dosimeter. Finally, experiment 4 determined that, on average, smart devices overestimated workplace exposures by up to 2. 2 dBA among workers exposed to highly variable noise. Project 2 developed a job-exposure matrix (JEM) for every occupation in the United States. This was done by collecting data from the government, private, industry and the published literature. From this dataset 748, 598 measurements made using the Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) were used to impute exposures for occupations without measurement data. Each measurement was assigned a job title based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) standard occupational classification (SOC) system. Because this classification system is hierarchical, it was possible to impute values for SOCs using SOCs where data was available. Of 443 SOCs, 19 % and 74 % were estimated to have noise exposures > 85 dBA and > 80 dBA, respectively, although many SOCs had wide credible intervals, indicating a significant amount of uncertainty around the point estimates. Project 3 compared the ability of the OSHA PEL and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) to predict NIHL. Noise exposures were estimated for a previously established cohort of construction workers followed for 10 years using both the PEL and REL metrics. These exposure estimates were used in mixed models predicting hearing threshold levels (HTLs). Akaike information criterion (AIC) was calculated to evaluate model fit. The modeled estimates were also compared to hearing loss estimates from an International Organization of Standards (ISO) NIHL model. In all but one instance, the models using the REL were found to have a better model fit. The mixed models predicted more hearing loss than the corresponding ISO model; however, the REL showed closer agreement to the corresponding ISO model than the PEL. The completion of these projects have made it easier to collect and use occupational noise measurements for epidemiological purposes. In addition, this research will help inform best practices for collecting occupational noise measurements to that they can be used to better predict NIHL...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sleep {{disturbance}} is a {{risk factor}} for somatic, psycho-social and spiritual dysfunction. It is also arguably the most deleterious effect of traffic noise pollution. Quantification of its burden is an anchor element of environmental policy making but no data are currently available for Bulgaria where the preponderance of <b>dangerous</b> nighttime <b>noise</b> exposure is highest in Europe. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the socio-economic burden of severe sleep disturbance due to traffic noise (road, aircraft and railway) in Bulgaria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The official World Health Organization methodology used in Europe was applied in order to estimate this annual loss expressed as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and their corresponding monetary value (assuming € 12 000 per DALY). RESULTS: Results showed that severe sleep disturbance due to all traffic sources was associated conservatively with 15 468 DALYs (8 839 - 22 097) and € 185 615 861 (€ 106 066 206 - € 265 165 516) lost in 2012, with road traffic being the single most important noise source. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, severe sleep disturbance due to traffic noise bears a heavy environmental and socio-economic burden in Bulgaria which prompts vigorous political action and greater involvement in environmental research. In order to increase the accuracy of future burden of disease analyses other studies would need to establish exposure-response functions based on population-based socio-acoustic surveys in the country...|$|R

There are many methods to asses of pollutant and noise emission used by various country but using different and separately methodology will causes a wide variation in results, some lack of information and the use of certain methods will require justification and reliability that must be demonstrated and proven. In relation of this issue and because there is no methods of the combination for assessing between Aircraft Pollutant and Noise emissions, this research will identify, improve, develop and combined the methodology of pollutant and noise emission integrated with the ICAO concept of Balanced Approach.

40|$|Noise {{is defined}} as an {{unwanted}} sound {{or a combination of}} sounds that has adverse effects on health. These effects can manifest in the form of physiologic damage or psychological harm through a variety of mechanisms. Chronic noise exposure can cause permanent threshold shifts and loss of hearing in specific frequency ranges. Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is thought {{to be one of the}} major causes of preventable hearing loss. Approximately 10 million adults and 5. 2 million children in the US are already suffering from irreversible noise induced hearing impairment and thirty million more are exposed to <b>dangerous</b> levels of <b>noise</b> each day. The mechanisms of NIHL have yet to be fully identified, but many studies have enhanced our understanding of this process. The role of oxidative stress in NIHL has been extensively studied. There is compelling data to suggest that this damage may be mitigated through the implementation of several strategies including anti-oxidant, anti-ICAM 1 Ab, and anti JNK intervention. The psychological effects of noise are usually not well characterized and often ignored. However, their effect can be equally devastating and may include hypertension, tachycardia, increased cortisol release and increased physiologic stress.

Not only will these farms produce a constant low level noise in their direct environment while operating, but the building of the foundations necessary to support the wind mills will produce impulsive <b>noise</b> <b>dangerous</b> to any cetaceans in the area and lethal to, for example, fish larvae.

Particular care is devoted to road traffic noise, since it is growing according {{to the growth of}} residential, industrial and commercial areas. For these reasons, it is important to develop effective models able to predict the noise in a certain area. In this paper, a hybrid predictive model is presented. The model is based on the mixing of two different approach: the Time Series Analysis (TSA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The TSA model is based on the evaluation of trend and seasonality in the data, while the ANN model is based on the capacity of the network to “learn” the behavior of the data. The mixed approach will consist in the evaluation of noise levels by means of TSA and, once the differences (residuals) between TSA estimations and observed data have been calculated, in the training of a ANN on the residuals. This hybrid model will exploit interesting features and results, with a significant variation related to the number of steps forward in the prediction.

The Hearing Loss Prevention Research Program is designed to reduce occupational hearing loss through research and the application of the research to real-world situations. This database advances this goal by informing buyers and users of power tools of the <b>dangerous</b> levels of <b>noise</b> and vibrations that they are exposed to while using the tools. By making people aware of how loud power tools actually are, NIOSH is attempting to encourage the design and production of quieter power tools and the proper use of hearing protectors when using such tools. The database is also part of a larger NIOSH prevention initiative called Buy Quiet. In recent years, Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The urban soundscape, which {{represents}} the totality of noise in the urban setting, is formed {{from a wide range}} of sources. One of the most ubiquitous and least studied of these is street-level (i. e., sidewalk) noise. Mainly associated with vehicular traffic, street level noise is hard to ignore and hard to escape. It is also potentially <b>dangerous,</b> as excessive <b>noise</b> from any source is an important risk factor for adverse health effects. This study was conducted to better characterize the urban soundscape and the role of street level noise on overall personal noise exposure in an urban setting. Methods Street-level noise measures were obtained at 99 street sites located throughout New York City (NYC), along with data on time, location, and sources of environmental noise. The relationship between street-level noise measures and potential predictors of noise was analyzed using linear and logistic regression models, and geospatial modeling was used to evaluate spatial trends in noise. Daily durations of street-level activities (time spent standing, sitting, walking and running on streets) were estimated via survey from a sample of NYC community members recruited at NYC street fairs. Street-level noise measurements were then combined with daily exposure durations for each member of the sample to estimate exposure to street noise, as well as exposure to other sources of noise. Results The mean street noise level was 73. 4 dBA, with substantial spatial variation (range 55. 8 - 95. 0 dBA). Density of vehicular (road) traffic was significantly associated with excessive street level noise levels. Exposure duration data for street-level noise and other common sources of noise were collected from 1894 NYC community members. Based on individual street-level exposure estimates, and in consideration of all other sources of noise exposure in an urban population, we estimated that street noise exposure contributes approximately 4 % to an average individual’s annual noise dose. Conclusions Street-level noise exposure is a potentially important source of overall noise exposure, and the reduction of environmental sources of excessive street- level noise should be a priority for public health and urban planning...|$|R
40|$|Les déficits auditifs dus au bruit comptent parmi les premières {{maladies}} professionnelles dans {{les pays}} industrialisés, que ce soit en nombre ou en coût de compensation financière, car ces atteintes sont irréversibles. En France, ce sont en moyenne 6, 8  % des travailleurs qui sont soumis à des bruits nocifs. Sur les 5  millions de Français ayant des problèmes auditifs, 2  millions sont âgés de moins de 55 ans. Les signes de souffrance auditive ou d’alerte sont notamment des difficultés à la compréhension en milieu bruyant qui peuvent s’ajouter aux effets de la presbyacousie. Une récente directive européenne, applicable dès février 2006, abaisse le niveau maximum de bruit admissible de 90 à 87 dBA (soit une intensité sonore diminuée de moitié), et introduit un niveau déclenchant un plan de prévention à 80 dBA. Enfin, le tableau relatif aux surdités professionnelles a été récemment modifié. Cette modification du calcul de l’indicateur médico-légal sera susceptible de multiplier par 4 le nombre de surdités professionnelles qui pourraient bénéficier d’une compensation financière. Noise-induced hearing losses (NIHL) {{are among the}} most often encountered occupational diseases in many industrial countries. This is true {{in terms of the number}} of exposed workers and in the amount of health insurance or State health care compensations. These handicaps are not reversible. In order to understand why this is, we will explain how high levels of noise pressure can affect the ear, by describing the three parts of the ear, including some details about the inner ear and its sensitive cells. Several epidemiological surveys indicate that an average of 6. 8  %, French employees are exposed to <b>dangerous</b> levels of <b>noise</b> with vast differences according to their sector of activity. The most exposed are found in the wood and paper industries (37. 4  %), in large plants and amongst intermittent workers. Males are five times more exposed than females, but they are much more numerous in these industries. About 5  million French people suffer from hearing disorders; 2  million of them are under 55 years of age. The Labour Ministry controls the occupational medicine services where exposed workers are subjected to a special check-up, which includes an audiometric examination at least every two years. But for the others, it is useful to know the danger signs of hearing disorders, like hearing fatigue (TTS), tinnitus or difficulties in understanding with background noise. Aging also affects hearing capabilities: this is called presbyacusis, which can be a confusing factor in the assessment of NIHL in older workers. In order to improve the protection of all workers in the EC, a recent European Directive will decrease the maximum level of tolerated noise (from the current 90 dBA) to 87 dBA before March 2006. In addition, the level at which a preventive programme has to be developed (hearing conservation programme) will start at 80 dBA instead of the current 85. The French compensation system for workers suffering from NIHL has also recently been modified. Such a modification will increase the number of compensations (probably by 4 times). The annual cost of the aforementioned compensations was 100  million Ð in 2003...|$|R
