40|$|Supplementation {{of various}} {{cultures}} of white rot fungi with tryptophan {{was found to}} have a large stimulatory effect on lignin peroxidase activity levels. This enhancement was greater than that observed {{in the presence of the}} lignin peroxidase recycling agent veratryl alcohol. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we found that tryptophan does not act to induce lignin peroxidase expression at the level of gene transcription. Instead, the activity enhancement observed is likely to result from the protective effect of tryptophan against H 2 O 2 inactivation. In experiments using a partially purified lignin peroxidase preparation, tryptophan and its derivative indole were determined to function in the same way as veratryl alcohol in converting compound II, an oxidized form of lignin peroxidase, to ferric enzyme, thereby completing the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, tryptophan was found to be a better substrate for lignin peroxidase than veratryl alcohol. Inclusion of either tryptophan or indole enhanced the oxidation of the azo dyes methyl orange and <b>Eriochrome</b> blue <b>black.</b> Stimulation of azo dye oxidations by veratryl alcohol has previously been shown to be due to its enzyme recycling function.

The current study showed a sensitive and effective method for removal of copper (Cu) from aqueous solutions using activated carbon (AC) modified with <b>Eriochrome</b> <b>Black</b> T (EBT). The AC was prepared from pigeon pea husks, since this is an abundant and inexpensive natural resource, using chemical activation with phosphoric acid solution (70 %), then physically modified with EBT. Surface properties of the AC-EBT phase were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and Fourier transmission infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The high adsorption of AC-EBT is due to the well-developed pores on the fabricated AC-EBT, which lead to high Cu uptake, and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 158. 73 mg g- 1 after 1 hour contact time. The experimental data fitted well to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Results demonstrated that AC-EBT would be a useful and valuable method for controlling water polluted with copper ions.
