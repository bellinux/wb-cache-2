30|$|Generally, {{different}} assessment {{models can}} be used in studies of seismic landslide risk. Among them, pseudo-static analysis, finite element modeling, and the Newmark model are often used to describe slope behavior under seismic stress. Pseudo-static analysis is useful in identifying yield accelerations and hence peak ground accelerations (PGAs) below which no slope displacement will occur (Seed et al. 1975). Because pseudo-static analysis provides only a single numerical threshold, many slopes experience transient earthquake accelerations well above their yield accelerations, but little or no permanent displacement occurs (Wilson and Keefer 1983; Jibson 1993). The clear mechanical concept of pseudo-static analysis encourages its wide use in engineering (Leshchinsky and Ka-Ching 1994; Ling and Cheng 1997; Biondi et al. 2002). Finite element modeling is a method that has facilitated very accurate evaluations of permanent slope deformations (Seed et al. 1975; Elgamal et al. 1987; Sun et al. 2013). These highly sophisticated methods require a broad spectrum of data of extremely high quality and density as well as intensive computing capacity, which is not always easily realized. Newmark’s method models a landslide as a rigid-plastic <b>friction</b> <b>block</b> with a known critical acceleration; when acceleration overcomes frictional resistance, sliding is initiated on an inclined plane (Newmark 1965; Wilson and Keefer 1983). Based on the calculation of cumulative permanent displacement, the analysis investigates seismic slope stability (Jibson 1993). Because the Newmark model yields much more useful information than pseudo-static analysis and is far more practical than finite element modeling, it has been used widely in both specific slope analyses (Jibson and Keefer 1993; Bray and Rathje 1998; Pradel et al. 2005) and regional landslide hazard assessments (Jibson et al. 2000; Del Gaudio 2003). Although seismic landslide assessment models can evaluate slope stability well, they cannot reflect trajectories of unstable rock masses and landslide depositional magnitudes, which are of great importance in determining the impact of a large landslide on specific infrastructure such as roads.|$|R

40|$|Within {{the past}} 20 years, {{a growing number}} of methods for the {{analysis}} of masonry vaults have been developed. However, most methods idealize the vaults as a system of many arches. This oversimplification could be admissible for barrel vaults and spherical domes under simple gravitational loads, but it cannot do justice to the three-dimensional effects developing in other types of vaults, especially in complex vaults without smooth and continuous surface. Moreover, although the results could be conservative for uniform load distributions, this model limits substantially the set of loading conditions that can be analyzed and hence provide an accurate assessment of vaults performance. To clear this limitation, this article proposes a tool for three-dimensional analysis of masonry vaults. Using the lower bound approach and taking into account the <b>friction</b> among <b>block</b> interfaces, the proposed analytical method may give a good indication of the actual surface of thrust within the framework of limit state analysis. Therefore, limit state analysis with finite friction is able to provide the crack pattern, the stress resultants and the horizontal thrust at the supports, important elements with regard to strengthening interventions. To show its simplicity and rigor, the procedure has been applied to pavilion vaults. The results obtained are validated by comparison with nonlinear finite element analysis and an application to a real case study is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of equivalents (DOE) allows courts {{to expand the}} scope of patent rights granted by the Patent Office. The doctrine has been justified on fairness grounds, but it lacks a convincing economic justification. The standard economic justification holds that certain <b>frictions</b> <b>block</b> patent applicants from literally claiming appropriately broad rights, and thus, the DOE is available at trial to expand patent scope and overcome these frictions. The friction theory suffers from three main weaknesses. First, the theory is implausible on empirical grounds. Frictions such as limits of language, mistake, and unforeseeability are missing from the leading cases. Second, {{there is not a}} convincing {{answer to the question of}} why the {{doctrine of}} equivalents, rather than some other doctrinal approach, should be used to overcome the frictions. The frictions can be overcome, or at least mitigated, for example, by astutely amending claims during prosecution; through a reissue proceeding after the patent issues; or through artful claim drafting as an initial matter. Third, proponents of a far-reaching DOE fail to pay adequate attention to the notice function of patent claims and are insufficiently sensitive to patent law 2 ̆ 7 s delicate incentive dynamic. We develop a better explanation of why claim breadth falls short of the maximum breadth allowed by patent law. Our explanation replaces the passive patent attorney depicted in the friction theory with an active inventor and attorney who are capable of responding effectively to the frictions mentioned above. Whether an inventor obtains the broadest permissible claim breadth depends mostly on the talent and effort of the inventor and attorney in identifying what has been enabled. A good attorney predicts the embodiments that could be chosen by infringers and finds appropriate language to draft a suitably broad claim. We call this process claim refinement, and we develop a refinement theory of the doctrine of equivalents. We justify the doctrine of equivalents primarily as a tool for promoting efficient investment in claim refinement. Although critics of the DOE contend the doctrine unduly inhibits competition, we show the degree of competition is often unaffected by the presence or absence of the DOE. The inventor can block competition in the absence of the DOE by drafting broad patent claims. The DOE should be used to avoid socially wasteful preemptive refinement. We reject the popular notion that the DOE is especially appropriate in the case of unforeseeable, later-developed technology. We reach this conclusion because in certain cases patent applicants can capture unforeseen embodiments at relatively low cost through clever claim drafting strategies. And in other cases unforeseen equivalents are unattainable no matter the amount of time and money spent on refinement efforts. In the latter cases, patent applicants would not exert much effort refining their claims to cover these equivalents, and inventor 2 ̆ 7 s incentives would not be much affected by a minute probability of loss of effective patent protection...|$|R

Our theory is validated through numerical simulations of spheropolygons with fractal Koch surfaces and is applied to the description of frictional properties of Weierstrass-Mandelbrot surfaces. The agreement between simulations and theory suggests that for interpreting macroscopic frictional behavior, the descriptors of surface morphology should be defined from the signature function rather than from the slopes of the contacting surfaces.

We idealize the frictional interface as a series of sliders that are being pulled from one edge under displacement controlled boundary conditions. The <b>friction</b> for each <b>block</b> decreases inversely with the block slip rate. The system response is governed by three parameters: the system elastic modulus, the loading rate, and the rate of frictional weakening.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{existing}} lower bound approaches for dry block masonry structures reveals {{a lack of}} reliable analytical methods applicable to most general conditions. Usually the analysis is restricted to cases in which sliding is prevented by high <b>friction</b> among <b>block</b> interfaces. This leads, for arches, to the well-known hinging mechanisms first {{discussed in terms of}} plastic analysis by Heyman (1966). However, especially for historic buildings the quality of the contact surfaces or of the binding materials might be deteriorated so as to substantially reduce the original friction coefficient. In addition, some particular shapes of curvilinear structures, e. g. flat arches, would never collapse unless sliding occurred. Hence the necessity of studying this group of problems under the more realistic assumptions of presence of sliding and absence of dilatancy. Herewith first is presented a proof of uniqueness of the solution for the limit state analysis of 3 D masonry arches, in the condition of axial symmetry of geometry and loading. This proof is crucial to the robustness of the results and allows a straightforward treatment of this class of problems as one of standard limit-state analysis. The analysis can easily be extended to barrel vaults, common in historic buildings and forming the structure of masonry bridges. On these assumptions a simple but very adaptable computer procedure, using a lower bound approach, has been developed for the calculation of the minimum thickness required to ensure stability for such structures. Parametric analysis shows how the geometry of the barrel vault varies depending on the eccentricity and inclination of the applied loads...|$|R
40|$|The Damen Twin Axe Fast Crew Supplier (FCS) 2610 is an {{offshore}} wind farm maintenance vessel that can safely and efficiently transfer mechanics between land and a wind farm. The thesis {{objective is to}} research the operational capability of the FCS by gaining insight into the push docking procedure of the transfer process. To keep the vessels bow steady and in position against the wind turbine tower during push docking, a fender {{is placed on the}} bow. Currently, it is not clear which phenomena play a role in making the fender stick or slip. This makes the fender a bottleneck in the relatively low operation profile, leaving room for improvement. In the push docking procedure condition, the FCS is pushed against the turbine tower using thrust generated by the drive train. The fender provides friction between the vessel and the tower. Disturbances by the environment, like waves, cause the bow to either slip or stick along the tower. An unexpected or long distance slip makes it unable for the mechanics to transfer from the FCS to the turbine tower. The objective of this research firstly is to gain insight in the interaction between the fender and FCS’s motion behaviour and its influences on the friction performance – the obstruction of the sliding motions between the fender and wind turbine. A second objective is to develop a prediction method to define safe transfer operations based on the fender-vessel friction performance in a yearly described sea – the operability. By use of calculations and simulations – in which boat, fender and environment are represented as real life components – two models are built that provides a description of the sea behaviour of the FCS and simulates the slick/slipping process of the fender against the wind turbine. In both models irregular head waves are described by a Jonswap spectrum. Model 1 merely represents the stick condition by using a frequency domain approach, in which the FCSs bow is ‘hinged’ against the turbine tower by springs in horizontal, (transversal) and vertical direction. Model 2 describes both stick and slip condition, describing the vessel motion interaction in the time domain. The fender is described by separate components, combining a ‘negative deflection’ based reaction force, a linear spring system and a (modified) coulomb <b>friction</b> <b>block</b> simulating the stick/slip phenomenon. Both models were validated in stick condition with results from towing tank tests. To define safe transfer possibilities, a condition check method judges the simulation conditions to be either safe or to be unsafe for transfers. With this the yearly ability to perform maintenance – operability – is determined. Based on the results of the sensitivity study, several influential design parameters can be identified. During stick conditions, in vertical direction a less stiff fender, higher static friction coefficient and increased thrust results in an increased operability. During stick and slip conditions, the thrust force has a major influence, higher thrust means an increasing operability. The dynamic friction coefficient is concluded to have less influence. The non-linear model causes the operability to be non-linear. In addition the operability is highly influenced by the simulation parameters (most important the friction slope) and the safety restrictions of the condition checker. These are both unknown but arbitrary chosen for this thesis. Therefore further investigation into these parameters is required to provide an accurate description of the yearly operability.

Reaction Wheel Pendulum or Inertia Wheel Pendulum as {{known in}} {{literature}} was first mentioned in 1999 by Prof. Mark W. Spong. In experiment, unactuated pendulum coupled to highly symmetric wheel {{driven by a}} DC motor. The unactuated pendulum is controlled by this actuated wheel. Actuation of the wheel creates angular acceleration due to torque generated by the DC motor. This torque causes the pendulum to swing up. Dynamic model needs to be obtained to control the system. In addition to this, advanced control methods such as feedback linearization, energy based control and hybrid control can be applied. Moreover, reaction wheel pendulum has non-linear property {{and it is an}} underactuated system. Thus, reaction wheel pendulum has been an attraction center in literature. In this study, general information is given about underactuated systems and the reaction wheel pendulum. Moreover, the literature investigation and general scheme of thesis are displayed in introduction. In second chapter, product design and manufacture are discussed. Later on, chapter three explains how to derive dynamic model of reaction wheel pendulum with Euler-Lagrange method that depends on system energy. Subsequently, control methods of reaction pendulum are given. Then, coorperating reaction wheel pendulums with elastic load is shown in future work. Finally, conclusion of this study is given. In introduction, basic information about underactuated systems, such as what it is and why it is important, is given. Besides, definition of the reaction wheel pendulum is declared. For instance, what the reaction wheel pendulum is, how it works and why it is important. Afterwards, literature investigations which give knowledge about control, linearization and stability analysis methods of underactuated pendulums are explained. First, swing up control with Lyapunov funtion is mentioned. Basic of this method is to select approptiate Lyapunov function. This selection is usually done depending on total energy of the system. Its aim is to swing up the pendulum from down to up equilibrium point. Second, some linarization methods are given for underactuated pendulums. One of them is a conventional method. With this method, dynamic model of the pendulum is linearized using Taylor series. According to this, pendulum can be controled in up equilibrium point. The other method is feedback linearization. In this method, proper output function is selected. Then, between input and output functions are looked for a relation with derivative of output function. When the relation is provided, feedback control function is generated to control pendulum in up equilibrium point. Third, stability analysis is exposed with Lyapunov function and LaSalle’s invariant stability analysis. They are given to determine system stability. Finally, schedule of thesis is found. In second section, manufacturing and design of pendulum are discussed. Pendulum design is done using CATIA, which is three dimentional solid modelling and analysis software program. First idea of pendulum design, is to have materials as far as light and durable such as delrin and aluminum. Therefore, delrin is used for wheel and pendulum arm. Alimunium is used for stable parts of pendulum. However, shafts are manufactured with steel. What’s more, detailed information about pendulum’s parts are also included in this section. To determine whether the pendulum parts can be manufactured or not, strength analyses is investigated using CATIA. Strength analysis forces are defined from simple dynamic model of pendulum which includes point charge and negligible rope. Point charge include all mass of the pendulum and rope lenght is the same as center of mass. Then, magnitudes of forces are derived with Newton equations. Pursuant to these forces, strength analyses are done with CATIA. Position graph is shown using pendulum’s dynamic equations. Related to the position graph, it is proved that the designed pendulum swings 2 times which is desired for this study to reach its up equilibrium point. These two approaches are demonstrated that needed pendulum can be manufactured. At the end of this chapter full product is presented. In third section, dynamic models is derived for ideal environment with Euler-Lagrange method. Furthermore, some advices are given about how to add frictions to the pendulum’s dynamic model using MATLAB-Simulink. Euler-Lagrange method is useful to derive dynamic equations of a system. It depends on kinetic and potential energy of entire system. In order to define kinetic energy of pendulum, moment of inertia, is necessary to be found out. After finding moment of inertia and energies, Lagrange function is able to be determined. Thanks to Lagrange function, Euler-Lagrange equation can be finally solved. The solution of Euler-Lagrange equation gives dynamic model of the pendulum. Whereby the solution of the equation, dynamic model is found. According to dynamic model, simulation is performed by using MATLAB-Simulink. As a result of this simulation, positions and angular velocities can be determined for wheel and pendulum arm. In {{spite of the fact that}} dynamic equations are determined for ideal environment, in practice, friction forces have effects over the pendulum. Therefore, some advices are given how to determine those friction forces. For example, if pendulum arm is free fell from 90 degrees, then its motion can be monitored via encoder. The plot of motion can be compared to Simulink Coulomb and Viscous <b>friction</b> <b>block’s</b> result, which is added to pendulum’s dynamic model. With respect to this comparison, Coulomb and Viscous <b>friction</b> <b>block’s</b> gains are able to be determined. Similarly, wheel frictions gains can be found, as well. Wheel can be driven until its maximum limit, after given energy is stopped and wheel can be allowed to free rotation. Then, plot of free rotation can be compared to dynamic model with Coulomb and Viscous <b>friction</b> <b>block.</b> In conclusion, block gains are provided. In fourth section, three different control methods and their hybrid control are mentioned. First of all, their aims are discussed. Two of three different control methods are to swing up pendulum from down to up right (unstable equlibrium) point. The other one is to balance pendulum in up right possition. Swing up control methods can not be used to control the pendulum in up righ possiton. Therefore, third control method which is known as input-output feedback linearization (feedback linearization) method is used. Before using feedback linearization, controllability of pendulum is shown via state-space model. To use state-space model, dynamic model is linearized using Taylor series. Feedback linearization method’s fundamental is to determine a suitable output function. Using derivative of selected output function, a relation can be supplied with input function. When the relation is obvious, then new control signal can be created which is used to control pendulum. Second, the pendulum requires Lyapunov function method to be swinged. This method is called as “energy based swing up control method” because system’s total energy is used in Lyapunov function. An appropriate Lyapunov function is selected as related to total energy of the pendulum. According to Lyapunov function, a control signal is selected to swing up the pendulum until up righ point. In addition, passivity of pendulum is explained to be able to use Lyapunov function. Third, the main control method for this study is given to swing up the pendulum. This method depends on switching the motor power. Pendulum is started with initial conditions with a maximum torque, it reaches to a maximum point and stops due to loss of energy. Then, the motor is switched to transfer more energy to the system. Hence, pendulum reaches higher point at the end of the first period. This switching continues until reaching up right position zone. The important idea is to stop transfered energy, when the motor is stopped, at right moment. Because of this, end swing angle and cut off torque angle are found. After determining control inputs of swing up and balance, their hybrid controls are created. Finally, these hybrid controls are compared. Fifth section is designed as future work. Cooperating reaction wheel pendulums are included in future work. Begining of the section, cooperating reaction wheel pendulums’ manufacture are exhibited. In product, there are two identical reaction wheel pendulum and their junction is supplied with elastic load. Afterwards, its dynamic model is derived using Newton-Euler approach which gives the same result as Euler-Lagrange with different way. This method is a suitable way for manipulator and it depends on force and torque balance of each link. Therefore, cooperating reaction wheel pendulums are modeled as a manipulator system. Then, its kinematic model is derived for each part. Related to this kinematic model, dynamic model is presented for ideal environment. Its simulation is performed by using the found dynamic model in MATLAB-Simulink and its result is shown and analysed. After, control scenarios of cooperating system are explained. In final section, general results of thesis are declareted and some control methods such as feedback linearization are compared to literature investigations. In addtion to this, general summary about the thesis is given. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} stress in the {{crust of the earth}} is of great {{fundamental}} and practical significance. No totally satisfactory method for measuring the complete {{state of stress}} has been devised yet. Despite this, many efforts have been made to measure this state of stress at different locations. From a compilation of many of the results, fifty which yielded the complete state of stress and in which one of the principal stresses is vertical, have been selected for a statistical analysis in an endeavor to define the nature of the state of stress in the crust. These data have been analyzed as a whole, and divided into three groups depending upon whether the vertical stress is the maximum, minimum or intermediate principal stress. Linear regression analyses of the values of half the maximum stress difference as a function of half the sum of the maximum and minimum principal stresses have been made. The correlation coefficients for these fits are 0. 786 for the data as a whole and 0. 848, 0. 790 and 0. 383 for each of the groups. Values of the coefficient of sliding <b>friction</b> between <b>blocks</b> of rock comprising the crust, interpreted from the slopes of these lines, ranged from 0. 625 (for those measurements where the vertical stress is the maximum principal stress) through 0. 427 (for those cases where the vertical stress is the minimum principal stress), to 0. 220 (for those cases where vertical stress is the intermediate principal stress). The 98 percent confidence limits for these values lie within + 19. 4 percent - 16. 6 percent...|$|R
40|$|Does legal {{investor}} protection improve efficiency {{in the market}} for corporate con-trol? To address this question, we incorporate financing constraints and legal {{investor protection}} into a standard takeover model. In the model, stronger legal investor pro-tection increases a bidder’s outside funding capacity. However, absent effective bidding competition, this does not improve efficiency, as the bid price–and thus the bidder’s need for funds–increases in lockstep with his pledgeable income. In contrast, under ef-fective bidding competition, the increased outside funding capacity improves efficiency by making it less likely that more efficient but less wealthy bidders are outbid by less efficient but wealthier rivals. Our model provides a novel rationale for the optimality of “one share-one vote, ” shows that margin requirements impair takeover efficiency while shadow costs of internal funds improve it, and makes empirical predictions relating the takeover outcome to, e. g., asset tangibility, financing <b>frictions,</b> firm-level governance, <b>block</b> ownership, cross-border M&A, and the security-voting structure. ∗We thank the Editor (Cam Harvey), the Associate Editor, an anonymous referee, our discussants (Au...|$|R
40|$|The {{lubricating}} {{effect of}} styrene-dimethylsiloxane block copolymer films spin cast on Si wafers {{was found to}} increase with increasing size of the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) <b>block.</b> <b>Friction</b> properties of symmetrical and close-to-symmetrical block copolymers were evaluated in contact with bromobutyl rubber in a plate-on-plate configuration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the copolymer films were all covered by an at least a 10 nm thick layer of PDMS. The lubricating effect remained constant down to a film thickness comparable to the chain dimensions of the copolymer, R- 0, after which it decreased progressively. At thicknesses below R- 0, the copolymer dewetted the wafer and formed discrete domains with sizes comparable to R- 0. The copolymer could further be blended with up to 70 wt % polystyrene without detecting {{a decrease in the}} lubricating effect. A mechanism is proposed for the observed frictional behavior where microflakes are abraded from lamellar copolymer surfaces and stick to the contacting rubber surface, whereafter lubrication may result from sliding of PDMS brushes against each other...|$|R
40|$|Spreading is a {{pervasive}} type of ground failure in subaerial environments, but its occurrence has hardly {{been documented in}} submarine settings. However, recent advances in seafloor imaging techniques show that repetitive extensional patterns of parallel ridges and troughs, oriented perpendicular to the direction of mass movement and typical of spreading, are widespread offshore. A spread develops via {{the failure of a}} surficial sediment unit into coherent blocks. These blocks are displaced downslope along a quasi-planar slip surface. Two modes of failure can be identified: retrogressive failure of the headwall, and slab failure and extension. Mechanical modelling indicates that loss of support and seismic loading are the main triggering mechanisms. The extent of displacement of the spreading sediment is controlled by gravitationally-induced stress, angle of internal friction of sediment, pore pressure escape and <b>friction.</b> The resulting <b>block</b> movement patterns entail an exponential increase of displacement and thinning of the failing sediment with distance downslope. A deeper insight into submarine spreading is important because of the widespread occurrence of ridge and trough morphology in numerous submarine slides, particularly in the vicinity of submarine infrastructures...|$|R
40|$|Robots {{based on}} {{parallel}} kinematic structures feature low moved masses, allowing for better dy-namic performance compared to serial mechanisms, eventually resulting in shorter cycle-times in handling and assembly. A {{side effect of}} this high dynamics is {{a higher level of}} vibration which has to be addressed in order to reach the full potential for short cycle-times. Some active measures for vibration-suppression were already presented previously. Another problem of parallel robots is a small ratio between working-space to installation-space. In order to overcome the problem (e. g. by changing configurations) specific components (e. g. joints) are needed. In this paper the use of an adaptronic joint with quasi-statical clearance adjustment integrated in the five-bar parallel structure is presented, addressing both vibration-suppression and configuration changes. Dimensioning of the adaptronic joint covers two aspects. Firstly increasing of <b>friction</b> up to <b>blocking</b> the joint in order to change configuration of the five-bar-structure. Secondly friction variation is used to optimize vibration damping and thus indirectly shorten cycle-times. First experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} idealized {{problem is}} intended to illustrate some basic thermodynamic concepts involved in kinetic <b>friction.</b> A <b>block</b> of mass m is sliding {{on top of a}} frictional, 1 flat-topped table of mass M. The table is magnetically levitated, so that it can move without thermal contact and fric-tion across a horizontal floor. The table is initially stationary, while the block has initial speed ui and slides to rest relative to the table. The block and table are inside a large vacuum tank, so there is no air resistance, buoyancy, nor thermal losses to the atmo-sphere. Furthermore the inner surface of the vacuum tank is a perfect mirror so that the tank does not radiatively exchange heat with the block and table. The block and table are homogeneous, both initially have temperature Ti, and they each have large ther-mal conductivities so that they rapidly attain a com-mon final temperature Tf after the block has come to rest. The specific heat capacity of the block is c b and that of the table is ct, and these heat capacities are assumed to be temperature independent over the range of temperatures that arises in this problem. (a) Find the common final speed uf and temperature Tf of the block and table. (b) Find the changes in the bulk kinetic energies K (in the center-of-mass frame of the isolated block-table system), the internal ener-gies U, and the entropies S of the block and table. (c) Discuss the first and second laws of thermody-namics in connection with these results. Solution The setup is sketched in Fig. 1.

40|$|International audienceThe auto locking {{structures}} {{are a new}} category of hybrid materials. They consist of periodic pavings of elementary blocks. The geometry of the <b>blocks,</b> the <b>friction</b> between the <b>blocks</b> {{as well as the}} boundary conditions applied {{to the edge of the}} assembly play a central role in the cohesion of the assembly. The effect of the boundary conditions has been experimentally quantified by performing indentation tests on structures built with cubic blocks made of alumina. The effect of the other design parameters is studied using two numerical methods. For the first method, a numerical tool that can simulate the behavior of interlocked structures built with cubes or osteomorphic blocks has been developed. This code uses the discrete element method. For the second method, the finite element commercial software Abaqus has been used to complete the results of the discrete element code. Then, the study of discrete element simulation brought to light the existence of a master curve that is similar to the experimental indentation curves. Therefore the indentation curves can be described by few parameters. The evolution of those parameters can be studied according to the design parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Spreading is {{a common}} type of ground failure in subaerial environments. However, this type of mass {{movement}} has hardly been documented in submarine settings. In this paper we show that spreading covers at least 25 % of the Storegga Slide scar area, a giant submarine slide located offshore mid-Norway. The morphological signature of spreading is a repetitive pattern of ridges and troughs oriented perpendicular to the direction of movement. Two modes of failure can be identified: etrogressive failure of the headwall and slab failure and extension, both involving the breakup of a sediment unit into coherent blocks. These blocks are displaced downslope along planar slip surfaces. Limit equilibrium modeling indicates that loss of support and seismic loading are the main potential triggering mechanisms. The extent of displacement of the spreading sediment is controlled by gravitationally induced stress, {{angle of internal friction}} of the sediment, pore pressure escape, and <b>friction.</b> The resulting <b>block</b> movement pattern entails an exponential increase of displacement and thinning of the failing sediment with distance downslope.

2500|$|Conventional {{ballasted}} tunnel-track {{was ruled}} out {{owing to the}} difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. [...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and <b>friction.</b> Reinforced concrete <b>blocks</b> of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|R
