30|$|Figure  8 {{illustrates}} the average query execution times on DG-SPARQL for 20 instances {{of each of}} the identified four query types on the DBpedia real dataset. In order to evaluate the speed-up improvement of query execution time in response to <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes (partitions), we have repeated this experiment three times using 2, 4 and 6 slave nodes. The results of the experiments show that the percentage of speedup improvement varies from one query type to another. For example, for QT 1, the query plan of this type of queries is translated into a single SQL query which is centrally executed on one of the underlying RDBMS nodes. Therefore, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> underlying slave nodes does not introduce any speedup improvement for the query execution time of such type of queries. Queries of query type QT 2 achieve the highest percentage of speedup improvement by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying slave nodes due to their distributed execution plans over the underlying RDBMS nodes. In particular, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 34  % speedup improvement while <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 59  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. Queries of query types QT 3 and QT 4 achieve comparable percentage of speedup improvement by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying slave nodes due to due to the network communication overhead and the post processing steps of their query plans. In particular, for QT 3, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 24  % speedup improvement while <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 43  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. For QT 4, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 25  % speedup improvement while <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 44  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. It should be noted that <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes does not necessarily lead to <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> speedup improvement on the query execution times as <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> relational-based sub-query plans can be less than <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave machines. In this case, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes does not lead to speedup improvement on the query execution time for this type of queries. In addition, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes leads to an <b>increase</b> in <b>the</b> overhead of the message exchange between the cluster nodes. This overhead affects having a linear relationship between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slave nodes and query execution time.|$|R

5|$|Core Design {{improved}} and modified the character with each instalment. Developers for Tomb Raider II <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> polygons in the character's model and added more realistic curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling {{as a new}} gameplay option, but the option did not appear until Tomb Raider III. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through the third game. For Tomb Raider III, the developers <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> polygons in Croft's 3D model to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted to reintroduce the character to players in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character's set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins {{as the voice of}} Lara Croft. By the time development for The Last Revelation began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a cave-in during the final scenes of the game.|$|E

Thus SAS was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9/MD-80 and instead <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> flights.
