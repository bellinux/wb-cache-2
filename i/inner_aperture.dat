This has been above alluded to as a feature of good construction, Chap. XI., § III.; it is to be noted now as one still more valuable in decoration: for when we arrive at the deep succession of concentric archivolts, with which northern portals, and many of the associated windows, are headed, we immediately find a difficulty in reconciling the outer curve with the inner. If, as is sometimes the case, the width of the group of archivolts be twice or three times that of the <b>inner</b> <b>aperture,</b> the inner arch may be distinctly pointed, and the outer one, if drawn with concentric arcs, approximate very nearly to a round arch. This is actually the case in the later Gothic of Verona; the outer line of the archivolt having a hardly perceptible point, and every inner arch of course forming the point more distinctly, till the innermost becomes a lancet. By far the nobler method, however, is that of the pure early Italian Gothic; to make every outer arch a magnified fac-simile of the innermost one, every arc including the same number of degrees, but degrees of a larger circle. The result is the condition represented in Plate V., often found in far bolder development; exquisitely springy and elastic in its expression, and entirely free from the heaviness and monotony of the deep northern archivolts.|$|E

Methods: Eye dropper bottle models, solution models (filtrate water/surfactant solution) and a dispensing time measuring apparatus were prepared to measure the dispensing time. Results: With filtrate water and pressure thrust load of 0. 3 MPa, the dispensing time significantly increased from 1. 1 &plusmn; 0. 5 seconds to 4. 6 &plusmn; 1. 1 seconds depending on the decrease of <b>inner</b> <b>aperture</b> diameters from 0. 4 mm to 0. 2 mm (P &lt; 0. 0001). When using the bottle models with <b>inner</b> <b>aperture</b> diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger, the dispensing time became constant. The dispensing time using surfactant solution showed the same tendency as above. When pressure thrust load was large (0. 07 MPa), the solution flew out continuously with <b>inner</b> <b>aperture</b> diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger and the dispensing time could not be measured. The <b>inner</b> <b>aperture</b> diameter most strongly explained the variation of the dispensing time in both the content solutions in the multiple linear regression analysis (filtrate water: 46 %, R 2 = 0. 462, surfactant solution: 56 %, R 2 = 0. 563).

The micromorphology and distribution of vestures is studied in 22 species representing all families within the order Myrtales based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Vestures are consistently present near the outer pit aperture of bordered vessel pits, suggesting the synapomorphic character of this feature for the entire order. It is unclear in which geological period this feature originated {{in the evolution of}} the pre-Myrtalean lineages. In some species vestures are associated with <b>inner</b> pit <b>apertures,</b> <b>inner</b> vessel walls, simple perforation plates, depressions of the cell wall, and bordered pits of tracheids or fibre-tracheids. A compact network of branched vestures almost completely filling the entire pit chamber is the most common vestured pit type in Myrtales, although considerable variation may occur within a wood sample.

The use of plate fins {{attached to the}} <b>inner</b> <b>aperture</b> surface {{is presented as a}} possible low cost means of suppressing natural convection heat loss in a cavity receiver. In {{the first part of the}} study a three-dimensional numerical model that captures the heat transfer and flow processes in the cavity receiver is analyzed, and the possibilities of optimization were then established. The model is laminar in the range of Rayleigh number, inclination angle, plate height and thickness considered. In the second part of the study, the geometric parameters considered were optimized using optimization programme with search algorithm. The results indicate that significant reduction on the natural convection heat loss can be achieved from cavity receivers by using plate fins, and an optimal plate fins configuration exit for minimal natural convection heat loss for a given range of Rayleigh number. Reduction of up to a maximum of 20 % at 0 receiver inclination was observed. The results obtained provide a novel approach for improving design of cavity receiver for optimal performance.

Its objective is to evaluate in a consistent way the potential of a class of solutions for the LHC low-β upgrades and help identifying {{what should be the}} R&D lines. The solutions studied are those of the present LHC baseline layout, namely quadrupole first and small crossing angle. Provision for dipole first solutions is included. The model tackles to the magnet layout, the beam optics, the beam-beam effect, the superconductor capabilities and the peak heat deposition in the coils. The approach is simplified to allow a gain by 6 orders of magnitude in the design/calculation time. The accuracy should be sufficient for the identification of the important features of the parameter space. The main results are: 1) a required quadrupole <b>inner</b> coil <b>aperture</b> larger than previously assumed, 2) the necessity to find simultaneously solutions for the upgrade of the triplet and for the minimization of the luminosity geometrical loss factor 3) a net global advantage of shifting the triplet by 4 meters towards the collision point, 4) the requirement to use the performance of the Nb 3 Sn technology (or equivalent) to increase significantly the LHC luminosity.

40|$|Energy {{access is}} {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} vital catalyst to wider social and economic development, which enables education, health and sustainable agriculture, and creates jobs. Therefore, sustainable growth and development in society needs energy supply that is readily available, affordable, renewable and efficient without causing many negative societal impacts, such as environmental pollution and its consequences. In this regard, concentrating solar power technology has great potential {{to be used for}} energy production and it is a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuel-based energy technologies, such as coal power plants, due to the abundance of solar energy as an energy resource, as well as its minimal impact on the environment. The parabolic dish receiver assembly is one such promising concentrating solar power technology. It usually consists of a reflector {{in the form of a}} dish with a downward-facing receiver at the focus of the dish. A cavity receiver is used to maximise the absorption of the concentrated flux. However, the receiver is subjected to environmental variations, as well as changes in receiver inclination angle, which lead to heat losses that affect the overall receiver s performance. The need for the commercialisation of economically viable parabolic dish systems necessitates further in-depth investigation into cavity receiver designs. As the cavity receiver plays a critical role in transferring solar heat to the engine, any heat loss from the cavity receiver can significantly reduce the efficiency and, consequently, the system s cost effectiveness. It is therefore essential to assess and effectively minimise heat loss in the cavity receiver to improve the thermal performance of the system, which can contribute to the commercialisation of this type of technology. The present study has therefore focused on developing novel approaches aimed at improving thermal performance for this type of concentrated solar thermal system through the reduction of heat loss in the cavity receiver. This research focused on the modified cavity receivers that are employed in medium- and high-temperature solar dish systems with operating temperatures of up to 1 200 K. Firstly, a three-dimensional numerical investigation was conducted on a modified cavity receiver to quantify the natural convection heat loss, and to determine the effects of the operating temperature, receiver inclination angle and aperture size on heat loss. Furthermore, visualisation results, such as temperature contours, were presented to gain insight into the effects of natural convection. The Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq fluid models were used in the numerical investigation and a comparison was made between them. Secondly, a novel approach of suppressing natural convection heat loss in a cavity receiver was investigated. The proposed model has not been observed in literature. A cavity receiver with plate fins attached to the <b>inner</b> <b>aperture</b> surface was investigated as a possible low-cost means of suppressing natural convection heat loss in a cavity receiver. Employing air as the working fluid, laminar natural convection heat transfer from the cavity receiver with plate fins attached to the <b>inner</b> <b>aperture</b> surface was investigated for a range of Rayleigh numbers, inclination angles, and fin heights and thicknesses. Furthermore, visualisation results, such as fluid flow and temperature contours, were presented to gain insight into the suppression of natural convection. In addition, a numerical optimisation tool was used to select the best plate fin geometric configuration that improves cavity receiver performance at minimum natural convection heat loss. Finally, a numerical study and optimisation of the combined laminar natural convection and surface radiation heat transfer in the cavity receiver with plate fins were conducted, and a three-dimensional simulation model was developed to estimate and optimise the convective and radiative heat loss. The influence of operating temperature, emissivity of the surface, orientation and the geometric parameters on total heat loss (convection and radiation) from the receiver were investigated. The results in steady state were obtained for a Rayleigh number range of 105 to 107. The overall thermal efficiency of the receiver was also analysed at different operating temperatures.
