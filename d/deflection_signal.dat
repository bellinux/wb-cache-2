50|$|A basic {{interpretation}} of PFM (which is generally accepted) identifies that two modes of imaging are possible, {{one that is}} sensitive to out-of-plane and one to in-plane piezoresponse, termed, vertical and lateral PFM (VPFM and LPFM) respectively. The separation of these components is possible {{through the use of}} a split photodiode detector, standard to all optical detection AFM systems. In this setup the detector is split into quadrants, nominally A, B, C and D. The centre of the entire detector outputs 0 V but as the laser spot moves a radial distance from this centre point, the magnitude of the voltage in output will increase linearly. A vertical deflection can be defined as {(A+B)-(C+D)}/(ABCD) so that now positive and negative voltages are ascribed to positive and negative cantilever vertical displacements. Similarly a lateral deflection is defined as {(B+D)-(A+C)}/(ABCD) to describe positive and negative torsional movements of the cantilever. So VPFM will utilise the vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> from the photodiode detector so will only be sensitive to out-of-plane polar components and LPFM will utilise the lateral <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> from the photodiode and will only be sensitive to in-plane polar components.|$|E

Using a standard Gaussian classifier we show, using both hand-picked features and ones derived from studies of rat vibrissal processing, that a robust rough-smooth discrimination is achievable without any knowledge of how the whisker interacts with the investigated object.

For sinusoidal heating, the wavelength of the acoustic wave in air with speed of 340 m/s is about several millimeters, which is {{much larger than the}} length of cantilever. Furthermore, experiments have been carried out under vacuum, in which case there are no air pressure waves.

In contrast to a quartz tuning fork sensor that consists of two coupled tines that oscillate opposed to each other, a qPlus sensor has only one tine that oscillates. The tuning fork is glued to a mount such that one tine of the tuning fork is immobilised, a tungsten wire, etched to have a sharp apex, is then glued to the free prong. The sensor was invented in 1996 by physicist Franz J. Giessibl. The AFM <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> is generated by the piezoelectric effect, and can be read from the two electrodes on the tuning fork.|$|E

This is either done by driving the sensor with the <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> phase shifted by 90°, or by using an advanced phase-locked loop which can lock to a specific phase.

50|$|Triggering allows {{stationary}} {{display of}} a repeating waveform, as multiple repetitions of the waveform are drawn over {{exactly the same}} trace on the phosphor screen. A triggered sweep maintains the calibration of sweep speed, {{making it possible to}} measure properties of the waveform such as frequency, phase, rise time, and others, that would not otherwise be possible. Furthermore, triggering can occur at varying intervals, so there is no requirement that the input signal be periodic.Triggered-sweep oscilloscopes compare the vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> (or rate of change of the signal) with an adjustable threshold, referred to as trigger level. As well, the trigger circuits also recognize the slope direction of the vertical signal when it crosses the threshold—whether the vertical signal is positive-going or negative-going at the crossing. This is called trigger polarity. When the vertical signal crosses the set trigger level and in the desired direction, the trigger circuit unblanks the CRT and starts an accurate linear sweep. After the completion of the horizontal sweep, the next sweep will occur when the signal once again crosses the threshold trigger.|$|E

The laser probe beam was passed through interface of cell membrane/culture medium of a cultured human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG 2. Deflection of the laser probe beam, which was induced by changes in concentration gradients due to the active materials movement across the cell membrane, was monitored. When a toxic hazard existed, a living cell {{was expected to be}} killed or injured, or cellular behaviors to be changed greatly. Then, the changing <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> from the living cell would become unchanged or altered in a different way. This was successfully demonstrated with cytotoxity of UV light and H 2 O 2. Most of the cultured HepG 2 cells showed changing deflection signals after 10 min illumination of UV-visible light longer than 370 nm, while almost all HepG 2 cells showed unchanged <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> after 10 min illumination of UV-visible light with wavelength longer than 330 nm. The results suggested that UV light between 330 – 370 nm could kill the cells. Additions of H 2 O 2 solution with different concentrations to the cell cultures caused the changing <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> from a living cell either unchanged or changed in different trend, suggesting toxicity of H 2 O 2 to the cells.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{based on}} theoretical simulations {{has shown the}} potential of the wavelet transform to detect damage in a beam by analysing the time-deflection response due to a constant moving load. However, its application to identify damage from the response of a bridge to a vehicle raises a number of questions. Firstly, {{it may be difficult to}} record the difference in the <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> between a healthy and a slightly damaged structure to the required level of accuracy and high scanning frequencies in the field. Secondly, the bridge is going to have a road profile and it will be loaded by a sprung vehicle and time-varying forces rather than a constant load. Therefore, an algorithm based on a plot of wavelet coefficients versus time to detect damage (a singularity in the plot) appears to be very sensitive to noise. This paper addresses these questions by: (a) using the acceleration signal, instead of the <b>deflection</b> <b>signal,</b> (b) employing a vehicle-bridge finite element interaction model, and (c) developing a novel wavelet-based approach using wavelet energy content at each bridge section, which proves to be more sensitive to damage than a wavelet coefficient line plot at a given scale as employed by others. ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>deflection</b> <b>signals</b> {{are caused}} {{not only by}} sample topography, {{but also by the}} thermal {{expansion}} caused by Joule heating. Since AFM has feedback controller with a bandwidth, for example 20 kHz (different AFM may have different bandwidths), the signal below 20 kHz is captured and processed by the feedback controller which then adjusts the z-piezo to image surface topography. Joule heating frequency is kept well above 20 kHz to avoid feedback response and to separate topological and thermal effects. The upper limit of the frequency is limited by the decrease of thermoelastic expansion with the inverse power of the modulation frequency and the frequency characteristics of the cantilever arrangement. A lock-in amplifier is specially tuned to the Joule heating frequency for detecting only the expansion signal and provides the information to an auxiliary Atomic Force Microscopy channel to create the thermal expansion image. Usually expansion signals approximately 0.1 Angstroms start to be detected, although the resolution of SJEM highly depends on the whole system (cantilever, sample surface, etc.).|$|R

50|$|A special {{high-resolution}} (around 800 lines) monochrome camera records high-contrast artwork. The {{image is}} then {{displayed on a}} high-resolution screen. Unlike a normal monitor, its <b>deflection</b> <b>signals</b> are passed through a special analog computer that enables the operator to bend the image {{in a variety of}} ways. The image is then shot from the screen by either a film camera or a video camera. In the case of a video camera this signal is then fed into a colorizer, a device that takes certain shades of grey and turns it into color as well as transparency. The idea behind this is that the output of the Scanimate itself is always monochrome. Another advantage of the colorizer is that it gives the operator the ability to continuously add layers of graphics. This makes possible the creation of very complex graphics. This is done by using two video recorders. The background is played by one recorder and then recorded by another one. This process is repeated for every layer. This requires very high-quality video recorders (such as both the Ampex VR-2000 or IVC's IVC-9000 of Scanimate's era, the IVC-9000 being used quite frequently for Scanimate composition due to its very high generational quality between re-recordings).|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} thrusts in {{proximal}} probe techniques is combination of imaging capabilities with simultaneous measurements of physical properties. In tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM), the most straightforward way to accomplish this goal is to reconstruct the time-resolved force interaction between the tip and surface. These tip–sample forces {{can be used to}} detect interactions (e. g., binding sites) and map material properties with nanoscale spatial resolution. Here, we describe a previously unreported approach, which we refer to as scanning probe acceleration microscopy (SPAM), in which the TMAFM cantilever acts as an accelerometer to extract tip–sample forces during imaging. This method utilizes the second derivative of the <b>deflection</b> <b>signal</b> to recover the tip acceleration trajectory. The challenge in such an approach is that with real, noisy data, the second derivative of the signal is strongly dominated by the noise. This problem is solved by taking advantage of {{the fact that most of}} the information about the deflection trajectory is contained in the higher harmonics, making it possible to filter the signal by “comb” filtering, i. e., by taking its Fourier transform and inverting it while selectively retaining only the intensities at integer harmonic frequencies. Such a comb filtering method works particularly well in fluid TMAFM because of the highly distorted character of the <b>deflection</b> <b>signal.</b> Numerical simulations and in situ TMAFM experiments on supported lipid bilayer patches on mica are reported to demonstrate the validity of this approach...|$|E

The result is the ERTM 2160 model (Earth Residual Terrain Modelled-gravity field with the spatial scales equivalent to spherical-harmonic coefficients up to degree 2160 removed). ERTM 2160, used successfully for the construction of the GGMplus gravity maps, approximates the short-scale (i. e., ~ 10 km down to ~ 250 m) gravity field in terms of gravity disturbances, quasi/geoid heights and vertical deflections at ~ 3 billion gridded points within ± 60 latitude. ERTM 2160 reaches maximum values for the quasi/geoid height of ~ 30 cm, gravity disturbance in excess of 100 mGal, and vertical deflections of ~ 30 arc-seconds over the Himalaya mountains. Analysis of the ERTM 2160 field as a function of terrain roughness shows in good approximation a linear relationship between terrain roughness and gravity effects, with values of ~ 1. 7 cm (quasi/geoid heights), ~ 11 mGal (gravity disturbances) and 1. 5 arc-seconds (vertical <b>deflections)</b> <b>signal</b> strength per 100 m standard deviation of the terrain.
