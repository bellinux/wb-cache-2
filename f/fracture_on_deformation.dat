40|$|Ductility is {{a measure}} of the ability of a material, section, {{structural}} element or structural system to sustain deformations prior to collapse without substantial loss of resistance. The Australian design standard, AS 3600, imposes minimum ductility requirements on structural concrete members to try to prevent premature non-ductile failure and hence to ensure adequate strength and ductile-type collapse with large deflections. The requirements also enable members to resist imposed deformation due to differential settlement, time effects on the concrete and temperature effects, whilst ensuring sufficient carrying capacity and a safe design. Current AS 3600 requirements allow a limited increase or reduction in elastically determined bending moments in critical regions of indeterminate beams, accommodating their ability to redistribute moment from highly stressed regions to other parts of the beam. Design moment redistribution limits and ductility requirements in AS 3600 for bonded partially prestressed beams are a simple extension of the requirements for reinforced members. The possibility of premature non-ductile failure occurring by fracture of the reinforcement or prestressing steel in partially prestressed members has not adequately addressed. The aim of this research is to investigate the overload behaviour and deformation capacity of bonded post-tensioned beams. The current ductility requirements and design moment redistribution limits according to AS 3600 are tested to ensure designs are both safe and economical. A local flexural deformation model based on the discrete cracked block approach is developed to predict the deformation capacity of high moment regions. The model predicts behaviour from an initial uncracked state through progressive crack development into yielding and collapse. Local deformations are considered in the model using non-linear material laws and local slip behaviour between steel and concrete interfaces, with rigorous definition of compatibility in the compression and tension zones. The model overcomes limitations of past discrete cracked block models by ensuring compatibility of deformation, rather than strain compatibility. This improvement allows the modeling of members with multiple layers of tensile reinforcement and variable depth prestressing tendons having separate material and bond properties. An analysis method for simple and indeterminate reinforced and partially prestressed members was developed, based on the proposed deformation model. To account for the effect of shear in regions of high moment and shear present over the interior supports of a continuous beam, a modification to the treatment of local steel deformation in the flexural model, based on the truss analogy, was undertaken. Secondary reactions and moments due to prestress and continuity are also accounted for in the analysis. A comparison of past beam test data and predictions by the analysis shows the cracking pattern and deformation capacity at ultimate of flexural regions in reinforced and partially prestressed members to be predicted with high accuracy. The analysis method accurately predicts local steel behaviour over a cracked region and deformation capacity for a wide range of beams which fail either by fracture of steel or crushing of the concrete. A parametric study is used to investigate the influence of different parameters on the deformation capacity of a typical negative moment region in a continuous beam. The structural system consists of a bonded post-tensioned, partially prestressed band beam. The primary parameters investigated are the member height and span-to-depth ratio; relative quantity of reinforcing and prestressing steel; material properties and bond capacity of the steels; and lastly the compression zone properties. Results show that the effects of the various parameters on the overload behaviour of partially prestressed beams follow the same trends as reinforced beams. A new insight into the local steel behaviour between cracks is attained. The deformation behaviour displays different trends for parametric variations of the local bond capacity, bar diameter and crack spacing, when compared to past analytical predictions from comparable studies. The discrepancy in findings is traced back to the definition of the plastic rotation capacity and the sequencing of the yielding of the steels. Compared to the other local deformation models, the current model does not assume a linear distribution of strain at a crack. The current findings highlight an important difference between predicted behaviours from different deformation compatibility requirements in local deformation models which has not yet been discussed in the literature. The local deformation model evaluates the relationship between maximum steel strain at a crack and average steel deformation over a crack spacing for the entire loading history. The total steel percentage, hardening properties of the steel and concrete strength are shown by the model to have the greatest effect on these steel strain localisation factors. Section analysis, as currently used in design, can be improved with the proposed simplification of the relationships to identify and quantify the effects of steel <b>fracture</b> <b>on</b> <b>deformation</b> capacity and strength. The numerical effort required to simulate the overload behaviour of practical beam designs with multiple reinforcement elements and a prestressing tendon are currently too great to be used in an extensive numerical study. The numerically more efficient smeared block approach is shown to accurately predict the ultimate carrying capacity of prestressed beams failing by crushing of the concrete. Consequently, this method is adopted to study the allowable limits of moment redistribution in the present investigation, Simplified relationships of the steel strain localisation factors evaluated in the parametric study of deformation capacity is used to predict maximum steel strains and premature failure. The limits of moment redistribution in bonded, post-tensioned partially prestressed band beams are explored by comparing the design load and predicted carrying capacity, for different section ductilities and design moment redistribution. In addition, the effects of different concrete strengths, up to 85 MPa, along with as three reinforcing and prestressing steel ductilities are quantified and compared to current Australian and international design requirements. Limitations in the carrying capacity are investigated for different reinforcement and prestress uniform elongation capacities. More than one thousand beam simulations produce results showing that current design moment redistribution and ductility requirements in the Australian design code for concrete structures (AS 3600) are sufficient for normal strength concretes (less than 50 MPa). A suggestion for design moment redistribution limits, section ductility requirements and steel ductility limits is made for members constructed from higher strength concretes. A special high steel ductility class is proposed for both the reinforcement and prestressing steel to allow moment redistribution in higher strength concrete. No moment redistribution is proposed for members reinforced with low ductility (Class L) steel. An increase of the current elongation limit of Class L steel from 1. 5 % to 2. 5 % is suggested to ensure strength and safety. An increase in the current ductility requirements from fsu/ fsy= 1. 03 and elongation equal to 1. 5 % to fsu/fsy= 1. 05 and 2. 5 % elongation for low ductility Class L steel is suggested to ensure strength and safety.

40|$|Physical model {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} by various researchers to investigate fault rupture propagation and ground deformation induced by bedrock faulting. However, the effects of pre-existing <b>fracture</b> <b>on</b> ground <b>deformation</b> are not fully understood. In this work, six centrifuge tests are reported to investigate the influence of pre-existing <b>fracture</b> <b>on</b> ground <b>deformation</b> induced by normal faulting in sand, clay and nine-layered soil with interbedded sand and clay layers. Shear box tests were conducted to develop a filter paper technique, which was adopted in soil model preparation to simulate the effects of pre-existing fracture in centrifuge tests. Centrifuge test results show that ground deformation mechanism in clay, sand and nine-layered soil strata is classified as a stationary zone, a shearing zone and a rigid body zone. Inclination of the strain localization is governed by the dilatancy of soil material. Moreover, the pre-existing fracture provides a preferential path for ground deformation and results in a scarp at the ground surface in sand. On the contrary, fault ruptures are observed at the ground surface in clay and nine-layered soil strata...|$|R
40|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (ISF) is a {{flexible}} process for rapid manufacturing of complex sheet metal parts. An advantage of ISF is the improved formability than traditional sheet forming {{processes such as}} stamping. A number of fundamental {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the enhanced ISF formability considering the effects such as bending under tension and through thickness shear. To further understand the ISF deformation mechanism and formability enhancement, this work presents a new analytical model which is focused <b>on</b> investigating the <b>deformation</b> stability and its effect on the metal sheet <b>fracture.</b> Based <b>on</b> this new model, the critical strain of deformation instability is obtained.

40|$|Around the {{perimeter}} of Antarctica, much of the ice sheet discharges to the ocean through floating ice shelves. The buttressing provided by ice shelves is critical for modulating the flux of ice into the ocean, and the presently observed thinning of ice shelves {{is believed to be}} reducing their buttressing capacity and contributing to the acceleration and thinning of the grounded ice sheet. However, relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the role that fractures play in the ability of ice shelves to sustain and transmit buttressing stresses. Here, we present a new framework for quantifying the role that fractures play in the creep deformation and buttressing capacity of ice shelves. We apply principles of continuum damage mechanics to derive a new analytical relation for the creep of an ice shelf that accounts for the softening influence of <b>fractures</b> <b>on</b> longitudinal <b>deformation</b> using a state damage variable. We use this new analytical relation, combined with a temperature calculation for the ice, to partition an inverse method solution for ice shelf rigidity into independent solutions for softening damage and stabilizing backstress. Using this new approach, field and remote sensing data can be utilized to monitor the structural integrity of ice shelves, their ability to buttress the flow of ice at the grounding line, and thus their indirect contribution to ice sheet mass balance and global sea level. We apply this technique to the Larsen C ice shelf using remote sensing and Operation IceBridge data, finding damage in areas with known crevasses and rifts. Backstress is highest near the grounding line and upstream of ice rises, in agreement with patterns observed on other ice shelves. The ice in contact with the Bawden ice rise is weakened by fractures, and additional damage or thinning in this area could diminish the backstress transmitted upstream. We model the consequences for the ice shelf if it loses contact with this small ice rise, finding that flow speeds would increase by 25 % or more over an area the size of the former Larsen B ice shelf. Such a perturbation could potentially destabilize the northern part of Larsen C along pre-existing lines of weakness, highlighting the importance of the feedback between buttressing and fracturing in an ice shelf...|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that most of the {{experiments}} <b>on</b> <b>fracture</b> <b>deformation</b> and fracture permeability under stress have been performed on brittle, crystalline rocks such as granite, quartzite, and marble. Studies on rocks showing some degree of plasticity, e.g. shale, are rare. Experiments of (Gutierrez et al. 2000) performed on Kimmeridge shale revealed irreversible, hysteretic fracture deformation under cyclic normal load. The fracture had nonmatching rough walls in that study. As a result, {{it was not possible to}} completely close such fracture by applying normal load. Even at normal stresses on the order of or higher than the unconfined compressive strength of the shale, the fracture permeability was several orders of magnitude higher than the matrix permeability of the rock. In contrast, experiments performed on an artificial, smooth-walled fracture using another shale (Opalinus Clay) demonstrated that the permeability of such fracture could be reduced virtually down to the matrix permeability by applying a sufficiently large normal stress (Cuss et al. 2011). The above two studies demonstrate the essential role of asperities in governing the mechanical and hydraulic behaviours of fractures in a ductile rock. It {{should be noted}} that asperities also have a significant impact on particle transport. In particular, surface roughness gives rise to hydrodynamic dispersion during particle transport in fractures (Bauget and Fourar 2008; Cumbie and McKay 1999; Koyama et al. 2008; Nowamooz et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Water {{flooding}} {{has long}} since been used to increase oil production from fractured carbonate reservoirs. More recently steam injection has also been applied specifically to enhance oil recovery from fractured carbonate reservoirs containing heavy oil. Production simulation modelling provides a method to optimise these processes. However, such models do not generally consider the impact of steam injection <b>on</b> <b>fracture</b> permeability {{due to the lack}} of a quantitative understanding of the impact of thermal and chemical processes <b>on</b> <b>fracture</b> <b>deformation</b> and fluid flow. To help fill : this knowledge gap, a series of flow, loading and unloading experiments were performed <b>on</b> <b>fractured</b> and un fractured samples between ambient and 90 °C. Loading fractured samples resulted in non-linear fracture closure. Unloading showed that some of the deformation was permanent. Fracture permeability was reduced dramatically as temperature was increased even when an unreactive mineral oil was used as the permanent while the confining pressure was kept constant. CT images showed that fracture apertures were dramatically reduced and contact areas increased during heating. The results indicate that this was caused by temperature weakening. Recirculation of reactive and equilibrated water through the fractures also resulted in a large reduction in fracture aperture probably as a result of dissolution and water weakening of the chalk. These thermal and water weakening effects have a far bigger impact <b>on</b> <b>fracture</b> permeability than simply loading and unloading the samples but are not accounted for in industry standard production simulation models. Finite element models, incorporating an elastoplastic constitutive model, were generated with <b>fracture</b> geometries based <b>on</b> the CT images obtained during the experiments. These models were able to reproduce the general behaviour of the fracture deformation observed in the experiments including both the nonlinearity and partial irreversibility of the process. These features could not be reproduced using a purely elastic model. The results are consistent with the idea that the contact asperities deformed by plastic deformation. These results suggest that the elastoplastic constitutive relationship probably provides a better tool to model the controls <b>on</b> <b>fracture</b> behaviour. Coupling this model with reservoir production simulation has the potential to improve the prediction of fluid flow in fractured carbonate reservoirs during steam injection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} {{is to provide a}} bounding estimate of how thermal-hydrological-mechanical (THM) behavior of rock in the region surrounding an emplacement drift in a Monitored Geologic Repository subsurface facility may affect the permeability of fractures in the rock mass forming the region. The bounding estimate will provide essential input to performance assessment analysis of the potential repository system. This calculation also supports the Near Field Environment Process Model Report (NFE PMR) and will contribute to Site Recommendation. The geologic unit being considered as a potential repository horizon at Yucca Mountain, Nevada lies within a fractured, densely welded ash-flow tuff located in the Topopah Spring Tuff member of the Paintbrush Group. Fractures form the primary conduits for fluid flow in the rock mass. Considerable analysis has been performed to characterize the thermal-hydrologic (TH) behavior of this rock unit (e. g., CRWMS M&O 2000 a, pp. 83 - 87), and recently the dual permeability model (DKM) has proved to be an effective tool for predicting TH behavior (CRWMS M&O 2000 a). The DKM uses fracture permeability as a primary input parameter, and {{it is well known that}} fracture permeability is strongly dependent <b>on</b> <b>fracture</b> <b>deformation</b> (Brown. 1995). Consequently, one major unknown is how deformation during heating and cooling periods may change fracture permeability. Opening of fractures increases their permeability, whereas closing reduces permeability. More importantly, shear displacement <b>on</b> <b>fractures</b> increases their permeability, and fractures undergoing shear are likely to conduct fluids. This calculation provides a bounding estimate of how heating and cooling in the rock surrounding an emplacement drift and the resulting mechanical deformation may affect the fracture permeability of the rock...|$|R
