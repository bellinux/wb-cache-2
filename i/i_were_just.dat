500|$|On tour {{following}} {{the release of}} Dog Beats, Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan, but were delayed by a blizzard. After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that [...] "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned"; they later learned that the concert was supposed to occur earlier in the evening, and that they were performing in the wrong building.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{agreed to}} what {{at the time}} was {{considered}} a controversial commercial sponsorship agreement with PepsiCo, which was later seen as helping {{to pave the way for}} other big money tours by other artists. For his part, Bowie recorded a TV commercial with Tina Turner to the tune [...] "Modern Love" [...] in May 1987 while he was preparing for the tour. The commercial had a short run, as Pepsi withdrew the commercial after Bowie was accused of sexual assault during the tour. Of the sponsorship agreement, Bowie said, [...] "We did a commercial sponsorship thing only for North America with the Pepsi-Cola company. As far as I'm concerned, what it's allowed me to do, having them underwrite the tour, is to be able to produce a far more extravagant show than if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> doing it myself. It means that instead of just having 1 or 2 sets I can have 3 or 4 sets made, and they can travel independently and they can be far more complicated." ...|$|E

6000|$|One night, when prayer meeting came out, Stephen {{stepped up}} to Prissy as usual {{and asked if he}} might see her home.

Prissy gave one scared, appealing look at Emmeline and then said, [...] "No, thank you, not to-night." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August, Maroney competed at the Visa Championships in Dallas, Texas. [...] She placed twenty-seventh in the {{all-around}} with {{a two-day}} combined score of 104.800 {{and third in}} the vault final with a score of 29.900. When asked about {{the first time she}} performed an Amanar in competition, Maroney said, [...] "The first time <b>I</b> did it <b>was</b> at Visa Championships and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> thirteen years old. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> really little and I didn't really know what was going on.

6000|$|The {{sergeant}} {{followed her}} pointing hand, and, as it happened, Lucille and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> passing beyond the rise riding close together side by side. Mackay looked steadily after us, and doubtless noticed that Lucille rode very well. [...] "I would not blame them. I'm just thinking I'm sorry for Corporal Cotton," [...] he said.|$|E

And so it had better be, please, {{as it would be}} if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> his common mistress. That will be {{perfectly}} all right for both of us. It was very good of you to come, though. Thank you--and good-bye." ...|$|E

60|$|But it was {{too much}} for our enemies. I cannot imagine that the Indians would have {{withheld}} their fire for so long, girls or no girls, had they not obeyed instructions from the whites who were with them. At any rate Jed and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> starting on another trip when a rifle went off from the Indian hill, and then another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, now, Zilla, Georgie and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> {{saying how}} hard Paul's been working all year, {{and we were}} {{thinking}} it would be lovely if the Boys could run off by themselves. I've been coaxing George {{to go up to}} Maine ahead of the rest of us, and get the tired out of his system before we come, and I think it would be lovely if Paul could manage to get away and join him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well, Dick; but I think that you and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as much frightened as the Spaniards were, when we saw how the thing had succeeded, and that all our troops were called out. There is no saying {{what they would have}} done to us, had they found out who started the report. The very least thing that would have {{happened}} would have been to be tried by court martial, and dismissed from the service; and I am by no means sure that worse than that would not have befallen us." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the best}} joak {{of all was}} at last. Singin, swagrin, and swarink--up stares came Mr. Dick Blewitt. He flung opn Mr. Dawkins's door, {{shouting}} out, [...] "Daw my old buck, how are you?" [...] when, all of a sudden, he sees Mr. Deuceace: his jor dropt, he turned chocky white, and then burnin red, and looked as if a stror would knock him down. [...] "My dear Mr. Blewitt," [...] says my master, smilin and offring his hand, [...] "how glad I am to see you. Mr. Dawkins and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> talking about your pony!

6000|$|... "I am a hop {{merchant}} myself, and as I have {{an income}} of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very countrified, considering {{that it is so}} close to town. We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at {{the other side of the}} field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.|$|E

6000|$|One day Mr. Dalton {{called on}} my brother-in-law, on {{a matter of}} business, and I was asked if I could {{entertain}} him awhile, until my brother-in-law should finish an engagement with another gentleman. I said I could, and took {{him up to the}} billiard-table. I had played with him many times at the club, and knew that he could play billiards tolerably well--only tolerably well--but not any better than I could. He and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> a match. He didn't know our table; he didn't know those balls; he didn't know those warped and headless cues; he didn't know the southeastern slant of the table, and how to allow for it. I judged it would be safe and profitable to offer him a bet on my scheme. I emptied the avalanche of thirteen balls on the table and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Markham, soothingly; [...] "he's ashore {{with the}} Padre, and {{everything}} else is all right too. But it's rather ridiculous to think that those idiotic Indians believed {{the only way they}} could show Mr. Hurlstone that they meant us no harm was to drag us all up to THEIR Mission, as they call that half heathen cross of theirs--for safety against--who do you think, dear?--the dreadful AMERICANS! And imagine all the while the Padre and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> behind you, bringing up the rear of the procession--only they wouldn't let us join you because they wanted to show you special honor as"--she sank her voice to a whisper in Eleanor's ear--"as the future Mrs. Hurlstone! It appears they must have noticed something about you two, {{the last time you were}} there, my dear. And--to think--YOU never told me anything about it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were talking}} of you," [...] {{observed}} the last, [...] "at {{the very moment}} you appeared. Ravensnest is now becoming a valuable property; and its income, added to the products of this large and very excellent farm {{that you have in}} your own hands, should keep a country house, not only in abundance, but with something more. You will naturally think of marrying ere long, and your mother and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> saying that you ought to build a good, substantial stone dwelling on this very spot, and settle down on your own property. Nothing contributes so much to the civilization of a country, as to dot it with a gentry, and you will both give and receive advantages by adopting such a course. It is impossible for those who have never been witnesses of the result, to appreciate the effect produced by one gentleman's family in a neighborhood, in the way of manners, tastes, general intelligence, and civilization at large." ...|$|E
