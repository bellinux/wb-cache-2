25|$|The {{abduction}} of D. Enkhbat from France in 2003. Allegedly, he {{was suspected}} {{to be involved}} in S. Zorig's assassination. Mongolia's Central Intelligence Agency abducted him from Le Havre in 2003, brought him to Berlin, where he was drugged and brought onto the regular MIAT plane to Ulaanbaatar. He was, however, not tried for being involved in the Zorig case. Instead, the authorities said they imprisoned Enkhbat because a <b>health</b> <b>certificate</b> that had led to a release from a previous sentence had been a forgery. Additionally, he and his lawyer L. Sanjaasüren were convicted of exposing state secrets in 2004. Enkhbat died on 22 April 2006. Ts.Nyamdorj (MPRP) was the Justice Minister in 2000-2008, 2008-2012. For his suspected role in D. Enkhbat's kidnapping, B.Khurts, who was a spy at the Central Intelligence Agency was arrested in the UK in late 2010. B.Khurts and three others of the Central Intelligence Agency were ordered and sent by then Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar (MPRP) to abduct D.Enkhbat from France. The Central Intelligence Agency is directly {{under the control of the}} Prime Minister. In 2010 B.Khurts was working as a high ranking National Security Council of Mongolia and on official visit to the UK then extradited to Germany in August 2011. Released next month, Khurts returned to Mongolia and became Deputy Chief of the Independent Authority Against Corruption in Mongolia.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{since this}} {{did little to}} reduce prostitution, Austrian laws changed to {{consider}} prostitution as a necessary evil {{that had to be}} tolerated but regulated by the state. In 1850, Dr. Nusser of the Vienna police suggested that prostitutes be required to register with the police, receive medical examinations twice a week, and obtain special <b>health</b> <b>certificates.</b> In 1873, Anton Ritter von Le Monnier, head of the Vienna police, reformed Vienna's prostitution law, and <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> have been obligatory since that time. Prostitutes who complied with the requirements of registration and examinations were no longer prosecuted by the police. A newspaper article of October 27, 1874 reported that 6,424 prostitutes had received <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> and were under observation by police and health authorities. According to police estimates, at least 12,000 more women lived on the proceeds of [...] "free love" [...] without being registered. Most of these were factory workers who received so little pay that they needed the additional income. Of the registered prostitutes, 5,312 were unmarried, 902 widows, and 210 married. The youngest was 15 and the oldest 47 years old.|$|R
2500|$|The city quickly {{recovered}} and defined an 1872 fire district requiring buildings to be constructed of brick. The {{remainder of the}} 1870s saw hard times for the city, including economic troubles during the Panic of 1873, and a yellow fever epidemic in 1878. Yellow fever affected almost 500 residents, leaving at least 86 dead, {{which resulted in a}} quarantine in the city. Rail passengers entering the city were required to provide a <b>health</b> <b>certificate</b> certifying that they were free of the disease. Many of the fatalities from the riot and epidemic were buried in McLemore Cemetery. Despite these early troubles, the town experienced an economic boom and entered a [...] "Golden Age" [...] around the start of the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSources of {{data used}} in France to {{routinely}} monitor vaccination coverage, {{such as the}} Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and school surveys, allow reliable estimations, but data are not made available with long delays. To rapidly identify recent changes, we have explored the feasibility and relevance of using vaccine reimbursement data. MethodsWe used the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries, {{a representative sample of}} the National Health Insurance Information System, which contains data on health spending reimbursement of {{the vast majority of the}} population. We first validated this new source by comparing measles vaccine coverage between Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries. We present herein the results on hepatitis B, meningococcal C, and human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) coverage. ResultsMeasles vaccine coverage estimated with the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries (91. 4 %) is very close to the estimation obtained through Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> (90. 6 %). For children born in 2011, hepatitis B vaccination coverage at 24 months of age was 88. 7 % for one dose and meningococcal vaccination coverage was 56. 4 % for one dose in December 2013. Of girls born in 1997, 20. 1 % had received the full HPV vaccination series on their 16 th birthday. ConclusionThis novel routine vaccination coverage monitoring tool provides regularly updated reactive and reliable vaccination coverage estimates in children...|$|R

30|$|Imaging {{platforms}} {{can easily}} become hubs for (potentially) pathogenic microorganisms. Several precautions help to minimize this risk. Animal facilities, and in particular, those transferring animals to others, should monitor the facility {{according to a}} list of specified pathogens and keep book in <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> [17]. Several organizations offer analytical services to test sentinel animals or excreta for contamination with defined microorganisms. Before exchanging animals between facilities, the <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> need to be exchanged, and only if the receiving facility’s negative list of pathogens is tested negative over a defined time period in the source facility/facilities, the animals can be transferred. Alternatively, and if infrastructure and risk assessment allow, rooms with differing hygiene levels or quarantine rooms can be defined and common instruments cleaned and decontaminated accordingly. However, it should be kept in mind that any infection or its treatment could affect the imaging results.|$|R
