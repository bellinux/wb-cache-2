5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded from doing so by his wife, who was a Campbell, and his neighbors. His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by the Campbell Earl of Breadalbane. Nonetheless, many MacIntyres were in the clan regiment of Stewart of Appin in the campaign of 1745–46, but they did not serve as an independent body.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> 300win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes {{in the game}} in {{the last decade of the}} 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.|$|E

The band's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has been inactive since the incident. Abbott and Zilla <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> band Hellyeah, and Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic.|$|E

5|$|After Kosovo's {{declaration}} of independence from Serbia in 2008, its broadcaster Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) applied for EBU membership, and wished to enter Kosovo into Eurovision Song Contest 2009. Kosovo would have made their Eurovision Song Contest debut in 2009 if it could <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> EBU. There is already a cooperation agreement signed between the EBU and RTK and the EBU supports the membership of RTK. As of 2013, RTK has observer status within the EBU and did participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011. According to the Kosovan newspaper Koha Ditore, a possible entry would be selected via a national final called Akordet e Kosovës, a former pop show that had been taken off the air some years ago.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, {{it is clear that}} Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in {{negotiations}} {{to portray the}} title role after a back-and-forth {{process in which the}} 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, Liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige. The next day, Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston, who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki. In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on. Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included. In July 2009, Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster. Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> cast in September, with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain. In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda, Stellan Skarsgård stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role. By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film. The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by Stuart Townsend, Hogun was to be played by Tadanobu Asano and Volstagg was to be played by Ray Stevenson.

5|$|Lance Armstrong {{was removed}} from the head of the list after having all seven of his Tour {{victories}} stripped when he was found guilty of repeated doping offences. Had his tainted Tour victories been reallocated (as were the victories of Floyd Landis and Contador) to the second placed rider in each race, Jan Ullrich would <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> list with 4 Tour wins. However, the race organisers ASO have decided not to reallocate the titles won in those years, in recognition of the historic doping problem in the sport at that time - Ullrich himself having been banned for a doping violation. Ullrich, therefore, has a single Tour victory to his name.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) has {{returned}} to his old job as regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch and announces that Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Ryan (B. J. Novak) <b>have</b> <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> sales team, retaining their old clients from the Michael Scott Paper Company. Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, to think of a way to get their clients back.|$|E
