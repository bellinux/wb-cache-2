(...) When we had the time to do it, that really lit a fire of creativity because it was something different. The idea of collaborating with a female voice and a different writer was what I needed, I guess, to create a bunch of new songs." ...|$|R

60|$|Any fair {{critical}} {{account of}} Dickens must always make him out {{much smaller than}} he is. For any fair criticism of Dickens must take account of his evident errors, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken account {{of one of the}} most evident of them during the last two or three pages. It would not even be loyal to conceal them. But no honest criticism, no criticism, though it spoke with the tongues of men and angels, could ever really <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Dickens. In all this that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Dickens at all. I say it with equanimity; I say it even with arrogance. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the gaps of Dickens. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the omissions of Dickens. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the slumber of Dickens and the forgetfulness and unconsciousness of Dickens.

What is there to be said about earthquake and the dawn? He has created, especially in this book of David Copperfield, he has created, creatures who cling to us and tyrannise over us, creatures whom we would not forget if we could, creatures whom we could not forget if we would, creatures who are more actual than the man who made them.|$|R

But enough of this. Mr. Leigh, you have done wisely to-night.

"You do not know, Beric, {{how often}} Nepo and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it, {{and how we}} have longed to see you, and I believe that what drew me first to Pollio was his praises of you. But before you begin {{there is one thing}} I must tell you. My father has {{received}} private news from Rome; there is a report there that the legions have proclaimed Galba emperor, and that ere long he will be in Rome. At present it is but a rumour, and of course at court all profess to disbelieve it, and Nero openly scoffs at the pretensions of Galba; but the friend who wrote to my father says that he believes it true. Now my father is a great friend of Galba's. They were much together as young men, and served together both in Gaul and Syria; and he feels sure that if Galba comes to the throne {{he will be able to}} obtain a pardon for you and those with you, since you have done no one harm save when attacked. He attempted to procure it from Nero, but altogether without success; with Galba it will be different, especially as a new emperor generally begins his reign by acts of clemency. Now, as I have given you my news, Beric, do you tell us, while we are eating the fruit, everything that has happened to you since I last saw you at that hut." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{while the}} {{plausible}} couple depreciate, {{they are still}} careful to preserve their character for amiability and kind feeling; indeed the depreciation itself is often made to grow out of their excessive sympathy and good will. The plausible lady calls on a lady who dotes upon her children, and is sitting with a little girl upon her knee, enraptured by her artless replies, and protesting {{that there is nothing}} she delights in so much as conversing with these fairies; when the other lady inquires if she has seen young Mrs. Finching lately, and whether the baby has turned out a finer one than it promised to be. ‘Oh dear!’ cries the plausible lady, ‘you cannot think how often Bobtail and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> poor Mrs. Finching—she is such a dear soul, and was so anxious that the baby should be a fine child—and very naturally, because she was very much here at one time, and there is, you know, a natural emulation among mothers—that it is impossible to tell you how much we have felt for her.’ ‘Is it weak or plain, or what?’ inquires the other. ‘Weak or plain, my love,’ returns the plausible lady, ‘it’s a fright—a perfect little fright; you never saw such a miserable creature in all your days. Positively you must not let her see one of these beautiful dears again, or you’ll break her heart, you will indeed.—Heaven bless this child, see how she is looking in my face! can you conceive anything prettier than that? If poor Mrs. Finching could only hope—but that’s impossible—and the gifts of Providence, you know—What did I do with my pocket-handkerchief!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{thought you}} were sure to hear sooner or later. I saw all the hands in the mill had got {{to know about it}} somehow or other, and I was sure it would soon get over the place; and I would rather that I could say, if any one asked me, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it to any one, and was in no way {{responsible}} for the absurd stories which <b>had</b> got <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> enough in Marsden, goodness knows, and it is disgusting that just as I should think they must be getting tired of the subject here is something fresh for them to begin upon again." ...|$|R

[...] "In fact, my struggle with depression as a student was no secret. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it in a widely-covered news conference as early as 1977, when I was in the South Carolina State Senate. Since then, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> often shared with appropriate groups the full story of my recovery to responsible adulthood as a professional, political and civic leader, husband and father. Teenage depression and suicide are major problems in the United States, and I believe that my life story offers hope to {{young people who are}} suffering with a constant fear of the future".|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think much}} about all this. Sir William Martin and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> much <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it; and the strong {{practical}} mind of the Primate, I hope, would keep me straight if I was disposed to theorise, which I don't think is the case.|$|R
6000|$|There that {{question}} illustrates {{the character of}} this man Douglas exactly. He smiles now, and says, [...] "Did n't they carry you off?" [...] but he said then [...] "he had to be carried off"; {{and he said it}} to convince the country that he had so completely broken me down by his speech that I had to be carried away. Now he seeks to dodge it, and asks, [...] "Did n't they carry you off?" [...] Yes, they did. But, Judge Douglas, why didn't you tell the truth? I would like to know why you did n't tell the truth about it. And then again [...] "He laid up seven days." [...] He put this in print {{for the people of the}} country to read as a serious document. I think if he had been in his sober senses he would not have risked that barefacedness in the presence of thousands of his own friends who knew that I made speeches within six of the seven days at Henry, Marshall County, Augusta, Hancock County, and Macomb, McDonough County, including all the necessary travel to meet him again at Freeport at the end of the six days. Now I say there is no charitable way to look at that statement, except to conclude that he is actually crazy. There is another thing in that statement that alarmed me very greatly as he states it, that he was going to [...] "trot me down to Egypt." [...] Thereby he would have you infer that I would not come to Egypt unless he forced me--that I could not be got here unless he, giant-like, had hauled me down here. That statement he makes, too, in the teeth of the knowledge that I had made the stipulation to come down here and that he himself had been very reluctant to enter into the stipulation. More than all this: Judge Douglas, when he made that statement, must have been crazy and wholly out of his sober senses, or else he would have known that when he got me down here, that promise--that windy promise--of his powers to annihilate me, would n't amount to anything. Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling? Let the Judge go on; and after he is done with his half-hour, I want you all, if I can't go home myself, to let me stay and rot here; and if anything happens to the Judge, if I cannot carry him to the hotel and put him to bed, let me stay here and rot. I say, then, here is something extraordinary in this statement. I ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement? I will ask my friend Casey, over there, if he would do such a thing? Would he send that out and have his men take it as the truth? Did the Judge talk of trotting me down to Egypt to scare me to death? Why, I know this people better than he does. I was raised just a little east of here. I am a part of this people. But the Judge was raised farther north, and perhaps he has some horrid idea of what this people might be induced to do. But really <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> this matter perhaps longer than I ought, for it is no great thing; and yet the smallest are often the most difficult things to deal with. The Judge has set about seriously trying to make the impression that when we meet at different places I am literally in his clutches--that I am a poor, helpless, decrepit mouse, and that I can do nothing at all. This is one of the ways he has taken to create that impression. I don't know any other way to meet it except this. I don't want to quarrel with him--to call him a liar; but when I come square up to him I don't know what else to call him if I must tell the truth out. I want to be at peace, and reserve all my fighting powers for necessary occasions. My time now is very nearly out, and I give up the trifle that is left to the Judge, to let him set my knees trembling again, if he can. set my knees trembling again, if he can.|$|E
5000|$|By imagination, Barlingay {{discovers the}} basic {{structure}} which {{gave rise to a}} particular concept and by critique he scrutinises his discovery for correctness. [...] "Systematization makes philosophy dead; insights keep it alive and make us dive in search of truth. I have, therefore, never attempted to systematize my thinking is just a case of wild imagination. But whether My thinking is correct or not, the procedure <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> is, I think, correct. This, according to me, is my method of analysis. It is neither conceptual, nor linguistic analysis in the strict sense of the term, although I do not discard the linguistic or conceptual analysis. I call my method of analysis ‘geni-analysis’ because in my opinion thinking is spread in time and the element of time or history cannot be completely discarded or ignored in philosophizing." ...|$|E
