Mr. Babbage and Sir John Herschel, on conjointly {{repeating the}} {{experiments}} in this country[A], could obtain the effects {{only with the}} metals, and with carbon in a peculiar state (from gas retorts), i.e. only with excellent conductors of electricity. They refer the effect to magnetism induced in the plate by the magnet; the pole of the latter causing an opposite pole in the nearest part of the plate, and round this a more diffuse polarity of its own kind (120.). The essential circumstance in producing {{the rotation of the}} suspended magnet is, that the substance revolving below it shall acquire and lose its magnetism in sensible time, and not instantly (124.). This theory refers the effect to an attractive force, and is not agreed to by the discoverer, M. Arago, nor by M. Ampère, who quote against it the absence of all attraction when the magnet and metal are at rest (62. 126.), although the <b>induced</b> <b>magnetism</b> should still remain; and who, from experiments made with a long dipping needle, conceive the action to be always repulsive (125.).|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{polarization}} of V atoms on Co(001) substrates within density functional calculations. For sub-monolayer coverage the coupling between V and Co is clearly of antiferromagnetic type whereas it changes to ferromagnetic coupling {{in the case}} of a full V monolayer on Co(001). The results obtained {{in the case of}} a sub-monolayer coverage are in agreement with recent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism by Huttel et al. [Phys. Rev. B 68, 174405 (2003) ]. The transition from antiferromagnetic coupling (in the case of sub-monolayer coverage) to ferromagnetic coupling (for a full monolayer coverage) is discussed in terms of local coordination numbers and V-Co hybridization. Comparison with Cr and Mn coverages on Co(001) complicates the problem: i) submonolayer Cr coverage stabilizes the antiferromagnetic coupling between Cr and Co atoms (like for V on Co(001) whereas a Cr monolayer on Co presents in-plane antiferromagnetic coupling; ii) submonolayer Mn coverage stabilizes now the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Co whereas a Mn monolayer on Co(001) presents an in-plane antiferromagnetic coupling.

Ferromagnetism is observed in all B-doped gh-C 3 N 4 systems. Moreover, a strong half-metallicity is achieved only in the ground state phase, i.e., BC 1 @gh-C 3 N 4, which results from a spin split of the non-bonding δ states of highly unsaturated 2 -fold coordinated N 2 atoms. The half-metallicity is lost for low B-doping concentrations. Thus, both selective doping and its concentration {{play an important role}} in <b>inducing</b> <b>magnetism</b> and half-metallicity. The half-metallicity in BC 1 @gh-C 3 N 4 can sustain up to 5 % compressive strain and 1.5 % tensile strain.

Among kinds of magnetic property engineering methods, doping attracts more attentions [18 – 28]. On the basis of previous studies, transitional metal (TM) atom doping can effectively <b>induce</b> <b>magnetism</b> into MoS 2. For example, magnetism is observed for Mn [18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28], Fe [18, 22, 24, 26, 28], Co [18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29], Cr [18, 24], Zn [22, 24], Cd [24], and Hg [24] doping. And the magnetic moment of the 3 d TM-doped MoS 2 increases with the d-band filling of the TM dopants [18]. Additional, spin polarization was found in MoS 2 with S atoms replaced by incomplete d-band atoms, such as Fe and V [30], and Group VA and III elements, such as N, P, As, B, Al, and Ga [28]. Moreover, adsorption of various atoms, such as H, B, C, N, and F, is also effective to turn MoS 2 from nonmagnetic to magnetism [31]. It is worth noting that no magnetism is observed in V-doped MoS 2 based on Ref [24], but according to Ref [18] and [28], V doping induces more than 1 -μB magnetic moments into monolayer MoS 2.

When one of oxygen atoms is removed, two electrons will be left and localized strongly at the f-level traps on two Ce atoms.

Lee and co-workers [17] examined the localization behavior of CeO 2 with various degrees of oxygen deficiency as well as the associated magnetic properties and their origins using first-principles methods in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP). Choudhury and Choudhury [10] investigated how oxygen vacancies and cationic Ce 3 + defects in ceria affect the band gap property by changing its structural regularity and then control its visible luminescence.
