25|$|Toxic effects {{occur with}} {{prolonged}} high intake. The specific toxicity {{is related to}} exposure time and the exposure concentration. A medical sign of chronic poisoning {{is the presence of}} painful tender swellings on the long bones. Anorexia, skin lesions, hair loss, <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> papilloedema, bleeding, general malaise, pseudotumor cerebri, and death may also occur.|$|E
25|$|Most {{patients}} (~90%) {{are diagnosed}} during the chronic stage {{which is most}} often asymptomatic. In these cases it may be diagnosed incidentally with an elevated {{white blood cell count}} on a routine laboratory test. It can also present with symptoms indicative of <b>hepatosplenomegaly</b> and the resulting upper quadrant pain this causes. The enlarged spleen may put pressure on the stomach causing a loss of appetite and resulting weight loss. It may also present with mild fever and night sweats due to an elevated basal level of metabolism.|$|E
25|$|GD type I (non-neuropathic) is {{the most}} common and least severe form of the disease. Symptoms may begin early in life or in {{adulthood}} and mainly affect the liver, spleen, and bone. Enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen (together <b>hepatosplenomegaly)</b> are common; the spleen can rupture and cause additional complications. Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive. Spleen enlargement and bone marrow replacement cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The brain and nervous system are not affected pathologically, but lung and, rarely, kidney impairment may occur. Patients in this group usually bruise easily (due to low levels of platelets) and experience fatigue due to low numbers of red blood cells. Depending on disease onset and severity, type I patients may live well into adulthood. The range and severity of symptoms can vary dramatically between patients.|$|E
500|$|Individuals who are {{homozygous}} for {{a specific}} mutation (K404E) or compound heterozygous with a null allele in CPOX have a more severe erythropoietic porphyria, harderoporphyria, characterized by neonatal jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, <b>hepatosplenomegaly</b> and skin lesions upon exposure to ultraviolet light. [...] HCP is a rare disease, but the exact incidence {{is difficult to determine}} due to the reduced penetrance of the acute porphyrias. [...] Overall, the incidence of all porphyrias is estimated at 1:20,000 in the United States. [...] The incidence of harderoporphyria is even lower, with less than 10 cases reported worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{infectious}} agents include cytomegalovirus, the {{herpes simplex}} virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. [...] Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, chorioretinitis (which can cause blindness), <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. [...] Microcephaly is a disorder {{in which the}} fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means {{certain areas of the}} brain have atypical calcium deposits, and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain. [...] All three disorders cause abnormal brain function or mental retardation. [...] <b>Hepatosplenomegaly</b> is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems. [...] It can also cause some kernicterus and petechiae. [...] Kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation of the skin, brain damage, and deafness. [...] Petechaie is when the capillaries bleed resulting in red/purple spots on the skin. [...] However, cytomegalovirus is often fatal in the embryo.|$|E
2500|$|Niemann–Pick type C {{has a wide}} {{clinical}} spectrum. Affected {{individuals may}} have {{enlargement of the spleen}} (splenomegaly) and liver (hepatomegaly), or enlarged spleen or liver combined (<b>hepatosplenomegaly),</b> but this finding may be absent in later onset cases. [...] Prolonged jaundice or elevated bilirubin can present at birth. [...] In some cases, however, enlargement of the spleen or liver does not occur for months or years – or not at all. [...] Enlargement of the spleen or liver frequently becomes less apparent with time, in contrast to the progression of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann–Pick disease, Types A and B or Gaucher disease. Organ enlargement does not usually cause major complications.|$|E
2500|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus can cause microcephaly, microphthalmus (abnormally small eyeballs), retinal {{dysplasia}}, <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> and mental retardation. [...] Both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia can cause blindness. [...] However, the most common symptom in infants is an inflammatory response that develops {{during the first three}} weeks of life. [...] Hyperthermia causes anencephaly, which is when part of the brain and skull are absent in the infant. [...] Mother exposure to toxoplasmosis can cause cerebral calcification, hydrocephalus (causes mental disabilities), and mental retardation in infants. [...] Other birth abnormalities have been reported as well, such as chorioretinitis, microphthalmus, and ocular defects. [...] Syphilis causes congenital deafness, mental retardation, and diffuse fibrosis in organs, such as the liver and lungs, if the embryo is exposed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{patients}} with a clinical suspicion for Tay–Sachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. [...] Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay-Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. [...] After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued. [...] All {{patients with}} infantile onset Tay–Sachs disease have a [...] "cherry red" [...] macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an ophthalmoscope. This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through [...] "red" [...] in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry-red spot is the only normal part of the retina; it shows up {{in contrast to the}} rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage. Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, Niemann–Pick disease, and Sandhoff disease), <b>hepatosplenomegaly</b> (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in Tay–Sachs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepatosplenomegaly</b> (commonly {{abbreviated}} HSM) is {{the simultaneous}} enlargement {{of both the}} liver (hepatomegaly) and the spleen (splenomegaly). <b>Hepatosplenomegaly</b> can occur {{as the result of}} acute viral hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, and histoplasmosis or it can be the sign of a serious and life-threatening lysosomal storage disease. Systemic venous hypertension can also increase the risk for developing <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> which may be seen in those patients with right-sided heart failure.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} types of Niemann-Pick disease in two categories. Patients with ASM {{deficiency}} are classified into type A and B. Type A patients exhibit <b>hepatosplenomegaly</b> in infancy and profound central nervous system involvement and unable to survive beyond two years of age. Type B patients also show <b>hepatosplenomegaly</b> and pathologic alterations of their lungs but usually without the involvement of their central nervous system. Some can develop significant life-threatening complications including liver failure, hemorrhage, oxygen dependency, pulmonary infections, and splenic rupture. Some develop coronary artery or valvular heart disease. In a longitudinal natural history study, nearly 20% of the patients died. For those classified into type C, they may have mild <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> but their central nervous system is profoundly affected.|$|E
50|$|It manifests with diarrhoea, <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> {{moderate}} {{lymph node}} enlargement without histopathological changes {{and evidence of}} the reticulo-endothelial system involvement.|$|E
50|$|Congenital {{toxoplasmosis}} {{may lead}} to hydrocephalus, seizures, lymphadenopathy, <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> rash, and fever. However, retinochoroiditis {{is the most common}} manifestation, occurring in 3/4 of cases.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{features}} include fever, irritability, feeding problems, anemia, <b>hepatosplenomegaly</b> and jaundice. Clinical features commence only after 3 weeks {{due to the}} protective effect of transplacentally transmitted antibodies.|$|E
50|$|Leishmania donovani causes spiking fevers, <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> and pancytopenia. It can be {{diagnosed}} though microscopic review by visualizing amastigotes in containing macrophages, and is treatable with sodium stibogluconate.|$|E
5000|$|...Letterer-Siwe is {{characterized}} by skin lesions, ear drainage, lymphadenopathy, osteolytic lesions, and <b>hepatosplenomegaly.</b> The skin lesions are scaly and may involve the scalp, ear canals, and abdomen.|$|E

50|$|A {{case study}} {{published}} in 2008 supported the hypothesis that eosinophilic cellulitis may also be caused by infection with Toxocara. In this study, the adult patient presented with eosinophilic cellulitis, <b>hepatosplenomegaly,</b> anemia, and a positive ELISA for T. canis.|$|E
50|$|Though {{caused by}} {{different}} infections, {{the signs and}} symptoms of TORCH syndrome are consistent. They include <b>hepatosplenomegaly</b> (enlargement of the liver and spleen), fever, lethargy, difficulty feeding, anemia, petechiae, purpurae, jaundice, and chorioretinitis. The specific infection may cause additional symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Stauffer {{syndrome}} causes abnormal {{liver function}} tests, {{especially those that}} reflect the presence of cholestasis, i.e. abnormal bile flow. <b>Hepatosplenomegaly</b> may also be observed.
