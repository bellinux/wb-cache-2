500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{on the high seas}} in the Caribbean during the 17th century during a {{conflict}} among colonists. When a major event occurs, Mike hears the sound of a typewriter in the sky. Mike's reality literally changes each time the author makes a change to the story. Mike realizes that during times when he hears the audible sounds of the typewriter, his actions and words are not of his own volition, and when such sounds are absent he is able to make decisions for himself. Mike {{falls in love with a}} woman in the story, and grows frustrated after realizing that she is just another of Hackett's fictional creations. At the end of the work, Mike returns to New York, and is left with lingering doubts whether he is still a character in someone else's story. He muses whether a [...] "typewriter in the sky" [...] is creating the world. Mike looks up into the sky in search of this mystical device or its controller: [...] "Abruptly Mike de Wolfe stopped. His jaw slackened a trifle and his hand went up to his mouth to cover it. His eyes were fixed upon the <b>fleecy</b> <b>clouds</b> which scurried across the moon. Up there– God? In a dirty bathrobe?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Forget for a {{few minutes}} that you are reading a copy of your evening paper. Allow your {{imagination}} to carry you to the gentle slope of a moon-lit Spanish hill. Before you rise [...] a vine covered garden wall, broken here and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored walls. [...] Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and soft, <b>fleecy</b> <b>clouds</b> are drifting gently with the breeze. Picture all this in your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the Spanish design is followed.... the designer of the theater has let his fancy take full flight. Here and there patches of red brick appear, as through [...] the plaster had fallen from the walls. A niche in the wall is cleverly adapted to hold a drinking fountain. The view from the balcony is even better than the lower floor. As in the lower floor view of the stage is unobstructed by pillars. he balcony being of cantilever construction removes the necessity of supporting it with posts and pillars which necessarily cut off the view of the unfortunate patron who is forced to sit behind one.|$|E

60|$|The phantom stooped {{towards the}} floor as she concluded, as if with the {{intention}} of laying her hand on the board on which she stood. But ere she had completed that gesture, her form became indistinct, was presently only like the shade of a <b>fleecy</b> <b>cloud,</b> which passed betwixt earth and the moon, and was soon altogether invisible.|$|R
6000|$|It {{looked so}} to me. [...] "Coasting along Tasman's Peninsula, what {{a shock of}} {{pleasant}} wonder must have struck the early mariner on suddenly sighting Cape Pillar, with its cluster of black-ribbed basaltic columns rising to a height of 900 feet, the hydra head wreathed in a turban of <b>fleecy</b> <b>cloud,</b> the base lashed by jealous waves spouting angry fountains of foam." ...|$|R

60|$|The river Hoogly. Off Calcutta. Tropical {{vegetation}} on the shore. Glittering sunshine on the water. Blue sky and <b>fleecy</b> <b>clouds</b> overhead.

60|$|It was innumerable islands; lifting {{themselves}} bluely {{through the}} azure air, and looking upon the distant sea, like haycocks in a hazy field. Towering above all, and mid-most, rose a mighty peak; one <b>fleecy</b> <b>cloud</b> sloping against its summit; a column wreathed. Beyond, like purple steeps in heaven at set of sun, stretched far away, what seemed lands on lands, in infinite perspective.|$|R

6000|$|The {{next morning}} the party, issuing from a narrow gorge, came upon a long valley, sear and burnt with the shadeless heat. Its lower {{extremity}} was lost in a fading line of low hills, which, gathering might and volume toward {{the upper end of}} the valley, upheaved a stupendous bulwark against the breezy north. The peak of this awful spur was just touched by a <b>fleecy</b> <b>cloud</b> that shifted to and fro like a banneret. Father Jose gazed at it with mingled awe and admiration.

60|$|Out of {{a little}} bank of white, <b>fleecy</b> <b>clouds</b> which hung down, here and there, from the blue sky, came the Black Dragon, her engines purring softly, her {{movements}} slow and graceful. Both men watched {{her for a moment}} in silence.|$|E
60|$|White, <b>fleecy</b> <b>clouds</b> {{were hanging}} in the air, and threw the dark spots of their shadow here and there over the landscape. But, by and by, the {{sunshine}} was where the shadow had been, and the shadow was somewhere else.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} and threw off his hat. It was {{delightful}} to feel the breeze upon his dripping face and {{to be out in}} the fresh air again. He had been at work for fourteen hours, and was aching all over, but that did not trouble him. The hay was safely in, and there was some satisfaction in the feeling that he had done his part in a heavy piece of work. Looking about him he noticed that the shadow of the firs had crept half across the clearing, and that thin wisps of <b>fleecy</b> <b>cloud</b> were streaming by high above their tall black tops. Then he heard Harry speaking to his father.|$|R
50|$|Whitaker's typical canvas {{depicted}} a meadowland near a forest, with a roadway winding over a hill. The skies {{tend to have}} white <b>fleecy</b> cumulus <b>clouds.</b> In the middle distance is often a twisted old oak tree. It might feature a shepherd with a flock of sheep.|$|R
60|$|Besides, {{the weather}} was perfect: argosies of <b>fleecy</b> <b>cloud</b> sailing slowly across a deep blue sky; a broad plain in all its spring {{freshness}} of color, picked out here and there with fruit trees smothered in blossom, and bearing on its bosom the passing shadows of the clouds above; in the distance the gradually growing forms of the mountains, each at first starting into life only as a faint wash of color, barely to be parted from the sky itself, pricking up from out the horizon of field. Then, slowly, timed to our advance, the tint gathered substance, grew into contrasts that, deepening minute by minute, resolved into detail, until at last the whole stood revealed in all its majesty, foothill, shoulder, peak, one grand chromatic rise from green to blue.|$|R

60|$|A {{pleasant}} salt odor of drying weed was {{mingled with}} the scent of the firs. In front of them a wonderful vista of white snow mountains emerged from <b>fleecy</b> <b>cloud,</b> and far beneath the silvery vapor appeared the faint and shadowy blurs of distant hillsides clothed with mighty forest. Overhead the big white sail swayed languidly to and fro, cutting sharply into the blue, and Frank felt {{that he would like to}} sail on like this for hours, lounging at the helm, and listening to the water as it slipped along the sides. With a light fair wind he could guide the boat wherever he wished by the slightest touch of the tiller, and it was pleasant to see how steadily he could keep her bowsprit pointing to a low rocky head that rose, a patch of soft blue shadow, against the evening light.|$|R
6000|$|Frank-hearted hostess of {{the field}} and wood, Gypsy, whose roof is every {{spreading}} tree, June is the pearl of our New England year. Still a surprisal, though expected long.
