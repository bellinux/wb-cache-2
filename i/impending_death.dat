40|$|Children’s {{understanding}} {{of death is}} likely to mediate how effectively they cope {{with the experience of}} the death of loved ones, {{or in the case of}} severely ill children, their own <b>impending</b> <b>deaths.</b> In order to develop the most appropriate forms of death education and counseling, developmental differences between children in the formation of a coherent concept of death must be understood. Research to date has mainly been focused on theoretical concepts instead of empirical research and indicates that mature concepts of death typically include four components: irreversibility, nonfunctionality, inevitability, and causality. This study found systematic differences in beliefs about death and afterlife both between ages and religious groups. However, much variation existed within each group. Overall, it appears that Hindus generally have more uniform beliefs than Christians. Also, Hindu beliefs are less varied among adults than among the two groups of children, while Christian beliefs actually seem to be more diverse among adults than children, perhaps because of the way adults interpret questions about spirituality...|$|R

40|$|In the HIV/AIDS literature, the {{tendency}} {{has been to}} avoid the agentive concept in favour of an emphasis on structure and subjectivity. Based on research with an HIV/AIDS project in Pretoria, South Africa, this article posits that examining how agency is locally conceptualized forms one route via which the notion may be plausibly inserted into {{the study of the}} pandemic. I evoke the figure of the ‘ideal agent’: the imagined AIDS sufferer against whose model actions those of actual AIDS sufferers are measured. Three stages emerge, the first characterized by victimhood, the second by moral transformation, and the third by the choice to ‘go home to one’s relatives’. In view of patients’ <b>impending</b> <b>deaths,</b> local knowledge regarding proper burial and ancestorship, and the limited resources of the project, the ideal agent suggests how AIDS sufferers’ agency is circumscribed and helps to clarify the volatility of the moral rebirth experience.

50|$|The film follows 18 {{individuals}} in separate but sometimes related {{groups on the}} campus of a Japanese university hospital. These groups include a mother and father of an unborn child; a group of friends during a dance rehearsal; staff at the university hospital and a team of students researching urban legends. Ostensibly, the plot is concerned with a mysterious outbreak resembling a viral pandemic which causes the film's protagonists to suddenly die one-by-one. It is suggested during the film that this is due to secret experiments being conducted by the United States Armed Forces in the hospital. However, rather than attempting to resolve the mystery of the outbreak, the focus of the film is largely devoted to the relationships between the characters and their reactions to their own and each other's <b>impending</b> <b>deaths.</b> Ishii has stated the film is made to show the absurdity of the characters not knowing when or why their deaths will occur and highlights the importance of drama and dialogue within the film, in contrast to his previous works.|$|R
