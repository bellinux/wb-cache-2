40|$|A 48 -year-old female was {{admitted}} to our hospital presenting with a chief complaint of progressive swelling because of diabetic nephrotic syndrome. Dapagliflozin seemed {{to play a role}} in accelerating the patient's urinary sodium excretion as well as reducing <b>gross</b> fluid <b>retention</b> despite the fact that her nephrotic condition was resistant to furosemide. Our experience emphasizes a potential novel approach to overcoming loop diuretic resistance using this agent among some subsets of type 2 diabetic subjects complicated with severe volume accumulation. We believe that combination treatment consisting of dapagliflozin and furosemide may produce diuretic synergy via sequential nephron blockade. The accumulation of more experience with additional cases similar to ours requires continuous and careful attention...|$|R
40|$|A 43 {{year old}} man with {{inoperable}} aortic coarctation and severe hypertension requiring near maximal anti-hypertensive treatment was admitted in severe heart failure. After 2 weeks of treatment the heart failure and blood pressure were incompletely controlled and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was started. Serum creatinine was normal before starting the ACE inhibitor and on discharge from hospital. The patient was re-admitted a week later with <b>gross</b> fluid <b>retention</b> and in renal failure. In the absence of alternative causes, a diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-induced renal failure was made and treatment was stopped. The patient required haemodialysis for 2 days and within 1 week the renal function had reverted to normal and has remained so for 1 year.

40|$|Haemorrhagic {{cystitis}} (HC) is {{an important}} complication after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Overt HC (grade ≥ 2, <b>gross</b> haematuria, clot <b>retention</b> and impairment of renal function), clinically more important than mild and occult HC (grade 1, microscopic haematuria), leads to substantial morbidity and occasional mortality. We retrospectively analyzed 32 cases of clinically overt HC {{from a series of}} 236 BMT patients. Significant risk factors included the use of busulphan during conditioning, allogeneic BMT and acute GVHD. Logistic regression showed GVHD {{to be the most important}} risk factor. According to the time of engraftment, HC could be divided into pre- and post-engraftment subtypes. Pre-engraftment HC was brief, not more severe than grade 2, and subsided with supportive treatment. In contrast, post-engraftment HC was protracted, often of grade ≥ 3, associated with severe GVHD, and required surgical intervention in many cases. Polyoma BK viruria, but not adenoviruria, could be demonstrated in both types of HC. The increased severity and association with GVHD of post-engraftment HC suggested that attack of urothelium by immunocompetent cells, possibly directed against BK viral antigens, might play a pathogenetic role. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Duplicate {{groups of}} 60 {{fingerling}} sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) weighing 0. 85 +/- 0. 03 g were given five isoproteic and isolipidic semipurified diets (50 % N x 6. 25 and 14 % ether extract on dry matter basis) containing graded levels of lysine and a practical (control) diet for 10 weeks. Fish {{were kept in}} twelve 60 - 1 tanks supplied with 2. 51 /min of sea water at a temperature of 25. 5 +/- 1. 2 -degrees-C and salinity of 34. 6 +/- 1. 6 parts per thousand. A basal diet was formulated so that the amino acid content, excluding lysine, simulated that of sea bass muscle protein. The diet contained maize gluten 400 g/kg, herring meal 100 g/kg and gelatin 50 g/kg and mixtures of essential and non-essential pure L-amino acids which accounted for one-third of the total amino nitrogen. The five semipurified diets were obtained by adding 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 g/kg of L-lysine HCl to the basal diet. By analysis of the dose-response relationship based on the growth data, the dietary requirement of lysine {{was found to be}} 21. 7 +/- 0. 10 g/kg diet (equivalent to 48. 2 g/kg dietary N x 6. 25). A similar value was obtained when the <b>gross</b> protein <b>retention</b> was regressed against the dietary lysine levels (22. 2 +/- 0. 25 g/kg diet). Growth, feed and protein utilisation of fish given the semipurified diets containing adequate levels of lysine were similar to those of fingerlings fed on the practical diet (P > 0. 05). The results indicated that sea bass are able to utilise successfully large amounts of alternative protein sources such as maize gluten, providing that adequate levels of lysine and other essential amino acids are present in the diet...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{emphasizes}} the relationship marketing {{stage of development}} within the banking industry in Romania, by identifying {{the extent to which}} business objectives and marketing strategies of companies are customer oriented. In order to achieve this aim a qualitative marketing research was conducted, by applying in-depth semi-structured interviews. The target group of the research consisted of nine banking companies, selected according to the market share, while the research participants were employees responsible for marketing, sales and customer relationship management activities. Due to respondents 2 ̆ 019 expertise, during the interviews could be applied mixed research methods in the process of data collection and subsequently, in data analysis. According to research objectives and results, although there is an increase in the importance of customer orientation within banking policies, the integration of relationship marketing optics at the institutional management level is facing a number of deficiencies, especially with regard to the concerns about employees 2 ̆ 019 satisfaction and loyalty or to the development of relationships with other stakeholders. The degree of satisfaction with the adoption of customer relationship management technology is relatively high among banks, being appreciated mainly those banking performance achieved in terms of retention rate, cross-selling and customer satisfaction. Most banks use the <b>gross</b> customer <b>retention</b> index as the main indicator of customer portfolio stability, although retention objectives tend to be set differently depending on customer value. Internal marketing strategies are developed around staff training processes, while performance evaluation criteria are rather specific to a transactional marketing approach. Results of the research provide clues on the relationship marketing processes and activities that need to be improved, in order to strengthen the current customer base and the competitive position in the banking industry...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that a positive correlation exists between clinical knowledge and retained concepts in basic sciences. Studies have demonstrated a modest attrition of anatomy knowledge over time, which {{may be influenced by}} students' perceived importance of the basic sciences and the learning styles adopted. The aims of this study were to: (1) conduct a cross-sectional evaluation of the retention of anatomical knowledge in preclinical (second-year) and clinical (fifth-year) chiropractic students at Murdoch University; and (2) examine students' perceptions of factors that may influence their anatomy knowledge retention. Second- and fifth-year chiropractic students at Murdoch University were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Ninety-one students voluntarily participated. The Carpal Bone Test, previously utilized to determine the retention of anatomical knowledge, was utilized to determine the extent to which participants retained gross anatomy knowledge. Participants also completed a questionnaire specifically designed to identify the factors that may have influenced their <b>retention</b> of <b>gross</b> anatomy knowledge. A two-sided Pearson chi-square test of association was used to ascertain statistically significant differences in carpal bone retention and students' responses between the two cohorts. Seventy percent of the fifth-year (clinical) chiropractic students correctly identified all eight carpal bones compared to only six percent of second-year chiropractic students. The majority of participants in both cohorts believed that gross anatomy knowledge is of clinical importance. The use of mnemonics and the clinical application of anatomy knowledge were identified as factors that significantly influenced participants' <b>gross</b> anatomy knowledge <b>retention</b> within this study...|$|R

Treatments for both experiments were: 1) soybean meal; 2) +K roasted; 3) +K extruded; 4) -K roasted; and 5) -K extruded. The roasting and extrusion treatments were accomplished with a Roast-A-Tron 8 roaster and an InstaPr 0 8 extruder. Diets were the soybean preparations (96. 5 % of the diet) with only vitamins and minerals added as needed to meet or exceed NRC requirements. Daily feed allowance was 5 % of initial body wt given as three equal meals. In Exp. I, 50 weanling pigs (10. 4 Ib average body wt and 21 d average age) were used. Apparent values for N digestibility, biological value (BV), percentage N <b>retention,</b> <b>gross</b> energy (GE) digestibility, and metabolizable energy (ME) were greater for pigs fed extruded soybeans compared to pigs fed roasted soybeans. Also, N digestibility, BV, and percentage N retention were greater for pigs fed -K soybeans compared to those fed + K soybeans. In Exp. 2, 40 pigs (21. 4 lb average body wt and 35 d average age) were allowed to adjust to the nursery environment before use in the experiment. In general, the pigs in Exp. 2 (Le., the older pigs) had greater utilization of nutrients from all of the soybean products than the younger pigs used in Exp. 1. Digestibilities of OM, N, and GE were greater for pigs fed -K soybeans compared to those fed + K soybeans, and extruded soybeans gave greater digestibilities of OM, N, and GE compared to roasted soybeans. Also, percentage N retention and percentage ME were greater for pigs fed extruded soybeans were greater than for pigs fed roasted soybeans. In conclusion, extruded and -K soybeans were of greater nutritional value than roasted and + K soybeans for 10 - and 20 -lb nursery pigs...|$|R

40|$|Changes in soil N-cycling and {{retention}} processes in subtropical/tropical acidic forest ecosystems under anthropogenic N inputs {{are not well}} understood. We conducted a laboratory N- 15 tracing study on an acid soil (pH values: 4. 6 to 5. 0) from a subtropical forest fertilized for more than 2. 5 years {{at a rate of}} 0, 40, and 120 kg NH 4 Cl-N ha(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively. To get a better resolution of mechanistic changes in soil N cycling {{and retention}} processes under NHS additions, we used a conceptual N- 15 tracing model to quantify process-specific and pool-specific N transformation rates in soils. Gross N mineralization rates decreased at high NH 4 + additions, which were paralleled by a reduction in fungal biomass and mineralization of recalcitrant organic N. Gross NHS immobilization rates did not show a change with increasing NH 4 + additions. Interestingly, soil NO 3 - production (heterotrophic, autotrophic, and <b>gross</b> nitrification) and <b>retention</b> (NO 3 - immobilization and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium) showed insensitivity to increasing additions of NH 4 +. The mechanisms behind the lack of response of heterotrophic nitrification were unclear, but possibly related to the absence of significant changes in soil C:N ratio and soil acidity under increased NH 4 + additions. Because of the low autotrophic nitrification potential and the lack of NH 4 + limitation to autotrophic nitrifiers, autotrophic nitrification was unresponsive to NH 4 + additions. NO 3 - immobilization rates appeared to be controlled by the NO 3 - produced from heterotrophic nitrification, as indicated by the positive relationship between NO 3 - immobilization and heterotrophic nitrification (R- 2 = 0. 59, p = 0. 015), thus showing a lack of a change under increased NH 4 + additions. DNRA seemed to be inherently less responsive to environmental changes such as NH 4 + deposition. Our work demonstrates that enhanced NH 4 + deposition has a low potential to stimulate soil NO 3 - production and weaken soil retention of NO 3 - in this, and perhaps other subtropical/tropical acidic forest ecosystems.
