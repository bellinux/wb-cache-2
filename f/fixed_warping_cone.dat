40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{expanders}} arising as increasing sequences of level sets of <b>warped</b> <b>cones,</b> as introduced by the second-named author, do not coarsely embed into a Banach space {{as soon as the}} corresponding <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> does not coarsely embed into this Banach space. Combining this with non-embeddability results for <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> by Nowak and Sawicki, which relate the non-embeddability of a <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> to a spectral gap property of the underlying action, we provide new examples of expanders that do not coarsely embed into any Banach space with nontrivial type. Moreover, we prove that these expanders are not coarsely equivalent to a Lafforgue expander. In particular, we provide infinitely many coarsely distinct superexpanders that are not Lafforgue expanders. In addition, we prove a quasi-isometric rigidity result for <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> Comment: 16 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} metric {{spaces that}} do not have property A yet are coarsely embeddable into the Hilbert space. Our examples are so called <b>warped</b> <b>cones,</b> which were introduced by J. Roe to serve as examples of spaces non-embeddable into a Hilbert space and with or without property A. The construction provides the first examples of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> combining coarse embeddability and lack of property A. We also construct <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> over manifolds with isometrically embedded expanders and generalise Roe's criteria for the lack of property A or coarse embeddability of a <b>warped</b> <b>cone.</b> Along the way, it is proven that property A of the <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> over a profinite completion is equivalent to amenability of the group.

40|$|We {{prove that}} if a quasi-isometry of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> is induced by a map between the base spaces of the cones, the actions must be {{conjugate}} by this map. The converse is false in general, conjugacy of actions is not sufficient for quasi-isometry of the respective <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> For a general quasi-isometry of <b>warped</b> <b>cones,</b> using the asymptotically faithful covering constructed in a previous work with Jianchao Wu, we deduce that the two groups are quasi-isometric after taking Cartesian products with suitable powers of the integers. Secondly, we characterise geometric properties of a group (coarse embeddability into Banach spaces, asymptotic dimension, property A) by properties of the <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> over an action of this group. These results apply to arbitrary asymptotically faithful coverings, in particular to box spaces. As an application, we calculate the asymptotic dimension of a <b>warped</b> <b>cone</b> and improve bounds by Szabo, Wu, and Zacharias and by Bartels on the amenability dimension of actions of virtually nilpotent groups. In the appendix, we justify optimality of our result on general quasi-isometries by showing that quasi-isometric <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> need not come from quasi-isometric groups, contrary {{to the case of}} box spaces.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{geometry}} of <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> over free, minimal isometric group actions and related constructions of expander graphs. We prove a rigidity theorem for the coarse geometry of such warped cones: Namely, if a group has no abelian factors, then two such <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> are quasi-isometric {{if and only if}} the actions are finite covers of conjugate actions. As a consequence, we produce continuous families of non-quasi-isometric expanders and superexpanders.

We explain the interplay between the existence of spectral gaps and that of Kazhdan projections. Our methods employ Markov operators associated to a random walk on the group, for which we provide new norm estimates and convergence results. They exhibit useful properties and flexibility, and allow to view Kazhdan projections in Banach spaces as natural objects associated to random walks on groups. We give a number of applications of these results. In particular, we address several open questions. We give a direct comparison of properties $(TE) $ and $FE$ with Lafforgueandapos;s reinforced Banach property $(T) $; we obtain shrinking target theorems for orbits of Kazhdan groups; finally, answering a question of Willett and Yu we construct non-compact ghost projections for <b>warped</b> <b>cones.</b> In this last case we conjecture that such <b>warped</b> <b>cones</b> provide counterexamples to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture...|$|R

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{long-term}} behavior of the concrete, a model for analyzing the shear-lag effect in composite beams with flexible shear connection is proposed. By assuming the slab loss of planarity described by a <b>fixed</b> <b>warping</b> function, the linear kinematics of the composite beam is expressed by means of four unknown functions: the vertical displacement of the whole cross section; the axial displacements of the concrete slab and of the steel beam; {{and the intensity of}} the warping (shear-lag function). A variational balance condition is imposed by the virtual work theorem for three-dimensional bodies, from which the local formulation of the problem, which involves four equilibrium equations with the relevant boundary conditions, is achieved. The assumptions of linear elastic behavior for the steel beam and the shear connection and of linear viscoelastic behavior for the concrete slab lead to an integral-differential type system, which is numerically integrated. The numerical procedure, based on the step-by-step general method and the finite-difference method, is illustrated and applied to an example of practical interest...|$|R
40|$|The inner {{region of}} the {{accretion}} disk around a magnetized star (T Tauri star, white dwarf or neutron star) is subjected to magnetic torques that induce warping and precession of the disk. These torques arise from {{the interaction between the}} stellar field and the induced electric currents in the disk. We carry out numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of warped, viscous accretion disks driven by the magnetic torques. We show that the disk can develop into a highly warped steady state in which the disk attains a <b>fixed</b> (<b>warped)</b> shape and precesses rigidly. The warp is most pronounced at the disk inner radius (near the magnetosphere boundary). As the system parameters (such as accretion rate) change, the disk can switch between a completely flat state (warping stable) and a highly warped state. The precession of warped disks may be responsible for a variety of quasi-periodic oscillations or radiation flux variabilities observed in many different systems, including young stellar objects and X-ray binaries.

We analyze whether the forces, induced by moduli stabilization and acting on the D 3 -brane, might cancel by fine-tuning such as to leave us with the original Coulomb attraction of the anti D 3 -brane as the driving force for inflation. For a large class of D 7 -brane embeddings we obtain a negative result. Cancelations are possible only for very small intervals of ϕ around an inflection point but not globally. For the most part of its motion the inflaton then feels a steep, non slow-roll potential. We study the inflationary dynamics induced by this potential. Comment: 34 pages, 4 figures.

Beginning {{with the development of}} the electrospinning method, English physicist William Gilbert (1544-1603) first documented the electrostatic attraction between liquids by preparing an experiment in which he observed a spherical water drop on a dry surface <b>warp</b> into a <b>cone</b> shape when it was held below an electrically charged amber. This deformation later {{came to be known as}} the Taylor cone. In 1882, English physicist Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919) analyzed the unstable states of liquid droplets that were electrically charged, and noted that the liquid was ejected in tiny jets when equilibrium was established between the surface tension and electrostatic force. In 1887, British physicist Charles Vernon Boys (1855-1944) published a manuscript about nanofiber development and production. In 1900, American inventor John Francis Cooley (1861-1903) filed the first modern electrospinning patent.|$|R

Such a scenario can address both the gauge hierarchy as well as fermion mass hierarchy problem in standard model.

40|$|We have {{surveyed}} the in-plane transport {{properties of the}} graphene twist bilayer using (i) a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for the underlying electronic structure, (ii) an isotropic elastic phonon model, and (iii) the linear Boltzmann equation for elastic electron-phonon scattering. We find that transport in the twist bilayer is profoundly sensitive to the rotation angle of the constituent layers. Similar to the electronic structure of the twist bilayer the transport is qualitatively different in three distinct angle regimes. At large angles (θ > ≈ 10 ^∘) and at temperatures below an interlayer Bloch-Grüneisen temperature of ≈ 10 K the conductivity is independent of the twist angle i. e. the layers are fully decoupled. Above this temperature the layers, even though decoupled in the ground state, are re-coupled by electron-phonon scattering and the transport is different both from single layer graphene {{as well as the}} Bernal bilayer. In the small angle regime θ < ≈ 2 ^∘ the conductivity drops by two orders of magnitude and develops a rich energy dependence, reflecting the complexity of the underlying topological changes (Lifshitz transitions) of the Fermi surface. At intermediate angles the conductivity decreases continuously as the twist angle is reduced, while the energy dependence of the conductivity presents two sharp transitions, that occur at specific angle dependent energies, and that may be related to (i) the well studied van Hove singularity of the twist bilayer and (ii) a Lifshitz transition that occurs when trigonally placed electron pockets decorate the strongly <b>warped</b> Dirac <b>cone.</b> We examine the role of a layer perpendicular electric field finding that it affects the conductivity strongly at low temperatures whereas this effect is washed out by Fermi smearing at room temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Graphics {{processing}} units, or GPUs, {{have gradually}} increased in computational {{power from the}} small, job-specific boards of the early 1990 s to the programmable powerhouses of today. Compared to more common central processing units, or CPUs, GPUs have a higher aggregate memory bandwidth, much higher floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), and lower energy consumption per FLOP. Because {{one of the main}} obstacles in exascale computing is power consumption, many new supercomputing platforms are gaining much of their computational capacity by incorporating GPUs into their compute nodes. Since CPU-optimized parallel algorithms are not directly portable to GPU architectures (or at least not without losing substantial performance), transport codes need to be rewritten to execute efficiently on GPUs. Unless this is done, reactor simulations cannot take full advantage of these new supercomputers. WARP, which can stand for ``Weaving All the Random Particles,'' is a three-dimensional (3 D) continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport code developed in this work as to efficiently implement a continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport algorithm on a GPU. WARP accelerates Monte Carlo simulations while preserving the benefits of using the Monte Carlo Method, namely, very few physical and geometrical simplifications. WARP is able to calculate multiplication factors, flux tallies, and fission source distributions for time-independent problems, and can run in both criticality or <b>fixed</b> source modes. <b>WARP</b> can transport neutrons in unrestricted arrangements of parallelepipeds, hexagonal prisms, cylinders, and spheres. WARP uses an event-based algorithm, but with some important differences. Moving data is expensive, so WARP uses a remapping vector of pointer/index pairs to direct GPU threads to the data they need to access. The remapping vector is sorted by reaction type after every transport iteration using a high-efficiency parallel radix sort, which serves to keep the reaction types as contiguous as possible and removes completed histories from the transport cycle. The sort reduces the amount of divergence in GPU ``thread blocks,'' keeps the SIMD units as full as possible, and eliminates using memory bandwidth to check if a neutron in the batch has been terminated or not. Using a remapping vector means the data access pattern is irregular, but this is mitigated by using large batch sizes where the GPU can effectively eliminate the high cost of irregular global memory access. WARP modifies the standard unionized energy grid implementation to reduce memory traffic. Instead of storing a matrix of pointers indexed by reaction type and energy, WARP stores three matrices. The first contains cross section values, the second contains pointers to angular distributions, and a third contains pointers to energy distributions. This linked list type of layout increases memory usage, but lowers the number of data loads that are needed to determine a reaction by eliminating a pointer load to find a cross section value. Optimized, high-performance GPU code libraries are also used by WARP wherever possible. The CUDA performance primitives (CUDPP) library is used to perform the parallel reductions, sorts and sums, the CURAND library is used to seed the linear congruential random number generators, and the OptiX ray tracing framework is used for geometry representation. OptiX is a highly-optimized library developed by NVIDIA that automatically builds hierarchical acceleration structures around user-input geometry so only surfaces along a ray line need to be queried in ray tracing. WARP also performs material and cell number queries with OptiX by using a point-in-polygon like algorithm. In the initial testing where 10 ^ 6 source neutrons per criticality batch are used, WARP is capable of delivering results that are anywhere from 4 to 800 pcm away from MCNP 6. 1 and Serpent 2. 1. 18, but with run times that are 11 - 82 times lower, depending on problem geometry and materials. On average, WARP's performance on a NIVIDIA K 20 is equivalent to approximately 45 AMD Opteron 6172 CPU cores. Larger batches are typically perform better on the GPU, but memory limitations of the K 20 card restricted batch size to $ 10 ^ 6 $ source neutrons. WARP has shown that GPUs are an effective platform for performing Monte Carlo neutron transport with continuous energy cross sections. Currently, WARP is the most detailed and feature-rich program in existence for performing continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport in general 3 D geometries on GPUs, but compared to production codes like Serpent and MCNP, WARP has limited capabilities. Despite WARP's lack of features, its novel algorithm implementations show that high performance can be achieved on a GPU despite the inherently divergent program flow and sparse data access patterns. WARP is not ready for everyday nuclear reactor calculations, but is a good platform for further development of GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo neutron transport. In it's current state, it may be a useful tool for multiplication factor searches, i. e. determining reactivity coefficients by perturbing material densities or temperatures, since these types of calculations typically do not require many flux tallies...|$|R
