60|$|David {{proved himself}} such a very {{satisfactory}} <b>incoming</b> <b>tenant</b> that the Colonel insisted upon his staying to lunch and hastened {{off into the}} cellar to find a bottle of old Marsala, of which he proposed that they should partake with a dry biscuit before Mr. Merridrew's departure. Sylvia sank into a low chair with a little exclamation of despair.|$|E
60|$|The {{owner of}} the second {{establishment}} lived in a blackwood cabinet--it was profanation {{to call it a}} house--alone with a bronze of priceless workmanship, a set of blackwood furniture, and all the medals that his work had won for him in England, France, Germany, and America. He was a very quiet and cat-like man, and spoke almost in a whisper. Would we be pleased to inspect the manufactory? He led us through a garden--it was nothing in his eyes, but we stopped to admire long. Stone lanterns, green with moss, peeped through clumps of papery bamboos where bronze storks were pretending to feed. A dwarfed pine, its foliage trimmed to dish-like plaques, threw its arms far across a fairy pond where the fat, lazy carp grubbed and rooted, and a couple of eared grebes squawked at us from the protection of the--waterbutt. So perfect was the silence of the place that we heard the cherry blossoms falling into the water and the lisping of the fish against the stones. We were in {{the very heart of the}} Willow-Pattern Plate and loath to move for fear of breaking it. The Japanese are born bower-birds. They collect water-worn stones, quaintly shaped rocks, and veined pebbles for the ornamentation of their homes. When they shift house they take the garden away with them--pine trees and all--and the <b>incoming</b> <b>tenant</b> has a free hand.|$|E

50|$|The NIB {{provided}} the tenants with housing, transport, food, tools and a subsistence advance of Kshs 300 {{per month for}} <b>incoming</b> <b>tenants</b> until the first cash crop was harvested. The tenants repaid this advance {{over a period of}} three years. When the tenants arrived, often the farm land was not ready and this resulted in late planting, low cotton yields and thus low incomes.|$|R
60|$|It was now May 15, and my steamer would sail on the twenty-first. The {{intervening}} days I employed, not {{in preparing}} for my travels, but in making every possible arrangement for the comfort and convenience of my <b>incoming</b> <b>tenants.</b> The Vincents {{did not wish to}} take possession until June 1, and I was sorry they had not applied before I had engaged my passage, for in that case I would have selected a later date. A very good steamer sailed on June 3, and it would have suited me just as well.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years the {{situation}} deteriorated further. Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and <b>incoming</b> <b>tenants</b> on New York-granted lands away. Most of these incidents did not involve bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, and the Boys sometimes did extensive property damage when driving tenants out. By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to £100.|$|R
50|$|When {{changing}} {{into new}} clothes, {{they are almost}} gunned down by the stressed <b>incoming</b> <b>tenant</b> of Phyllis' apartment, {{as members of the}} fire department respond to a call by pushing their hydrant-blocking car out of the way only to make it roll into a ditch.|$|E
5000|$|A tenant of {{a market}} garden, or other land, under the Evesham Custom {{has the right to}} sell their tenancy if the {{landlord}} gives their approval, including the right to nominate the new tenant. The payment (known as the [...] "ingoing") made by the <b>incoming</b> <b>tenant</b> includes compensation for any improvements the outgoing tenant has made, such as the planting of fruit trees. The payment also includes a premium for receiving a tenancy offering lifetime security. The entire transaction is made between the outgoing and <b>incoming</b> <b>tenant,</b> with the landlord not involved beyond giving their approval. Furthermore, if the landlord does not accept the new tenant, they are obliged to compensate the outgoing tenant to ensure they did not suffer any financial loss.|$|E
50|$|Èarlaid was {{the right}} {{sometimes}} sold by an outgoing to an <b>incoming</b> <b>tenant</b> to enter into possession of the arable land early in Spring - the incomer doing the ploughing, sowing and planting, and subsequently claiming the resulting crop. It is in vogue only in places where Whitsunday is the removal term for farmers.|$|E
50|$|Eugene Fishbein {{managed the}} Olcott Hotel in 1980. At {{the time he}} had been in charge of {{operations}} for twenty-five years. In 1980 all units in the hotel had pantries or kitchenettes. Almost two thirds of its four hundred and fifty units were rent stabilized. Long-term occupants paid $300 to $450per month for studio apartments. One bedroom apartments cost from $400 to $600 monthly. <b>Incoming</b> <b>tenants</b> paid fifty percent more than the stabilized rates. New tenants tended to be transient, people from abroad or members of the entertainment industry. They stayed only two to three weeks on average.|$|R

40|$|A {{challenge}} in admitting individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias into memory care residential facilities is determining the appropriate {{level of service}} based on abilities and care needs. At intake, the <b>incoming</b> <b>tenant’s</b> functional performance capacity is obtained through family or proxy report corroborated with screening results of global cognitive function. Based on this information, the agency determines the level of service needs; if misjudged, inadequate placement can be stressful for the individual and family and costly for the facility. This study examined the predictive validity of a clinically administered assessment of cognitive-functional performance, Cognitive Performance Test (CPT), in gauging service needs in 4 {{activities of daily living}} (ADL; dressing, eating/feeding, showering, and toothbrushing) with 57 tenants residing in a memory care-assisted living facility. Linear regression results revealed a significant relationship between CPT scores and ADL performance in all areas (P <. 001) with CPT scores accounting for 51 % to 62 % of the variability in performance...|$|R
5000|$|... "Ordinary" [...] estates {{were to be}} {{built to}} a high {{specification}} in estate layout, building and fitments, and so were to be let at a relatively high rent. They were mostly four-in-a-block flats, each flat with its own front door, with some semi-detached and short terraces here and there. They were made of brick and roofed with tiles. Churches, shopping parades and community centres were to be incorporated. These ‘garden suburb’ houses - an idea imported from the south - were let to teachers and semi-professional council employees. Examples in Glasgow were built at Carntyne, Mossend and Knightswood. The logic of these developments (in terms of supporting the ‘working classes’) was that those who moved to these areas would release relatively high quality tenements for <b>incoming</b> working class <b>tenants.</b> These schemes, like red sandstone tenements, remain highly desirable places to stay. None were built in Braidfauld.|$|R
