500|$|Guest star Ed Lauter had {{previously}} {{worked with the}} episode's director, William A. Graham, on the film [...] On {{his role in the}} episode, Lauter has stated [...] "I don’t really have {{a lot to say about}} that, except <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a nice job, and that it was nice working up there in Vancouver with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson".|$|E
500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled {{my desire}} to prove to {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There was nothing more important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, not everybody was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going, ‘This is fantastic, you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E
2500|$|Raimi said {{directing}} McDormand was [...] "very difficult". Raimi said, [...] "apparently I didn't know Fran {{as well as}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> ... The {{reason it}} was difficult was that our conception of the best movie to make differed, arguing {{in trying to make}} the best picture possible. We did come across disagreements, but they were very healthy." ...|$|E

What <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not remember; but {{it was with a}} dreamy calmness that, now the worst had passed, I returned to Crane Valley.|$|R

2500|$|Liberati's {{system of}} {{acquiring}} his style {{is founded on}} the bedrock of virtuosoship: persevering, persistent, faithful work of the severest nature. With a determination and energy truly admirable he devoted all his spare moments to practice. His {{first step was to}} perfect the 'attack of the tone.' Then, with a metronome as his guide in tempo, he practiced scales in all keys—always in a light staccato—until he could play them with absolute precision, in both time and tune. He stated, [...] "You may think you play a scale perfectly but try it with a metronome and you will find out that you don't. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> until I began practicing with a metronome." [...] Although then regarded as an artist, Liberati learned that he could not play a simple scale with evenness, but by diligence he gained the point he sought. He was forced to begin at a slow tempo but gradually increasing it, he rapidly acquired the desired precision at any tempo he found necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Stokes {{scored a}} goal {{in each of}} Celtic's first two league games of the season, 3–0 and 6–1 wins over St Johnstone and Dundee United respectively. [...] However {{over the course of}} the season Stokes scored fewer goals than in {{previous}} seasons, mainly due to new manager Ronny Deila fielding him in a wide left role as opposed to his more recognised position as a striker. [...] Stokes' form at this time was often unimpressive, drawing criticism from supporters, and he was also disciplined by the club after he returned to Celtic late from a trip to his home city of Dublin. [...] Stokes continued to feature on the left wing for Celtic though, and it was from his cross that Kris Commons scored the opening goal on 15 March 2015 in Celtic's 2–0 win over Dundee United in the League Cup Final. [...] He commented after the final, [...] "I do need to show that I can still bring something to the team and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that today. I felt fresher and sharper. I thought I contributed." [...] A few days later, Stokes provided the assist for Jason Denayer's opening goal in a 4–0 win over Dundee United in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead. [...] However, Stokes was sent off later in the same game for elbowing United's Paul Paton.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{have come}} because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> some good,' she said, {{trembling}} {{with anger and}} fear. 'I was speaking to your daughter at your party.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything new? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> not. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{these islands}} twenty-five--twenty-seven years ago. If you find {{anything}} new here--well it's brand new. I didn't leave much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would <b>do</b> so, but {{he looked}} so down-and-out that I didn't {{have the heart to}} say {{anything}} and perhaps make him feel worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> see {{four or five}} men; {{but it was too}} dim to be sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I was {{thinking}} of something else. I was wondering whether I really know you as well as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Am I mistaken in supposing {{that you are not}} an ambitious man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] said she, [...] "but I do {{not know}} her as well as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But here she comes now, and without the young man. I hope she has not drowned him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had <b>done</b> {{anything}} to stop you from offering that sort of helpfulness which makes you a blessing to everybody, I should never forgive myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said she, setting {{herself to}} work on her horse-blanket, [...] "not this year. When I came to Barnbury, baker, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might <b>do</b> well, but <b>I</b> have not <b>done</b> well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> without one. <b>I</b> felt I {{must stand}} alone, and let no one suspect. But--I'm getting puzzled and bewildered, and I don't {{know what to}} do next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that one!" [...] Her tone {{suggested}} that an unfair strain was being put upon her memory. [...] "I didn't feel I wanted {{him as much}} as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{when it came to the}} point." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{too much}} horrified to do {{anything}} but hide my eyes and pray. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not do so obviously, but Hester saw or guessed, stamped at me, and said, [...] "Don't; I will not have it done. It is mockery!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Milt {{crossed his}} knees, caught his chin in his hand, [...] "I don't know as I really do know him so well. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I was onto his evil ways. He {{was the son}} of the pioneer doctor, Maine folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might <b>do</b> you a favor," [...] went on Dave, {{and then}} told of his meeting with the cattle agent, and of how Pludding was trying to reach Oakdale without delay.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mistook your purpose, honoured sir, {{and thought}} you really desired to know {{something}} of our literature; and in repeating what you deemed not unworthy your hearing, <b>I</b> profess <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>doing</b> you pleasure, instead of stirring your indignation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Annoyed, I know. And {{it was all}} my fault--or my misfortune. But I assure you, Mrs. Pasmer, that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>doing</b> {{something}} that would please her--in the highest and noblest way. Now don't you know I did?" ...|$|R
60|$|I ran forward, {{but they}} stopped me, and Mr. Woodcourt entreated {{me with the}} {{greatest}} earnestness, even with tears, before I {{went up to the}} figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said. I did so, as <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so, as I am sure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} {{a good deal}} since that night. I've {{come to the conclusion}} that I don't believe what I've been preaching. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but I didn't. I don't know what I believe. Seems as if the land had slid from under my feet. What am I to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{appeared}} for {{a moment}} to reflect upon this: it was spoken in a tone that might have touched her. Yet {{at the end of the}} moment, lifting her eyes, she brought out: [...] "I hate art, as you call it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I knew I did; but till this morning I didn't know how much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It come on {{a fellow}} so suddent," [...] said Peter shamefacedly. [...] "I think I could a-stood my ground if I'd known {{she was going to}} come out. But when she popped out like that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>done</b> for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{ashamed to}} answer you," [...] said the Earl; [...] "but truth is, first {{impressions}} are of consequence, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might <b>do</b> as wisely not {{to appear before}} your sister, for the first time, {{in the character of}} Bully Bottom." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....my {{works have}} their own minds. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not need a book that is expensive, but a book that has {{substance}} and meaning. — José de la Cruz to arrogant experts {{and were able to}} finish their studies ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> once at home--when we were boys; but it {{was only}} Nathan in his night-shirt; but I wasn't frightened when I thought he was a ghost. I believe there's no such things. Our nurses tell a pack of lies about 'em," [...] says Harry, gravely. [...] "George was a little frightened; but then he's----" [...] Here he paused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't I? Then I hope I never shall. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I {{thought they}} were the {{feelings}} of a good, true-hearted friend; feelings that I could sometimes look back upon with pleasure as being honest when so much that one meets is false. I have become very fond of you, Mr Gresham, and I should be sorry to think that I did not understand your feelings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon I {{was scared}} wild... Bill says to me, 'Bill, you oughtn't show yellow like thet. You shore don't savvy thet boy of yours.' ... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> son, {{but when it}} come to a {{showdown}} I was chicken-hearted.

"I've {{been doing}} badly all day long— and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>doing</b> uncommonly well— but about four o' clock I scraped {{everything}} <b>I</b> had <b>done</b> {{for the last}} two days and my canvas is back again where I started it— and I am as blue as indigo." ...|$|R
50|$|Originally I {{was very}} proud of what {{happened}} there, but I played 14 years of professional hockey, so <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Jeez, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> more than that.'
