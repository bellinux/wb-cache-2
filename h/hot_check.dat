40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedNaval aviation accounts for 54 % of all naval fuel usage. With {{such a large}} footprint, even small reductions in fuel consumption can {{have a significant impact}} on the bottom line. Recognizing this fact, the Chief of Naval Operations has targeted naval aviation to achieve a 4 % reduction in non-mission fuel burn without adversely affecting mission execution or safety. In this thesis, we model ground operations at Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana and NAS Lemoore to identify and reduce the time an aircraft spends with engines online during post-flight operations. Specifically, by reducing the processes performed while conducting <b>hot</b> brake <b>checks</b> and reducing resources required at the hot skids, we are able to save over $ 8 million at NAS Oceana and Lemoore alone. In addition, we have identified zero-cost coordination efforts that increase synchronization of fuel truck delivery to their consumers, such as noting refueling intentions on schedules to allow fuel truck managers to allocate trucks more efficiently, leading to additional savings. We provide recommendations specific to each base and recommendations that can be adopted fleet-wide. Finally, we identify that the current allocation of aircraft among bases is suboptimal and provide policy recommendations that would improve overall readiness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work was to produce a {{programme}} to calculate as accurately as possible the distributions of weight and buoyancy of a vessel, leading to the determination of sheer force and bending moment at each of 101 equally spaced ordinates overall. Calculations may be performed for still water or sine wave conditions. The programme, which provides tabular and/or graphical output, is written in Elliott Autocode {{and is in the}} Applications Group library of Elliott Automation Limited. It is extensively labelled and is flow charted throughout, the symbols used being those of the British Standards Institution, and illustrated in the glossary. A fairly detailed look into the ‘end lengths’ suggested by Lloyd’s (their Rpt. SR 64 / 15) has been undertaken in connection with the distribution of the continuous material. Ordinate tilting has been used, in the main, as opposed to ‘base swinging’ techniques, the reasons being fully explained in the text. The programme was approved by Lloyd’s Register of Shipping in August 1966, (except for those parts relating to (i) the coffin method for the continuous material and (ii) the application in a sine wave - which parts Lloyd's did <b>hot</b> <b>check).</b> It has also been further successfully tested by them in November, 1966.

40|$|To {{guarantee}} execution, Java {{and other}} strongly typed languages require bounds checking of array accesses. Because bounds checks may raise exceptions, they block code motion of instructions with side effects, thus preventing many useful code optimizations, such as partial redundancy elimination or instruction scheduling of memory operations. Furthermore, {{because it is}} not expressible at level, the elimination of bounds checks can only be performed at run time, after the program is loaded. Using existing powerful bounds-check optimizers at run time is not feasible, however, because they are too heavyweight for the dynamic compilation setting. ABCD is a light-weight algorithm for elimination of &ray Checks on Demand. Its design emphasizes simplicity and efficiency. In essence, ABCD works by adding a few edges to the SSA value graph and performing a simple traversal of the graph. Despite its simplicity, ABCD is surprisingly powerful. On our benchmarks, ABCD removes on average 45 % of dynamic bound check instructions, sometimes achieving near-ideal optimization. The efficiency of ABCD stems from two factors. First, ABCD works on a representation. As a result, it requires on average fewer than 10 simple analysis steps per bounds check. Second, ABCD is demand-driven. It can be applied to a set of frequently executed (<b>hot)</b> bounds <b>checks,</b> which makes it suitable for the dynamic-compilation setting, in which compile-time cost is constrained but hot statements are known...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Hot flashes is {{the most}} common problem in {{postmenopausal}} women, which may have adverse effects on their quality of life. Concerns about the effects of hormone replacement therapy has been increased the desire to investigate alternative treatments such as herbal therapy for this problem. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sage extract on frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women. Method: This study was a randomized controlled trial. Using a triple- blind design (participants and researcher blind to group assignment and data analyst blind to groups until after initial analyses), participants were assigned randomly to sage extract or identical placebo. Participants included 84 women aged 45 to 60 referred to the Health Center of Branch No. 1 of Lahijan with complain of hot flashes in the fall of 1391. The main variable of this study was the frequency of hot flashes. Participants using a <b>hot</b> flash <b>check</b> list, recorded their frequency of their hot flashes before and 8 weeks after the beginning the intervention (daily intake of 100 mg capsules of salvia extract or identical placebo capsules). Results: The two groups were similar in terms of the mean number of hot flashes before the intervention. After 8 weeks of intervention the mean number of hot flashes decreased in both groups. But statistically significant difference was found between the participants’ pre-intervention and post-interventionin sage group. (p= 0, 004). Conclusion : This study showed that both the sage extract and placebo were effective in reducing the frequency of hotflashes but the sage was more effective.

The influence of the climatic vagaries {{on the performance of}} humans in this bioclimatic zone is also presented. Aa descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted in Maiduguri in January, 2002 to evaluate people’s response to weather in the city. The study used a multi-stage sampling technique to select and administer 1200 instrument of the survey to the eligible respondents in four wards of the city proportionately. The wards (proportions) are; Gwange (450), GRA (150), Mairi (300) and Bulunkuttu (300). The dry season in the sudano-sahelian environment presents two distinct thermal opposites. The harmattan season (October-March), which is cold and the hot (transitional) season (April-early June), which presents debilitating hot conditions. These two seasons have created two distinct climate cultures among the inhabitants of the area in response to the vagaries of the weather. It was found that humans have some ways of adjusting and overcoming the problems posed by the harsh dry season weather of the sudano-sahelian zone. The measures adopted during the cold harmattan include warm dressing, heating and mating. While the set of measures adopted during the cold harmattan include resting under trees in the late mornings and the afternoons, sleping outside in open spaces at night, wetting of beddings, floors and building walls and creating artificial micro weather through fanning and air conditioning. The weather vagaries mitigation measures are however, paradoxically associated with some and health problems like burglaries, theft, increased incidences of sexually transmitted diseases and burns. These affect both human and land productivity in this environmental effects. For example, heating and warming process in the home and outside have usually meant more exploitation of vegetal resources. This leads to, among other things, deforestation and soil erosion and also atmospheric pollution. This study therefore, recommends that the residents of the city should be educated on the danger and on how to avoid the adverse effects of some weather vegaries adjustment measures. Aalso, government should ensure the availability of anti-snake venom as part of the essetial drugs in the health centers. Security should also be tightened during the <b>hot</b> season to <b>check</b> thefts and burglaries...|$|R

When transporting hydrocarbons from seabed to top side on a jacket platform {{there is always the}} need of a riser. Risers are attached to the platform leg or bracing by means of riser clamps. The riser loads together with environmental forces transfers large stresses to the clamps. To ensure that the clamps can withstand these loads over the design life, several analyses have to be performed. This thesis covers the design methodology and the most important analyses using a FE (Finite Element) tool, on one of the clamps designed by Subsea 7 for the Ekofisk 2 / 4 -B platform. Basically three analyses are performed; ULS (Ultimate Limit State) stress check and FLS (Fatigue Limit State) check for the clamp and the bolts, in addition to a non-linear slippage analysis. The action loads from the riser are given by the jacket operator. The environmental forces on the riser and the clamps are calculated to find the largest load combination in the horizontal- and vertical direction. For the various analyses different load- and material factors are applied to the forces. The worst load combination is applied in the analysis which is conducted in ANSYS, FE tool. The linear FE analysis has to be setup correctly to obtain good results. The results for the ULS stress check are in general within allowable limits, i. e. below design yield. There is however some peak stresses in local areas that are above design yield. Common practice is to conduct a non-linear analysis and check if the peak stresses are due to secondary effects. To disregard the secondary effects the plastic strain obtained in the non-linear analysis have to be insignificant. The results obtained indicate that the peak stresses are due to secondary effects, hence the clamp meets the requirements for the ULS criteria.

40|$|In {{chapter one}} of this thesis aspects of {{reproduction}} and production, mainly milk production were reviewed. Components of reproductive efficiency such as the fertility components: age at calving, service periods, days open, calving interval and non return rate; were also investigated. The physiological relationship between those traits and milk production and persistency, in both temperate and tropical environments, was also considered, as well as longevity or stayability as other alternatives for evaluating reproduction. Attention was put on first and second lactation performance. With a view towards understanding physiological aspects of reproduction and production in dairy cows, the nature of lactation in mice was reviewed from the relatively few works that have been done. The papers reviewed included the role of pre-natal and post-natal maternal effects {{and the relationship between}} littersize and milk-yield. Daily yield and lactation from a number of studies were compared. Theories of genotype-environment interaction (GM) and adaptation, as well as their implications, were reviewed in the subsequent part of. chapter 1. Evidence of GEE in dairy cattle (Friesian, Holstein or Friesian-Holstein, crossbred with Friesian, and native) in both reproductive characters and milk production throughout the tropic regions were examined particularly closely. Mating systems and selection responses in genetic improvement programmes also were reviewed. Constraints and shortcomings for the achievement of genetic progress through natural mating, AI and progeny-testing in the tropics were examined in conjunction with attainment of high milk production in the temperate countries. The use of new technology (MOET) for manipulating reproductive efficiency was also introduced in the hope that {{it can be used to}} increase breeding efficiency in the tropics. The milk-yield and reproductive. characters, of two genotypes of mice (one genotype had been selected for high early reproductive and milking performance and the other was a random bred control) were measured in the normal and a <b>hot</b> environment to <b>check</b> if GEI were present. Both genotypes had been developed in the normal temperature. Evidence of interaction was found in the second parity and only in reproductive traits, e. g. fecundity, interval between mating and birth of second parity. These results are supported by many studies of GEI for both milk-yield and reproductive characters in dairy cattle in the tropics. Milk production does not show GEI, if the environment is defined merely as temperature. The previous selection of the improved genotype had resulted in positive correlated responses in: litter size and litter weight at birth in the first parity, production characters (growth characters and preweaning weight of the litters) in both parities, and on milk production but not on persistency. The selected line did maintain its superiority across environments. However females from the improved genotype performed worse in almost all characters in the hot environment compared to the normal environment. In an analogy with dairy cattle, the high production capacity of the selected line was not exhibited in the adverse environment. Problems of genetic improvement in the tropics were discussed. They included the use of appropriate selection criteria based on. more knowledge of both physiological and genetical relationships between milk-yield and other-characters, with the aim of increasing adaptability and productivity in the target environment. Other possibilities for genetic improvement of dairy cattle in the tropics and the use of synthetic breeds for overcoming the problems in the long term were also discussed.
