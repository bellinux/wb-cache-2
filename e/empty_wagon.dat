A few blocks off he met a man with an <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> and hired him to go and fetch his trunk.

An <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> at the cross-road was suddenly crowded with people, who seemed to have sprung from the earth. There was much running and confusion on the hillside. On the mountain-road, Mr. Jack Hamlin had reined up his horse, and was standing upright on the seat of his buggy. And the two objects of this absorbing attention approached each other.|$|E

50|$|There were steep {{gradients}} on the line; from Seghill to Prospect Hill {{rising as}} steep as 1 in 61, and from Prospect Hill to the Tyne falling gradients, the steepest {{of which was}} 1 in 25. The line was worked mainly by stationary engines, one at Prospect Hill, near the Allotment, which hauled up the loaded wagons from Holywell, and the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> from the Newcastle and North Shields road. The other engine was at Percy Main, hauling the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> from the staiths. From Prospect Hill to Percy Main and from Percy Main to the staiths the loaded wagons ran by gravity, unwinding as they descended a tail rope from the drum of the engine, to bring hack the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons.</b> The remainder of the line from Seghill to Holywell was worked by locomotives; those used at first were the Samson and the John, both built by Timothy Hackworth.|$|R
60|$|The cold was by {{no means}} {{excessive}} during the day, and although the snow was deep and heavy, there was no difficulty in keeping up with the convoy, as the pace of the bullocks was little over {{a mile and a half}} an hour. At night they were snug enough, for the doctor had adapted an <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> as their sleeping-place, and this, with a deep bed of straw at the bottom, blankets hung at the sides and others laid over the top, constituted as comfortable a shelter as could be desired.|$|E
60|$|Miss Port smiled. She had {{finished}} her dinner, and {{she folded her}} napkin and dusted some crumbs from her lap. She always humored her father when he was really in earnest; he was very old {{and could not be}} expected to live much longer, and it was his daughter's earnest desire that she should be in good favor with him when he died. With a straight-cut smile at the captain, she rose and left the two old friends to their talk, and went out on the front piazza. There she saw Mr. Morris, the butcher, on his way home with an <b>empty</b> <b>wagon.</b> She stepped out {{to the edge of the}} sidewalk and stopped him.|$|E
60|$|But one had {{not been}} made. And the old road {{had not been}} used for years. Right at the outset we struck a long, steep, winding, rocky road. We got stalled at the very foot of it. More toil! Unloading the wagon we packed on our saddles the whole load {{more than a mile}} up this last and {{crowning}} obstacle. Then it took all the horses together to pull the <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> up to a level. By that time sunset had overtaken us. Where had the hours gone? Nine hours to go one mile! But there had to be an end to our agonies. By twilight we trotted down into Long Valley, and crossed the main road to camp in a grove we remembered well. We partook of a meagre supper, but we were happy. And bed that night on a thick layer of soft pine needles, in a spot protected from the cold wind, was immensely comfortable.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the tight}} {{economic}} conditions facing the NSW coal mining industry {{at the time}} and the need to rationalise some of its operations, Coal & Allied decided it was more economical to ship the coal to port by road and on 28 August 1987 announced the planned closure of the Stockrington to Hexham line from 25 September 1987. The railway operated normally until 18 September when following a dispute between a loco crew and management, coal haulage ceased and only <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> were to be worked to Hexham for storage. The last coal was dumped at the coal preparation plant on 21 September and on 22 September No.25 cleared the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> from the preparation plant and then made two trips to Stockrington to work the remaining <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> to Hexham. However, on 24 September as part of the vigorous protest efforts by the railway employees, No.25 was hijacked and after spending a day at Doghole the loco was moved to Lenaghans Drive road bridge and a protest camp set up. However, {{due to a lack of}} support from their fellow unionists at the other Coal & Allied operations the protest ended with no effect on 15 October 1987.|$|R

5000|$|In BR {{days there}} were unfitted mineral trains run at express freight speed, locally known as [...] "the Annesley Cutters" [...] or [...] "Windcutters", {{exclusively}} {{running on the}} ex-GC line. These ran from Annesley, a collection yard for the collieries of Nottinghamshire served by the ex Great Central Railway, to Woodford Halse and then onwards to major destinations across southern England. These trains have been recreated on the preserved Great Central Railway, using over 30 of these wagons purchased in 1992 by readers of Steam Railway magazine. Whilst there were many equivalent <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> trains run by the Midland/ LMS/ BR LM Region, they were never run at express speeds, nor did they attract any nickname such as Windcutters.|$|E
50|$|When {{tests were}} {{originally}} carried out, {{it was found}} necessary to stop {{two or three times}} while taking <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> up to the Rhondda. According to one driver, it was not advisable to pass a single water column for fear of running short before the next one.|$|R

50|$|The Denniston Incline began {{operation}} in April 1880. It was a self-acting ropeway that used gravity to lower 12.5 ton gross laden weight New Zealand Railways' coal wagons {{one at a}} time from Brakehead, at Denniston, at the top to Conns Creek below. Each descending wagon hauled an empty one up the incline by means of wire ropes, each wagon attached to its own rope and brake drum. The two drums were mounted beside each other on a common shaft, and the wire rope wound in opposite directions on each drum. So while one drum was letting the rope out and lowering a full wagon down the incline, the other drum was winding its rope in and pulling an <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> up the incline. Hydraulic pistons slowed the rotation of the winding drums to control the speed of the wagons.|$|E
5000|$|Ozawa station - A 762mm (2'6") gauge horse-drawn tramway {{opened to}} the port at Iwanai in 1905. In 1912 it was {{replaced}} by a 1067mm (3'6") gauge line, which closed in 1985. Near Iwanai the first tramway in Hokkaido, and possibly Japan, opened in 1869 as a 2.8 km gravity line linking a coal mine to the port of Kayanuma. It used timber rails and a ~1050mm gauge, with brakemen riding the loaded wagons, and horses and cattle hauling the <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> back to the mine. In 1881 the line was rebuilt to 762mm gauge with iron rails, and steam locomotives were introduced in 1927. In 1931 the tramway {{was replaced by a}} 10 km cableway linking the mine to Iwanai port, which in 1946 was replaced by a 6.3 km 1067mm gauge line. A bridge on the new line collapsed during a typhoon in 1962, and the line was closed, with the coal mine closing two years later.|$|E
50|$|The <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> {{would be}} winched off the cradle and run down onto a second {{weighbridge}} {{to calculate the}} tare and then run down a gradient of 1 in 70 to the empties siding. Local hydraulic capstans were included to rope-haul wagons {{to and from the}} cradle as necessary.The empty wagons would then be shunted to the sorting sidings.Two men could empty a wagon in one minute, one to run the wagon on and off the cradle, and another to operate the hydraulics.The resident engineer reported in 1890 that as much as 400 LT had been shipped in one hour from a single tip.In 1890 movable tipping hoists mounted on rails were installed so that coal could be loaded simultaneously into one hold from a fixed hoist and another hold from the movable hoist.The original tipping hoists were made by Tennant and Walker of Leeds.The design was a compromise between the demand for speed in loading and the cost of breakage of coal delivered into the holds from a height.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{attendance}} {{of the demand}} for freight transport {{is related to the}} process of allocation of the wagons that in turn is associated with {{the way in which the}} decision is taken. The distribution of wagons to the shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement of the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons.</b> In addition, the trips of the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> have the major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism of wagon distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the problem related to the distribution of the load wagons and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling of the wagons...|$|R
50|$|The Wootton bridge {{collapse}} {{occurred on}} 11 June 1861, when the rail {{bridge over the}} road between Leek Wootton and Hill Wootton in Warwickshire collapsed {{under the weight of}} a passing goods train on the line between Leamington Spa and Kenilworth owned by the London and North Western Railway Company. The train had passed over the bridge safely in the morning with a full load of coal, and was returning to Kenilworth with the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> at 7 am. The 30 ton locomotive fell through the deck of the bridge onto the road below, and the tender crashed into the cab, killing both driver and fireman instantly. Many of the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> behind were dragged into the gap to form a pile almost up to the height of nearby telegraph poles.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, a {{self-acting}} incline {{is one in}} which the loaded wagons going down pull, via a cable and drum, the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> going up. There might be two separate tracks, or a single track with a passing loop. This system was widely used on slate railways in Wales.|$|R
