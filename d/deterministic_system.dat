25|$|Penrose {{believes}} that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may {{come into play}} in the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that the present computer is unable to have intelligence {{because it is an}} algorithmically <b>deterministic</b> <b>system.</b> He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because things such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} {{theory of}} controllability for <b>deterministic</b> <b>systems</b> is extended to linear stochastic systems defined on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Three types of stochastic controllability are studied: approximate, complete, and S-controllability.

2500|$|Spinoza {{contends that}} [...] "Deus sive Natura" [...] is a being of {{infinitely}} many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His {{account of the}} nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same substance. It is important to note here that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the Ethics, Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests dualism. The universal substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the mind–body problem known as neutral monism. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence in which God can make changes, but a God which itself is the <b>deterministic</b> <b>system</b> of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that [...] "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,"; he directly challenges a transcendental God which actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause and effect which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God, or the existence which humans inhabit, allows them to best respond to the world around them.|$|E

In this paper, we study the computational power of <b>deterministic</b> P <b>systems</b> in the evolution–communication framework. It is known that, in the generative case, two membranes are enough for universality. For the <b>deterministic</b> <b>systems,</b> we obtain the universality with three membranes, leaving the original problem open. ...|$|R

30|$|In [10, 11], the {{sufficient}} condition for BIBO stabilization {{of the control}} system with no delays was proposed by the Bihari-type inequality. In [12, 13], employing the parameters technique and the Gronwall inequality investigated the BIBO stability of the system without distributed time delays. In [14 – 16], based on Riccati-equations, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, some BIBO stabilization criteria for a class of delayed control systems with nonlinear perturbations were established. In [17], the BIBO stabilization problem of a class of piecewise switched linear system was further investigated. However, up to now, these previous results have been assumed to be in <b>deterministic</b> <b>systems,</b> including continuous time <b>deterministic</b> <b>systems</b> and discrete time <b>deterministic</b> <b>systems,</b> but seldom in stochastic systems (see [18], Fu and Liao get several mean square BIBO stabilization criteria in terms of Razumikhin technique and comparison principle). In practice, stochastic control systems are more applicable to problems that are environmentally noisly in nature or related to biological realities. Thus, the BIBO stabilization analysis problems for stochastic case are necessary.|$|R
