5000|$|It is a predatory insect, {{feeding on}} small insects {{including}} <b>greenflys</b> and red spider mites. [...] It is typically 3-4 mm in length, with reflective forewings and black pronotum. The legs are mostly orange-brown. It more commonly inhabits lower vegetation than trees, and especially nettles {{in the later}} half of the growing season. A. nemorum lays its eggs inside plant leaves.|$|R

His music style leans towards the more soul/funk influenced styles of drum'n'bass. He is currently signed to FF Recordings {{and has been}} releasing music since 2001. <b>Greenfly</b> also co-runs Subfactory, a free weekly drum'n'bass event in Reading, Berkshire, England.|$|E

50|$|The novel Absolution Gap {{contains}} {{a reference to}} entities in a parallel universe (or at least claiming to be from one) facing attack from an agent {{very similar to the}} <b>Greenfly.</b> In their world, the <b>Greenfly</b> gradually consume the entire universe, rendering it uninhabitable. There are references that may imply the alternate universe entities are actually the extreme far future of humanity.|$|E

50|$|The {{butterfly}} inhabits low-lying jungle in very wet regions. The {{males are}} fond of sitting {{on the tops of}} leaves not very high off the ground and making short circular flights. The females flutter about amongst the undergrowth and bushes at forest edges. The butterfly has also been recorded by one observer to settle over hosts of <b>greenflies</b> (aphids), tickle them with the proboscis and feed on the exudations.|$|R
2500|$|Aphids, {{also known}} as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as <b>greenflies,</b> blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be {{confused}} with [...] "jumping plant lice" [...] or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green, but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint, they are a highly successful group of organisms.|$|R

50|$|Humanity then {{enjoyed a}} second, 400-year-long golden age. After this, however, came the <b>Greenfly</b> outbreak, {{in which human}} {{civilisation}} was destroyed by a rogue terraforming system of human origin that destroyed planets and converted them to millions of orbiting, vegetation-filled habitats. The <b>Greenfly</b> began to subsume most of human space, with all efforts to stop them failing. The storyline of the Revelation Space universe thus far concludes with humanity leaving the Milky Way galaxy {{in an attempt to}} set up a new civilisation elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|There is some {{suggestion}} that the terraforming agent which the Shadows are fleeing from is the Greenfly; the agent they are fleeing has characteristics that correspond more or less perfectly with the <b>Greenfly</b> forces encountered {{at the end of}} Absolution Gap and [...] "Galactic North". If this is true, the Shadows could be descended from the human survivors at the end of [...] "Galactic North". Another possible explanation is that either the <b>Greenfly</b> or instructions for building them somehow came to our universe from the far brane.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Greenfly</b> {{first started}} making {{music at the}} age of eight when he taught himself to play the piano. Years later after playing various {{instruments}} (including guitar, drums, keyboards to name a couple) in many bands, he got into drum and bass around 1994 after hearing one of the Essential Mixes on BBC Radio 1. From then he got into music production and {{a couple of years later}} released his self-entitled debut album on Millennium Records, London. Following on from the global success of this he continued to make music and in 2001 his track [...] "G-Funk" [...] was signed by Good Looking Records. The track was an instant success and was voted 3rd best dnb tune of 2003 by a Mixmag poll as well as featuring on LTJ Bukem's Progressions Sessions CDs. Since then <b>Greenfly</b> has released several other tracks on Good Looking Records and over 30 singles on other labels such as V recordings, Camino Blue, FF Recordings, Zen, Red Mist and Strictly-Digital. <b>Greenfly</b> is still producing drum'n'bass for his own label, FF Recordings, as well as music for adverts, animations and websites. In 2009 he released his debut 4 track EP on FF entitled 'Playing Tunes'.|$|E
50|$|The {{sweet pea}} plant does suffer from some pests, {{the most common}} being aphids. These insects suck the sap out of the plants, {{reducing}} growth. Mosaic virus is spread by <b>greenfly,</b> causing yellowing of leaves, distortion of new shoots, and inhibited flowering.|$|E

5000|$|... "Galactic North" [...] (1999), {{short story}} by Alastair Reynolds, also {{published}} in the collection Galactic North (2006). The Ross 128 system {{is the source of}} an outbreak of self-replicating machines known as <b>greenfly,</b> which become a major threat to life in the galaxy (compare Ross 128: [...] "Across the Sea of Suns" [...] above).|$|E
50|$|Aphis gossypii {{is a tiny}} insect or <b>greenfly</b> in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in {{the order}} Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants. It is a widely distributed pest {{of a variety of}} agricultural crops in the families Cucurbitaceae, Rutaceae and Malvaceae. Common names include cotton aphid, melon aphid and melon and cotton aphid.|$|E
5000|$|The tracks [...] "Lord of the Hornets" [...] and [...] "The <b>Greenfly</b> and the Rose" [...] were {{recorded}} as demos {{in preparation for}} Calvert's Hype album, but they were issued as a single by Flicknife Records (FLS204) in 1980. The band used for this session is a unique combination of former Hawkwind members, except for Gary Cooper who was Calvert's literary agent at the time.|$|E
50|$|Tim {{is still}} small yet his {{responsibilities}} are growing larger.

50|$|Tabanus nigrovittatus, {{also known}} as the greenhead horse fly, salt marsh greenhead, or simply the greenhead fly, greenhead or <b>greenfly,</b> is a species of biting horse-fly {{commonly}} found around coastal marshes of the Eastern United States. The biting females are a considerable pest to both humans and animals while they seek a source of blood protein to produce additional eggs. Females live for three to four weeks and may lay about 100 to 200 eggs per blood meal.|$|E
50|$|In {{the novels}} it becomes {{apparent}} that the Inhibitors are starting to fail in their mission as civilisations are getting further and further into space before being found and destroyed. In fact, in the last book Absolution Gap, in the epilogue, it is shown that humanity, with technological assistance from other star faring, albeit hidden, cultures (for example, the Nestbuilders), were able to push back the Inhibitors and establish an Inhibitor-free zone around human space. However, this introduced the problem of <b>Greenfly,</b> a terraforming-replicator gone wrong that ravaged systems.|$|E
50|$|Macrosiphum hellebori, more {{commonly}} known as Hellebore aphid or <b>greenfly,</b> is a sap feeding aphid that infests the flowers and foliage of hellebore plants. The whitish-green aphids are about 2-4mm long and form dense colonies on hellebores, coating them with a honeydew {{that can lead to}} the growth of sooty mold on the leaves and flowers of the hellebore. This species of aphid only affect hellebores and are most active in March and April when the hellebores are flowering and when few aphid predators are around, though they may infest during any time of the year.|$|E
5000|$|By 2658, Irravel has {{acquired}} a cloned body of herself. Markarian has disappeared with the remaining colonists and is fleeing aboard the pirates' ship Hideyoshi. Still {{under the influence of}} her Ultranaut conditioning, Irravel gives chase, interested in exacting revenge, rescuing the colonists, and learning why Markarian gave up the codes to their security. By 2931 she has followed him to a refuge among the [...] "Nestbuilder" [...] race, from whom she attempts to purchase advanced weapons technology in order to have the advantage against the Hideyoshi during the next encounter. However, the Nestbuilders and their symbiotic species, the Slugs, reveal that while she was travelling at high relativistic velocities, the <b>Greenfly</b> terraformers were unleashed around the star Ross 128 (the same star that Diadem orbits in [...] "Glacial"), and have since malfunctioned, destroying the planets there and turning them into trillions of orbiting bio-domes filled with vegetation. The inhabitants of the star system failed to stop them and were apparently killed in the process. Irravel says that she cannot provide any information that would help the Nestbuilders/Slugs, and leaves on the trail of Markarian again. Mirsky dies an old woman in space in 3354. In their last conversation, they discuss the <b>Greenfly,</b> which they observe by now has begun spreading to other systems, destroying the intelligent societies it was designed to provide for. All attempts at containing the swarm have failed.|$|E
50|$|He {{exited the}} Royal Air Force in early 1919 {{and went home}} to Antigua, {{suffering}} from eye strain. He {{then returned to the}} RAF, gaining a permanent commission as a lieutenant on 1 August 1919 and becoming an instructor at RAF Cranwell. In 1920, he was assigned to flight operations in Iraq. On 22 September 1920, he flew DH.9a no. F2838 on a relief expedition to drop food to a stranded boat, the <b>Greenfly.</b> He was shot down by ground fire at Samawahon, and seen to wade ashore. He was executed at Dangatora. He is commemorated on Panels 43 and 64 of the Basra Memorial.|$|E
50|$|The main pest {{affecting}} roses is the aphid (<b>greenfly),</b> which sucks the sap and {{weakens the}} plant. In {{areas where they}} are endemic Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica) take a heavy toll on rose flowers and foliage; rose blooms can also be destroyed by infestations of thrips (Thysanoptera spp). Roses are also used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species; see list of Lepidoptera that feed on roses. Spraying with insecticide of roses is often recommended {{but if this is}} done care is needed to minimize the loss of beneficial insects; systemic insecticides have the advantage of only affecting insects which feed on the plants.|$|E
50|$|The Altamaha River {{flows through}} a flood plain {{up to five}} miles (8 km) wide, {{consisting}} {{of some of the}} last remaining hardwood bottomlands and cypress swamps in the American South. As the river approaches the Atlantic Ocean, it becomes a broad estuary. At least 120 species of rare or endangered plants and animals live in the Altamaha River watershed, including 11 species of pearly mussels, seven of which are endemic to the Altamaha. The river basin also supports the only known example of old-growth longleaf pine and black oak forest in the United States. Other notable species include shortnose sturgeon, Atlantic sturgeon, West Indian manatee, Eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), <b>greenfly</b> orchid, and Georgia plume. The unusual Franklin tree (Franklinia alatamaha), now extinct in the wild, was found by John Bartram along the Altamaha River in 1765. Bartram sent seeds from the trees to England and planted some in his garden in Philadelphia, where some still live.|$|E
50|$|In 4161, Irravel {{stops at}} the Pleiades cluster and meets distant {{descendants}} of the Conjoiners living amongst a race known as the Islanders, who inhabit the planets in the star cluster. Markarian is still fleeing her. She learns that the Greenflies are now consuming whole star systems at a massive rate, surging outward in a fractal pattern in massive swarming tendril-like waves made of substantial fractions of the mass orbiting each star. She also discovers that herself, Markarian, Mirsky, and Seven, their confrontation having unleashed the <b>Greenfly</b> upon the galaxy, have receded into the mists of prehistory and become mythologised as primordial figures. The Islanders put on a play, in which Irravel (unknown to the Islanders) plays herself in a highly ritualised performance, where it is customary for a human bearing the by-then common ancestral name Irravel to play the character. During the feast later that evening, she tries {{to tell them that}} she truly is the same person depicted in the Islanders' play, but they disbelieve her, as many Irravels make such insistences with no particular claim to legitimacy. She leaves the next morning, still in pursuit of Markarian.|$|E
50|$|Parasitoids {{are among}} the most widely used {{biological}} control agents. From {{the point of view of}} the farmer or horticulturalist, the most important groups are the Ichneumonid wasps, which prey mainly on caterpillars of butterflies and moths; Braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including greenfly; Chalcid wasps, which parasitise eggs and larvae of <b>greenfly,</b> whitefly, cabbage caterpillars, and scale insects; and Tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, adult and larval beetles, and true bugs. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term low daily output with a range in production of 4-1000 million female parasitoids per week. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems. Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.|$|E
