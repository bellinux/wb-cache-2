40|$|SUMMARY We {{studied the}} effect of {{exercise}} on blood radiotracer concentration after technetium- 99 m in vivo red blood cell labeling. After red blood cell labeling, 13 subjects underwent maximal supine bicycle exercise. Radioactivity, analyzed with a well counter, was measured in heparinized venous blood samples drawn at rest and during peak exercise. Changes in activity were compared with changes in <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>count.</b> Activity and erythrocyte counts increased during exercise in all 13 subjects. Percent increase in activity correlated with percent increase in <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>count</b> (r = 0. 78), but did not correlate with either duration of exercise or maximal heart rate. Twenty minutes after termination of exercise, activity and zrythrocyte count had decreased from peak exercise values but remained higher than preexercise values. In iiine nonexercised control subjects, samples drawn 20 minutes apart showed no change in activity or in <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>count.</b> We conclude that exercise increases blood activity, primarily because {{of an increase in}} <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>count.</b> During radionuclide ventriculography, blood activity must be measured before and after any intervention, particularly exercise, before a change in left ventricular activity can be attributed to a change in left ventricular volume.

40|$|A Staphylococcal {{infectious}} disease, toxic {{shock syndrome}} (TSS), {{is characterized by}} acute and systemic disorders, such as fever, erythema, shock, and multi-organ failures. A causative exotoxin of TSS, TSS toxin- 1 (TSST- 1), one of the bacterial superantigens, activates {{a vast number of}} human T cells in Vβ 2 -selective way and induces overproduction of cytokines. However, it does not exhibit direct cytotoxic actions. Cytokines produced in an excessive amount are primarily involved in the pathogenicity of TSS. In the present study, we analyse abnormal reactions seen in TSS in rabbits induced by long-term exposure to TSST- 1 filled in an osmotic pump implanted. All of the rabbits exposed to TSST- 1 exhibited acute and systemic abnormal reactions and 60 % of them died within 14 days. The rabbits which survived TSS exhibited transient decrease in body weight, <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> and concentration of hemoglobin in peripheral blood, and transient increases in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, triglyceride, and total cholesterol values. By comparison, the rabbits that died exhibited steady decreases in body weight, <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> and concentration of hemoglobin in peripheral blood prior to their deaths, and transient increases, in higher degrees than did survived ones, of the other clinical data described above...|$|R
