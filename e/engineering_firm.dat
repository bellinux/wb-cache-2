5|$|Actual {{construction}} of the stadium began once Arsenal secured funding. The club appointed Sir Robert McAlpine in January 2002 to carry out building work and the stadium was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous), who were the architects for Stadium Australia and the redevelopment of Ascot Racecourse. Construction consultants Arcadis and <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> Buro Happold were also involved in the process.|$|E

5|$|The British <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> Atelier One and {{freelance}} engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} {{form the}} <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
5|$|The Connective Corridor project, {{supported}} by {{of public and}} private funds, will be a strip of cultural development that will connect the main campus of the university to downtown Syracuse, NY. In 2008, an <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> is studying traffic patterns and lighting to commence the project. A design competition was held to determine the best design for the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} jointly {{designed}} by <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> G. Maunsell & Partners and architects William Halford & Partners. The prestressed concrete design was relatively new for Western Australia, where road bridges had traditionally been built from timber frameworks. The bridge is arched along its length, with a vertical curve {{of up to}} 4% grade.|$|E

5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore {{not be limited to}} simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E
5|$|By 1983 {{the museum}} was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and {{approached}} <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The following year, in April 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms were {{opened to the public}} as a branch of the museum.|$|E

In 2001, Connecticut State Senator Catherine Cook introduced a bill for $150,000 in bonds to fund {{the restoration of the}} Avery Point Light; it was later approved. An article in the New London Day also noted an engineering study valued at $40,000 was being conducted for no cost by James Nordon's <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> of Gibble, Norden and Champion.|$|E

5|$|On March 8, 2013, the <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> NORR, {{commissioned}} by the Ontario Provincial Police, released {{the results of their}} forensic engineering investigation to the Elliot Lake Inquiry. The investigation found that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive corrosion. The corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with road salt (which accelerated the corrosion) to corrode the structure.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that dry berthing was physically possible for the ship, it was necessary to make a preliminary evaluation of the engineering viable ways in which dry berthing could actually be accomplished. Again, an independent maritime <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> was contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives and to present a report of their findings to BTF and to TPWD.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} architects Allward and Gouinlock and by the <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> Stone and Webster Canada, Ltd. in 1965. Colonel McLaughlin unveiled {{a model of the}} building at his 94th birthday celebration, which was held in his honour at the museum in September of that year. It was hoped that the building would be open by Canada's centennial in 1967, but construction delays forced the opening to October 26, 1968.|$|E

5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent maritime <b>engineering</b> <b>firm</b> {{to make a}} survey of the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Alice Hicks (January 2, 1919– October 21, 1979) was an American {{engineer}}, {{the first}} woman engineer to be hired by Western Electric, and both co-founder and {{first president of the}} Society of Women Engineers. Despite entering the field at a time where engineering was seen as an inappropriate career for a woman, Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an <b>engineering</b> <b>firm.</b> During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program, including the Apollo moon landing missions.|$|E
5|$|British {{businessman}} Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham {{during most}} of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese <b>engineering</b> <b>firm.</b> Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the 2010 Formula One season using the Brabham name.|$|E

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the mechanical engineering sector as one of specialized suppliers implies the necessity of customer-oriented R&D activities and a strong need to cooperate and communicate especially with customers. Although there is a specific pattern of the management of technology in mechanical engineering, differences lie in the varying emphasis placed on technology strategy; mechanical <b>engineering</b> <b>firms</b> manage technological and economic challenges differently due to the individual predominant technology strategy, the size of firm, the type of market, and the complexity of products. Problems of technology management in European mechanical <b>engineering</b> <b>firms</b> are identified and opportunities of acting are pointed out depending on different categories of enterprises. The results {{presented in this paper}} are based on an analysis of literature and on more than fifty interviews conducted in mechanical <b>engineering</b> <b>firms</b> throughout the EC...|$|R
