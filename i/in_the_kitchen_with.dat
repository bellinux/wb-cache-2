5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Bishop {{fatally shot}} her 18-year-old brother, Seth Bishop, on December 6, 1986, at their home in Braintree, Massachusetts. Bishop fired two shots from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun (one into her bedroom wall, then one into her brother's chest while they were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> their mother). Later she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle on the {{adjacent}} road {{and tried to get}} into the vehicle. The death of her brother was classified as an accident by Braintree police.|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} survey {{was carried out}} to investigate the occurrence of non-occupational pneumoconiosis in Ladakh, {{where there are no}} mines or industries. The clinicoradiological investigations of 449 randomly selected subjects from three villages showed typical cases of pneumoconiosis associated with progressive massive fibrosis and egg shell calcification of hilar glands. The prevalence of pneumoconiosis in these three villages was 2. 0 %, 20. 1 % and 45. 3 % and it corresponded with the severity of dust storms and the use of chimneys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens.</b> <b>The</b> dust concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>with</b> no provision for a chimney were very high. The free silica content of the storms was between 60 and 70 %. Exposure to free silica from dust storms and soot from domestic fuels are suggested as causes of these cases of pneumoconiosis...|$|R

25|$|Bob Clendenin as Tom Gazelian – Jules' widowed {{neighbor}} who expresses his attraction {{for her in}} weird ways, makes wine in his garage, and is always doing things for Jules and the gang without getting anything back {{in an attempt to}} become part of their group. He is frequently found to be peering into Jules' kitchen window, unnoticed by Jules and/or the gang until he says something. By season 4 he {{is considered one of the}} gang, appearing in most episodes and accompanying the group wherever they go, although still generally standing outside Jules' window instead of <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> the others. His behaviour is often weird and creepy, and details of his otherwise normal and successful life (that he is a millionaire neurosurgeon, former all-state track star, with an adult son in the Marines and a daughter attending law school) are slowly revealed as the series progresses.|$|E
25|$|Shore {{finished}} her television career hosting A Conversation with Dinah (1989–1992) {{on the cable}} network TNN (The Nashville Network). This half-hour show consisted of one-on-one interviews with celebrities and comedians (such as Bob Hope), former boyfriends (Burt Reynolds in a special one-hour episode) and political figures (President Gerald Ford and his wife, Betty.) In a coup, Shore got former First Lady Nancy Reagan's first post-White House interview. Around this time, she gained a contract as television spokeswoman for Holly Farms chicken. (In the 1980s, Shore sang in Glendale Federal Bank television commercials.) Her last television special, Dinah Comes Home (TNN 1991), brought Shore's career full circle, taking {{her back to the}} stage of the Grand Ole Opry, which she first visited some 60 years earlier. Shore won nine Emmys, a Peabody Award, and a Golden Globe. Shore's talk shows sometimes included cooking segments, and she wrote cookbooks including Someone’s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> <b>with</b> Dinah.|$|E
25|$|Marks built a grand 40 odd room Victorian mansion, Zwartkoppies Hall, on {{the farm}} near Pretoria, which became {{well-known}} to celebrities and dignitaries visiting South Africa. Sammy and Bertha moved into the house in 1886. Sammy had an Italian painter paint the walls on silk material so that the walls would look like {{they were made of}} silk. Beautiful patterns decorated each room of the mansion. Having the same restless energy that led to Marks's success, his wife Bertha controlled the house and its staff with ease, managing to raise nine children, breed poultry, maintain a garden, and entertain on a lavish scale. Luncheons, dinners, croquet on the lawn, tennis and billiards parties were all regular events. There was no dinner party, and no Sunday, which passed without a 5 course meal attended by 30+ guests. A staff of 13, most of whom were engaged through an agency in London, carried out the housework: parlourmaids, kitchenmaids, laundrymaids and gardeners, as well as a governess, a cook, an estate carpenter and a Scottish butler. A massive stove <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> five ovens and 10 hot-plates, testified to the scale of the entertainment.|$|E
50|$|Another one of {{the year}} 7 expeditions looked at what Chemistry had to do with cooking and covered {{national}} curriculum across Maths, Science and Design Technology.

500|$|Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She {{influenced}} the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin {{from the kitchen}} shelf for the next day's dinner party. [...] "Elizabeth David says..." [...] was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should {{be put in a}} dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> impenetrable sentences. She was a pleasure to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a [...] "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar's feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete's gift of conveying a sense of place.|$|E

40|$|Unlike a mercantile concern, the stock-in-trade of a tea room {{consists}} solely of food which, at most, {{will last}} {{only a couple}} of weeks. The records and accounts of a tea room should not differ materially from those of any other· business. <b>The</b> big problem <b>in</b> tea room catering is to serve the guest with the best food and still keep the per capita cost within reasonable limits. The accounting for cash and other property is simple; it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and store room where large losses occur. A simple cost system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> combined <b>with</b> comparative analytical reports of the report on sales, is the best solution of this problem. Many economies may be effected and numerous losses and wastes detected, when detailed records of daily food consumption are kept for comparison...|$|R

500|$|New York Dolls {{features}} 10 original {{songs and}} 1 cover—the 1963 Bo Diddley song [...] "Pills". Johansen described the album as [...] "a little jewel of urban folk art". Rundgren, {{on the other}} hand, said the band's sensibilities were different from [...] "the urban New York thing" [...] {{because they had been}} raised outside Manhattan and drew on carefree rock and roll and Brill Building pop influences such as the Shangri-Las: [...] "Their songs, as punky as they were, usually {{had a lot to do}} with the same old boy-girl thing but in a much more inebriated way." [...] Johansen quoted the lyric [...] "you'd best believe I'm in love L-U-V" [...] from the Shangri-Las' [...] "Give Him a Great Big Kiss" [...] (1964) when he opened [...] "Looking for a Kiss", which tells a story of adolescent romantic desire hampered by peers who use drugs. On [...] "Subway Train", he used lyrics from the American folk standard [...] "Someone's <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> <b>with</b> Dinah". In the opinion of critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album's rowdy hard rock songs also revamped riffs from Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, resulting in music that sounded edgy and threatening in spite of the New York Dolls' wittingly kitsch and camp sensibilities. [...] "Personality Crisis" [...] featured raunchy dual guitars, boogie-woogie piano, and a histrionic pause, while [...] "Trash" [...] was a punky pop rock song with brassy singing.|$|E

As demand rose, the store insisted that Mrs. Schlorer improve the packaging from less of a homemade appearance. Deciding to take a risk, Amelia went to a local glass factory where the minimum purchase was 5 gross or 720 jars. The main criteria that Amelia insisted upon was that a tablespoon easily fit into the jar opening for spooning of the mayonnaise. After six years of mixing, bottling, and labeling by hand for local grocery stores and door-to-door delivery, the Schlorers formed the Schlorer Delicatessen Company which was later known as Mrs. Schlorer's, Inc.|$|R
