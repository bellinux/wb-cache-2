40|$|We propose an {{equilibrium}} refinement <b>of</b> strict <b>perfect</b> equilibrium for {{the finite}} normal form games, {{which is not}} known in the literature.

We consider the alternative (and equivalent) <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>perfect</b> equilibrium, based on the substitute sequences, as appeared in Selten [14]. We show that by strengthening and modifiyng this definition slightly, one can obtain a refinement stronger than strict perfectness. We call the new refinement strict substitute perfect equilibrium. The main advantage of this solution concept is that it reflects the local dominance of an equilibrium point. An example is provided to show that a strict perfect equilibrium may fail to be strict substitute perfect.

According to criminologists and scientists, this casual <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>perfect</b> crime exists.

Due to its great ability to overcome the noise interference, in this research, we suggest an attractive idea to expand the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>perfect</b> signal based on HOS.|$|R

5000|$|As of 2014, {{the current}} Major League Baseball <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a <b>perfect</b> game {{is largely a}} side effect of the {{decision}} made by the major leagues' Committee for Statistical Accuracy on September 4, 1991, to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit. That decision removed a number of games that had long appeared in the record books: those lasting fewer than nine innings, and those in which a team went hitless in regulation but then got a hit in extra innings. The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>perfect</b> game was made to parallel this new <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the no-hitter, in effect substituting [...] "baserunner" [...] for [...] "hit". As a result of the 1991 redefinition, for instance, Harvey Haddix receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter for his performance on May 26, 1959, when he threw 12 perfect innings against the Milwaukee Braves before allowing a baserunner in the 13th.|$|R
