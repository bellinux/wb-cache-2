Six major items comprise the system: the cables, splices - one for flat cable to round wires {{and one for}} flat cable to flat cable; a series of flat cable connectors; the distributor, which is used for interconnecting the circuits; and a repair technique for the falt cable. Polyarylene, a new high performance melt-processable insulation material, permits {{the design of a}} completely standardized, modular {{flat conductor}} flat cable.

40|$|Safety of {{suspension}} {{bridges and}} stay-cable bridges is {{depending on the}} durability of the cables. The latter show an apparent healthy aspect over their observable lengths but in fact can be damaged in the hidden parts (anchorages). In this study, Acoustic Emission (AE) is used in order to detect and to locate broken wires in the anchorages areas. The acoustic activity {{in the presence of}} broken wires comes from <b>interwire</b> friction. When damaged, the reference cables are put in vibration and some acoustic parameters can be used to highlight difference between them. The main parameters of the acoustic signals are the total number of count and the cumulated energy. To better understand the <b>interwire</b> fretting mechanism, a study of the behaviour of a broken wire in a tight cable subject to dynamic bending has been carried out. This contributes to define the conditions of vibrating for AE detection. The <b>interwire</b> fretting mechanism and its detection are influenced by the change of roughness, lubrication and <b>interwire</b> contact strength.

The experimental {{results show that the}} electromagnetic losses of the metastructures increase with the decreasing of the <b>interwire</b> distance due to the increasing of the long-range dynamic dipole-dipole interaction within inter-wires {{in the presence of the}} microwave field.

Starting from exact micromagnetic relations, we analyze two limits, namely cooperative reversal processes operative on short lengths scales and noncooperative reversal processes on long length scales. In alnicos, intrawire interactions are predominantly cooperative, whereas <b>interwire</b> effects are typically noncooperative. However, the transition between the regimes depends on feature size and hysteresis-loop shape, and <b>interwire</b> cooperative effects are largest for nearly rectangular loops.

40|$|The {{current voltage}} (IV) {{characteristics}} for perpendicular transport through two sequentially coupled wires of finite length is calculated analytically. The transport within a Coulomb blockade step is assisted by plasmon resonances that appear as {{steps in the}} IV characteristics with positions and heights depending on inter- and intrawire interactions. In particular, due to the <b>interwire</b> interactions, the peak positions shift to lower voltages {{in comparison to the}} noninteracting wires which reflects the facilitation of current by interactions.

40|$|We report first-principles {{calculations}} of shot noise properties of parallel carbon wires in {{the regime in}} which the <b>interwire</b> distance is {{much smaller than the}} inelastic mean free path. We find that, with increasing <b>interwire</b> distance, the current approaches rapidly a value close to twice the current of each wire, while the Fano factor, for the same distances, is still larger than the Fano factor of a single wire. This enhanced Fano factor is the signature of the correlation between electron waves traveling along the two different wires. In addition, we find that the Fano factor is very sensitive to bonding between the wires, and can vary by orders of magnitudes by changing the <b>interwire</b> spacing by less than 0. 5 Å. While these findings confirm that shot noise is a very sensitive tool to probe electron transport properties in nanoscale conductors, they also suggest that a considerable experimental control of these structures is required to employ them in electronics.

Using bosonization an interacting metallic fixed point is obtained, which {{is shown to}} be a higher dimensional analogue of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, or a sliding Luttinger liquid. This non-Fermi liquid metallic state, however, is unstable in the presence of weak <b>interwire</b> backscatterings, which favor charge density wave states and suppress pairing. Depending on the effective strength of the Coulomb repulsion and the size of <b>interwire</b> spacing various charge density wave states are stabilized, including Wigner crystal states.

40|$|In {{building}} a multiprocessor system, we can minimize the system's mean {{time to failure}} by providing an architecture resilient to component faults. We compare the fault tolerance and performance characteristics of various fault-tolerant multistage interconnection networks. We primarily focus on networks composed of dilated routing components. A dilated router features redundant outputs in each logical direction, and can thus be used to construct multipath networks. Multipath networks have multiple paths from any input to any output. An <b>interwired</b> multipath network disperses its routers' redundant outputs to input ports of physically distinct components. We introduce a deterministic wiring scheme for routing <b>interwired</b> networks that maximizes the number of routing paths available for each endpoint. We compare the deterministically-wired network to both randomlyinterwired networks and non-interwired multipath networks. We characterize fault tolerance by measuring the probability of a single endpoint disconnection as faults accumulate in the network. Our performance simulations are based on traffic from shared memory applications and include barrier synchronization to expose the effects of localized performance degradation. We find that at a minor performance cost, deterministically-interwired networks are more fault tolerant than randomly- <b>interwired</b> networks and non-interwired networks...|$|R

The system behaves as a sliding Luttinger liquid {{in the vicinity of}} the Gamma point, but its spectral and correlation characteristics have either 1 D or 2 D nature depending on the direction of the wave vector in the rest of the Brillouin zone. Due to <b>interwire</b> interaction, unperturbed states, propagating along the two arrays of wires, are always mixed, and the transverse components of the correlation functions do not vanish.

40|$|Starting from {{an array}} of {{interacting}} fermionic quantum wires, we construct a family of non-Abelian topologically ordered states of matter in three spatial dimensions (3 D). These states of matter inherit their non-Abelian topological properties from the su(2) ^ _k conformal field theories that characterize the constituent interacting quantum wires in the decoupled limit. Thus, the resulting topological phases {{can be viewed as}} 3 D generalizations of the (bosonic) su(2) ^ _k Read-Rezayi sequence of fractional quantum Hall states. Focusing in detail on the su(2) ^ _ 2 case, we first review how to determine the nature of the non-Abelian topological order (in particular, the topological degeneracy on the torus) in the two-dimensional (2 D) case, before generalizing this approach to the 3 D case. We also investigate the 2 D boundary of the 3 D phases, and show for the su(2) ^ _ 2 case that there are anomalous gapless surface states protected by an analog of time-reversal symmetry, similar to the massless Dirac surface states of the noninteracting 3 D topological insulator.
