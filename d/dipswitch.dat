25|$|Indexing {{abundance}} – Documenting {{the abundance}} of a species is a resource-intensive, and time-consuming process. However, if {{the abundance of}} a species can be estimated from its AOO, then assessments of population size can be made more rapidly. This assumption underlies the use of range sizes when deciding on the conservation status of a species (see IUCN Red List), and has led to debate over whether the EOO or AOO measure of species range is more appropriate (Gaston and Fuller 2009). For example, Zuckerberg et al. (2009) have demonstrated that for breeding birds in New York, most species that underwent changes in abundance (positive or negative) between 1985 and 2005 showed concurrent changes in range size. Using a <b>dipswitch</b> test with 15 criteria, Hui et al. (2009) examined the ability of eight models of this kind to estimate the abundance of 610 southern African bird species. Models based on the scaling pattern of occupancy (i.e., those that reflect the scale dependence of species range size) produced the most reliable abundance estimates, and therefore are recommended for assemblage-scale regional abundance estimation.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} {{programmable}} LED board to be used for educational purposes and encourage students to pursue degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (S. T. E. M.) fields. When the board is complete, it will be brought into middle and high school classrooms for use as an interactive activity to demonstrate the basics of memory and programming. When students are finished programming their boards, they can mount it on a stick and swing it in circles to display their message in the air. The goal is to make the average production cost of each board under $ 5 so that the students can take them home and demonstrate the project to their friends and parents. The LED board will communicate with a user interface that will allow students to program the LEDs to light up in a desired design with <b>dipswitches.</b> The user interface features four pushbuttons, a bank of eight <b>dipswitches,</b> a 3 -D printed case, and an LCD display. For each “bit” the students program into the LED board their selection will be displayed on an LCD display. Eventually after programming in their select word or character the LCD will display their whole series. After the student moves from each memory location to the next, the sequence will be saved into the LED board for when it is mounted. The LED board will be mounted on a 3 D-printed box attached to a piece of PVC pipe. After being disconnected from the user interface, the LED board will be powered with AA batteries. The teacher will receive a user interface to keep in the classroom for future use...|$|R
40|$|Digital systems, {{electronic}} circuit applications, and other {{courses in the}} Swarthmore Engineering Department use various microcontrollers and programmable logic devices in their labs and projects. The goal of this project was to design a multipurpose board that could provide a single, cost-effective replacement for the various boards used in these courses. This is achieved by incorporating a MAX 7000 S series complex programmable logic device (CPLD) and a Motorola HC 08 series microcontroller onto a single board. Extensive input and output functionality is achieved with {{the inclusion of a}} USB controller, LCD display, pushbuttons, <b>dipswitches,</b> LEDs, and various headers. Two design stages were completed to produce a working MAX chip with various I/O devices, a working Motorola chip, and a partially implemented USB controller. After a third revision incorporating changes suggested in this report, the board is expected to be fully functional and ready to be used in courses at Swarthmore...|$|R

In addition to selectable difficulty levels via <b>dipswitch,</b> there are also four player-selectable variants of the game: ...|$|E
50|$|Other {{upgrades}} {{included the}} introduction of a larger 64 L fuel tank, shorter gear lever throw on the manual gearbox, relocation of the <b>dipswitch</b> from under the brake pedal to the high left of the firewall, and the windscreen wiper motor was relocated to the engine side of the firewall — greatly reducing wiper noise. All models benefited from additional safety features (some compulsory under new Australian Design Rules, or ADRs) such as dual circuit brakes with a tandem master cylinder, double sided safety rims, front seat belts and front power disc brakes on V8 models.|$|E
5000|$|Finding {{themselves}} in space, Slim, Smilin’ Tom, Phyllis, and Chip discover that in space {{they are able}} to pick up the astonishing amount of television being broadcast by alien worlds, and {{they are able to}} navigate around the galaxy. In time they find that the broadcasting in the galaxy is controlled by a robotic entity called IB (Interstellar Broadcasting), and when an election is announced for the head of IB, Phyllis decides to run. Meanwhile, Smilin’ Tom decides he has to find his long-lost twin brother and solicits a television program that specializes in solving mysteries, called [...] "Tangled Webs", to help him in his search. Slim is kidnapped by an alien called <b>Dipswitch</b> but turns out to be just down the hall. <b>Dipswitch</b> is actually trying to connect with Chip, who leaves with him to become a transdimensional being. IB tries many things to keep Phyllis from winning the election, but she is eventually crowned Queen of the Universe and leaves to begin her rule. Smilin’ Tom finds his brother running a video store in Peterborough and leaves to join him. The season includes many segments such as [...] "The Rugged Road To Learning", a re-dubbed black and white documentary from 1910, [...] "Sally Polkadot" [...] a sweetly bizarre stop-action puppet show voiced by a British woman (Laura Jarrah), and [...] "Esoteric Knowledge", a low-budget science show apparently from the 60s hosted by the generally misinformed Dr. Onius.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Imagewriter II (1985) {{closely followed}} Apple's Snow white design introduced with the Apple IIc, {{and was one}} of the few peripherals that matched its creamy off-white color scheme known at Apple as Fog. This model is recognizable for being white in color and not having the product name on the front cover. There were many ROM revisions produced for this and later ImageWriter IIs, made visible through a self-test (pressing the form feed button while turning the ImageWriter on, then releasing both buttons simultaneously; the printer would then print the ROM version as well as <b>dipswitch</b> settings). The printer came with a small built-in 2K RAM memory buffer, with option to expand.|$|E
50|$|Other occupancy-abundance {{models that}} can be used to {{describe}} the SPO includes Nachman's exponential model, Hanski and Gyllenberg's metapopulation model, He and Gaston's improved negative binomial model by applying Taylor's power law between the mean and variance of species distribution, and Hui and McGeoch's droopy-tail percolation model. One important application of the SPO in ecology is to estimate species abundance based on presence-absence data, or occupancy alone. This is appealing because obtaining presence-absence data is often cost-efficient. Using a <b>dipswitch</b> test consisting of 5 subtests and 15 criteria, Hui et al. confirmed that using the SPO is a robust and reliable for assemblage-scale regional abundance estimation. The other application of SPOs includes trends identification in populations, which is extremely valuable for biodiversity conservation.|$|E

40|$|Single phase semi-converter {{have been}} made using SCR. Semi-converter is a {{controlled}} rectifier that work at single quadrant so that voltage and current output only have positive value. The aim of making this system is to get voltage variation, and controlled ellectricity and current. Triggering account is necessary in triggering SCR which obtained from triggering circuit that consist of microcontroller AT 89 S 51 as voltage control circuit, modul IC TCA 785 as phase control and account transformator as firing circuit. Voltage control circuit connected with <b>dipswitch</b> as output and the output {{in the form of}} voltage variable that used as voltage control then synchronized AC’s phase source by phase control circuit. The output of phase control circuit in the form of triggering account can be shifted from 350 to 1800 then getting insulation from firing circuit. Output from firing circuit is used to triggering single phase semi-converter that use thyristor with kind SCR TIC 106. Result of examination of this system is that SCR’s triggering angle can be shifted from 350 to 1800. In single phase semi-converter examination, using lamp and motor burden, can be concluded that current and voltage burden increasing inversely proportional to triggering angle and phase shift can resulted in the change of DC motor speeds from 99, 9 rpm until 0 rpm...|$|E
