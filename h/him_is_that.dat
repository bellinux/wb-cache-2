5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the genuine}} poems of Tibullus have been lost. On the other hand, {{much of the}} work {{attributed}} to <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of others. Only the first and second books can uncontroversially claim his authorship. In both books occur poems which give evidence of internal disorder; but scholars cannot agree upon the remedies to be applied.|$|E
60|$|What perplexed <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he felt {{a curious}} {{physical}} distaste, which made it uncomfortable for <b>him</b> to <b>be</b> near her.|$|R

25|$|A {{controversial}} but undeniably important historical figure, reviled by {{many and}} followed almost blindly by others, Juan Lechín Oquendo died in August 2001, {{at the age}} of 87. A major criticism used against <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he tended to de-stabilize precisely those regimes that were friendliest to the interests of the working class (Paz Estenssoro, Torres, Siles Zuazo between 1982 and 1985), while being quite deferential to the most hardline right-wing governments (Barrientos, Banzer, Garcia Mesa), at least until he could get safely out of the country.|$|E
25|$|Gavaskar {{was also}} a fine slip fielder and his safe {{catching}} in the slips helped him become the first Indian (excluding wicket-keepers) {{to take over a}} hundred catches in Test matches. In one ODI against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1985, he took four catches and helped India defend a small total of 125. Early in his Test career, when India rarely used pace bowlers, Gavaskar also opened the bowling for a short spell on occasions if only one pace bowler was playing, before a three-pronged spin attack took over. The only wicket claimed by <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Pakistani Zaheer Abbas in 1978–79.|$|E
500|$|Embedded in the Primary Chronicle is a eulogy to Prince Yaropolk, {{and among}} the honors {{assigned}} to <b>him,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{he was in the}} habit of assigning a [...] "tenth part of his wealth to the Mother of God". Probably due to his personal devotion to the papacy and to St Peter, Yaropolk established a new church of St Peter at the monastery of St Demetrios in the city of Kiev. He was said to have left all his wealth to the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev. The Primary Chronicle's eulogy is the first indication of saintly regard, and indeed today he is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day falling on the reported day of his death, November 22.|$|E

2500|$|A {{scholarly}} {{assessment of}} <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a generally secular leader who often embraced religious pluralism, and was tolerant to most religious groups, except those who helped the British. According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was [...] "an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robin Baldrick, {{the medieval}} Baldrick's father. All {{that is known}} about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he is a dung gatherer. He is never seen and is only {{mentioned}} once, in the opening credits of The Black Seal when the narrator referred to Baldrick as [...] "Baldrick, Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first that}} is known about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he became a freeman of the Leathersellers Company in January 1623, having served an eight- or nine-year apprenticeship. He was elected a warden of the yeomanry of the leather-sellers in 1630, and a liveryman in 1634. In [...] 1630 he married his wife Sarah, with whom he would {{have at least one}} son, Nicholas Barbon.|$|E

[...] People would {{go out of their}} way to avoid him on the subway, but the moment Larry would start talking he'd instantly put them at ease with his sense of humor.|$|E
2500|$|Rama {{iconography}} shares {{elements of}} Vishnu avatars, but has several distinctive elements. It never {{has more than}} two hands, he holds (or has nearby) a bana (arrow) in his right hand, while he holds the dhanus (bow) in his left. The most recommended icon for <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he be shown standing in tribhanga pose (thrice bent [...] "S" [...] shape). He is shown black, blue or dark color, typically wearing reddish color clothes. If his wife and brother {{are a part of}} the iconography, Lakshamana is on his left side while Sita always on the right of Rama, both of golden-yellow complexion.|$|E
2500|$|In a media {{interview}} Spurs {{head coach}} Gregg Popovich commented, [...] "(Hill) does {{a little bit}} of everything, the great thing about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's a very good all around basketball player, he's a tenacious defender, he can score, he can run, he's a good passer, he knows how to play and he's really a team guy". When asked on multiple occasions which current NBA player he most resembled, Hill responded by picking Monta Ellis, adding that he sees himself as a combo guard and an energy player who enjoys playing defense and getting into the passing lanes. Hill was drafted by the Spurs to back up All-Star Tony Parker at point guard.|$|E

2500|$|Jim Burke: Burke was {{an opening}} batsman whose {{occasional}} off spin bowling brought him 12 Test wickets (28.75) and whose action was likened to a policeman hitting a small offender with a truncheon. He was no-balled for throwing in grade cricket and Benaud {{was reluctant to}} use him in the Tests. E.W. Swanton wrote [...] "I am sorry that the chief memory of <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was the worst chucker I ever saw bowl, bracketed equal with Meckiff and the South African, Griffen: that {{and the memory of}} his piano playing - off the field in fact no one was better company". Even his own Sydney crowd shouted [...] "give him a coconut" [...] when he hit the stumps with his bowling ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1836, the unpopular {{government}} of the Duke of Broglie lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and the King needed a new Prime Minister. As he had done in 1830, he chose a man he was certain would soon fail; [...] Adolphe Thiers. On the subject of Thiers, Louis-Philippe told Victor Hugo, [...] "He (Thiers) has spirit, but he is spoiled by {{the spirit of a}} parvenu; [...] he has shown himself to be insatiable." [...] Louis Philippe cited what he said was Talleyrand's view of Thiers: [...] "You will never make anything of Thiers, but nonetheless he will be an excellent instrument. But he is one of those men whom you can make use of only if you give them satisfaction; but he is never satisfied. The misfortune, for you and for <b>him,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you cannot make him a cardinal." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{study of}} {{discrete}} geometric analysis includes a graph-theoretic interpretation of Ihara zeta functions, a discrete analogue of periodic magnetic Schrödinger operators {{as well as}} the large time asymptotic behaviors of random walk on crystal lattices. The study of random walk led him to the discovery of a [...] "mathematical twin" [...] of the diamond crystal out of an infinite universe of hypothetical crystals (2005). He named it the K4 crystal due to its mathematical relevance (see the linked article). What was noticed by <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the K4 [...] crystal has the [...] "strong isotropy property", meaning that for any two vertices x and y of the crystal net, and for any ordering of the edges adjacent to x and any ordering of the edges adjacent to y, there is a net-preserving congruence taking x to y and each x-edge to the similarly ordered y-edge. This property is shared only by the diamond crystal ...|$|E

2500|$|The baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are {{considered}} to be two historically certain facts about Jesus. James Dunn states that these [...] "two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent" [...] and [...] "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts" [...] that they are often the starting points {{for the study of the}} historical Jesus. Bart Ehrman states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of Pontius Pilate is the most certain element about him. John Dominic Crossan states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be. Eddy and Boyd state that it is now [...] "firmly established" [...] that there is non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus. Craig Blomberg states that most scholars in the third quest for the historical Jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable. Christopher M. Tuckett states that, although the exact reasons for the death of Jesus are hard to determine, one of the indisputable facts about <b>him</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was crucified.|$|E
