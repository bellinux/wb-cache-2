50|$|Another {{climb to}} the summit runs {{approaches}} from the east, from the <b>Grutten</b> Hut along the Schutterfeldköpfe. This formerly signed ascent is no longer maintained, however, and is crumbly and prone to rock falls (as at 2005).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Grutten</b> Hut (Gruttenhütte) is an Alpine club hut at {{a height}} of 1620 metres in the Kaisergebirge in Tyrol in Austria. [...] It {{is owned by the}} Turner Alps Kränzchen Section of the German Alpine Club.|$|E
5000|$|The Gamsängersteig {{from the}} <b>Grutten</b> Hut is the normal route and is of medium difficulty. It is {{generally}} well secured, but {{is used on}} good summer's days by countless climbers, {{so there is a}} high risk of falling rocks. It takes 2.5 hours to climb.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Grutten</b> Hut {{was built}} in 1899 on its present site by the Alpen Turner Kränzchen Section and Carl Babenstuber and was ceremonially opened on 14 July 1900. Soon {{afterwards}} a glass veranda, a wash house and a mule stable were built. In 1922 a separate sleeping block, the Josef Dorn Haus was built and in 1925 the then manager of the hut, Hans Eisenmann, created a climbing area through the Wilde Gschloß, the present-day Jubiläumssteig. In 1938 there were further modifications and extensions, including another sleeping block, the Emil Kempfle Haus. During the Second World War the <b>Grutten</b> Hut was commandeered and it remained closed until 1951 after the border opening {{when there was a}} great influx into the Tyrol. In the 1960s further major upgrades and extensions were added. Even after a new well was dug, its supply was hardly any greater, and just before its 100th anniversary a costly sewer conduit was built. This not only ensures the supply of water and drainage, but also provides the lodge with electricity and telephone service. In 2002, the sanitary facilities were modernized and a wooden terrace was built.|$|E
50|$|The hut {{is located}} on the sunny {{southern}} side of the Wilder Kaiser ridge on a grassy terrace high above the villages of Ellmau and Going with an outstanding view that, on clear days, takes in the Großvenediger. Towering above this heavily frequented hut is the Ellmauer Halt that, at 2344 m, is the highest mountain in the Kaisergebirge range. On fine summer days the <b>Grutten</b> Hut is a popular destination for hikers and an important base for mountaineers and climbers, who can set out from here on numerous Alpine tours to the summits of the Wilder Kaiser.|$|E
50|$|The {{base camp}} for {{climbing}} tours on this mountain is the <b>Grutten</b> Hut mountain hut on its southern flank, at {{a height of}} 1,620 m. There is also the unoccupied, tiny Babenstuber Hut, immediately below the summit. This shelter and emergency refuge has stood on the Ellmauer Halt since 1891, but is not weatherproof. In any case the peak should only be climbed in good weather with dry conditions by experienced climbers with secure footwear, no fear of heights and climbing agility. Due to {{the popularity of the}} Ellmauer Halt there is a high risk of falling rocks, especially on the normal path, the Gamsängersteig. A helmet and even a Klettersteig set are therefore recommended.|$|E
50|$|The Ellmauer Tor is {{the most}} {{important}} and most frequently used crossing in the Wilder Kaiser. On clear summer's days countless climbers walk through here. The most famous way leads from the north, from the Stripsenjochhaus through the Steinerne Rinne to the Ellmauer Tor. For this route Alpine experience, secure footing and no fear of heights are indispensable, even though it is well safeguarded. No less popular is the way from the south, from the Wochenbrunner Alm either via the Gaudeamus Hut or via the <b>Grutten</b> Hut and the Jubiläumssteig to Ellmauer Tor. This route is easier, but very exposed to the sun. The Tor has an amazing panorama of the surrounding rock scenery and a view south to the High Tauern, the highest mountains in Austria. It is also the starting point for ascents of the Goinger Halt and Karlspitzen.|$|E
50|$|Amongst mountaineers the Treffauer is {{considered}} an arduous, but nevertheless worthwhile and not especially difficult tour. However, Alpine experience, good fitness, dry conditions, sure-footedness and a head for heights are necessary. The designated normal route to the Treffauer begins in Scheffau and runs via the Jägerwirt, the Alpine meadow of the Kaiser Hochalm, the Snow Cirque (Schneekar) and the shaded western flank taking around 4 hours to reach the summit cross. This route is the easiest by far and, unlike the neighbouring Ellmauer Halt, less challenging. Popular, but not to be underestimated is the crossing to the Tuxeck with its succeeding descent to the <b>Grutten</b> Hut. This requires difficult and unsecured climbing sections of up to UIAA grade III to be overcome; in addition {{there is a high}} risk of rock falls in the confusing terrain. The Treffauer {{is one of the few}} summits in the Wilder Kaiser that does not attract climbers.|$|E
