5|$|As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the President has {{the duty}} to protect the Belarusian {{territory}} from internal and external forces. The president can call <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of emergency in the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the threat of violence. Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the Council of the Republic must be notified by the President and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the President issues a state of martial law {{in the event of}} a possible military action against Belarus. The President has to form and head the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus, and can appoint and dismiss the State Secretary of the Security Council and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J. Hughes of Whatcom County {{proposed the}} formation of a commission to adopt the state flag, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and Adjutant General. Governor Ernest Lister became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state's citizens and city organizations. The campaign <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> flag, however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a state flag to be detrimental to the national flag.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Newsom pushed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> law {{to allow}} {{communities}} in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog.

5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the blind in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf and blind West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf and blind in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the blind. Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> institution for the blind. He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E

5|$|In late September 1933, {{the ship}} left the Bay of Kotor and sailed through the Turkish Straits to Constanța on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, where she {{embarked}} King Alexander and Queen Maria of Yugoslavia. She then visited Balcic in Romania and Varna in Bulgaria, before returning via Istanbul and the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, arriving {{back at the}} Bay of Kotor on 8 October. On 6 October 1934, King Alexander left the Bay of Kotor on board Dubrovnik <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> visit to France, arriving in Marseille on 9 October. He was killed the same day by a Bulgarian assassin, and Dubrovnik conveyed his body back to Yugoslavia, escorted by French, Italian and British ships.|$|E
5|$|Later, on 19 June, Chief of Staff al-Hariri led a {{high-ranking}} delegation that included Prime Minister al-Bitar, Aflaq and Education Minister Sami Droubi to Algeria <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> visit. While al-Hariri was away, the Committee used {{the opportunity to}} undertake a purge of about 30 elite officers—mostly political independents—under al-Hariri's command. Al-Hariri was ordered to take a direct flight to the Syrian embassy in the United States, where he was reassigned as the embassy's military attache. Instead, he returned to Syria via a flight to Beirut on 23 June to protest the Committee's move against him. Unsuccessful, he left the country for France in a self-imposed exile on 8 July. The Committee's virtual ousting of al-Hariri was {{to the chagrin of}} al-Bitar, who viewed al-Hariri as the last military counterweight able to check the Committee's domination over his government.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Florida International University's {{founding}} began in 1943, when state Senator Ernest 'Cap' Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator Bob Graham) presented {{the state legislature}} with the initial proposal {{for the establishment of}} a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a period of building further education infrastructure. To help elementary school teachers further their studies, Soeman took part in establishing a private junior high school in 1953. The following year he helped establish the Setia Dharma Senior High School, the first senior high school in Riau. Minister of Education Mohammad Yamin attended the opening ceremony, where Soeman compared the situation in Riau to that of Aceh and North Sumatra and declared that the people of Riau had been treated like stepchildren. He called for Yamin to send government teachers to support Setia Dharma. Though Yamin objected to Soeman's rhetoric and did not send any teachers to Setia Dharma, he did arrange <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> senior high school to be opened in Riau.|$|E
5|$|University {{president}} Robert Bruininks {{originally planned}} to have the school apply <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> liquor license in order to serve beer and wine in limited areas of the stadium. Under his proposal, alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium season ticket seats ranging in price from $1,800 to $45,000 a year. This is/was consistent with the University's long-held alcohol policy at other on-campus athletic venues, such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena. This {{is also consistent with}} other NCAA institutions (including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan) with on campus stadiums. No Big Ten stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> banner decades later.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E

5|$|Isabel {{wished to}} hold a {{discreet}} and private burial ceremony, but she eventually agreed to the French government's request <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> funeral. On 9 December, thousands of mourners attended the ceremony at La Madeleine. Aside from Pedro's family, these included: FrancescoII, former king of the Two Sicilies; IsabelII, former queen of Spain; Philippe, comte de Paris; {{and other members of}} European royalty. Also present were General Joseph Brugère, representing President Sadi Carnot; the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies as well as their members; diplomats; and other representatives of the French government. Nearly all members of the Institut de France were in attendance. Other governments from the Americas and Europe sent representatives, as did Ottoman Turkey, China, Japan and Persia. Following the services, the coffin was taken in procession to the railway station to begin its trip to Portugal. Around 300,000 people lined the route under incessant rain and cold. The journey continued on to the Church of São Vicente de Fora near Lisbon, where the body of Pedro was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza on 12 December.|$|E
5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University. In 1832, the college applied <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university west of the Mississippi River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder of Rush Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first medical journal west of the Mississippi River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily catered to seminary students rather than the general public, and only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city – Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E
