The particle size distribution of pneumatically conveyed biomass correlates closely with combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions and should therefore be monitored continuously. In this paper, an instrumentation system based on a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric film sensor is proposed, to achieve on-line continuous measurement of biomass particle size distribution. The sensor is attached to an <b>impact</b> <b>bar</b> protruding into the biomass particle flow. The relationship between the resulting impact signals and particle size is modelled mathematically, allowing particle size distribution to be inferred. Experimental work, undertaken with willow chips and miscanthus chips, has allowed both the effectiveness of the on-line particle sizing system and the validity of the mathematical model to be evaluated. The results indicate that the system has good linearity and repeatability. ...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-light {{materials}} with open, periodic cell structures are studied by many scientists, {{because of their}} potential multi-functionality. Our research group invented the new cellular metal named WBK, fabricated with helical forming wires, and has investigated {{the performance of the}} WBK. It has been found that WBK fails by buckling of struts composing WBK. Therefore, for enhancing the resistance against buckling, this work suggests a new idea, that is WBK comprising metal hollow spheres (MHSs) in the inner space, which is named WBK-MHS hybrids. The reason of selecting MHS is that, it also had ultra light weight and high energy absorption. The compressive properties of WBK-MHS hybrid have been investigated and compared to other competitive structures. From the result, the maximum stress and energy absorption are much enhanced in comparison with simple addition of those of the corresponding stand-alone WBK and MHS. The result is attributed to suppression of buckling of struts composing WBK and uniforms deformation over the entire components. The WBK-MHS hybrids out performs competitors in the mechanical performance. Its means Hybrid WBK can widely apply to industry just like car <b>impact</b> <b>bar,</b> bumper and so on...|$|E

The complete numerical proceedure is used to study spall failure in brittle materials.

The sinusoidal pulse leads to a finite region of the bar undergoing failure, rather than a single plane, as occurs with a square or triangular wave pulse. This observation {{may be related to}} experimental findings of multiple spall planes for <b>impacted</b> <b>bars.</b> The numerical method is not restricted to one-dimensional problems, thus we further study the additional features that arise for an <b>impacted</b> <b>bar</b> assuming that the bar deforms under plane stress conditions.

40|$|Direct impact Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar systems offer many potential advantages over split Hopkinson {{pressure bar}}s, including access to higher strain rates, higher strains for equivalent striker velocity and system length, lower dispersion and faster achievement of force equilibrium. Currently advantages are gained at a significant cost: {{the fact that}} input bar data is unavailable removes all information about the striker impacted specimen face, preventing the determination of force equilibrium, and requiring approximations {{to be made on}} the sample deformation history. Recently photon Doppler velocimetry methods have been developed, which can replace strain gauges on Hopkinson bars. In this paper we discuss an experimental method and complementary data analysis for using Doppler velocimetry to measure surface velocities of the striker and output bars in a direct <b>impact</b> <b>bar</b> experiment, allowing similar data to be recorded as in a split bar system, with the same level of convenience.

40|$|Automobile {{safety is}} the {{avoidance}} of automobile accidents or the minimization of harmful effects of accidents, in particular as pertaining to human life and health. Numerous safety features have been built into cars for years. Safety {{is divided into two}} categories, active and passive. Active Safety is systems that use an understanding {{of the state of the}} vehicle to both avoid and minimize the effects of a crash. These include braking systems, like brake assist, traction control systems and electronic stability control systems to help the driver control the vehicle. Meanwhile, passive safety refers to built-in features of a vehicle that help reduce the effects of an accident, such as crumple zones, seatbelts, strong body structures and airbags. Impact test is conduct in 5 different ways such as side, front, pole rollover and offset. During side collision, physical event is a complicated transfer of momentum from striking car to struck car. This project consists of two steps. First is. to develop solid model by using 3 D scanner and convert into simulation environment. Second is to do simulation which consists of setting the boundary condition for restraint, force and then meshing the model.

On the usually densely cratered and vegetation-free surfaces of other terrestrial planets, the forward argumentation is sometimes reversed and usually convincing arguments need to be found against an impact origin (e.g., van Gasselt et al. 2007; Michaelski and Bleacher 2013).

Fracture parameters are the crack velocity and the energy release rate as in general but also the cohesion force which is the equivalent of the dynamic stress intensity factor in 2 dimensions. With these parameters we define two different criteria of propagation, the critical energy release rate and the critical cohesion force. Loading is generated by a striker of variable length, mechanical properties and initial velocity. Then optimization consists in finding the striker giving the maximum crack length for a given kinetic energy. The main results are that the striker should be of same mechanical impedance of the <b>impacted</b> <b>bar</b> and the optimal strike velocity depends on the criterion but should be high compared to the minimum required to initiate the propagation...|$|R

The aim is to improve existing identi"cation methods based on known strains at three uniformly distributed sections by increasing the number of sections considered and by distributing them non-uniformly. The increased number of sections results in an overdetermined system of equations from which an approximate solution for the complex modulus is determined using the method of least squares. Through the non-uniform distribution of sections, critical conditions with accompanying large errors at certain frequencies are largely eliminated. Experimental tests were carried out at room temperature with two materials, viz., polypropylene and polymethyl methacrylate, "ve strain gauge con"gurations and two kinds of impact excitation.
