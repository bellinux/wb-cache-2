5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bill of Rights, but he did tie it <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Under James' grandson, Charles II, a keen racegoer and owner, and James' {{great-granddaughter}} Queen Anne, royal {{support was}} given to racing and the breeding of race horses. With royal support, horse racing became popular with the public, and by 1727, a newspaper devoted to racing, the Racing Calendar, was founded. Devoted <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sport, it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets.|$|E

5|$|In 1688, the Spanish sent {{three more}} expeditions, two by sea {{and one by}} land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, {{discovered}} Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including {{a woman who had}} been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, , wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.|$|E

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived at}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music of Russian composers. One {{included}} the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured {{the final version of}} Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch. Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.|$|E
5|$|In Russia and {{the other}} nations of the former Soviet Union, golden jackals are {{considered}} furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the dressing process. Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In a rare move, District Judge Earnest Lau {{released}} a 14-page judgment explaining the court's denial of Odex's request for Pacific Internet's client information. He compared Odex's demands to an Anton Piller order, which {{provides for the}} right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. Seen as draconian, it is only used under extreme circumstances. He held that only copyright holders themselves, or their exclusive licensees, can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders. Out of all the anime licensed to Odex, only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company. The judge noted that, out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court, ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS), not Odex, to act for the copyright holders. Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$7,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of neurons {{in the deep}} nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400μm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. These cells project {{to a variety of}} targets outside the cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and project <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inferior olivary nucleus, the source of climbing fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the excitatory projection of climbing fibers to the nuclei. There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells projects to the same cluster of olivary cells that send climbing fibers to it; there is strong and matching topography in both directions.|$|E
5|$|The Dude {{finds his}} {{bungalow}} completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged {{him so that}} his goons could look for the ransom money at the Dude's home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude protests being a father, but Maude tells him {{that he will not}} be involved in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family charity. Having an epiphany, the Dude and Walter travel to the Lebowski estate, while the Dude explains: when Lebowski, who apparently hated his wife, heard of the kidnapping, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude a briefcase without any money in it, saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and the Dude confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, but is thrown out of his wheelchair by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.|$|E
