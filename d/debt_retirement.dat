Nevertheless, today 2 ̆ 7 s retirees and near-retirees have large amounts of debt. On a lower fixed income, health problems can exacerbate the debt burden of retirees, especially if they hold mortgage or credit card debt. Using data from the 2010 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this study profiles debt-burdened retirees age 65 or older, and investigates factors associated with the likelihood of holding mortgage debt and credit card <b>debt</b> in <b>retirement.</b> The sample for this study included 7, 383 older adults. About 38 percent of them held debt from mortgages, home equity loans, and/or consumer debt. Specifically, 24. 4 percent reported having consumer debt (M = 2, 494), and 17 percent reported a mortgage balance (M = 17, 087). The logistic regression results indicated that, all else being equal, college education, higher numbers of physical health problems, and being married significantly predicted the likelihood of holding mortgage and consumer <b>debt</b> during <b>retirement.</b> Older adults frequently carry <b>debt</b> into <b>retirement,</b> which may result in financial distress. About 17 percent of retirees in our sample were still paying their mortgages, and a quarter of them continued to owe credit card or medical debt. On a lower fixed income, paying down these debts could be particularly burdensome. Some retirees may need to borrow against their homes or sell them. However, with the decline of the housing market, many may not have enough equity in their homes.

40|$|Orientation: This article {{reports on}} a quantitative-relational study {{addressing}} the impact of sense of coherence (SOC), which is a psychological-wellness construct, on the financial-health profile of employees in an insurance company. Research purpose: The objective {{of the study was}} to explore the relationship between psychological wellness as operationalised in the SOC construct and in financial health. Motivation for the study: Financial pressure can be a major stressor in the workplace, affecting employees’ ability to function optimally. The debt crisis in South Africa is therefore necessitating employers to invest in the financial health of their employees. In light of the National Credit Act 34 of 2005, employers should, in fact, provide debt counselling to employees struggling with financial problems. In the South African context, however, studies investigating the potential influence of psychological-wellness constructs on financial health are lacking. Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey design was applied and a quantitative-relational approach followed. From the 1 100 employees in a financial insurance company, 435 completed questionnaires were received. Main findings: The empirical results indicated a significant relationship between the variables, confirming that a stronger SOC impacts positively on employees’ financial health. A stronger SOC therefore relates positively to more effective <b>debt</b> management and <b>retirement</b> planning. Practical/managerial implications: The findings emphasised the importance of <b>debt</b> management and <b>retirement</b> planning being addressed and integrated into employee-assistance strategies and programmes. Contribution/value-add: This study is a significant step in addressing financial health from a psychological perspective. </p...|$|R

40|$|We use {{data from}} several {{waves of the}} Survey of Consumer Finances to {{document}} credit and debit card ownership and use across US demographic groups. We then present recent theoretical and empirical contributions {{to the study of}} credit and debit card behavior. Utilization rates of credit lines and portfolios of card holders present several puzzles. Credit line increases initiated by banks lead households to restore previous utilization rates. High-interest credit card debt co-exists with substantial holdings of low-interest liquid assets and with accumulation of retirement assets. Although available evidence disputes ignorance of credit card terms by card holders, credit card rates do not respond to competition. There is a rising trend in bankruptcy and delinquency, partly attributable to an increased tendency of households to declare bankruptcy associated with reduced social stigma, ease of procedures, and financial incentives. Co-existence of credit card <b>debt</b> with <b>retirement</b> assets can be explained through self-control hyperbolic discounting. Strategic default motives contribute partly to observed co-existence of credit card debt with low-interest liquid assets. A framework of “accountant-shopper” households, in which a rational accountant tries to control an impulsive shopper, seems consistent with both types of co-existence and with observed utilization of credit lines.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on corporate finance. In the first chapter, I investigate how a liquidity cost associated with debt- `debt servicing cost' affects a firm's capital structure policy. In contrast to the standard capital structure theory prediction that builds on a trade-off between interest tax shields and expected bankruptcy costs, public firms use debt quite conservatively. To address this well known debt conservatism puzzle (Graham 2000), I argue that servicing debt drains valuable liquidity for a financially constrained firm and hence endogenously creates `debt servicing costs,' which have received little attention in the literature. To examine the influence of debt servicing costs on capital structure choices, I develop and estimate a dynamic corporate finance model with interest tax shields, liquidity management, investment, external {{debt and equity financing}} costs, and capital adjustment costs. By using the marginal value of liquidity as a natural measure of the debt servicing costs, I find that (1) an increase in financial leverage results in higher debt servicing costs, even with risk-free debt. (2) a smaller firm tends to experience greater debt servicing costs because of its endogenously large investment demands; and (3) in the majority of cases, equity proceeds are used for cash retention as well as capital expenditure, especially when a firm faces large current and future investment needs. In addition, I quantitatively show that large debt servicing costs are closely associated with low leverage and frequent equity financing by analyzing the role of fixed operating costs and convex capital adjustment costs. In the second chapter, I empirically support the theoretical debt servicing costs analysis of the previous chapter. I firstly examine the structural estimation method used for the calibration of my model in the first chapter. The statistical property of the simulated method of moments estimator and detailed identification scheme for the calibration are investigated {{in the first half of}} this chapter. Then I cross-sectionally confirm the validity of debt servicing costs predictions on capital structure choices. I study how each firm's convex capital adjustment costs, operating leverage, profit volatility, and future investment needs influence capital structure policies. Consistent with the debt servicing costs predictions, firms with higher convex capital adjustment costs, higher operating leverage, higher profit volatility and larger future investment demands show lower leverage ratios and more frequent equity financing activities. These findings shed new lights on pervasively conservative debt policy in U. S. public firms. A higher profitability observed in large future investment demands firms also suggests the importance of debt servicing costs consideration in resolving the puzzling negative correlation between profitability and leverage ratios. In the third chapter, I examine how macroeconomic conditions affect the cyclical variations in capital structure policies. As in the financial crisis of 2008, economic contractions affect a firm's profitability, investments and external financing conditions altogether. To address the effects of these simultaneous changes on capital structure dynamics, I develop and estimate a dynamic trade-off model with investment, payouts, and liquidity policies with macroeconomic profitability and financing shocks. Investment dynamics and a higher value of liquidity of economic downturn are pivotal in capital structure dynamics; the former drives the issuance of debt and equity, and the latter leads to active <b>debt</b> <b>retirements</b> and conservative <b>debt</b> issues in upturns. My model yields the following main results: (1) Equity issues are pro-cyclical, and concentrated for small, low profit, and large investment demand firms in earlier stage of economic upturns. (2) Payouts peak in later stages of upturns and co-move positively with equity issues; (3) Debt policies move counter-cyclically, and leverage ratios after <b>debt</b> issuance and <b>retirement</b> are even higher during economic downturns. My comparative static analysis predicts pro-cyclical debt policy for financially constrained firms, and pervasively conservative use of debt for firms expecting financial market shutdowns, a sharp profitability drop, or a longer stay in economic downturns...|$|R

President Kirchner defended the policy as a cost-saving maneuver, whereby government bonds paying out 15 percent interest would be retired from the market. The move, however, also provided numerous vulture funds (holdouts from the 2005 debt restructuring who had resorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds) a legal argument against the central bank's independence, thus facilitating a judgment lien on 12 January against a central bank account in New York.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Attitudes to Pensions Survey series aims to investigate attitudes to pensions and private financial preparations for later life in Great Britain. The baseline survey was conducted in 2006 with a follow-up conducted in 2009. These two surveys were both conducted by NatCen Social Research {{on behalf of the}} Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The 2012 survey was conducted by TNS BMRB on behalf of DWP. One of the key aims of the survey series is to examine continuity and change in attitudes to financial planning for retirement over time so a large number of the questions have been repeated over all three surveys. The Attitudes to Pensions Survey, 2012 is the third survey in the series. Although the survey retains key questions from the previous surveys in the series, the sample definition and questionnaire are two key areas of change in the 2012 survey. For the 2012 survey, the upper age limit for participation in the survey of 69, in place in the two previous surveys, was removed so that anyone aged 18 or over was eligible to take part. This reflected the need to research issues around policies aimed at redefining retirement, encouraging more flexible working and extending working life. The questionnaire was changed to reflect the changing policy environment in particular: inclusion of more attitudes to reflect automatic aspects of behaviour questions included to reflect changing circumstance/policy interest less emphasis on some details (e. g. provision) a new section on automatic enrolment Main Topics : The interview covered: pensions knowledge (including knowledge of own State Pension Age), attitudes to pensions, attitudes to saving, pension provision, automatic enrolment in to workplace pensions, savings for <b>retirement,</b> <b>debt,</b> expectations for <b>retirement,</b> when expect to retire from paid work, reasons for age of retirement (if retired), expected or actual level of income in retirement and demographic information...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} {{of the market for}} {{retirement}} products in Chile has its origins in the pension reform that was implemented in 1981. But the successful development of an active annuity market also reflects many other factors. This paper summarizes and updates an earlier longer study {{on the development of the}} Chilean annuity market. The update focuses on the numerous changes that were introduced in 2008. The most striking aspect of the Chilean experience is the very high rate of annuitization. This has been linked to the restrictions that have been applied to lump-sum withdrawals, the offer of inflation-protected annuities, and the robust prudential regulation of providers. But the level of annuitization has also been supported by the annuitization incentives provided to early retirees and the influence of brokers and sales agents. The recent regulatory changes have weakened the impact of the last two factors, while strengthening the demand for annuities at normal <b>retirement.</b> <b>Debt</b> Markets,Pensions&Retirement Systems,Insurance&Risk Mitigation,Emerging Markets,Non Bank Financial Institutions...|$|R
