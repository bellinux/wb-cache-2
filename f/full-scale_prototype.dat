5|$|Such a large glider {{had never}} been {{constructed}} before by the British military, and to test the design, a half-scale prototype model was first designed; designated GAL. 50 it still required an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber {{to act as a}} tug to get it airborne, and was first flown in September 1941. However, it only flew once; the test pilot approached the landing area too low, attempted to raise the flaps for extra glide, and instead crashed the prototype and wrecked it. However, the trial was considered to be a success and the first <b>full-scale</b> <b>prototype</b> model was finished at GAL's works in Hanworth, Middlesex in March 1942. The Hamilcar was transported to RAF Snaith in Yorkshire, as GAL's airfield at Hanworth was too short for the glider to take off from; moving the glider to a secure military airfield would also ensure that it remained secret. Its first flight was conducted on 27 March 1942, towed by a Handley Page Halifax bomber. A second prototype was completed in June 1942, and further testing and development took place at a number of different airfields, including the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment at RAF Beaulieu; all flight trials appear to have been successful, and there were few differences between the prototypes and the production models.|$|E
25|$|Manned {{models are}} {{considered}} by maritime pilots {{as the next}} best thing to a <b>full-scale</b> <b>prototype</b> for understanding a ship's behaviour. Those who have trained on both claim that scale models are complementary to computer simulators. While manoeuvres with currents, waves, tugs, anchors, bank effects, etc. are reproduced more accurately on scale models, numerical simulators are more realistic when it comes to the bridge environment.|$|E
25|$|Oszkár von Asboth {{was one of}} the {{researchers}} at Fischamend. In 1917 he commissioned Ufag to make a <b>full-scale</b> <b>prototype</b> to his own design, but it was destroyed in a fire before completion. After the war he went on to build and fly several more helicopters. One was constructed in 1920 but later destroyed on the order of the Allied Control Commission. Subsequent examples based on the PKZ-2 design were designated AH-1 to AH-4 and made over 150 successful flights between 1928 and 1930. Von Asboth later set up companies in Britain and France to promote his twin-rotor designs, and at least one machine was built by the French company.|$|E

25|$|On 6 December 1978, Embraer {{was officially}} awarded a {{contract}} to produce two prototypes and two airframes for fatigue tests. The specifications were concluded in February 1979, and the main differences from the EMB-311 were the more powerful PT6A-25C engine, raised rear cockpit, {{and the addition of}} ejection seats. Eventually, the original specifications underwent a major modification, including a smaller fuselage with an upright cruciform tail instead of a swept-back tail; a more domed canopy; extended elevators; greater distance between the nosewheel and back wheel; reduction of the wing root; and an increased wingspan, tailplane, and landing gear. By late 1979, a full-scale mock-up was built with a cockpit for the evaluation of flight instruments, and a subscale, radio-controlled research model was designed to evaluate the free-flight characteristics before building a <b>full-scale</b> <b>prototype.</b>|$|E

50|$|Prototypes were {{produced}} even as development work was continuing—a system {{demanded by the}} use of composite materials, as the tooling required is very expensive and has to be built for production use from the outset. Beech built three airworthy <b>full-scale</b> <b>prototypes.</b> NC-1 was used for aerodynamic testing and was the only Starship equipped with conventional electro-mechanical avionics. NC-2 was used for avionics and systems testing and NC-3 was used for flight management system and powerplant testing. NC-1 first flew on February 15, 1986.|$|R

25|$|The envisioned {{test program}} {{was to have}} been quite thorough, which would have {{involved}} subjected full-scale aircraft to the severe temperatures anticipated at Mach 2.5 flight via a purpose-built heat chamber; upon reaching the flight testing phase, the prototypes had been scheduled to perform a total of 1,400 flight hours. The first prototype, which had received the internal designation Avro 731, a three-eighths scale aircraft for testing purposes, was scheduled to fly in 1959. A pair of Avro 731 prototypes were set to be built and flown in advance of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>prototypes.</b>|$|R

Brennan's design was given serious consideration for the North-West Frontier of India, and a Schilovski monorail was proposed by the USSR government between Leningrad and Tsarskoye Selo in 1921.

Experiments to study airflow similarity in ceiling slot-ventilated agricultural enclosures using different similarity criteria were conducted on two scale models.
