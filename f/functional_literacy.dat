40|$|<b>Functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> is one {{path through}} which the {{educational}} system, health system, culture and society intersect to influence health outcomes and their associated costs. Inadequate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> can impair oral and written communication and subsequently the ability to understand the prevention and self-management of disease. Despite these concerns, the national prevalence of inadequate, marginal and adequate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> and their association with health status, health care utilization and subsequent health care outcomes remain largely unknown. For those tasked with the responsibility of managing population health, there is a void of tools and techniques {{that can be used}} to efficiently identify those at greatest risk of inadequate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy.</b> Using standard regression modeling and diagnostic techniques, this study was the first to develop and validate a model to estimate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> and to confirm its direct relationship with preventive health services utilization in a nationally representative sample of elderly >= 65 years of age. The national prevalence of inadequate and marginal <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> was estimated to be 39 %. Preventive health care utilization varied by <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> category. Individuals with inadequate or marginal <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> had odds of not receiving a flu shot within the past 12 months that was 1. 26 times that of individuals with adequate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> (OR = 1. 26, 95 % CI (1. 11 - 1. 43)) after controlling for income, insurance coverage, having a usual source of care, and self-reported general health status.

This research confirms the national public health relevance of <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> in preventive health care utilization in the elderly.

This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and <b>functional</b> <b>literacy</b> programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure {{the health and well-being of}} families, including information and advice on family planning.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Refugees have poorer health {{compared}} to indigenous populations, {{which may be}} explained by lower health literacy, i. e. not being able to access, understand, appraise or apply health information. This study aims to determine levels of functional and comprehensive health literacy, and factors associated with inadequate health literacy, in refugees coming to Sweden. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed among 455 adult refugees speaking Arabic, Dari, Somali or English. Participants in 16 strategically selected language schools for immigrants responded to a questionnaire. Health literacy was measured using the Swedish <b>Functional</b> Health <b>Literacy</b> Scale and the HLS-EU-Q 16 questionnaire. Uni- and multivariate statistical methods were used to investigate group differences. RESULTS: The majority of the participating refugees had inadequate or limited <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> and comprehensive health literacy. About 60 % of them had inadequate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> and 27 % had inadequate comprehensive health literacy. Low education and/or being born in Somalia were factors associated with an increased risk of having inadequate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy.</b> Having inadequate <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> was associated with an increased risk of having inadequate comprehensive health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of refugees in the language schools had limited or poor health literacy. Health literacy should be taken into consideration in contexts and in activities addressing migrants. More research is needed to better understand health literacy among refugees and to develop strategies and methods to increase health literacy and make life easier for those with low health literacy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Much of the {{evidence}} of an association between low <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> and poor health comes from studies that include people who have various cognitive difficulties or who do not speak the dominant language of their society. Low <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> among these people {{is likely to be}} evident in spoken conversation. However, many other people can talk readily about health and other issues but have problems using written information. Consequently, their difficulties may be far less evident to healthcare professionals, creating a 'hidden population' whose <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> problems have different implications because {{they are less likely to}} be recognised and addressed. We aimed to review published research to investigate relationships between low <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> and health in working age adults who can converse in the dominant language but have difficulty with written language. Methods We searched reviews and electronic databases for studies that examined health-related outcomes among the population of interest. We systematically extracted data relating to relationships between low <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> and both health status and various possible mediators or moderators of the implications of literacy for health. We developed a narrative review. Results Twenty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. Lower <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> in this population was found to be associated with worse health status. This may be mediated by difficulties accessing healthcare, and poorer self-management of health problems. It is currently unclear whether, how or to what extent these difficulties are mediated by poorer knowledge stemming from low <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy.</b> The variation in <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> measures and comparisons make it difficult to compare study findings and to establish the implications of different literacy issues for health outcomes. Conclusions There is evidence in the literature that low <b>functional</b> or health <b>literacy</b> is associated with poor health in the 'hidden population' of adults whose literacy difficulties may not be evident to health care providers. Further research is needed to help understand the particular disadvantages faced by this population and to establish appropriate responses. </p...|$|R

This correlational study was designed to examine the relationship between the <b>functional</b> health <b>literacy</b> of ADN students and their awareness of their patients 2 ̆ 7 health literacy needs using the asset model and the health literate care model. A convenience sample of 131 ADN students in their last 2 semesters of nursing school completed the Test of <b>Functional</b> Health <b>Literacy</b> in Adults (TOFHLA) and the Knowledge and Skills Survey. Pearson correlation, linear regression, multivariate analysis of variance, and Spearman correlation were used to analyze the demographics of students, TOFHLA, and Knowledge and Skills Survey scores.

The results supported the need for improved training and support for students on the topic of health literacy along with opportunities for further research.
