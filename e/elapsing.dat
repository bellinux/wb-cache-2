40|$|Summary. We explore Bayesian {{analysis}} for continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models {{based on a}} conditional reference prior. For CTMC models, inference of the <b>elapsed</b> time be-tween chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the <b>elapsed</b> time increases. Moreover, improper priors on the <b>elapsed</b> time may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition to the <b>elapsed</b> time, an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes the CTMC. Usually, experts have good prior knowledge about {{the parameters of the}} infinitesimal rate matrix, and thus can provide well-informed priors. We show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the <b>elapsed</b> time yields a proper posterior distribution. Finally, we demonstrate that, when compared to anal-yses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, Bayesian analysis on the <b>elapsed</b> time based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The conditional reference prior therefore represents a better default prior choice for widely-used estimation software...|$|R

In multiple laser exposures, the acrylate continues to shrink; whereas (University of Dayton data) no additional shrinkage is observed in epoxy strands on a second hit. In force relaxation tests, a strand is drawn and then a 0. 5 % step strain is applied after different <b>elapsed</b> times.
