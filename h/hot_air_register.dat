5000|$|For heating purposes, a floor {{register}} is preferred. This {{is because}} <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> rises, {{and as it}} cools it falls. This creates good air circulation in a room, and helps to maintain a more even temperature as <b>hot</b> and cold <b>air</b> is mixed more thoroughly. Floor registers generally have a grille strong enough for a human being to walk on without damaging the grille. It is rare to find a floor register installed less than 6 in {{from the corner of}} a room. When a floor register is not practical or desired, a wall register is used. The correct placement of wall heating registers is critical. Generally, the heating register will be directly across from an exterior window. The <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> from the <b>register</b> will mix with the cold air coming off the window, cool, and drop to the floor—creating good air circulation. However, the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> must be pushed from the register with enough force (or [...] "throw") so that it will cross the room and reach the window. If there is too little throw, the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> will stop moving partway across the room, the cold air from the window will not be heated (creating the feeling of a cool draft), and air circulation will suffer.|$|R

40|$|Dried fish is {{commonly}} produced by convective <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> drying. Microwave technology {{was presented in}} this paper to improve both process and product quality. Catfish (order Siluriformes) slices were dehydrated in a microwave assisted <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> convective dehydration (MWHA) system to investigate the effects of microwave power and <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature on drying time, dehydration behaviour, energy consumption and colour of dried fish. Three different microwave power outputs namely medium (373 W), medium low (217 W) and low (91 W) combined with convective <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature of 40 °C, 70 °C and 130 °C accordingly were employed in the drying experiments. Results show that microwave accelerates drying time up to 120 folds faster compared to drying with <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> convective alone. It was also noted that increasing the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature was not as significant as increasing the microwave power in reducing the drying time. Experiments show that drying time was reduced about 75 % when an increase of microwave power from low (91 W) to medium mode (373 W) combining with convective <b>hot</b> <b>air.</b> However, drying with microwave alone required longer drying time. Energy consumption analysis shows that microwave assisted drying process requires less energy usage.

40|$|AbstractComparison of drying {{characteristics}} of Thompson seedless grapes using combined microwave oven and <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer was investigated. The drying rate curves indicated {{the absence of}} a constant-rate drying period in all drying methods. Within a certain microwave power range (75 – 900 W in the current study), increasing microwave power speeds up the drying process, thus shortening the drying time. No benefits were seen when increasing drying time from 30 to 120 min when grapes drying started in <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer and finished in microwave oven for 1 min at any power level. The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated. The average total soluble solids was 90. 4 ° Brix when drying was achieved by microwave oven followed by <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer, meanwhile, it was 90. 2 ° Brix when drying was achieved by <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer followed by microwave oven. The total soluble solid was 92 ° Brix when drying process started and finished in <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer alone. The average drying ratio was 4. 21 when drying was achieved by microwave oven followed by <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer; meanwhile, it was 4. 19 when drying was achieved by <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer followed by microwave oven. The <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet drying method had higher drying constant ‘k’ compared to the other two methods.
