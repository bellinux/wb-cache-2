5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion.

5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening.

When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to work, they assembled themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> yards.

5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance.

40|$|Genes can be {{activated}} or inhibited by signals within <b>the</b> tissues <b>in</b> {{response to an}} acute bout of exercise. It is unclear how a particular aerobic exercise bout may influence two muscles with similar actions to the activity. Therefore, {{the purposes of this}} investigation was to determine the gene response of selected genes involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> "stress" response of the gastrocnemius (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscles to a single two hour aerobic exercise bout in female Sprague-Dawley Rats at the 1 hour time point after <b>the</b> <b>exercise.</b> Exercised rats were run (n= 8) for 2 hours at 20 m. min- 1 and one hour after the completion of the bout had their soleus (S) and gastrocnemius (G) muscles removed. Age and timed matched sedentary control rats had both S and G muscles removed also. RNA was isolated from all muscles. Real-time PCR analysis was performed on the following genes: NFκB, TNFα, and Atf 3. GAPDH was used as the housekeeping gene for both muscles. S muscle showed more genes altered (n = 52) vs G (n = 26). NFκB gene expression was 0. 83 ± 0. 14 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercised</b> S but was + 1. 36 ± 0. 58 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercised</b> G and was not significantly different between the muscles. TNFα was altered 1. 30 ± 0. 34 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercised</b> S and 1. 36 ± 0. 71 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercised</b> G and was not significantly different between the muscles. The gene Atf 3 was significantly altered at 4. 97 ± 1. 01 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercised</b> S, while it was not significantly altered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercised</b> G (0. 70 ± 0. 55). This study demonstrates that an acute bout of aerobic exercise can alter gene expression to a different extent <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> S and G muscles. It is highly likely that muscle recruitment was a factor which influenced <b>the</b> gene expression <b>in</b> theses muscles.

5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially {{released from the}} requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was {{the focal point of}} the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E

In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} research {{aimed to explore}} the relationship between director and exercitant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> giving of <b>the</b> Spiritual <b>Exercises</b> of Ignatius of Loyola (1491 - 1556).

The research reported here was a phenomenological exploration of the experience of 24 directors of <b>the</b> Spiritual <b>Exercises</b> <b>in</b> Australia, including 11 Jesuits, 3 religious and 10 lay people, overall, 14 men and 10 women, ranging in age between 30 and 90. An indepth semi-structured interview was conducted with each of these participants, exploring their experience of receiving and giving <b>the</b> <b>Exercises,</b> as well as their different paths of formation to become a director. A particular focus of the research was on the place of psychodynamics occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationship between director and exercitant. The research results suggest that the relationship between the director and exercitant parallels the exercitant's experience of God <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Exercises; further that there are parallels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the director and <b>the</b> exercitant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exercises,</b> which are somewhat similar to that between therapist and patient in psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Findings of this research are discussed, including themes that emerged from the participants' interviews: transformation and healing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exercises,</b> <b>the</b> complexities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of the director, understanding of psychodynamics, and supervision of directors.
