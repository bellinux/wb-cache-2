It commonly occurs when a motorist decelerates from speeds of around [...] to about , which results in severe vibrations being transmitted to the driver. These vibrations are the result of uneven thermal distributions, or hot spots. Hot spots are classified as concentrated thermal regions that alternate between both sides of a disc that distort {{it in such a way}} that produces a sinusoidal waviness around its edges. Once the brake pads (friction material/brake lining) comes in contact with the sinusoidal surface during braking, severe vibrations are induced, and can produce hazardous conditions for the person driving the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} brake-induced {{noises and}} vibrations, <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> is forced vibration, which is caused by {{unevenness}} of the brake disc due to the thermal mechanical interactions in wheel brakes. Brake disc unevenness is normally described and evaluated as the Disc Thickness Variation (DTV) and the disc’ Lateral Run-Out (LRO). DTV and LRO gener-ate Brake Pressure Variation (BPV) and Brake Torque Variation (BTV) in wheel brakes, which are transmitted to the driver and perceived by the driver as the brake pedal pulsa-tion, the steering wheel oscillation, the car body vibrations, and low-frequency drone noises inside a vehicle. <b>Hot</b> <b>judder</b> is characterized by hot spots on the disc surfaces. The frequency of <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> {{is dependent on the}} wheel rotational speed, showing order behaviors. The num-ber of hot spots generally corresponds to the dominant order of <b>hot</b> <b>judder.</b> In the last decades, most of the <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> tests have been carried out with brake dynamometers, and high numbers (typically around 10) of hot spots were found in the majority of the tests. The generation and development mechanisms of the high dominant order have been almost the exclusive focus of current <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> researches. However, the influ-ences of the vibrations and noises (with higher frequencies compared with the low-order cold judder) caused by high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> on the driver’s subjective perception have been still not clarified. That is to say, it is still unknown in which form and under which conditions, the high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> can be transmitted to and perceived by the driver, and thus causing customer complaints. A top-down approach is used in order to investigate the influences of high-order judder on driver’s perception with respect to two aspects: the incidence of high-order hot jud-der in vehicle tests and the drivers’ perception of high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder.</b> The first aspect is mainly investigated by studying the transferability of dynamometer tests to vehicle tests and by identifying the incidence of high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> in production brakes. Specifically, identical brakes from one front brake and one rear brake are separately tested with a brake dynamometer and through vehicle tests by means of road tests and chassis dynamometer tests, and all brakes of four production passengers are identified with accelerometers attached on the brake caliper and the caliper bracket. The perception of high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> is chiefly studied by investigating its transfer behaviors. Global transfer functions from BPV/BTV to the selected driver interface quantities (brake pedal pulsation, steering wheel oscillation, seat track vibrations, and vehicle interior drone noise) are defined, which establish the links between the <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> intensity in the wheel brake and the intensity at the driver interface. In order to identify the transfer functions with a high signal-noise-ratio and better reproducibility, a novel testing method is adopted: vehicle tests with brake discs that are artificially modi-fied with the desired surface shapes simulating the high-order DTV/LRO. Altogether three vehicles with seven different modified discs are tested. Two critical levels of drone noise (60 and 80 dB(A)) are selected according to the general vehicle total noise level and the human’s perception characteristics of sound. The perception threshold values of the driver interface vibrations are obtained through regression analysis between their subjective ratings and objective measurements. Based on the critical drone noise levels and the threshold values of vibrations, as well as the global transfer functions, threshold values of BPV and BTV for perceiving the high-order judder are computed. Concerning the incidence of high-order judder, both the dominant order and the thermal increases of BTV and BPV for the dominant order showed great discrepancies in differ-ent test types (e. g. brake dynamometer or vehicle, drag braking application with con-stant velocity and constant pressure/torque or stop braking application with decreasing velocity and constant deceleration/pressure). <b>Hot</b> <b>judder</b> behaviors in the brake dyna-mometer test were not transferable to the vehicle tests. Besides, no evident high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> has been identified in all the brakes of the four passenger cars. Generally, <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> seems to be more likely to be excited at the brake dynamometer than in the vehi-cles. Therefore, brake dynamometer test is still appropriate for detecting <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> in the early phase of brake development, and thus preventing its occurrence in the vehicle. Regarding the driver’s perception, the drone noise is the most probable reason leading to customer complaints, since higher than 100 Hz less than 10 Nm BTV is required to perceive the drone noise and 50 Nm BTV can already result in unacceptable drone noise. The driver is less sensitive to the vibrations caused by high-order judder. Roughly at least 20 Nm BTV or 2. 5 bar BPV is needed for perceiving the vibrations, and the perception is most possibly due to the steering wheel oscillation or the vertical vehicle vibration. Moreover, some resonances in the transfer paths {{play a significant role in}} the high-order judder transmission. Although the investigations in this work are limited to three vehicles, the practical significance of high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> on the driver’s percep-tion is revealed for the first time. With these results, the impact of the measured BTV and BPV of <b>hot</b> <b>judder,</b> e. g. in the brake dynamometer tests, can be assessed. Combining these results, the most effective and efficient way to mitigate the high-order <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> would be reducing its occurrences in the wheel brakes and diminishing the prominent resonances in the transfer paths...|$|E
40|$|Brake judder is a {{phenomenon}} of noise which its vibration can be felt physically by the driver of a vehicle. If this vibration is exposed to the driver {{for a long period}} it can lead to tiredness during driving. There are two types of judder which is cold judder and <b>hot</b> <b>judder.</b> This paper will be focusing on the <b>hot</b> <b>judder.</b> As a disc surface heats up during braking it causes both sides of the disc distort and hence produce a sinusoidal waviness around its edges. In this paper finite element analysis of <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> is performed using a commercial software package, ABAQUS. An existing brake disc design is simulated and will be used as a baseline model. Various structural modifications made on the disc are proposed in an attempt to reduce brake judder in a disc brake assembly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Hot</b> <b>judder</b> {{characteristics}} of a ventilated disc brake system are discussed. Three dimensional finite element models of the ventilated disc, pads and pistons are created, and a fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of the <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> phenomenon of the disc brake system is performed using SAMCEF. The brake dynamo test is carried out according to the high speed judder test mode. The evolution of the temperature distribution on the disc surface is described, and the hot spot generation process is investigated. The simulation results such as the maximum disc temperature, BTV are compared to {{the data from the}} dynamo test, and the reliabilities of the analysis technique and simulation model presented in this paper are verified...|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} forces generated during braking between brake pads and discs produce high thermal gradients on the rubbing surfaces. These thermal gradients may cause braking {{problems such as}} brake fade, premature wear or hot spotting and the associated <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> phenomenon in the frequency range below 100 Hz. Further consequences are comfort reductions, a defective braking process, inhomogeneous wear, cutbacks of the brake performance and even damage of brake components. The present paper proposes a modeling concept that is targeted on this field of application and introduces the new Modelica class ThermoelasticPlate, which is implemented in the DLR FlexibleBodies library...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{hot spot}} {{generation}} {{has been considered}} as the main degradation mechanism in railway brake disc. Therefore, the understanding of hot spots, also called <b>hot</b> <b>judder,</b> which is undesirable low frequency vibrations developed by non-uniform contact area between brake pad material and brake disc, is important for {{a better understanding of}} material design as well as enhancement of materials properties in railway brake disc. Also, infrared (IR) thermography is a powerful NDE technique for the characterization of thermal phenomenon in engineering components and/or systems including engineering materials. The high-speed IR camera provides the measurement of temperature change during brake operation as well as the images of temperature contour on the brake disc surface. In this investigation, damage evolution due to generation of hot spots on railway brake disc was investigated using the infrared thermography method. Moreover, based on obtained thermographic images of hot spots, the hot spots and thermal damage of railway brake disc during braking operation were qualitatively analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Friction braking is {{necessarily}} related to high thermal loads which may cause {{problems such as}} hot spotting and the associated <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> phenomenon. The driver may experience brake judder as vibrations in the frequency range below 100 Hz in the steering wheel, brake pedal and floor. It is state-of-the-art to investigate the thermal and thermoelastic behaviour of brakes in elaborate finite element studies, which provide high resolution results but require a high computational effort. As a consequence, thermal and thermoelastic issues could not be considered so far in brake models intended {{to be used for}} a system-dynamical analysis of the complete vehicle that may necessary to set up control strategies such as electronic stability programs. With this backgrouns, the article introduces a new method to model brake discs and to account for their thermal amd thermoelastic behaviour while braking in a very efficient way. Effects such as the temperature dependency on friction and the change of contact conditions between the disc and the pad caused by thermal and mechanical influences may be considered with much less computational effort and an acceptable accuracy when compared with the finite element method...|$|E
40|$|Judder {{may fall}} under the {{headings}} of cold or <b>hot</b> <b>judder</b> but {{by far the most}} complex to understand is <b>hot</b> <b>judder.</b> This may result from rotor deformation or an effect referred to as "hot spotting". It is clear that to minimise the occurrence of thermal judder it is necessary to avoid excessive heating of the rotor {{and at the same time}} avoid significant variation in temperature across the rotor. To this end the designer must ensure uniform heat dissipation from the rotor. In high performance braking applications vented discs are normally used as these provide a greater cooling surface. These discs increase cooling efficiency by employing braking surfaces (blades) separated by a number of "ribs" or "vanes" which allow air to pass between the two blades. To increase cooling efficiency some vented discs use pins to separate the braking surfaces as this arrangement increases the available area to dissipate the heat. The cooling efficiency of the brake discs depends on two parameters; the mass flow rate of air through the disc and the effective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the disc blades and vent vanes/pins. "Pin" type vented discs have been found to be good at increasing heat transfer coefficient but mass flow rates through such discs are generally smaller when compared to vane type discs. This paper attempts to define a plausible way of controlling the shape of the columns within a pin vented disc with a view to finding an optimised configuration for a disc consisting of three rows of 36 "pins" positioned so that their centre lines are separated by ten degrees, with the central row of pins offset by five degrees to the outer and inner rows. The optimisation of this "pin" arrangement attempts to increase the average heat transfer coefficient and the wetted area in order to enhance the aero-thermal characteristics of the disc to increase heat dissipation from the rotor in a uniform manner and hence decrease the discs tendency to judder. The results presented within clearly show the advantages of increasing the pumping efficiency of the brake rotor; this is demonstrated by the "high mass flow rate" design. It has also been shown that increasing the width of the second an third rows of pins produces a decrease in the flow rate through the disc whereas the first row has an optimal width that creates a venturi at the inlet which aids inlet velocities. A reasonable correlation has been demonstrated between the results from the computational fluid dynamic analysis and those gained from empirical formulas as well as previous computational studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Brake judder is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} occurring in di erent types of vehicles. The judder frequency is {{directly proportional to}} the revolution speed of the wheel and therefore also to the velocity of the vehicle. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and oor. In the higher frequency range, the structural vibrations are accompanied by a sound. Brake judder primarily a ects the comfort but could, when confronting an inexperienced driver for the rst time, lead to faulty reactions and reduced driving safety. Furthermore, a speci c type of judder, so-called <b>hot</b> <b>judder,</b> is related to disc cracking. There are numerous publications available dealing with high frequency vibrations, such as brake squeal, including mathematical models for analysis and simulation. However, low frequency phenomena, such as brake judder and groan, have received much less attention. There is a growing interest from the automotive industry concerning brake judder. Even though few companies would admit {{that they have the}} problem, it is not unusual to meet people who have experienced the problem in their own passenger cars. Much of the knowledge concerning brake judder remains within the companies. Hence, very few people have the full picture. The purpose of the present paper is to give an overview of the brake judder problem...|$|E
40|$|High speed {{testing of}} a brake system using two {{different}} callipers and two different discs {{on a special}} test rig with a swinging calliper head mounting shows similar results with regard to <b>hot</b> <b>judder.</b> Holographic interferometry is used {{in an attempt to}} observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary information was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a permanent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode formation. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder – the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the calliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the calliper body. The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A “strobing” effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes “just off” the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc centre. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing end of the pads with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface. Other observations include hot spotting on the disc surface and a surface scan of the disc face indicates a depression at these positions. A metallurgical analysis of the blue spot is currently being carried out to determine if a material phase change has occurred within the disc body and this will be included in the paper. The introduction of a pressure fluctuation absorber shows an improvement in the pressure amplitude and subsequent vibration signal and the possible development of this system is discusse...|$|E
