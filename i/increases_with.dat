The effect of extraction variables were studied such as extraction temperature which ranges from 70 to 110 °C and solvent to oil ratio which ranges from 1 : 1 to 4 : 1 (wt/wt) were studied. The results of this investigation show that the extract yield E decreased with decreasing solvent to oil ratio in extract layer and <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> temperature.

40|$|One {{dimensional}} laboratory {{consolidation test}} {{was conducted on}} compacted lateritic soils treated with up to 16 % rice husk ash (RHA), to assess its consolidation properties. Specimens were prepared at three different moulding water contents (2 % dry of optimum, optimum moisture content and 2 % wet of optimum) and compacted using the British Standard Light compactive effort. Preliminary tests on soils showed improved index properties <b>with</b> an <b>increase</b> in liquid limit (LL), an increase in plastic limits (PL) with a resulting decrease in plasticity index (PI). Preconsolidation pressure <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> RHA content, it also decreased before <b>increasing</b> <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> moulding water content.

Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> the amount of exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot {{go all the way}} through the body. Gamma radiation can go {{all the way through the}} body.|$|E

The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target.

Lifespan <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier.
