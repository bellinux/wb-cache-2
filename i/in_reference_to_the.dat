The dispute between Luther and Eck would become public in the 1519 Leipzig Debate.|$|E

Depéret referred these fossils to the genus Megalosaurus, which at the time was a wastebasket taxon containing any number of unrelated large theropods, as the new species M. crenatissimus. This name is derived from the Latin word crenatus ("notched") and the suffix -issimus ("most"), <b>in</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> numerous serrations on both front and rear edges of the teeth.
