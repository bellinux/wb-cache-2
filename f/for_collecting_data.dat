25|$|A census {{is taken}} {{simultaneously}} {{in all parts}} of the UK every ten years. The Office for National Statistics is responsible <b>for</b> <b>collecting</b> <b>data</b> for England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective countries. In the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775. It is the third-largest in the European Union, the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth. Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7%. This compares to 0.3% per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2% in the decade 1981 to 1991. The 2011 census also confirmed that the proportion of the population aged 0–14 has nearly halved (31% in 1911 compared to 18 in 2011) and the proportion of older people aged 65 and over has more than tripled (from 5 to 16%). It has been estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach over 626,000 by 2080.|$|E

2500|$|School {{psychologists are}} {{becoming}} increasingly involved {{in the implementation of}} academic, behavioral, and social/emotional interventions within a school, often across a continuum of tiered supports. Schoolwide positive behavior supports (SWPBS) is a systematic approach that proactively promotes constructive behaviors in a school. These programs are designed to improve and support students’ social, behavioral, and learning outcomes by promoting a positive school climate and providing targeted training to students and educators within a school. [...] School psychologists are commonly involved in the implementation and monitoring of such programs. Teams are generally formed to address and evaluate existing policies, structures, and leadership roles. Commonly, teams will develop a set of goals to be adopted by the entire school community. To do so, teams are tasked with designing systems that address the needs of all students, including those who have repeated offenses. These systems and polices should convey clear behavior expectations and promote consistency among educators. [...] Students should be continuously reinforced for positive behaviors. SWPBS systems set parameters <b>for</b> <b>collecting</b> <b>data,</b> evaluating the efficiency of systems, and establishing these practices within a school. School psychologists are commonly involved in the implementation and data collection processes. Data should be collected consistently to assess implementation effectiveness, screen and monitor student behavior, and develop or modify action plans.|$|E

40|$|In Wireless Sensor Networks, {{recent studies}} reveal {{mobility}} {{of the sink}} nodes as a solution <b>for</b> <b>collecting</b> the <b>data</b> from the sensor nodes. The mobile element acts as a mechanical carrier <b>for</b> <b>collecting</b> the <b>data</b> from the sensor nodes. Each sensor node is assigned a buffer for accumulating the sensed data and data loss occurs if the buffer overflows. Therefore, scheduling the mobile element such without any buffer overflow is a major issue. The proposed algorithm incorporates the partitioning of the network into clusters based on the geographical regions. Within each cluster, a hierarchical tree structure is formed such that only the base-level nodes are visited by the mobile element. The <b>collected</b> <b>data</b> flows down the hierarchical tree to the base level nodes until all the <b>collected</b> <b>data</b> reaches the mobile node.
