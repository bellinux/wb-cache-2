5|$|The {{ships were}} {{considered}} second-class battleships, lightly constructed, armed, and armoured by British standards; Swiftsure, in fact, suffered from structural weakness while in service and required hull strengthening, although Triumph {{did not have}} such problems. Chile had required the ships {{to fit into the}} <b>graving</b> dock at Talcahuano, so they had to be longer and narrower for their displacement than ships built to British standards. Details in mast and anchor arrangements as well as the arrangement of magazines and shell-handling rooms also were different from British standards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after World War I, Britain {{expanded}} Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang on Singapore's north coast {{as part of}} plans to deter Japanese expansionism in the region (the Singapore strategy). The resulting facility {{was among the most}} important in the British Empire and included the large King GeorgeVI <b>graving</b> dock and AdmiraltyIX floating dry dock. The Commonwealth forces allocated to Malaya and Singapore were swiftly defeated in the months after the outbreak of the Pacific War, however, and the island was surrendered to the Japanese on 15February 1942. Singapore was bombed by Japanese aircraft {{on a number of occasions}} during the Battle of Malaya and subsequent fighting on the island itself; these raids caused many civilian deaths.|$|E

The sudden inrush of water into the <b>graving</b> dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E

It was constructed by the Scottish engineer Adam Hunter (1869–1933), who was working as Chief Engineer for Arrol & Co., having served his apprenticeship {{on the construction of}} the Forth Bridge.

5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI <b>Graving</b> Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Most {{planning}} {{focused on}} the first phase, which {{was seen as the}} most critical. This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second phase, a naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a <b>graving</b> dock capable of taking battleships at Pearl Harbor between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy had no such base east of Malta. In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific in case of a war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while Sydney was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location.|$|E
5|$|XXBomber Command's {{attacks on}} Singapore {{produced}} mixed results. The raids on Singapore Naval Base {{damaged or destroyed}} many workshops and denied the Japanese {{the use of the}} King GeorgeVI <b>Graving</b> Dock between late 1944 and early 1945, and the AdmiraltyIX Dry Dock from February 1945. In addition, workers at the Naval Base did not return to work for some time after each raid, and had to be provided with better pay and rations and additional air-raid shelters. Although the damage inflicted on the Empire Docks area impeded Japanese port operations, the poor condition of the port area also hindered British efforts to rehabilitate Singapore following the war. The attacks on the oil storage tanks on islands near Singapore were less successful, and many were found to still be operable after the Japanese surrender.|$|E

5|$|In {{his letter}} of 29 October 1862, Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi. In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell, {{notified}} Bulloch, who had purchased the ships {{in his own}} name, that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war. Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863, nominally {{on behalf of the}} Egyptian government, with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea. The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships, so this was superficially plausible. North Carolina, later HMS Scorpion, was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi, later HMS Wivern, received the name of El Monnassir. Lord Russel, prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador, Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels. The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship, , to watch over the newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September. The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her <b>graving</b> dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to discuss the double <b>graves</b> existence, content and meaning during the Swedish Iron Age. Being buried in pairs {{seems to have been}} {{relatively}} rare. Is the double <b>grave</b> a family <b>grave</b> or was one of the individuals a human sacrifice? The focus of this essay will be to discuss the possible relationship the people in the double <b>graves</b> may have had, but also to see how rare the <b>grave</b> type is with the help and inspiration of theories by Sarah M. Nelson. Are the <b>graves</b> family style <b>graves</b> such as husband and wife or parent and child? Are there any other possibilities for the existence of double <b>graves?</b> The most common interpretation of the double <b>graves</b> is that they are family <b>graves.</b> I will try to answer these questions by examining four Iron Age burial grounds in Sweden. I do not rule out that double <b>graves</b> may be family <b>graves,</b> however, if they were family <b>graves,</b> why are they so uncommon and where is the rest of the family? Why is it only two people in the <b>grave?</b> This makes me question if the double <b>graves</b> are something else but pure family <b>graves.</b> It is more likely that the double <b>graves</b> have been the results of accidents or disease where two people lost their lives at the same time. ...|$|R

To support this billion dollar wellhead platform construction project, Husky announced that it would be establishing a <b>graving</b> dock facility on the Northside Peninsula at Argentia to support the construction of the concrete base of the wellhead platform. Construction of the <b>graving</b> dock began in late 2013 and was finished in early 2015.
