40|$|Greenhouse {{experiments}} were conducted over two cropping cycles {{to investigate the}} effect of fungicide seed treatment and fungal root rot pathogens on nodulation and dry matter accumulation of selected food legumes. The legumes were common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. variety GLP 2), green gram (Vigna radiata L. variety M 66) and lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) while the pathogens were Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli, Macrophomina phaseolina, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani. Treatments consisted of inoculation of legume seeds with appropriate rhizobia alone, rhizobia together with fungicide, rhizobia together with pathogen and a combination of rhizobia, fungicide and pathogen. Fungicide copper oxychloride {{was used as a}} seed dresser. Rhizoctonia solani and S. sclerotiorum were more pathogenic and showed significantly increased seedling mortality and greater reduction in seedling emergence, number of nodules and root <b>dry</b> matter. Fungicide <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> significantly increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality. However, fungicide <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> alone and in combination with pathogen depressed nodulation in all the legumes. Inoculation with F. oxysporum and M. phaseolina had no significant effect on nodulation in common bean. All the treatments had little or no significant effect on shoot dry matter. The results suggest that fungicide seed treatment in combination with rhizobia inoculation is beneficial in management of root rot and enhancement of nodulation in food legumes...|$|R

Field trials were conducted at Junagadh, Raichur, Vriddhachalam, Mainpuri, Durgapura and Kolasib in different soils to find out effectiveness and feasibility of applying commercial grade B sources i. e. Agricol, Chemiebor, Solubor, Borosol and Borax. The results indicated that application of B has pronounced influence on flowering and yield attributes, and all boron sources increased yield, yield attributes, shelling and 100 seed mass in peanut. Soil application of 1. 0 kg B ha- 1 as Agricol, Solubor and Borosol increased pod yield by 8 - 23, 6 - 18, 12 - 18 %, respectively, compared to 9 - 28 % by Borax and 5 - 24 % by boric acid. Hence either of these B sources could be used. Foliar application (0. 1 % aqueous solution) of Borosol, Chemiebor and Solubor showed similar response increasing pod yield by 7 - 39, 6 - 32, and 6 - 35 %, respectively. However, foliar applications showed scorching of peanut leaves during hot and <b>dry</b> weather. <b>Seed</b> <b>dressing</b> of Agricol damaged seeds reducing field emergence, thus was detrimental. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} apply 1. 0 kg B ha- 1 to the soil to enhance peanut productivity by improving pod filling. The data for various locations revealed that soil application of the same amount of B as Borax, Agricol, and Solubor showed similar response and hence any one of these B sources could be used, however, among these Agricol is a cheaper source of B...|$|R

Sementes de feijão da {{cultivar}} Pérola foram submetidas aos seguintes tratamentos: 1) testemunha; 2) carbendazin + thiram + fipronil + polímero; 3) carbendazin + thiram + fipronil; 4) carbendazin + thiram + thiodicarb + polímero e 5) carbendazin + thiram + thiodicarb. Avaliaram-se emergência, eficiência no controle de lagarta elasmo (Elasmopalpus lignosellus) e sanidade das sementes. Nos resultados dos parâmetros emergência e controle de elasmo, os tratamentos associados ao inseticida fipronil foram superiores aos demais; na sanidade das sementes, os tratamentos com o inseticida thiodicarb foram mais eficientes, indicando ser esse o inseticida mais compatível à mistura com os fungicidas carbendazin + thiram aos 150 dias de armazenamento.

40|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>dressing,</b> i. e., the {{treatment}} of crop seeds with insecticides and/or fungicides, aiming to protect seeds from pests and diseases, is widely used in conventional agriculture. During the growing season, those crop fields often receive additional broadband herbicide applications. However, despite this broad utilization, very little is known on potential side effects or interactions between these different pesticide classes on soil organisms. In a greenhouse pot experiment, we studied single and interactive effects of <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Capo) with neonicotinoid insecticides and/or strobilurin and triazolinthione fungicides and an additional one-time application of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the activity of earthworms, soil microorganisms, litter decomposition, and crop growth. To further address food-web interactions, earthworms were introduced to half of the experimental units as an additional experimental factor. Seed dressings significantly reduced the surface activity of earthworms with no difference whether insecticides or fungicides were used. Moreover, <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> effects on earthworm activity were intensified by herbicides (significant herbicide × <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> interaction).

40|$|Black beetles (BB: Heteronychus spp. : Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) {{are serious}} {{constraints}} to upland rice {{production in the}} Madagascar central highlands. From 2002 to 2007 we compared the effects of two soil management and two fertilization modalities in an upland rice-based cropping system on soil macrofauna abundance, diversity and BB damage to rice crops and yield. This cropping system involved a 2 -year rotation of upland rice the first year, followed by common bean the second year, with oat as a relay crop under both conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage soil management (NT), each under both organic (OF) and mineral fertilization (MF). All four modalities (CT-OF; CT-MF; NT-OF and NT-MF) were managed under two plant protection levels (<b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> with imidacloprid + thiram vs no <b>seed</b> <b>dressing).</b> Herbivorous/detritivorous beetles were the most abundant soil biota, respectively representing more than two-thirds and half of all macrofauna {{at the outset of}} the experiment and 4 years later, with the BB Heteronychus arator rugifrons (Fairmaire) being the dominant pest species (herbivore). The Shannon diversity index was reduced significantly between the beginning and the end of the experiment 4 years later, while it was only marginally affected by soil management, fertilization and <b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> regimes at both sampling dates.
