Skácel finished the scoring with another shot from just outside the box to make it 5-1 for Hearts.|$|E
5|$|Jericho and Goldberg {{continued}} to feud over {{several weeks before}} being announced as participants in the Elimination Chamber match, in which Goldberg eliminated Jericho. During {{the weeks leading up}} to SummerSlam, Kane would turn on Rob Van Dam after the loss of their tag titles, and his unmasking which occurred eight days after this event along with <b>his</b> <b>heel</b> transformation, would lead to the promotion of a no disqualification singles match between the two at SummerSlam in which Kane won, ending their team. La Résistance would engage in a feud with the Dudley Boyz, eventually a match was scheduled for SummerSlam between the two teams over the World Tag Team titles.

5|$|Burge {{moved to}} Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a {{short-term}} deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011. He made his Doncaster debut as a second-half substitute in a 6–0 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 15 February 2011. That {{was to be}} his only appearance for the club. On 17 March 2011, Burge joined League Two team Oxford United on loan {{for the rest of}} the season, after impressing in a reserve game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went straight into the starting line-up for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off <b>his</b> <b>heel</b> on its way into the net for what would have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April 2011 he was recalled by Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{arrived in}} Australia and {{continued}} its training at Strathpine, Queensland. Training {{there was more}} vigorous than at Fort Bliss, and Chase broke <b>his</b> <b>heel</b> bone in a training accident. In December 1943, the 1st Cavalry Division sailed for Oro Bay, where it staged for its next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign. Chase was chosen to lead the assault. Here, his tactical expertise came to the fore. He resisted the temptation to overrun the island of Los Negros, and thereby overextend his forces, and instead formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, {{he was able to}} defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison. The crisis passed, Chase's force was reinforced {{by the rest of the}} division, and the 1st Cavalry Division was then able to overrun the islands. Chase was awarded the Bronze Star for his role in the campaign.|$|E

Walking back to their quarters Finucane jumped Croydon Town hall's stone balustrade parapet which hid an 18-foot drop the other side which broke <b>his</b> <b>heel</b> bone {{and put him in}} hospital for several weeks. Finucane was treated in Horton Hospital which specialised in combat wounds. While recovering Finucane was sent messages of congratulations by Trafford Leigh-Mallory AOC 11 Group. The Air Ministry sought to take advantage of Finucane's reputation by asking him to assist with morale and propaganda activities. On 22 October he read out an Air Ministry-approved description of his service for the BBC radio programme The World Goes By from his hospital bed. Finucane was moved to RAF Halton in Wendover, Buckinghamshire on 14 November 1941. On 22 November he moved to the former luxury Palace Hotel in Torquay. Upon arrival Finucane was asked to leave for London to receive the DSO and two bars to the DFC on 25 November with his brother and parents. That day King George VI personally decorated Finucane at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|Pugh {{started his}} career with First Division club Burnley where, at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and {{gradually}} {{worked his way up}} through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003. As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record, which led to him being named on the bench for two first-team matches in the League Cup, they decided to keep him on for a third year. As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club's reserve and youth team. This led to him to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football. He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th-minute substitute in a 3–1 defeat to Stevenage Borough. He converted a Simon Heslop cross during a match against Dagenham & Redbridge to score his first career goal, which helped Kidderminster to a 3–1 victory. Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with <b>his</b> <b>heel,</b> then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on Soccer AMs showboating section.|$|E
