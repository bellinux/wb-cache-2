30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several exemptions and <b>derogations</b> <b>for</b> the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption [2]. Pseudonymisation is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre <b>for</b> national regulations (<b>derogations</b> defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that exemptions and <b>derogations</b> <b>for</b> research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|R
5000|$|Member States {{may allow}} a <b>derogation</b> <b>for</b> public lending (i.e. public libraries) {{provided}} that authors obtain some royalties 5(1). Member States may also exempt [...] "certain categories of establishments" [...] from {{the payment of}} royalties 5(2). These provisions is interpreted strictly: Portugal has been censured for a transposition which effectively exempted all public institutions from payment of royalties, and Belgium for failing to set a rate of remuneration (making its collection impossible).|$|R
40|$|The UK-IPO {{is seeking}} views {{on whether to}} {{maintain}} the existing <b>derogation</b> <b>for</b> a further two years until 1 January 2012 or to allow the derogation to lapse and for works by artists who are deceased, but are still protected by copyright, {{to be eligible for}} resale right. Resale right was introduced into the UK in 2006 when Directive 2001 / 84 /EC was implemented. Resale right allows artists and their heirs to receive a small royalty each time one of their works is resold whilst that work is in copyright. The UK currently uses a derogation in the Directive so the right only applies in the UK to works by living artists. This derogation will expire on 1 January 2010 unless the UK Government seeks a further two year extension in accordance with the terms of the Directive. The UK-IPO is seeking views on whether to maintain the existing <b>derogation</b> <b>for</b> a further two years until 1 January 2012 or to allow the derogation to lapse and for works by artists who are deceased, but are still protected by copyright, to be eligible for resale right...|$|R
