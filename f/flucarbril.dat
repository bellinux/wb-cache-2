40|$|A {{clinical}} study {{was made of}} the analgesic effectiveness of a new drug, <b>Flucarbril</b> (100 mg), and its statistical comparison to co-deine (30 mg). Neither drug when used alone in the doses indicated was found use-ful for the relief of pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars. <b>Flucarbril,</b> 1 -methyl- 6 trifluromethylcarbo-styril, is a new drug with muscle relaxant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. * Its use for postoperative dental trismus, pain, and edema has been suggested. The recommended dosage of <b>Flucarbril</b> is 300 to 400 mg daily in divided doses when side effects are not noted. Codeine has been claimed to be effective in the relief of pain and is used frequently for analgesia in dentistry. Its effect has been compared with that of other drugs in previous studies of pain thresholds. 1 - 3 In this investigation, 30 mg codeine was used as a control to preclude the development of unfavorable side effects which occur with a higher dosage. 14 Materials and Methods Postoperative pain relief was evaluated in 52 healthy patients who had undergone surgical removal of impacted third molars under general anesthesia: 26 patients re-ceived 30 mg codeine phosphate and 26 patients received 100 mg <b>Flucarbril.</b> The medications were dispensed as four identi-cal capsules in a double-blind study; selec-tion of medication was by random assign-ment. The patients were given the first capsule at the onset of pain, which always This investigation was supported by NIDR Research Grant #ROlDEO- 2419 - 02 and a grant-in-aid from Smith...|$|E
