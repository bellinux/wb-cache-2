5|$|<b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1986. It is the second instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II and revolves around the United States Marine Corps' objective to secure the island of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> from the Imperial Japanese Army.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Eastwood {{directed}} {{two films}} about World War II's Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b> The first, Flags of Our Fathers, {{focused on the}} men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by Letters from <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers {{on the island and}} the letters they wrote home to family members. Letters from <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for Letters from <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b> At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. Letters from <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> {{took place}} in February and March 1945 during World War II and was marked {{by some of the}} fiercest {{fighting}} of the war. The American invasion, known as Operation Detachment, was charged with capturing the airfields on <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b>|$|E
5|$|D. <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> is {{not within}} the special wards of Tokyo. Administratively, the island is part of Ogasawara, Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Guam, 3rd Battalion spent two months conducting 'mopping up' operations on the island until November, when it received orders to prepare for operations against <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b> From November until February 1945, they {{took part in a}} training regimen so serious that a fellow battalion later reported at least 20% of its members were incapacitated due to foot and heat injuries. During the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> 3rd Battalion, as part of 3rd Marines, was kept offshore as the Expeditionary Troops reserve. However, despite numerous requests from other Marine officers, the 3rd Marines were never landed. According to one 3rd Battalion veteran, some Marines from the battalion came ashore to unload supplies or with other units that they had recently transferred to. After sitting off <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> in their transport ships for a month, the 3rd Marines were ordered to return to Guam on 5 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 1944, Callaghan {{became the}} first captain of the USS Missouri, the last {{battleship}} commissioned by the US Navy. He commanded the Missouri in engagements at <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> and Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|While {{the attacks}} on the Mariana Islands did not seriously disrupt the USAAF air campaign, they had an effect on other American operations. After {{determining}} that the Japanese raiders were staging through <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> American forces stepped up their attacks on that island. While the decision to invade <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> had been made before the raids commenced, stopping the attacks formed part of the justification for the landing. In addition, further air defense units were deployed to the Mariana Islands to protect the B-29 bases.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines {{were part}} of the reserve forces for the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> and were {{committed}} to the action five days after D-Day. Among the Marines who distinguished themselves on <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> was Private Wilson D. Watson who received the Medal of Honor. After the island was secured, the unit was sent back to Guam where they underwent training for a possible invasion of the Japanese mainland. The invasion never occurred since hostilities between Japan and the United States came to an end. The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines was sent to Camp Pendelton where, in December 1945, it was once again disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b> He supervised the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, {{he was in charge of}} a communications center on <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore one of the first people to know that Hiroshima was the target, and that it had been attacked. After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|His actions helped Marines {{penetrate}} the Japanese defense {{and get off}} the landing beach during the critical {{early stages of the}} invasion. Basilone was posthumously awarded the Marine Corps' second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross, for extraordinary heroism during the battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) {{presented}} him with its John O. Stitely Distinguished Public Service Award. Upon his retirement, a special stamp cancellation showing the flag-raising on Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> was issued in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{transitioning}} into an extratropical cyclone, Lucille {{brushed the}} Japanese islands of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> and Chichi-jima. On the former, winds reached 55km/h (35mph) {{while on the}} latter, gusts peaked at 130km/h (80mph). The gusts on Chichi-jima caused the USS Cayuga County to broach in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. {{military}} was considering future {{operations in the}} Bonin Islands during August 1944 the planners assessed that an occupation of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> might be necessary to protect the Marianas from attack, {{and after the war}} this was given as one of the justifications for the costly invasion of the island. However, this was not necessary due {{to the success of the}} Seventh Air Force and the USN's campaign against Iwo Jima's airfields as well as the Japanese military's shortage of long-ranged aircraft. In any event, the decision to invade <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> was made a month before the major attacks on the B-29 bases began, and there were no raids on the Marianas in the seven weeks before the landings began on February19.|$|E
5|$|After the Marianas {{began to}} come under attack, the United States {{military}} stepped up its raids on the Japanese-held islands {{which could be used}} to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E
5|$|Although some Japanese {{soldiers}} were taken prisoner, most fought {{until they were}} killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> were killed. Of the 117,000 Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April–June 1945, 94% were killed. American military leaders used these figures to estimate high casualties among American soldiers in the planned invasion of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Indianapolis {{served as}} {{flagship}} of Scouting Force 1 during World War II, and saw {{action in a}} number of campaigns in the Pacific theater. She supported the Gilbert and Marshall island campaigns as well as operations off the Caroline Islands. Later in the war she fought in the Battle of Philippine Sea and later the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> and participating in the Battle of Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{received}} 11 battle {{stars for}} World War II {{service as a}} result of her participation in operations in North Africa, the Gilbert, Carolina, and Marshall Islands campaigns, as well as operations during the battles for Leyte, Luzon, <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> and Okinawa. No US Navy sailors or Marines were killed in action aboard the battleship during the war.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 1945, Saratoga {{departed}} Pearl Harbor for Ulithi Atoll to {{rendezvous with}} the Enterprise {{and form a}} night fighter task group (TG 58.5/Night Carrier Division 7) along with Enterprise, to provide air cover for the amphibious landings on <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b> She arrived on 8 February with the 53 Hellcats and 17 Avengers of Carrier Air Group (Night) 53 aboard and sailed two days later.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> {{was marked}} {{by some of the}} fiercest {{fighting}} of the Pacific campaign. The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese home islands and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers present {{at the beginning of the}} battle, over 20,000 were killed and only 216 taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese High Command {{believed}} that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China. In response, five additional infantry divisions {{were assigned to the}} defense of this area. Three of these divisions were released for other operations in March 1945 after the American invasion of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> was interpreted as evidence that the Hong Kong-Canton area would be bypassed rather than attacked.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin and {{the task}} force moved to <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> on 17 February to provide direct support for the {{landings}} slated to take place on 19 February. They revisited Tokyo on 25 February and hit the island of Hachino {{off the coast of}} Honshū the next day, resulting in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Horacio Rivero, Jr., USN, served {{aboard the}} , {{providing}} artillery cover for Marines landing on Guadalcanal, Marshall Islands, <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> and Okinawa. Rivero eventually reached {{the rank of}} Full-Admiral (four-stars) and in October 1962, {{found himself in the}} middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis. As Commander of amphibious forces, Atlantic Fleet, he was on the front line of the vessels sent to the Caribbean by President Kennedy to stop the Cold War from escalating into World War III.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} radical {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Both New York and Texas entered {{service in}} 1914 and {{immediately}} {{served in the}} occupation of Veracruz, and service reinforcing the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet in the North Sea during World War I, during which time New York {{is believed to have}} sunk a U-boat in an accidental collision. Both ships undertook numerous training exercises and overhauls during the interwar era, and joined the Neutrality Patrol at the beginning of World War II. Outmoded by more advanced battleships in service, both ships served primarily as convoy escorts and naval artillery during the war. New York supported Operation Torch in North Africa, undertook convoy patrols and training in the Atlantic, and supported the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> and the Battle of Okinawa. Texas supported Operation Torch, Operation Overlord, the bombardment of Cherbourg, Operation Dragoon and the battles at <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> and Okinawa. Following the war, New York was used as a target ship in Operation Crossroads and sunk as a target in 1948, while Texas was converted into a museum ship, and remains permanently moored in San Jacinto State Park today.|$|E
5|$|John Basilone (November 4, 1916 – February 19, 1945) was a United States Marine Corps gunnery {{sergeant}} who {{was killed}} in action during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for heroism above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the Battle for Henderson Field in the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the Navy Cross posthumously for extraordinary heroism during the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima.</b> He was the only enlisted Marine to receive both of these decorations in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Sinlaku first {{affected}} <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> producing sustained {{winds of}} 131km/h (82mph), with gusts to 183km/h (114mph). Residents {{on the small}} island of Minamidaitojima evacuated their homes to safer areas during the storm. Rainfall caused flooding on the island. Offshore Okinawa, a Philippine cargo ship went missing, prompting a rescue mission by the Japanese Coast Guard. The crew was rescued a day later, {{and no one was}} injured.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to his own squad, {{he was killed by}} an enemy grenade. As a result of his one-man attack, Sergeant Cole's company could move forward against the fortifications and attain their ultimate objective. Sergeant Cole was initially buried in the 4th Marine Division Cemetery on <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> but at the request of his father, his remains were returned to the United States to be buried in Parkview Cemetery, Farmington, Missouri.|$|E
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Wilson {{served as}} Chief of the Personnel Division (G-l) of the War Department General Staff. He became Chief of Staff of the Fifth Air Force in September 1942, before {{returning}} to the United States in 1944 to become Assistant Chief of Staff, United States Army Air Forces for Organization, Commitments and Requirements. For a time he was acting Chief of Staff of Army Air Forces. In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> as an official Army Air Forces observer. In June 1945, he assumed command of the Air Force Proving Ground Command.|$|E
5|$|Early on April15, Sudal passed {{very near}} the {{uninhabited}} Japanese island of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a surprise to the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
5|$|He {{enlisted in}} the Marine Corps on June 3, 1940, after serving {{three years in the}} United States Army with duty in the Philippines. He was {{deployed}} to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1942, he took part in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In October, he and two other Marines used machine guns to hold off an attack by a far numerically superior Japanese force. In February 1945, he was killed in action {{on the first day of}} the invasion of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> after he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse and led a Marine tank under fire safely through a minefield.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, Australian troops {{landed in}} Borneo, {{overrunning}} the oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May. Chinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> by March, and Okinawa {{by the end}} of June. At the same time, American submarines cut off Japanese imports, drastically reducing Japan's ability to supply its overseas forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to directing {{many of his}} own star vehicles, Eastwood has also directed films in {{which he did not}} appear, such as the mystery drama Mystic River (2003) and the war film Letters from <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima</b> (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, the drama Changeling (2008), and the South African biographical political sports drama Invictus (2009). The war drama biopic American Sniper (2014) set box office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{returned}} to Puget Sound naval yard for a needed overhaul. The work lasted until January 1945; the ship {{returned to}} active duty on the 24th of that month. Indiana {{took part in the}} bombardment of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> as well as in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Following the shore bombardments, Indiana joined the task force that had assembled to invade Okinawa; the ship provided ground support fire as well as anti-aircraft defense against the increasing number of Kamikazes that were attacking the invasion fleet. Indiana continued in these duties {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February, Arkansas was in {{position}} off <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> and at 06:00, she {{opened fire on}} Japanese positions on the island's west coast. The bombardment lasted until 19 February, though she remained off the island throughout the Battle of <b>Iwo</b> <b>Jima,</b> ready to provide fire support to the American Marines ashore. She departed on 7 March, bound for Ulithi, and arrived on 10 March, where she rearmed and refueled {{in preparation for the}} next major operation in the Pacific War, the invasion of Okinawa. She departed Ulithi, on 21 March, and arrived off Okinawa, four days later, when she began the bombardment {{along with the rest of}} Task Force 54. The soldiers and Marines went ashore on 1 April, and Arkansas continued to provide gunfire support over the course of 46 days throughout the Battle of Okinawa. Kamikazes repeatedly attacked the ship, though none struck her. She left the island in May, arriving in Guam on 14 May. She then proceeded to Leyte Gulf, on 12 June, arriving four days later. There, she was assigned to Task Group 95.7, along with Texas and three cruisers. She remained in the Philippines until 20 August, when she departed for Okinawa, arriving in Buckner Bay on 23 August, by which time Japan had surrendered, ending World War II. Over the course of the war, Arkansas earned four battle stars.|$|E
