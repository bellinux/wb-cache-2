Abstract Wood pallets are often put in circulation for several years. In a pallet’s lifetime it goes through several wet-dry cycles. In this study, softwood pallet specimens were compressed statically and impacted at different water contents through an accelerated drying process for three repeated wet-dry cycles. A static compressive strength test was performed along the grain of pallet stringers to avoid the effect of loadings in different grain directions. Instead of using the standard drop test from a <b>drop</b> <b>tester,</b> an incline impact test was performed to obtain more consistent impact accelerations.

The principle aim of {{this research}} project is to measure parameters which are pertinent for numerical simulations in discontinuous media. One such numerical tool, the Discrete Element Method (DEM), is a promising technique for predicting the dynamics of charge motion with in a mill. Particle interactions in DEM are calculated by contact force and force displacement laws at each particle contact. These contact events are characterized by parameters that are often fitted or estimated {{due to the lack}} of accurate experimental measurements. The {{aim of this}} project is to experimentally measure the necessary interaction properties required for the DEM analysis and to test the DEM models against the measured experimental results. An in-ﬂight binary collisions <b>drop</b> <b>tester</b> is constructed to measure the material interaction properties of two spheres. The collision event is captured photographically and pre- and post- relative velocities are measured. The binary collisions of the particles are carefully controlled by relay timing circuits and they are captured on digitized images using a SLR digital camera.

The measured relative velocities arc applied in rigid body theory of binary impact to extract the required material interaction properties.

40|$|Mechanical shock {{tests are}} very {{important}} for portable electronic products such as notebook computers and mobile phones because these products are subjected to high risks of impact loading. Impact loading often plays {{a critical role in}} the functional performance and mechanical reliability of electronic components and devices. Drop tests are adopted usually to the overall product to assess the structural and functional integrity. Traditional test method is to drop the products from a certain height with a quick release hook or <b>drop</b> <b>tester.</b> The obvious advantage for these methods is that they can directly duplicate the field impact scenarios. However, the test repeatability can not be guarantied in drop tests, because it is difficult to control the orientation of the object at impact and to instrument it. Moreover; by considering the real impact conditions, drop tests are not applicable for the shock reliability tests of individual components. Shock table tests are carried out to overcome the drawbacks described above. A shock impulse with a given shape, magnitude and duration is applied to the shock table and then imparted to the sample product or component fasted to the table. However, the shock table test is a simulation of the real-life drop impact process. To make the shock table tests adequately mimic the real drop impact, it is critical to make correlation between the shock table test parameter and field conditions. The present paper aims to conduct a systematic study, both experimentally and analytically, to evaluate the feasibility of using appropriate shock table tests to mimic the shock environment for components and systems adopted in portable electronics. Firstly, dynamic characteristics of typical portable electronic systems and components under drop impact are studied, and then effective shock table test methods are developed for adequately mimic the real-life impact state. At last, by comparing the typical results from shock table tests and those from drop tests, the correlation of shock table test parameters and drop tests conditions are investigated. ...|$|E

The findings are {{explained in terms of}} the impact characteristics. At temperatures above ambient there were changes in the impact characteristics. The drop impact tests were carried out on samples (70 mm x 70 mm x 5 mm) at an ambient temperature of 180 C and elevated temperatures of 400 C, 600 C, 800 C and 1000 C using an instrumented <b>drop</b> <b>tester</b> with a 12. 1 mm diameter hemispheric tup and the load history and energy profile were obtained. The actual damage response depends on many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the thickness of the laminate, the exact stacking sequence, the shape and kinetic energy of the impactor {{and the degree to which}} the laminate is supported against bending. The examination of the impact and post impact characteristics at elevated temperatures revealed a plastic mode of failure and the performance was assessed in terms of contact time, post impact displacement and total energy. Composites are generally brittle in nature and respond elastically with little or no plastic deformation, but this is not the case for natural fibre - styrene polyester matrix composites especially at high temperatures as there exists some degree of plasticity seen in the after impact state of the samples. Low energy impact (6 J) results in cracking of the matrix leading to reduction in the strength of the composite. But higher energy impact strikes produce cracking of the matrix and splintering of the fibres. From the load - indentation curves average power coefficients of 3. 6 and 15. 4 were obtained for sisal and flax composites respectively as against 1. 5 for the special Hertz contact of two elastic bodies...|$|E

40|$|Case {{carburized}} bearing cones {{were subjected}} to impact loadings using an experimental impact <b>drop</b> <b>tester.</b> The cones were manufactured from AISI-SAE 4320 steel by hot ring rolling, or machining from seamless tube. The microstructure consisted of retained austenite and tempered martensite. Some samples also contained fine dispersed carbides. ^ The cones were impacted with energies {{in the range from}} 3 to 30 J. The acceleration of the impacter was measured in-situ. Post impact analysis included indentation surface profiling and cross section sampling for hardness, retained austenite and crack morphology. ^ In general, results indicated that material response to impact loading was dominated by core thickness, microstructural constituents, and service history. ^ Impacts on lubricated contact surfaces were more elastic, thereby limiting deformation. The critical or transition impact energy which caused case fracture was determined. The mode of case fracture depended on the retained austenite profile and load history: (1) Increased retained austenite levels beyond 40 %, greatly reduced case fracture. (2) Increased load cycles moved the transition zone to lower impact energies. With increasing core thickness, the microstructure absorbed more energy. For high energy impacts which caused case fracture, the dependency on core thickness was enhanced. ^ Resulting impact damage depended on the amount and condition of retained austenite. As the retained austenite content increased, more energy was absorbed through work hardening and transformation to martensite. This reduced the depth of the damaged microstructure, as well as the indentation size. Instantaneous case fracture was prevented and cracking of the case structure was largely reduced. During service life, the microstructure continually lost the capability to respond elastically to impact loading. As a result, the absorbed energy increased, damage appeared deeper below the surface and the transition zone beyond which case fracture occurred, moved to lower impact energies. ^ The presence of carbides in the microstructure was beneficial only for very low impact loads, which limited deformation. As load increased, the carbides acted as stress concentration sites, which promoted crack initiation. The mode of deformation changed from displacement and transformation of retained austenite to a combination of displacement and case fracture, which absorbed minimum energy. As a result, the impact damage was far more severe, and extended deeper into the material. ...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{cracking}} due to {{high temperature}} drying has been of concern to the maize industry because {{it can lead to}} increases in broken grain and fine material during subsequent handling. In this study, several factors affecting physical characteristics of maize grain, particularly those related to stress cracking, were investigated. In the first year (1995 - 1996), the effects of several preharvest factors; hybrid, nitrogen, harvest grain moisture content, and postharvest drying factors including drying temperature and relative cooling rate on physical attributes and stress cracking in grain were investigated. Grain hardness (hard to soft endosperm ratio (H/S ratio)) was significantly affected by the interaction between hybrid and nitrogen. The effect of drying temperature and harvest moisture on drying time was dominant, while drying rate was significantly affected by hybrid and drying temperature. The effect of cooling rate on stress cracking and stress crack index (SCI) stood out among the main effects. At the lowest cooling rate of 0. 23 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, checked stress cracking (checking) was minimal, and SCI was less than 100. However, at higher cooling rates from 0. 55 to 1. 11 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, grains had more than 25 % multiple stress cracking, regardless of the levels of hybrid, nitrogen, harvest moisture and drying temperature. The predicted SCI for the three hybrids reached a maximum around at 0. 75 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, cooling rate, irrespective of levels of nitrogen and drying temperature. In the second experiment (1996 - 1997), the effects of grain hardness and morphological factors (grain size and shape) at a single grain drying rate and the development stress cracking over time were investigated. The re-parameterized Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) model successfully predicted the increasing rate (κ) and the maximum value (α) of percentage checking in various sizes, shapes and hardness of grains time after drying. From the data analysis, the maximum value of checking (α) showed a significant correlation with grain length (r = - 0. 707), thickness (r = 0. 620), roundness (r = 0. 703) and the shortest diffusion pathway (SDP; r = 0. 627). While, the increasing rate (κ) of percentage checking with time after drying was significantly correlated with grain bulk density (r = - 0. 564), hardness ratio (r = - 0. 611) and drying rate (r = 0. 551), {{and to a lesser extent}} (r > 0. 35), with the grain size parameters including hundred-grain weight, grain length, and width. Based on this result, it was suggested that removing small and rounded grains could reduce checked stress cracking by up to 40 to 50 % in some dent maize hybrids. In addition, the standardized multiple regression for single grain drying rate according to H/S ratio and grain weight accounted for from 65 to 74 % of the variation. Tempering grain at high temperatures reduced stress-cracked grains significantly. However, the effect of tempering on stress cracking in the hard grain hybrid was small. In the 1997 - 1998 experiment, a breakage tester (HT-I <b>drop</b> <b>tester)</b> was developed and single grain breakage at various grain temperatures and times after drying was determined. Both hard and soft maize hybrids had minimal breakage at high grain temperatures (78 to 110 °C), while decreasing grain temperature increased breakage exponentially. This indicated that grain temperature should be considered as a co-factor for measuring grain breakage. After drying at both 60 °C and 120 °C, the percentage breakage measured at ambient temperature increased rapidly during cooling in air at an ambient temperature of 20 °C and a relative humidity around 65 - 70 %. Breakage reached a maximum after about 10 minutes from the start of cooling. A Mitscherlich function was used to describe the chronological development of percent grain breakage and the analysis of the function parameters for the extent (maximum) and rate of breakage indicated that there was a significant interaction between hybrid and drying temperature for the development of grain breakage after drying. In conclusion, the MMF and Mitscherlich models described stress cracking and grain breakage during drying and cooling of maize grain. These studies provide valuable information to grain industries to assist with minimizing grain damage during drying...|$|E
40|$|The t 10 {{relationship}} {{developed by}} Narayanan and Whiten has underpinned {{a number of}} the JKMRC models and the characterisation of ore competence through impact testing with the <b>drop</b> weight <b>tester.</b> This usefulness is based on a consistent relationship between the ho value and the overall size distribution that was noted for brittle rocks. However, like all characterisation tests this should be used only when the controlling conditions apply, which in this case is single impact breakage between two metal platens and within the range of sizes in which fragment sizes are normalizable. For any other mode of breakage the relationship should be confirmed before being applied. Soft ores or bimodal ores with widely different competence between dominant components have nontypical breakage signatures. Breakage via single point impact abrasion, compressed-bed breakage, low-energy surface breakage and incremental breakage, to name some of the other breakage modes, do not obey the general ho relationship, so their outcomes cannot be used to provide a direct comparison. Inappropriate use of the ho parameter can result in misleading conclusions about efficiency of energy use. These issues and alternative comparison techniques are presented and discussed in terms of choosing appropriate measures of efficiency of breakage, ore competence and energy required for comminution...|$|R

This makes it particularly well suited for simulating tumbling mills whose charge is principally individual particles (steel balls, rocks and fines). The use of DEM to simulate tumbling mills has proliferated since the early 1990 s and been successfully employed to predict important milling parameters such as charge motion, power draw, liner wear and impact energy distribution. The ultimate aim of any model of the tumbling mill is to predict {{the product of the}} milling process. Current DEM simulations of the tumbling mill however do not simulate the breakage of the particles and as such can not directly predict the product. In order to predict the performance of industrial-scale tumbling mills, laboratory-scale mills are used to experimentally obtain data, which is then scaled up using black box mathematical models. In this thesis a tumbling mill model that utilises the power of DEM to provide the mechanical environment and the energies available for breakage is proposed. The incorporation of DEM eliminates the need to scale up because DEM is able to simulate the actual industrial-scale device. Data from breakage experiments on the ore being treated is also incorporated into the model to determine the breakage functions. Population balance techniques are applied in the mathematical framework of the model to predict the product of the comminution process. In order to test the proposed tumbling mill model, DEM simulations of a 1. 695 m diameter pilot SAG mill using charge based on actual operation data were performed and analysed. Results from the DEM simulation and <b>Drop</b> Weight <b>Tester</b> breakage experiments were then used in the proposed tumbling mill model to predict the evolution of the product size distribution...|$|R
40|$|Understanding ore {{breakage}} {{is the key}} for {{the development}} of appropriate breakage characterisation experiments. Hence, there has been significant effort to understand a single breakage event, both from the experimental and the modelling standpoints. One particularly interesting approach is to consider breakage of a particle, for instance in a <b>drop</b> weight <b>tester,</b> as a sequence of primary and secondary breakage components. Secondary breakage is defined as subsequent breakage of progeny that takes place after the primary fracture of the parent particle due to surplus energy that is provided by the comminution or breakage testing device. This influences the spatial distribution of fragments as well as their selection. Due to the complex nature of secondary breakage, most of the researches in the past have either been dedicated to understanding primary fracture as a basic element of every comminution process or to describe the breakage process as a whole. However, the progression of breakage may be modelled properly by incorporating the sequential breakage of fragments into a breakage process model. In the paper, a novel approach is proposed to describe a single breakage event by modelling it as a process through several stages of primary fracture while appreciating the effect of sequential fragmentation. The model has three main components: the primary breakage, the selection, and the classification functions. The data that served as the basis for demonstrating this model were a number of impact experiments in an impact load cell on quartz and apatite particles. The results indicate a good correspondence between experiments and model fit. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis to changes in selection and classification functions was performed, which indicated a strong dependency of a breakage event on its sub-processes. It is envisaged that this approach will allow decoupling the contributions of the ore and of the stressing conditions on the outcome of the breakage event...|$|R

The Appearance function, also known as breakage distribution function, is used to describe the breakage characteristics of an ore impacted with a certain energy. It is the bedrock of comminution modelling. The range of applicability of the majority of existing appearance functions is limited to coarser sizes above a few millimetres. In the previous work, a 4 D (four dimensional) appearance function model was developed based on JKRBT test data, but its applicable range was not sufficiently broad at − 24. 4  +  7. 3  mm. In order to develop a more versatile appearance function model {{that can be used for}} a wide range of energy levels and feed particle sizes, drop weight tests for smaller particles with sizes ranging from 425  μm to 16  mm were carried out with the Mini JK <b>drop</b> weight <b>tester.</b> Combined with data up to 63  mm from Standard JK Drop Weight Tests, the outcomes were fitted to two types of 4 D appearance functions - the P 80 -m based 4 D model and the P 80 -m-q based 4 D model. The proposed 4 D models are more accurate and scalable than existing models. Most importantly, they can be used for a wide range of conditions, with feed particle size ranging from 425  μm to 63  mm and input specific energy from 0. 1 to 2. 5  kW h/t in the initial test data.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies {{had been}} {{undertaken}} {{on the effects}} of different postcure schedules on the impact resistance of RT-cured glass/epoxy laminates, subjected to repeated drop tests using an in-house built uninstrumented <b>drop</b> weight impact <b>tester.</b> The impact resistance was assessed in terms of two parameters, viz., the number of drops to failure (Nf) and the delamination area growth (dA). The specimens were postcured at different time–temperature combinations and the impact response was studied at three different incident energy levels (10. 6, 12. 6, and 14. 8 J). It was found that, the Nf and dA values increased to a maximum at an optimum postcure schedule of 85 C/ 4 h. The extent of composite cure for the different postcure schedules was ascertained by measuring the glass transition temperatures (Tg), in order to obtain an appreciation for correlation between the impact resistance and the chemical cure status of the composite. Also, single drop impact studies were made at the 25 -J energy level using an instrumented impact tester (DYNATUP 8250) and the aforesaid optimum postcure schedule was reconfirmed.

40|$|In this study, the {{behavior}} of {{two different types of}} cores, short flax fiber reinforced and continuous flax fiber reinforced polymeric cores, has been investigated under low velocity out-of-plane impact loading. The fiber-reinforced corrugations were manufactured by using matched-die compression molding and the resulting cells were bonded using ultrasonic methods to form recyclable honeycomb cores. A <b>drop</b> weight impact <b>tester,</b> Imatek IM 10 T- 20 ITS, capable of producing velocities of up to 20 m/s coupled with a high-speed camera (Phantom), was used to capture video images of the impact. The displacement of the impactor was recorded with a digital displacement transducer and the force was recorded with a digital force transducer. The effects of reinforced material type, the core height and the presence of facings including all their interactions on the energy absorption were determined by using statistical analysis based on the Taguchi method. The impact results revealed a better energy absorption when honeycombs with cell walls reinforced with continuous fibers were used; the presence of face-sheets {{played an important role in}} energy absorption only at lower core height. This was confirmed by the results of the statistical analysis revealing antagonistic interaction between the core height and facings...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Low-velocity {{impact damage}} {{is a major}} concern in the design of {{structures}} made of composite materials, because impact damage is hidden and cannot be detected by visual inspection. Piezoelectric sensors can be used to detect variations in structural and material properties for structural health monitoring. In this study, polyvinylidene flouride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors are used for monitoring impact damage initiation and propagation in composite laminates to illustrate this potential benefit. Several tests for monitoring the stress wave signals including acoustic emission due to failure modes, such as matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage are performed. A series of impact tests at various impact energies by changing the impact mass and height is performed on the instrumented <b>drop</b> weight impact <b>tester.</b> The wavelet transform (WT) and short time fourier transform (STFT) are used to decompose the piezoelectric sensor signals in this study. Test results show that the particular waveform of sensor signals implying the damage initiation and propagation are detected above the damage initiation impact energy. It is found that both PZT and PVDF sensors can be used to detect the impact damage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{effort has}} been made to study the effects of {{variable}} incident impact energy and laminate thickness (obtained by varying the number of fabric layers at constant moulding pressure and also by varying the pressure for a fixed number of fabric layers), on the low velocity impact damage tolerance of GFRP composite laminates (woven E-glass fabric in a room temperature cure epoxy system LY 556 /HY 951). Repeated drop tests were conducted using an in-house built <b>drop</b> weight impact <b>tester.</b> Number of <b>drops</b> to failure (Nf), was considered as the impact damage tolerance index. Correlations between Nf and composite material parameters (fiber weight fraction – Wf, laminate thickness – t, number of fabric layers – L) and a test parameter (incident impact energy – E) were found out and the bounding limits for these were defined. Critical values of impact energy (Ec) and laminate thickness (tc) were defined (for the particular resin – hardener system chosen for the study) which can quite possibly be used as designer’s guidelines. A new ratio, (t/Wf), was introduced for the study of composite systems where both fiber weight fraction and laminate thickness get affected upon alteration of a process parameter (the pressure – P as in this case) ...|$|R
