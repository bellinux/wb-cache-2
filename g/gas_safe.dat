5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>Gas</b> <b>Safe</b> Register {{is to protect the}} public from unsafe gas work.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{legislation in the}} western world over the last 20 years or so requires that poisonous exhaust emissions from cars are reduced. Catalytic converters fitted to exhaust systems make these poisonous <b>gases</b> <b>safer.</b> Now nearly half the world's annual production of platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) is being used in the manufacture of catalytic converters. As cars travel around our cities these converters lose Pt and Pd which are ejected onto roads. This creates artificial concentrations of Pt and Pd in the urban environment that is a new addition to the global distribution. We know very little about such concentrations but we know much more about Pt and Pd concentrations in geological settings. Pt and Pd occur naturally at the Earth's surface only in a very few rare locations in rocks formed by an unusual combination of geological processes. The major Pt and Pd deposits were formed by crystallisation of magma which concentrated the metals into specific minor rock units within large igneous intrusions. As these precious metals are very rare on the Earth's surface they are economic at concentrations of only a few parts per million. Recent studies, including those described here, show that values of Pt and Pd accumulating in our cities are approaching values found in natural deposits. Certainly Pt and Pd can be located in road dust at road junctions in the cities in the wealthy western world at levels well above natural background values...|$|R

50|$|The use of gas as {{illuminant}} became {{widely available}} with {{the invention of}} the Dalén light by Swedish engineer, Gustaf Dalén. In 1906, Dalén became the chief engineer at the Gas Accumulator Company. Initially Dalén worked with acetylene, an extremely explosive hydrocarbon gas. Dalén invented Agamassan (Aga), a substrate used to absorb the <b>gas</b> allowing <b>safe</b> storage and hence commercial exploitation. Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white-light and immediately superseded the duller-flamed LPG as the fuel of choice in lighthouse illuminations. Dalén incorporated another invention into his light - the 'sun valve'. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.|$|R
25|$|The vaporized {{oil burner}} {{was invented in}} 1901 by Arthur Kitson, and {{improved}} by David Hood at Trinity House. The fuel was vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil lights. The use of gas as illuminant became widely available with {{the invention of the}} Dalén light by Swedish engineer, Gustaf Dalén. He used Agamassan (Aga), a substrate, to absorb the <b>gas</b> allowing <b>safe</b> storage and hence commercial exploitation. Dalén also invented the 'sun valve', which automatically regulated the light and turned it off during the daytime. The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant.|$|R
