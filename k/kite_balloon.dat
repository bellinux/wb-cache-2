5|$|Valiant {{was paid}} off in 1885, and she was {{assigned}} to the HMS Indus stoker training establishment in 1897, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904. The ship was converted to a <b>kite</b> <b>balloon</b> storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so the ship was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the 4th BS and became the flagship of its commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. During this foray, Hercules carried out the first test of a towed <b>kite</b> <b>balloon</b> (without observers). Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.|$|E

5|$|Bretagne {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Brest on 1 July 1912, {{launched}} on 21 April 1913, and completed in September 1915. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 February 1916. After entering service in 1916, Bretagne and her sisters {{were assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, their unit {{for the remainder of the}} war, Bretagne becoming flagship of the squadron. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Bretagne saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917, due to a severe shortage of coal at Corfu. Around July 1918, the ship's foremast was replaced by a tripod foremast that mounted an experimental fire-control director and her mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive <b>kite</b> <b>balloon.</b> Bretagne returned to Toulon in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|By October 1915 Campania had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and the flight deck was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the flight deck. A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a <b>kite</b> <b>balloon</b> {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E

25|$|On 27 May, {{a report}} {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>kite</b> <b>balloon</b> with aircraft found that balloon observation was better for reports of the situation in general, including that of artillery-fire. During the days and nights, the balloon observer could tell the British artillery group commander where German guns were firing, the areas worst bombarded, the areas of greatest activity, whether gas had been released and the direction it moved. Aircraft were considered better for artillery ranging, managing to operate in conditions which were impossible for the balloon. During the day, air observers saw far more gun flashes than the observation balloon crews but none after dark. A balloon observer could spot flashes at night and sometimes name the battery, given the observer's knowledge of the area. The advantage of telephone communication with the balloon observer over Morse wireless from aeroplanes was judged considerable.|$|E

Later that month, a shell broke up in the left barrel of [...] "A" [...] turret and caused minor damage. While stationed off the Kerch Peninsula, the ship provided artillery support to White troops, including bombardments of Bolshevik positions in the villages of Koi-Asan and Dal Kamici. By 1920, British attention had turned to the Greco-Turkish War. On 20 June 1920, Marlborough arrived in Constantinople, where the Mediterranean Fleet was being concentrated to support the occupation of the city. On 6 July, British forces landed at Gemlik, while Marlborough provided artillery support.|$|E

500|$|On 18 August, the Germans again sortied, {{this time}} to bombard Sunderland; Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the German fleet commander, hoped to draw out Beatty's battlecruisers and destroy them. British signals {{intelligence}} decrypted German wireless transmissions, allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet {{in an attempt to}} engage in a decisive battle. Both sides withdrew, however, after their opponents' submarines inflicted losses: the British cruisers [...] and [...] were both torpedoed and sunk by German U-boats, and the German battleship [...] was damaged by the British submarine [...] After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats. Later that year, Emperor of India was equipped with equipment to handle a <b>kite</b> <b>balloon.</b> Following the investigation into the Battle of Jutland, the Royal Navy determined that deck protection was insufficient in all of its capital ships; as a result, Emperor of India had an additional [...] of armour over the magazines between October and December 1916.|$|E
500|$|A fire-control {{director}} was {{installed on the}} roof of the spotting top in 1914, before the start of the war in August; her original pole foremast was reinforced by flanged girders to stiffen it and allow it to bear the weight of the director. By October 1914, a pair of [...] anti-aircraft (AA) guns had been added. The torpedo nets were removed in 1915–1916. Approximately [...] of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland and a medium-length rangefinder was added atop the conning tower. Around the same time, the ship was modified to use a <b>kite</b> <b>balloon.</b> By April 1917, the 4-inch guns had been removed from the hull casemates as they were frequently unusable in heavy seas. The casemates were plated over and some of the compartments were used for accommodations. That same year, the spotting top was enlarged and the foremast was fitted with full-sized tripod legs to handle the additional weight.

The Second Army Report Centre at Locre Château was linked by buried cable to each corps report centre, corps heavy artillery headquarters, divisional artillery headquarters, RFC squadrons, balloon headquarters, survey stations and wireless stations. Responsibility for counter-battery fire was given to a counter-battery staff officer with a small staff, who concentrated exclusively on {{the defeat of the}} German artillery. A conference was held each evening by the counter-battery staffs of divisions and corps, methodically to collate the day's reports from observation aircraft and balloons, field survey companies, sound ranging sections and forward observation officers.
