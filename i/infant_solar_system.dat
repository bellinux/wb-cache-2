40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} around the embedded phase of star formation and the chemical links between the various stages of evolution. The primary goal of this work is to pinpoint the origins of cometary complex organic molecules in the preceding protoplanetary disk and prestellar stages, both in the gas and solid phases. The grand motivation is to identify our interstellar roots. This work is unique in comparison to earlier publications due to the dynamic nature of the models used {{in combination with the}} large comprehensive chemical network. Three chapters in this book pertain to physicochemical models and an additional one is of observational nature. Altogether, this thesis is an attempt to piece together the chemical connection between the prestellar core, the protoplanetary disk and the protoplanetary and cometary materials. The main take-home message is that the seeding of <b>infant</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> building blocks with complex organic molecules is unavoidable as a result of chemistry during protoplanetary disk assembly...|$|E

Circumstellar disks {{are known}} to contain a {{significant}} mass in dust ranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual grains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a swarm of non-drifting planetesimals with radii ranging from 1 to 10 ^ 3 km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust drifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several regimes {{depending on the size}} of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance: the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be carried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions (i. e., a turbulence parameter α= 10 ^- 2), filtering is found to be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals extending between 0. 1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent (α= 10 ^- 4) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency x_filter,MMSN scales with r^- 7 / 4 (where r is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with r^- 1 / 4 to r^ 1 / 4 in the settling regime. This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the <b>infant</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e. g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model...|$|E

[...] {{model is}} a {{scenario}} for the dynamical evolution of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> It is named for {{the location of the}} Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, where it was initially developed, in Nice, France. It proposes the migration of the giant planets from an initial compact configuration into their present positions, long after the dissipation of the initial protoplanetary gas disk. In this way, it differs from earlier models of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> formation. This planetary migration is used in dynamical simulations of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> to explain historical events including the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> the formation of the Oort cloud, and the existence of populations of small <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> bodies including the Kuiper belt, the Neptune and Jupiter trojans, and the numerous resonant trans-Neptunian objects dominated by Neptune.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> can be schematically divided into three different phases: the Solar Nebula, the Primordial <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> and the Modern <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> These three periods were characterized by very different conditions, both {{from the point of}} view of the physical conditions and from that of the processes there were acting through them. Across the Solar Nebula phase, planetesimals and planetary embryos were forming and differentiating due to the decay of short-lived radionuclides. At the same time, giant planets formed their cores and accreted the nebular gas to reach their present masses. After the gas dispersal, the Primordial <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> began its evolution. In the inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> planetary embryos formed the terrestrial planets and, in combination with the gravitational perturbations of the giant planets, depleted the residual population of planetesimals.
