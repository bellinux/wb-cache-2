5|$|Languages evolve and diversify over time, and {{the history}} of their {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions and <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded {{to the threat of}} attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys couesi and {{at least}} six more {{narrowly}} distributed species with peripheral distributions together form the O.couesi group within the genus Oryzomys. The eighth species of the genus, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) is {{the only member of}} its own group (unless western populations are classified as a separate species, O.texensis). Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is now {{recognized}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys.

O.couesi occurs with O.dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group.

5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff.

Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack.
