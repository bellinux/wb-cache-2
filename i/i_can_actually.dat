500|$|Adams {{decided to}} focus on the game's {{development}} full-time during his first year of his math post-doctorate at Texas A in 2006. The university offered him $50,000 if he would stay another year. Adams agreed and commented on this, [...] "I woke up the morning after I gave notice, like, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> make this work." [...] Later, Adams expected he would use his $15,000 savings for a year and then have to get a job in order to support himself because the game had not been released yet. Development continued till 8 August 2006, when the first alpha version (version 0.21.93.19a) was released. Donations reached $800–$1000 in the following months, this average increased gradually until they were financially stable. He then decided to solely rely on donations.|$|E

2500|$|The Colour and the Shape {{has been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock, and grunge by professional reviewers. Much of the lyricism found on the album revolves around battered romanticism, more specifically the dissolution of Grohl and Jennifer Youngblood's marriage {{during the winter of}} 1996, which Grohl described as [...] "the winter of my discontent." [...] The album's track sequence reflects this sentiment, chronicling his change from chaos to newfound happiness. Although Grohl admitted the lyricism found on Foo Fighters was obscure and [...] "nonsense," [...] Norton pushed Grohl to write lyrics that had meaning. Grohl also found new strength in his singing compared to the insecurities on his voice for the debut, and delved deeper into his feelings with the lyrics, with him stating that [...] "there was a new freedom: 'Wow, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> write about things I feel strongly about and things that mean something to me and things I wouldn't normally say in everyday conversation.'"

40|$|To {{avoid the}} current paradoxes {{of the global}} agro-food system it is {{necessary}} to define and implement a viable agricultural sustainable model, combining satisfaction of food needs and land preservation. A possible solution {{can be found in a}} holistic production system consistent with a sustainable development model, designed to satisfy diverse “local” economies. The conservation agriculture (CA) could be a part of this model, as it includes a set of best practices available to preserve agrarian soil and its biodiversity. Briefly, we cover the CA background in Europe followed by the evaluation of its impact in terms of private/public interest, using the sustainability’s metric. To test the viability of a model based on CA in “local conditions”, we compare economic performance of different conservation practices (i. e. minimum and no tillage) to that of conventional agriculture in a typical Mediterranean environment - Collina Materana – in Southern Italy (Basilicata region). Our findings suggest that: <b>i)</b> CA <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> be a viable alternative to conventional systems; ii) in Mediterranean agricultural areas CA has yield advantages especially during dry years, when conservation techniques increase water supply to crops; iii) public support is needed to direct farming choices in fact without financial incentives these practices would be not widely accepted and diffused; iv) European policy makers have to recognized the positive benefits of CA and pay them as ecosystem services in the framework of Good Agricultural Environmental Conditions and the present CAP subsidies...|$|R

As to the nudities, if they were ever more nude than now, I should suppose, in their fresh brilliancy, they might well have startled a not very squeamish eye. The effect, such as it is, of this picture, is much injured by the high altar and its canopy, which stands close against the wall, and intercepts a considerable portion of the sprawl of nakedness with which Michael Angelo has filled his sky.

60|$|Now, I {{take this}} bent glass tube, and {{introduce}} one end into {{that part of}} the flame, and you see at once that something is coming from the flame, out {{at the other end of}} the tube; and if I put a flask there, and leave it for a little while, you will see that something from the middle part of the flame is gradually drawn out, and goes through the tube and into that flask, and there behaves very differently from what it does in the open air. It not only escapes from the end of the tube, but falls down to the bottom of the flask like a heavy substance, as indeed it is. We find that this is the wax of the candle made into a vaporous fluid--not a gas. (You must learn the difference between a gas and a vapour: a gas remains permanent, a vapour is something that will condense.) If you blow out a candle, you perceive a very nasty smell, resulting from the condensation of this vapour. That is very different from what you have outside the flame; and, in order to make that more clear to you, I am about to produce and set fire to a larger portion of this vapour--for what we have in the small way in a candle, to understand thoroughly, we must, as philosophers, produce in a larger way, if needful, that we may examine the different parts. And now Mr. Anderson will give me a source of heat, and I am about to shew you what that vapour is. Here is some wax in a glass flask, and I am going to make it hot, as the inside of that candle-flame is hot, and the matter about the wick is hot. [The Lecturer placed some wax in a glass flask, and heated it over a lamp.] Now, I dare say that is hot enough for me. You see that the wax I put in it has become fluid, and there is a little smoke coming from it. We shall very soon have the vapour rising up. I will make it still hotter, and now we get more of it, so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> pour the vapour out of the flask into that basin, and set it on fire there. This, then, is exactly the same kind of vapour as we have in the middle of the candle; and that you may be sure this is the case, let us try whether we have not got here, in this flask, a real combustible vapour out of the middle of the candle. [Taking the flask into which the tube from the candle proceeded, and introducing a lighted taper.] See how it burns. Now, this is the vapour from the middle of the candle, produced by its own heat; and that is one of the first things you have to consider with respect to the progress of the wax in the course of its combustion, and as regards the changes it undergoes. I will arrange another tube carefully in the flame, and I should not wonder if we were able, by a little care, to get that vapour to pass through the tube to the other extremity, where we will light it, and obtain absolutely the flame of the candle at a place distant from it. Now, look at that. Is not that a very pretty experiment? Talk about laying on gas--why, we can actually lay on a candle! And you see from this that there are clearly two different kinds of action--one the production of the vapour, and the other the combustion of it--both of which take place in particular parts of the candle.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use of tree pattern {{matching}} for instruction selection has proven {{very successful in}} modern compilers. This {{can be attributed to}} the declarative nature of tree grammar specifications, which greatly simplifies the development of fast high-quality code generators. The approach has also been adopted widely by generator tools that aim to automatically extract the instruction selector, as well as other compiler components, for application-specific instruction processors from generic processor models. A major advantage of tree {{pattern matching}} is that it is suitable for static analysis and allows to verify properties of a given specification. Completeness is an important example of such a property, in particular for automatically generated compilers. Tree automata can be used to prove that a given instruction selector specification is complete, <b>i.</b> e., <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> generate machine code for all possible input programs. Traditional approaches for completeness tests cannot represent dynamic checks that may disable certain matching rules during code generation. However, these dynamic checks occur very frequently in compilers targeting application-specific processors. The dynamic checks arise from hidden properties that are not captured by the terminal symbols of the tree grammar notation. We apply terminal splitting to the instruction selector specifications that are automatically derived from structural processor models to make these properties explicit. The transformed specification is then verified using a traditional completeness test. If the test fails, counter examples are presented that allow to adopt the compiler or extend the processor model accordingly...|$|R

40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{detailed}} simulation study {{to examine how}} localizing P 2 P traffic within network boundaries impacts the profitability of an ISP. A distinguishing aspect of our work is the focus on Internet-wide implications, i. e., how adoption of localization within an ISP affects both itself and other ISPs. Our simulations are based on detailed models that estimate inter-AS P 2 P traffic and inter-AS routing, localization models that predict {{the extent to which}} P 2 P traffic is reduced, and pricing models that predict the impact of changes in traffic on the profit of an ISP. We evaluate our models by using a large-scale crawl of BitTorrent containing over 138 million users sharing 2. 75 million files. Our results show that the benefits of localization must not be taken for granted. Some of our key findings include: (<b>i)</b> residential ISPs <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> lose money when localization is employed and some of them will not see increased profitability until other ISPs employ localization; (ii) the reduction in costs due to localization will be limited for small ISPs and tends to grow only logarithmically with client population; and (iii) some ISPs can better increase profitability through alternate strategies to localization by taking advantage of the business relationships they have with other ISPs...|$|R

40|$|Influenced {{possibly}} more by volume than substance, {{some scholars have}} concluded that significant progress is being realized in state-level land-use regulation in the United States. In truth, more time must pass before a definitive evaluation of the more comprehensive efforts can be made. In this critical paper I examine the statewide growth-management legislation of the four states having tripartite (local - regional - state) administrative hierarchies: Florida, Vermont, Maine, and Georgia. There and elsewhere, numerous structural compromises have won adoption. Bold declarations of regulatory intent are found here often to be wrapped around ambiguous and easily subverted administrative mechanisms and standards. With prima fade evidence of significant structural shortcomings in hand, I then restore focus on the founding debates {{in search of a}} synthesis that might be more supportive of regional growth management. Using the theory of local autonomy as a starting point, I disentangle the normative foundations of the Liberal ethic of local participation and 'control', and of private rights in property. The centralization of growth management is seen by its proponents as a means to regionalize the 'public interest' in land use, positing a new and more expansive norm defining the public's interest in private property. Opponents, on the other hand, resist the public encumbrance of private land, and find in centralization a regionalized 'public' desirous of greater control and less amenable to private influence. In these opposing views, however, lies the possibility of less conflicted, more efficacious regional growth-management enactments. Centralization, <b>I</b> conclude, <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> deepen the capacity for 'local' participation {{yet at the same time}} extend its domain to matters of regional concern. The result can improve the capability of the local state to manage spillovers, achieve more sustainable patterns of growth, and facilitate more satisfactory templates of private investment and equity accumulation. ...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{draws upon}} ancient political philosophy (Plato and Aristotle) and 20 th century hermeneutic thought (Heidegger and Gadamer) {{to argue that}} our judgment and understanding is always “situated” within a world, or horizon, shaped by the projects, practices, and traditions {{in which we are}} engaged. This means that judgment never starts from scratch. The exercise of judgment, in evaluating competing arguments in politics or law, in trying to understand a philosophical text, in deliberating about how to act in this or that circumstance, is always informed by preconceptions and commitments that we have not justified in advance. In this sense, our judgment is always “prejudiced. ” But contrary to a familiar way of thinking, the prejudicial aspect of judgment is not some regrettable limitation. Certain prejudices, <b>I</b> argue, <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> enable good judgment rather than hinder it. 	 The primary goal of the dissertation is to clarify the concept of prejudice and to draw out its implications for politics, ethics, and philosophy. What does it mean to reason from within the world? What room does such reasoning allow for human agency and political reform? 	 By drawing upon Heidegger’s notion of “Being-in-the-World” and Gadamer’s notion of “horizon,” I develop the idea that our life circumstance is an intelligible perspective that informs our deliberation and judgment. Moreover, our life perspective provides the basis for a kind of situated agency. 	 After elaborating the situated conception of understanding, I show that it is implicit in Aristotle’s notion of practical wisdom (phronesis) and in Plato’s notion of dialectic. My goal is to bring out a link that is often overlooked between their philosophy and 20 th century hermeneutic thought. By reading each in light of the other, we gain a deeper understanding {{of what it means to}} reason from within the perspective of our lives. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
