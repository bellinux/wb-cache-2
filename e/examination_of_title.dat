40|$|Background: Specific {{treatments}} for influenza {{are limited to}} neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes. Corticosteroids show evidence of benefit in sepsis and related conditions, most likely due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Although commonly prescribed for severe influenza, there is uncertainty over their potential benefit or harm. Objectives: To systematically assess the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy {{in the treatment of}} influenza, taking into account differences in timing and doses of corticosteroids. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to June week 1, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to June 2015), CINAHL (1981 to June 2015), LILACS (1982 to June 2015), Web of Science (1985 to June 2015), abstracts from the last three years of major infectious disease and microbiology conferences, and references of included articles. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and observational studies that compared corticosteroid treatment with no corticosteroid treatment for influenza or influenza-like illness. We did not restrict studies by language of publication, influenza subtypes, clinical setting or age of participants. We selected eligible studies in two stages: sequential <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> and abstract, followed by full text. Data collection and analysis: Two pairs of review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled estimates of effect using random-effects meta-analysis models, where appropriate. We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic and assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Main results: We identified 19 eligible studies (3459 individuals), all observational; 13 studies (1917 individuals) were suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis of mortality. Of these, 12 studied patients infected with 2009 influenza A H 1 N 1 virus (H 1 N 1 pdm 09). Risk of bias was greatest in the 'comparability domain' of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, consistent with potential confounding by indication. Data specific to mortality were of very low quality. Reported doses of corticosteroids used were high and indications for their use were not well reported. On meta-analysis, corticosteroid therapy was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio (OR) 3. 06, 95...|$|E

40|$|This comment {{will argue}} that Congress {{did not intend to}} {{prohibit}} statutory accommodation of an individual pregnant employee 2 ̆ 7 s right to temporarily transfer from a hazardous work environment as an alternative to discriminatory fetal protection policies. Additionally, this comment argues that the California legislature 2 ̆ 7 s fear of pre-emption was premature. The legislature should amend the statute to require compliance by title VII employers in order to conform with public policy articulated in California Federal and to fulfill the original legislative intent. This comment recognizes that both male and female workers have a right to work in a toxin-free environment. There are environments nevertheless, such as strenuous or hazardous workplaces, where one may need to consider that certain toxins have negative effects on the reproductive capabilities of workers. The goal of title VII, equality of employment opportunity, would not be undermined by accommodating a trait unique to women such as pregnancy, through the use of California 2 ̆ 7 s mandatory transfer provisions. In illustration of the necessity of the right to temporary transfer provisions, this comment provides a brief history of employers 2 ̆ 7 use of discriminatory fetal protection policies against pregnant workers. Following is a discussion of the inadequacy of the federal approach to alleviating pregnancy discrimination in the context of hazardous environments, beginning with an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and including California 2 ̆ 7 s Fair Employment and Housing Commission 2 ̆ 7 s disagreement with recent federal case law in this area. The section includes a discussion of enforcement of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The section also critiques the bias in the scientific data upon which the federal system relies to justify and analyze employers 2 ̆ 7 use of fetal protection policies. The next section discusses the impact of federal case law on the Fair Employment and Housing Commission 2 ̆ 7 s enforcement capabilities. The comment then explores the recent United States Supreme Court decision in California Federal. Following, is an examination of the legislative history of the California statute which provides temporary transfers for pregnant employees in hazardous environments. In light of California Federal, the comment argues that the California legislature was premature in fearing title VII pre-emption. The conclusion asserts that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and California statute can coexist and argues for the elimination of subsection (e) of CAL. GOV 2 ̆ 7 T CODE § 12945...|$|E

The leading rule for a lawyer, as for the man of every other calling, is diligence. Leave nothing for to-morrow which can be done to-day. Never let your correspondence fall behind. Whatever piece of business you have in hand, before stopping, do all the labour pertaining to it which can then be done. When you bring a common law-suit, {{if you have the}} facts for doing so, write the declaration at once. If a law point be involved, examine the books, and note the authority you rely on upon the declaration itself, where you are sure to find it when wanted. The same of defences and pleas. In business not likely to be litigated,--ordinary collection cases, foreclosures, partitions, and the like,--make all <b>examinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles,</b> and note them and even draft orders and decrees in advance.

The literature search was carried out in the electronic databases Pubmed and Bireme, using the keywords: obesity, overweight, BMI, adolescents and Brazil. The following inclusion criteria were considered: Brazilian adolescents, BMI-based obesity estimates, publication until 2007, and adequate methodology. After the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles,</b> abstracts and full texts, 27 papers fulfilled our inclusion criteria. For describing the studies, the following variables were used: type of survey, design, age range, sample size, place of data collection. For evaluating the evidence, the following indicators were used: methods used, independent variables studied, statistical analyses employed, and cut-off used for defining obesity. Most studies used cross-sectional designs (77. 7 %) and were carried out through home interviews (51. 7 %). Only one study used a nationally-based sample and three used regional-based samples (Northeast and Southeast). Regardless the design, place, type of survey, age range and cut-off used, the prevalence of obesity tended to be higher in the following groups: adolescents living in the Southeast region, living in urban areas, from high socioeconomic level and from private schools. In terms of behavioral determinants of obesity, the paucity of prospective studies and the difficulties of adequately measuring physical activity and food consumption, make the results less clear. Although the number of studies has increased, it is still necessary to stimulate surveys in the North, Southeast and Mideast regions.

40|$|The name of Amenhotep son of Hapu is {{well-known}} to scholars. He was similarly distinguished {{in ancient times}} as one who reached extraordinary heights during life and whose memory was preserved for centuries after death. This thesis engages with the premise that an individual constructed monuments for commemoration and memorialisation, and thus that the individual was governed by this motive during their creation. Two statues of Amenhotep in particular {{are believed to have}} served as mediators between human and god, and by exploring the ways in which he presented himself on the nine contemporary statues which are currently known (all but one originating at Karnak) it is argued that he deliberately portrayed himself as a suitable intermediary, encouraging this form of remembrance.

40|$|In {{the seventh}} chapter of Pantagruel, written in 1532, François Rabelais {{seized on the}} {{relationship}} between titles and books to pose a serious linguistic challenge to the stability of the book and its tenuous role in supporting an architectonic system of knowledge. The chapter consists primarily of a disordered catalog <b>of</b> invented <b>titles,</b> and the author assures us elsewhere that if we wish to grasp his deeper meaning we should examine these titles closely. A first look shows us that he is mocking particular authors and titling conventions, while further exploration reveals the catalog as a whole to serve as a macro-critique of scholastic attempts to order and regiment knowledge. But his critique also operates on the micro-level <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> as a function of naming.

Physical rehabilitation of those affected might help to improve activities of daily living. Objectives: our primary objective was to assess the effects of physical rehabilitation therapies and interventions for people with CIP and CIM in improving activities of daily living such as walking, bathing, dressing and eating. Secondary objectives were to assess effects on muscle strength and quality of life, and to assess adverse effects of physical rehabilitation. Search methods: on 16 July 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register and on 14 July 2014 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL Plus. In July 2014, we searched the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro, [URL] and three trials registries for ongoing trials and further data about included studies. There were no language restrictions. We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings and screened reference lists to identify further trials. Selection criteria: we planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and randomised controlled cross-over trials of any rehabilitation intervention in people with acquired weakness syndrome due to CIP/CIM. Data collection and analysis: we would have extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and classified the quality of evidence for outcomes in duplicate, according to the standard procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. Outcome data collection would have been for activities of daily living (for example, mobility, walking, transfers and self care). Secondary outcomes included muscle strength, quality of life and adverse events. Main results: the search strategy retrieved 3587 references.

Methods: Following PRISMA guideline, a systematic review was carried out. Results: The initial search retrieved 51763 articles identified through database searching, and 41 articles identified through manual search. After <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> and the abstract, 83 articles were retrieved for further examination. Sixty-two articles were included, thus obtaining a total of 104 patients.

The study of women’s historiography worldwide, historically, was largely neglected until {{the feminist movement}} advocated {{for the inclusion of}} women’s contributions to world history. The inclusion of ‘women and gender’ studies in Egyptology commenced in the late 1980 ’s, however, the predominance of literature pertains to the Pharaonic period. To date, little concentrated analysis dedicated to the women of Early Dynastic period (3150 – 2890 BC) has been undertaken. The thesis investigates the roles {{of the women in the}} early Egyptian society, through the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the biographic details recorded on their funerary monuments. The multi-disciplinary investigation combines a textual, and a new sociological approach, to the women’s titles recovered from the cemeteries of Abydos, Abu Rawash and Helwan. The evaluation into the previous scholarship regarding the titles uncovers androcentric characterisation of the women as concubines associated with the harem, which has masked the women’s participation in the society. The textual analysis re-evaluates the titles objectively and situates the women’s involvement contextually, providing new insight into the society of Early Dynastic Egypt. The study offers an anthology of the women’s Early Dynastic stelae that provides a framework for the developments and changes to women’s roles throughout the different period of Egyptian history.

40|$|This Article takes a {{comprehensive}} {{look at the}} failure <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> VII as a system for claiming nondiscrimination rights. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire 2 ̆ 6 Rubber Company, 127 S. Ct. 2162 (2007), requiring an employee to assert a Title VII pay discrimination claim within 180 days of when the discriminatory pay decision was first made, marks {{the tip of the}} iceberg in this flawed system. In the past decade, Title VII doctrines at both ends of the rights-claiming process have become increasing hostile to employees. At the front end, Title VII imposes strict requirements on employees to promptly report and assert claims of discrimination. These requirements leave little room for gaps in knowledge, hesitation in responding, or fears of retaliation to delay rights-claiming. The model of rights-claiming behavior at the heart of this doctrine contrasts starkly with extensive social science research on how people perceive and respond to discrimination in the real world. The juxtaposition <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> VII doctrine with this social science literature reveals a fundamentally flawed framework for asserting discrimination rights. Employees make out poorly at the other end of the rights-claiming process too. Those employees who do step forward to complain of discrimination are left with grossly inadequate protection from retaliation for doing so. Recent developments in retaliation law have weakened protections for employees, reinforcing the very reasons employees are unlikely to assert nondiscrimination rights in the first place. Together, Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s timely complaint and retaliation doctrines create an untenable framework for employees in need of the law 2 ̆ 7 s substantive protections. Rather than salvage this system, the recent trend toward employer-sponsored internal processes for resolving discrimination complaints exacerbates these flaws in ways that have yet to be acknowledged in the push for greater reliance on such internal processes. This Article marks an important contribution to the literature on Title VII and discrimination law, as the first major <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> how <b>Title</b> VII functions as a rights-claiming syste...|$|R
5000|$|The full <b>title</b> <b>of</b> {{the book}} is Les anecdotes de Suede, ou Histoire secrette des changemens arrivés dans ce royaume, sous le regne de Charles XI (The anecdotes of Sweden or the secret history of the changes {{occurred}} in Sweden under the reign of Charles XI). The book was written under the regime of Charles XI of Sweden, when the Crown recaptured lands earlier granted to the nobility. The reductions had been fought for by gentry, tradesmen, state servants, and peasantry alike, partly {{as a way to}} curb the power of the great aristocratic families and partly as a way to make the state solvent and able to pay its debts. The book describes the Riksdag of the Estates assembled by Charles XI in 1680 and the events that led to reduction. Sweden's weak economy had suffered during the Scanian War and was in a deep crisis. At this session of the assembly, which has been described {{as one of the most}} important, the king finally pushed through the reduction of aristocratic land holdings, which had been discussed in the Riksdag since 1650. The decision meant that any land or other holding previously owned by the crown and lent or given away — including counties, baronies and lordships — could be recovered. The ruling affected many nobles, some of whom were ruined. The reduction process involved the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> every <b>title</b> deed in the kingdom — including the dominions — and resulted in the complete readjustment of the nation's finances.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has been focused on}} the portrayal of intimate partner homicides in the news media with specific emphasis on the most commonly occurring type, femicides (the murder of a female intimate partner by a male intimate partner). One important finding in the analysis of intimate partner homicide is the striking number of femicides that are followed by perpetrator suicide. Whereas homicide followed by suicide is a rare occurrence in the context of crime generally, within the context of intimate partner homicide, femicide–suicide is common. The present research utilized content analysis to explore the media coverage of a near population of femicide–suicide cases in the North Carolina from 2002 to 2009 (n = 86). An <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the article <b>titles</b> showed that the majority <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> (54 %) assigned to the articles describe the crime as an ambiguous homicide or homicide–suicide and do not indicate the relationship between the perpetrator and victim. In comparison, results show that 78 % of the articles’ text defined the homicide–suicide as domestic violence. Specifically, in cases where the news coverage defined the femicide–suicide as domestic violence, the authors identified 4 media frames used (1) femicide–suicide by a male perpetrator, (2) femicide–suicide due to loss of perpetrator control, (3) femicide–suicide as a mercy killing, and (4) femicide–suicide due to jealousy. Implications for societal perceptions of violence against women as well as corresponding victims’ policies/services are presented and discussed...|$|R
