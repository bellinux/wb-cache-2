5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of <b>helium</b> <b>gas</b> at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when <b>helium</b> <b>gas</b> at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.|$|E

5|$|Since 2002, the American National Archives stores {{important}} national documents {{such as the}} Declaration of Independence and the Constitution within argon-filled {{cases to}} inhibit their degradation. Argon is preferable to the helium {{that had been used}} in the preceding five decades, because <b>helium</b> <b>gas</b> escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.|$|E
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude <b>helium</b> <b>gas</b> is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of small installations, {{convenience}} may outweigh cost. There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release <b>helium</b> <b>gas,</b> which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E

50|$|In {{gases and}} plasma, {{the degree of}} {{ionization}} refers to the proportion of neutral particles that are ionized into charged particles. For example, when electricity passes through a novelty plasma ball, perhaps 1% of the gases are ionized (sometimes referred to as partially ionized). Our Sun and all stars contain largely hydrogen and <b>helium</b> <b>gases,</b> that are fully ionized into electrons, protons (H+) and helium ions (He++).|$|R
40|$|Oil {{injected}} twin-screw compressors {{are widely}} used for medium pressure applications in many industries. Low cost air compressors can be adopted for compression of <b>helium</b> and other <b>gases,</b> leading to significant cost saving. To generate machine independent experimental data, two similar compressors with different capacities have been built to asses the performance of air compressor when applied to compress nitrogen, argon and <b>helium</b> <b>gases</b> apart from air. Also this paper addresses the effect of oil injection quantity and its temperature on volumetric and power efficiency.

5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the <b>helium</b> <b>gas,</b> the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

25|$|The X-15 {{reaction}} control system (RCS), for maneuvering in low-pressure/density environment, used high-test peroxide (HTP), which decomposes into water and {{oxygen in the}} presence of a catalyst and could provide a specific impulse of 140 seconds. The HTP also fueled a turbopump for the main engines and auxiliary power units (APUs). Additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions, for example the fuselage interior was purged with <b>helium</b> <b>gas,</b> and the liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems.|$|E
25|$|These {{elements}} constituted only 0.6% of {{the material}} in the solar nebula. That is why the terrestrial planets could not grow very large and could not exert large pull on hydrogen and <b>helium</b> <b>gas.</b> Also, the faster collisions among particles close to the Sun were more destructive on average. Even if the terrestrial planets had had hydrogen and helium, the Sun would have heated the gases and caused them to escape. Hence, solar terrestrial planets such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are dense small worlds composed mostly from 2% of heavier elements contained in the solar nebula.|$|E

The vehicle carried IRS-1D {{satellite}} which was deployed in the Sun-synchronous Low Earth orbit. This was India's first launch vehicle built without Russian assistance and PSLV's first operational flight placed IRS-1D into a polar orbit. However, it could not place the satellite in the desired circular orbit but in an elliptical orbit due to a leak of <b>helium</b> <b>gas</b> {{from one of the}} components.

40|$|Some of {{ion beam}} {{properties}} {{have been investigated}} by using Lee model code on plasma focus devices which is operated with nitrogen and <b>helium</b> <b>gases.</b> The operation of plasma focus in different pressure regime gives a consistent ion beam properties which can make the plasma focus a reliable ion beam source. These ion beam properties such as ion beam flux, ion beam fluence, ion beam energy, ion beam current, and beam ion number corresponding to gas pressure have been studied for Mather type plasma focus device. The result shows the differences between <b>helium</b> as lighter <b>gas</b> and nitrogen as heavier gas in term of ion beam properties.

25|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it a valuable tool in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the Joule–Thomson effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the <b>helium</b> <b>gas</b> is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{damage to}} nickel alloys - The {{standard}} Hastelloy N alloy {{was found to}} be embrittled by neutron radiation. Neutrons reacted with nickel to form helium. This <b>helium</b> <b>gas</b> concentrated at specific points inside the alloy, where it increased stresses. ORNL addressed this problem by adding 1–2% titanium or niobium to the Hastelloy N. This changed the alloy's internal structure so that the helium would be finely distributed. This relieved the stress and allowed the alloy to withstand considerable neutron flux. However the maximum temperature is limited to about 650°C. Development of other alloys may be required. The outer vessel wall that contains the salt can have neutronic shielding, such as boron carbide, to effectively protect it from neutron damage.|$|E
25|$|After the day {{required}} to make the tank safe by purging remaining hydrogen gas with <b>helium</b> <b>gas,</b> NASA engineers prepared for disconnection of the vent arm and the significant number of lines prior to taking their {{first look at the}} GUCP. On the night of 9 November, technicians began disconnecting the GUCP by unhooking and lowering the hydrogen vent line. Teams performed an initial inspection of the flight seal and quick disconnect prior to sending them to labs for a thorough engineering analysis. Engineers reported an unevenly (asymmetrically) compressed internal seal and the quick disconnect hardware also seemed have a less concentric fit than pre-fueling measurements indicated. Inspections also confirmed the condition of the hardware did not match the observations documented when it was installed on the external tank inside the VAB.|$|E
