40|$|Shedding is {{the first}} primary motions of loom. It is done by raising and {{lowering}} the Heald frames. The heald frames on a loom are positioned {{side by side with}} a little distance as possible. The different positions of heald frame causes the variation in distance from cloth fell to peek of shed. In the present paper, the effect ofthis positional variation upon warp yarns, fabric properties and most importantly the whole weaving procedure have been concentrated. To find out the significance of this effect, two categories of fabric was produced using same weave (combination of plain and twill) but changing drafting plan. In the first category, the warp yarnshaving plain weave were threaded to heald frames nearest to the cloth fell and the other portion of warp yarns having twill weave were threaded farthest to the cloth fell. The drafting plan of second category was reverse the first category. All the other parameters were same in both cases. During weaving, weaving performances wasobserved and recorded in both cases. Later, crimp% of plain and twill portion of both fabrics were measured by Tautex Digital Crimp Tester and yarn strength of plain and twill portion of both samples were measured by Titan universal strength tester. It was observed that selecting heald frame position have substantial effect on crimp%,yarn strength and fabric performance. It is expected that this study will be help full to increase weaving performance and ensure better fabric quality in case of producing <b>fancy</b> <b>weave...</b>|$|E

For as his hermit did that mild unearthly face always come before him.

In her secret heart she almost approximated to her father's enthusiasm in wishing to show Giles once for all how she still regarded him. The question whether the future would indeed bring them together for life was a standing wonder with her. She knew that it could not with any propriety do so just yet. But reverently believing in her father's sound judgment and knowledge, as good girls are wont to do, she remembered what he had written about her giving a hint to Winterborne lest there should be risk in delay, and her feelings were not averse to such a step, so far as it could be done without danger at this early stage of the proceedings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Current global {{textiles}} and fashion industries have gradually shifted focus to high value-added, high sensibility, and multi-functional products based on new human-friendliness and sustainable growth technologies. Textile design CAD {{systems have been}} developed in conjunction with computer hardware and software sector advances. This study compares the patterns or images of actual woven fabrics and virtual fabrics prepared with a textile design CAD system. In this study, several weave structures (such as <b>fancy</b> yarn <b>weave</b> and patterns) were prepared with a shuttle loom. The woven textile images were taken using a CCD camera. The same weave structure data and yarn data were fed into a textile design CAD system in order to simulate fabric images as similarly as possible. Similarity Index analysis methods allowed for an anal-ysis of the index between the actual fabric specimen and the simulated image of the corresponding fabric. The results showed that repeated small pattern weaves provide superior similarity index values than those of a <b>fancy</b> yarn <b>weave</b> that indicate some irregularities due to fancy yarn attributes. A Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity(CW-SSIM) index resulted in a better index than other methods such as Multi-Scale(MS) SSIM, and Feature Similarity(FS) SSIM, across fabric specimen images. A correlation analysis of the similarity index based on an image analysis and a similarity eval-uation by panel members was also implemented.

40|$|Both loop fancy yarns and frotte fancy yarns {{belong to}} the group of yarns with {{continuous}} effects. The difference between frotte and loop yarn relies {{on the fact that the}} loop yarn is constructed with two core yarns and the frotte yarn is constructed with only one core yarn. The differences are evident in the shape of these two types of fancy yarns. These shape differences are the functions of the tensions of component yarns during the twisting process. The shape and construction of the fancy yarn influence its properties. The properties of loop and frotte <b>fancy</b> yarns, <b>woven</b> and knitted fabrics are compared in this article in order to find out the optimal yarn’s and fabric’s production condition to satisfy the final user and maintain low production costs. In terms of economy aspects only, the frotte fancy yarns are believed to be cheaper in production due to lower quantity of components utilize for their production to compare with loop fancy yarns, under conditions of the same settings of ring twisting frame...|$|R

6000|$|Yet though {{lovely and}} full of noble feeling, my poor Perdita (for this was the fanciful name my sister had {{received}} from her dying parent), was not altogether saintly in her disposition. Her manners were cold and repulsive. If she had been nurtured by those who had regarded her with affection, {{she might have been}} different; but unloved and neglected, she repaid want of kindness with distrust and silence. She was submissive to those who held authority over her, but a perpetual cloud dwelt on her brow; {{she looked as if she}} expected enmity from every one who approached her, and her actions were instigated by the same feeling. All the time she could command she spent in solitude. She would ramble to the most unfrequented places, and scale dangerous heights, that in those unvisited spots she might wrap herself in loneliness. Often she passed whole hours walking up and down the paths of the woods; she wove garlands of flowers and ivy, or watched the flickering of the shadows and glancing of the leaves; sometimes she sat beside a stream, and as her thoughts paused, threw flowers or pebbles into the waters, watching how those swam and these sank; or she would set afloat boats formed of bark of trees or leaves, with a feather for a sail, and intensely watch the navigation of her craft among the rapids and shallows of the brook. Meanwhile her active <b>fancy</b> <b>wove</b> a thousand combinations; she dreamt [...] "of moving accidents by flood and field"--she lost herself delightedly in these self-created wanderings, and returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life. Poverty was the cloud that veiled her excellencies, and all that was good in her seemed about to perish from want of the genial dew of affection. She had not even the same advantage as I in the recollection of her parents; she clung to me, her brother, as her only friend, but her alliance with me completed the distaste that her protectors felt for her; and every error was magnified by them into crimes. If she had been bred in that sphere of life to which by inheritance the delicate framework of her mind and person was adapted, she would have been the object almost of adoration, for her virtues were as eminent as her defects. All the genius that ennobled the blood of her father illustrated hers; a generous tide flowed in her veins; artifice, envy, or meanness, were at the antipodes of her nature; her countenance, when enlightened by amiable feeling, might have belonged to a queen of nations; her eyes were bright; her look fearless.|$|R

But lo! the boy proves a young war-horse, neighing for battle, burning for gunpowder and guns, for bowie-knives and revolvers, and for every form and expression of physical force;--he might make a splendid trapper, an energetic sea-captain, a bold, daring military man, but his whole boyhood is full of rebukes and disciplines for sins which are only the blind effort of the creature to express a nature which his parent does not and cannot understand.

Then the secret agonies,--the long years of sorrowful watchings of those gentler nurses of humanity who receive the infant into their bosom out of the void unknown, and strive to read its horoscope through the mists of their prayers and tears!--what perplexities,--what confusion! Especially is this so in a community where the moral and religious sense is so cultivated as in New England, and frail, trembling, self-distrustful mothers are told that the shaping and ordering not only of this present life, but of an immortal destiny, is in their hands.|$|R

The results obtained were as follows: 1) As for the environment in the workshop, a noise level of weaving machines reached 80 phone. This value appeared to show the influence on the physical function of workers. 2) Admitted was want of sleeping hours among most of the workers because of irregular working hours, that is, over ten-hour labor a day (this contained 32. 4 % of the workers) and a working system of day-and-night shift. 3) Most of subjective fatigue complaints were the cases of chronic fatigue. The values of Donaggio's test of urine were high in 32. 7 % of the workers. 4) It was found mostly in the subjects of night-working type that values of Flicker descrimination varied more than 10 % upward and found in the sujects of early-morning-working type that varied more than 10 % downward. 5) As for the conditions of nutrition intake, it appeared that the side food was preferred to the staple food.

40|$|For years {{archaeologists have}} {{commented on the}} {{occurrence}} of typically Aegean patterns on the ceilings of {{a fair number of}} Egyptian tombs, while musing that they could not see how such patterns were reaching Egypt. Certainly Minoan and Mycenaean potsherds had been found in fair numbers in Egypt; but the designs on the Egyptian ceilings were not the ones used by Aegean potters. To me, however, the particular patterns and layouts seemed strongly reminiscent of weaving —a craft I was quite familiar with, unlike most archaeologists, because my mother was a weaver. If the source of these ceiling patterns were indeed pieces of imported cloth, it would explain why the archaeologists could see no mode of transport, since the cloth itself has not survived. Indeed not a scrap of patterned textile has survived in the Aegean area from the Bronze Age: Greece {{is one of the worst}} places in all of Europe and the Mediterranean for the preservation of textiles. So what do we have to go on? For one thing, we can examine what they show themselves as wearing. And what gorgeous textiles they are! In fresco after fresco we see handsome all-over polychrome patterns, the favorite being interlocked shapes like trefoils and quatrefoils. On the one hand, most archaeologists have assumed, if they thought about it at all, that the scrumptious fabric designs in these frescoes were far beyond the weavers of the day, and hence that the Bronze Age fresco painters had invented the designs to make their pictures look pretty. And of course no such cloth has survived to prove the case either way, because no cloth has survived at all from Minoan Crete. We have, however, an independent source of evidence about what people were capable of weaving—namely, the more general history of European weaving—and it tells us that Europeans of lesser cultures nearby had already been <b>weaving</b> <b>fancy</b> cloth for millennia. We know from various sorts of archaeological and palaeobotanical evidence, for example, that flax had been in use for textiles throughout southeastern Europe since the 6 th millennium BC, and that wool and woolly sheep had been introduced from the Near East shortly before 3000 BC (the end of the Neolithic). At about this time we are lucky enough to get some fragments of patterned cloth from various other parts of central and southern Europe—from the Swiss pile dwellings, the Megalithic passage graves of East Germany, and the pile dwellings of northern Italy. Most of these textiles are patterned with supplemental wefts: one splendid example is the famous Neolithic linen 2 ̆ 2 brocade 2 ̆ 2 from Irgenhausen, in Switzerland, which analysis shows must have been executed in a minimum of 3 colors, possibly more...|$|R
