40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{foundations}} of analytical dynamics. It obtains the <b>explicit</b> <b>equations</b> of motion for mechanical systems that are subjected to non-ideal holonomic and nonholonomic equality constraints. It provides an easy incorporation of such non-ideal constraints into the framework of Lagrangian dynamics. It bases its approach on a fundamental principle that includes non-ideal constraints and that reduces to D’Alembert’s Principle in the special case when all the constraints become ideal. Based on this, the problem of determining the equations of motion for the constrained system is reformulated as a constrained minimization problem. This yields a new fundamental minimum principle of analytical dynamics that reduces to Gauss’s Principle when the constraints become ideal. The solution of this minimization problem then yields the <b>explicit</b> <b>equations</b> of motion for systems with non-ideal constraints.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the general {{structure}} for the <b>explicit</b> <b>equations</b> of motion for general mechanical systems subjected to holonomic and non-holonomic equality constraints. The constraints considered here need not satisfy D’Alembert’s principle, and our derivation {{is not based on}} the principle of virtual work. Therefore, the equations obtained here have general applicability. They show that in the presence of such constraints, the constraint force acting on the systemcan always be viewed as made up of the sumof two components. The explicit formfor each of the two components is provided. The rst of these components is the constraint force that would have existed, were all the constraints ideal; the second is caused by the non-ideal nature of the constraints, and though it needs speci cation by the mechanician and depends on the particular situation at hand, this component nonetheless has a speci c form. The paper also provides a generalized formof D’Alembert’s principle which is then used to obtain the <b>explicit</b> <b>equations</b> of motion for constrained mechanical systems where the constraints may be non-ideal. We show an example where the new general, <b>explicit</b> <b>equations</b> of motion obtained in this paper are used to directly write the equations of motion for describing a non-holonomically constrained system with non-ideal constraints. Lastly, we provide a geometrical description of constrained motion and thereby exhibit the simplicity with which Nature seems to operate...|$|R
