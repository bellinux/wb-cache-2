In this study, the morphology and distribution of primordial follicles were studied in <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> from 24 women before and after cryopreservation. Cryopreservation did not significantly change either the morphology or number per unit volume of morphologically normal follicles in frozen <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue.</b> Primordial follicles were predominant, accounting for 78. 6 % and 82. 6 % of total follicles in fresh and frozen <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissues</b> respectively. The distribution of follicles was extremely uneven in <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue.</b> A large variation in follicle numbers was observed in <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> samples from patient to patient, and even in the same patient, indicating that the number of follicles counted in one sample of <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> may not represent the number of follicles in other <b>tissue</b> samples. <b>Ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> could be frozen in the form of strips instead of fragments for fast processing and better viability of <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> in cryopreservation.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} cryopreservation and thawing of <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> from oncological patients opting for fertility preservation on <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> viability. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, the <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> viability before and after cryopreservation and thawing was measured for 25 newly diagnosed oncological patients who had their <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> cryopreserved. Outcome measures were follicle integrity (histology), follicle viability (Calcein viability assay), steroid hormone production (estradiol and progesterone production in vitro) and overall tissue viability (glucose uptake in vitro). This study was conducted at a Cryobank for storage of <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> in a university hospital. RESULTS: Cryopreserved/thawed <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> showed a decreased glucose uptake when compared to tissue {{that had not been}} cryopreserved. In addition, a diminished E 2 and P 4 production was observed after cryopreservation and thawing, despite the fact that numbers of viable follicles as determined by the Calcein viability assay were comparable.

40|$|<b>Ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> {{cryopreservation}} {{is currently}} proposed to young cancer patients {{to preserve their}} fertility before radio-chemotherapy.

We therefore decided to evaluate the presence of leukemic cells in cryopreserved <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> from 18 leukemic patients: 6 with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 12 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In each case, histology, RT-qPCR and long-term (6 months) xenografting to immunodeficient mice were used. Histology did not identify any malignant cells in the <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue.</b> By RT-qPCR, 2 out of 6 CML patients were positive for BCR-ABL in their <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue.</b> Among the 12 ALL patients, 7 of the 10 with available molecular markers showed positive leukemic markers in their <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> (translocations or rearrangement genes). Four mice grafted with <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> from ALL patients developed intraperitoneal leukemic masses. In conclusion, this study demonstrates, by RT-qPCR, ovarian contamination by malignant cells in acute as well as chronic leukemia, while histology fails to do so.

40|$|Preserving {{viability}} of frozen gametes and reproductive tissues {{is crucial to}} understand and overcome species-specificities in respect to the diversity in cryobiological properties and requirements among cell types and tissues. The use of different animal models to study <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> cryopreservation will help to uncover several important factors related to germ cells preservation. Horses (Equus ferus caballus) have been proven to be an excellent model for reproductive biology studies with implications for humans. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{are one of the}} most abundant wild species in the United States, but little information about their reproductive features are known. Therefore, five studies were conducted in this Dissertation with the following general objectives: (i) to develop <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> cryopreservation techniques for horses and white-tailed deer species; and (ii) to determine the effects of <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> cryopreservation techniques on morphological and molecular mechanisms related to folliculogenesis in horse and white-tailed deer species. In study one, equine <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> was used to determine the ideal ovarian fragment size for better cooling resistance under storage at 4 Â°C. In study two, equine <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissues</b> were used to determine the toxicity effect of cryoprotective agents on <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> pre- and post-cryopreservation. In study three, equine <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissues</b> were used to compare slow-freezing versus vitrification; and to determine the best cryoprotective agents for each cryopreservation method. In study four, white-tailed deer reproductive tracts were used to characterize the age effect on reproductive features. In study five, white-tailed deer <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> was used to compare slow-freezing versus vitrification methods to preserve preantral follicles under in vitro culture. The main findings of the horse studies were: (i) equine <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> can be stored at 4 Â°C for up to 24 h when biopsy ovarian fragments are used; (ii) ethylene glycol seems to be a less harmful cryoprotectant agent to equine preantral follicles; and (iii) both slow-freezing and vitrification methods similarly preserved the follicle morphology after time of culture. The main findings of the white-tailed deer studies were: (i) aging caused quantitative and qualitative effects on the ovarian reserve of white-tailed deer; (ii) fresh <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> can be cultured for up to seven days preserving the tissue integrity; and (iii) fragments cryopreserved by vitrification had higher follicle viability during in vitro culture than by the slow-freezing method.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Is it {{possible}} to create {{a model system that}} mimics ovarian metastatic disease in order to devise new strategies to detect cancer cells and prevent cancer cell transmission via <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> autotransplantation in cancer survivors? SUMMARY ANSWER: Injection of bovine or human ovarian cortex fragments with cells from different cancer types {{led to the formation of}} proliferating tumour masses and newly formed small metastatic lesions. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Autotransplantation of <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> comes with the major concern of cancer cells possibly being present in the tissue. A model system to develop strategies aimed at enhancing the safety of <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> autotransplantation is currently lacking. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The ability of injected human leukaemia, lymphoma, Ewing's sarcoma or breast cancer cells to proliferate and form tumour-like structures in bovine and human <b>ovarian</b> cortex <b>tissue</b> in vitro was assessed. The injected cells were from human cancer cell lines. After 4 days of culture, some tissue fragments were harvested for standard histological staining and immunohistochemical staining of tumour cell specific antigens and the Ki 67 proliferation marker, while the remaining fragments were incubated for an additional 6 days (bovine tissue) or 3 days (human tissue) before analysis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Experiments were performed with <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> from women after prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. Bovine <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> was obtained at an abattoir. Glucose uptake during in vitro culture was monitored to quantify the viability of tissue. Tumour formation was assessed at Day 4 and Day 10 in bovine <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> and at Day 4 and Day 7 in human <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue,</b> using histology and immunohistochemistry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We found that bovine and human <b>ovarian</b> cortex <b>tissue</b> could be cultured for up to 10 and 7 days, respectively, without any loss of viability. Our preliminary results show that all cell lines tested were capable of forming proliferating tumours in <b>ovarian</b> cortex <b>tissue</b> in vitro. Lymphoma and breast cancer cells produced small metastases near the original lesions. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The tumour model presented was based on the growth of human cancer cell lines in <b>ovarian</b> cortex <b>tissue.</b> It is unknown whether these cells behave differently from malignant cells derived from primary tumours. In addition, the human <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> was derived from women over 39 years of age, which is obviously considerably older than patients opting for <b>ovarian</b> <b>tissue</b> cryopreservation.
