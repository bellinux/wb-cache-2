25|$|The {{development}} of molecular biology {{is also the}} encounter of two disciplines which made considerable progress {{in the course of}} the first thirty years of the twentieth century: biochemistry and genetics. The first studies the structure and function of the molecules which make up living things. Between 1900 and 1940, the central processes of metabolism were described: the process of digestion and the absorption of the nutritive elements derived from alimentation, such as the sugars. <b>Every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> processes is catalyzed by a particular enzyme. Enzymes are proteins, like the antibodies present in blood or the proteins responsible for muscular contraction. As a consequence, the study of proteins, of their structure and synthesis, became one of the principal objectives of biochemists.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{approach}} suggested by , Thomas Hales, {{then at the}} University of Michigan, determined that the maximum density of all arrangements could be found by minimizing a function with 150 variables. In 1992, assisted by his graduate student Samuel Ferguson, he embarked on a research program to systematically apply linear programming methods to find a lower bound {{on the value of}} this function for each one of a set of over 5,000 different configurations of spheres. If a lower bound (for the function value) could be found for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> configurations that was greater than the value of the function for the cubic close packing arrangement, then the Kepler conjecture would be proved. To find lower bounds for all cases involved solving about 100,000 linear programming problems.|$|E
