2500|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1946, Morrison appointed Adair Watters [...] {{superintendent of the}} New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) {{in an effort to}} eliminate corruption. But tensions developed when Watters moved to suppress gambling, prostitution, and other vice too zealously for Morrison's liking. Watters resigned in February 1949 because of Morrison's political interference with NOPD activities. Throughout most of the 1950s, scandals continued to be revealed concerning the involvement of the NOPD in graft and vice. [...] In 1952, the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans was established as an independent monitor of the NOPD and the Morrison administration's approach to vice. State Police Colonel Francis Grevemberg, later a two-time gubernatorial candidate, led a series of high-profile raids on New Orleans gambling establishments that embarrassed Morrison and the NOPD for its inactivity. Eventually, retired FBI Agent Aaron M. Kohn was sent from Chicago to investigate NOPD involvement in vice. Kohn later recalled:"After about a year, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> something about the system down here. In Chicago, people were generally {{on one side of the}} fence or the other—honest or crooked. But in Louisiana, there just isn't any fence." [...] He soon complained that Morrison was obstructing his efforts. In 1955, Morrison forced the mayor to ask for Schuering's resignation.|$|E

60|$|We dined {{well and}} gayly. Mr. Bundercombe renewed many {{restaurant}} acquaintances and I am quite sure he thoroughly enjoyed himself.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that I {{had made}} an awkward capture; that I had under my hand one whom I dared not set free, and could not take with me.

6000|$|... "Where can we hide here?"

40|$|I want to {{take one}} {{paragraph}} from the second chapter (Social debt, silent gift) from Clara Han’s compelling account of the braiding of care and violence in post-Pinochet neoliberal Chile and work out its implications for anthropology with regard to questions of social suffering, poverty, and how we may understand {{the pursuit of the}} good. The paragraph that occurs on page seventy-nine goes as follows: Later, when I asked Paloma who her friends were in the población, she said to me, “Friends? I don’t have any friends. Susana is my friend. We share our intimacies. Friends are few, neighbors are many. ” Indeed, such a sentiment was echoed to me by many women in La Pincoya. Only upon meditation upon the boundary between neighbors and friends did <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the crucial difference between inhabiting friendship and neighborliness lay not in the perceptive ability of catching those signs of critical moments, such as the cry of Paloma’s hungry child, but in how that catching would be or could be addressed...|$|R
2500|$|Two of the theatre's stars {{provided}} {{inspiration for}} the young singer. [...] "Watching the art of Nezhdanova and Sobinov ... <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{for the first time}} that even great masters, in order to elevate their character to peaks of expressiveness have to expose their inner exaltation in the most stark, transparent ways; that hidden riches of an artist's inner world should come hand in hand with economy in outward movement", she wrote in autobiography.|$|R

60|$|It was {{not until}} we had snugly stowed {{ourselves}} into this place that <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> how great was the danger which menaced.

60|$|I was {{absolutely}} miserable, but I hadn't {{gone too far}} when <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that I couldn't leave her alone there without protection, to hunt her own food amid the dangers of that savage world.

He {{said there would be}} blood shed over you. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> what he meant. He's not sorry for what he did. Think how strange that is. For he has the instincts of a gentleman. He's kind, gentle, chivalrous. Evidently he had tried every way to win your favor except any familiar advance. He did that as a last resort. In my opinion his motives were to force you to accept or refuse him, and in case you refused him he'd always have those forbidden stolen kisses to assuage his self-respect--when he thought of Turner or any one else daring to be familiar with you. Bo, I see through Carmichael, even if I don't make him clear to you. You've got to be honest with yourself. Did that act of his win or lose you? In other words, do you love him or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew him}} {{in the days when}} I counted for {{something}} in the world," [...] Julien explained. [...] "Don't you remember that on the night when we dined together at the Maison Léon d'Or he sent one of his emissaries for me?

I had meant it to be the story of my life, but how little of my life is in it! It gives, at most, certain acute points, certain salient aspects. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> for the first time how thin and suggestive and sketchy a thing any novel or biography must be. How we must simplify! How little can we convey the fullness of life, the glittering interests, the interweaving secondary aspects, the dawns and dreams and double refractions of experience! Even Mary, of whom I have labored to tell you, seems not so much expressed as hidden beneath these corrected sheets. She who was so abundantly living, who could love like a burst of sunshine and give herself as God gives the world, is she here at all in this pile of industrious inexpert writing? ...|$|R
