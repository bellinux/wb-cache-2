40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the historical and}} present situation in New Zealand regarding school fires and arson. The Ministry of Education has been installing combined security and smoke <b>detection</b> <b>alarm</b> system in schools since 1991 as a measure to protect schools from fire and arson. The {{costs and benefits of}} this system are compared to an automatic sprinkler system. The security and smoke <b>detection</b> <b>alarm</b> system provides early warning {{in the event of a}} fire. Since the installation of these systems there has been a reduction in the cost of fires. This system is relatively inexpensive compared to an automatic sprinkler system. An automatic sprinkler system provides not only a warning device but also a suppression mechanism that acts to extinguish or control the fire while it is still very small. Water is applied directly to the base of the fire resulting in very little fire damage compared to the major losses in a building protected with a security and smoke alarm detection system. The best strategy to further reduce fire losses in New Zealand schools is to progressively install automatic sprinkler systems in new and existing buildings...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Network {{intrusion}} detection has been generally dealt with using sophisticated software and statistical analysis, although sometimes {{it has to}} be done by administrators, either by detecting the intruders in real time or by revising network logs, making this a tedious and timeconsuming task. To support this, {{intrusion detection}} analysis has been carried out using visual, auditory or tactile sensory information in computer interfaces. However, little is known about how to best integrate the sensory channels for analyzing intrusion <b>detection</b> <b>alarms.</b> In the past, we proposed a set of ideas outlining the benefits of enhancing intrusion <b>detection</b> <b>alarms</b> with multimodal interfaces. In this paper, we present a simplified sound-assisted attack mitigation system enhanced with auditory channels. Results indicate that the resulting intrusion detection system effectively generates distinctive sounds upon a series of simple attack scenarios consisting of denial-of-service and port scanning...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for handling intrusion <b>detection</b> <b>alarms</b> more e#ciently. Central to this approach {{is the notion that}} each alarm occurs for a reason, which {{is referred to as the}} alarm's root causes. This article observes that a few dozens of rather persistent root causes generally account for over 90 % of the alarms that an intrusion detection system triggers. Therefore, we argue that alarms should be handled by identifying and removing the most predominant and persistent root causes. To make this paradigm practicable, we propose a novel alarm clustering method that supports the human analyst in identifying root causes. We present experiments with real-world intrusion <b>detection</b> <b>alarms</b> to show how alarm clustering helped us identify root causes. Moreover, we show that the alarm load decreases quite substantially if the identified root causes are eliminated so that they can no longer trigger alarms in the futur...|$|R

40|$|Consider a {{networked}} {{system of}} interest, where “networked” {{may be in}} a physical sense, meaning that the nodes are physically connected by point-to-point communication channels, or in a logical sense, meaning that the nodes are connected via edges that reflect certain relationships between the nodes (e. g., trust relationships).

Furthermore, the attack could be crafty or stealthy, meaning that it would always try not to trigger the intrusion <b>detection</b> <b>alarm</b> of the networked system. In such a setting, a question of particular interest to the system administrator is: What is the quantitative security assurance of the networked system?
