40|$|Abstract — To {{guarantee}} the connectivity in wireless networks {{is an important}} issue. For this purpose, we have to provide precise frequency for the network such that it can meet the various require-ments of future applications. In this paper, we not only propose a novel frequency calibration methodology based on SVM-based fuzzy inference system (SVM-FIS) in wireless networks, but also against temporary failure of wireless connection. There are two modes—normal mode and handover mode—in the calibration system. In normal mode, the primary clock can periodically delivers the controlling signals to steer the remote station’s oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) through the wireless connection. Once the wireless connection was temporarily crashed, the station switches to <b>holdover</b> <b>mode</b> which the SVM-FIS controller takes over sending the control-ling signals from primary clock to steer its OCXO. Experimental results indicate that performance of frequency stability of the OCXO can be improved from a few parts in 109 to 1013 for averaging times of one day, and the performance can be maintained within a few parts in 1012 over a day in <b>holdover</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|E
40|$|Every day, {{millions}} of people ask what time it is. Depending on the person and their reason for asking, the required accuracy and precision of an answer varies. Humans {{are not the only}} ones that care about time though, (perhaps more importantly) countless electronic devices ranging from cell phones to satellites do as well. Without accurate and precise frequency references and timekeeping systems, many of the electronics in use today would function incorrectly. The primary goal of this thesis was to achieve both synchronization and syntonization using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver called Namuru, which was developed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). In the former case, this means that the pulse per second (PPS) signals output by the receiver should be aligned with the second boundaries of GPS Time (GPST). In the latter case, this means that the frequency of the voltage-controlled temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (VC-TCXO) onboard the receiver should be equal to its setpoint. The secondary goal of this thesis was to develop a clock model that accurately simulated the synchronization and syntonization performance of the receiver. The tertiary goal of this thesis was to develop supplementary features for the receiver like position-hold and <b>holdover</b> <b>modes.</b> In order to achieve these goals, several new capabilities were added to the receiver and much work was done in a number of different areas, such as field-programmable gate array (FPGA) programming, writing firmware, modifying hardware, and modeling...|$|R
