40|$|A puzzle in the {{literature}} on the formation of coalitions supporting International Environmental Agreements (iea) is that if an iea leads to substantial gains, then it will not be supported by many countries. The non-cooperative game theoretic literature highlights the « small coalitions » puzzle by which {{only a small number of}} countries are willing to sign an <b>environmental</b> <b>convention.</b> In these models, a global coalition comprising all countries or most of the countries and generating significant global benefits is not sustainable. In effect, greater the number of countries in the coalition, higher the incentive of signatories to not respect their engagements. Introducing social externalities, we explain why in reality, some treaties can be sustained by nearly all the countries in the world, and others can be sustained by a handful of countries.

40|$|Land {{degradation}} {{is taking}} place globally and in all ecosystems; this brings severe consequences for our habitat, economy and well-being. This land degradation also drives economic and environmental migration, which will intensify in the near-future. Accordingly, radical changes are needed in the conceptualization of the UNCCD, re-defining its scope and re-shaping the paradigm. The present scope of the Convention {{is not sufficient to}} meet the global challenges. Ignoring problems beyond the drylands has compromised the Convention’s credibility. The ambiguous boundaries of the Convention- sometimes defined as an <b>environmental</b> <b>convention,</b> sometimes as a poverty-reduction convention- has been unhelpful. The environment-and-development issue must, therefore, be resolved within the Convention. A strong macro-economic argument is essential to bring about the necessary radical change in the way that development decisions are made. An expanded, global mandate for the Convention to encompass land degradation and development would better match today’s problems and opportunities. W...|$|E
30|$|Renewable energy {{utilization}} mainly {{wind power}} generation has acquired magnificent considerations in eye-catching {{number of countries}} following {{the adoption of the}} Kyoto protocol <b>environmental</b> <b>convention.</b> Despite its significant environmental benefits, the continuous intermittency and chaotic fluctuations of wind speed and other weather variables make the output power of wind power generation systems completely stochastic and different from those of conventional energy sources. Due to this indeterminacy, it may get several challenges to connect large quantities of wind power into a power system network. However, this challenge is not surmountable. In order to enhance the economic competence and acceptability of the wind power and to allow a reduction in the penalty of an instantaneous spot market coming from over estimation or underrating of the generation, the exact forecasting of wind power as well as wind speed is necessary. Definitely, a reliable forecasting system can help distribution system operators and power traders to make a better decision on critical situation.|$|E

40|$|We {{note that}} your {{government}} and the asbestos industry have successfully lobbied the Canadian government to block the listing of chrysotile asbestos as a hazardous substance under a U. N. <b>environmental</b> <b>convention</b> (the Rotterdam Convention), thus preventing {{the recommendation of the}} Convention’s expert scientific body from being implemented and thus also jeopardizing the mandate of the Convention. The Rotterdam Convention was created specifically to protect people in developing countries and countries in economic transition from being harmed by hazardous substances. It provides the basic human right of prior informed consent, requiring that countries be informed that a substance they may import is hazardous. It is extremely troubling to see Quebec instigate sabotage of a U. N. <b>environmental</b> <b>convention</b> and thus deny a basic human right that is taken for granted in Quebec itself. This obstruction helps the industry’s sales. But it brings Quebec into international disrepute. Under Canadian law, chrysotile asbestos is classified as a hazardous substance, but the Quebec government has successfully lobbied to prevent it being recognized as such under international environmental law, thus creating a double standard of protection as if some lives were less deserving of protection than others. We note that at the December 2009 Copenhagen Conference you called on Canada to show stronger commitment to implementing the UN Climate Change Convention. We ask you to show similar commitment to implementing the UN Rotterdam Convention. In light of the above disturbing facts, we appeal to you, as you are about to leave on a trade mission to India, to show the integrity and honour that the world expects of Quebec. We ask that you listen to the overwhelming evidence put forward by independent health experts, including your own Quebec health experts, and not succumb to the political lobbying of the asbestos industry. We call on you, as well as the leaders of the other Quebec political parties, to end Quebec’s export of asbestos, to stop funding the Chrysotile Institute, to support the listing of chrysotile asbestos under the UN Rotterdam Convention, to assist the last 340 asbestos miners and their community with economic diversification and to address the asbestos disease epidemic in Quebec...|$|E

40|$|There is {{potential}} for synergy between the global <b>environmental</b> <b>conventions</b> on climate change, biodiversity and desertification: changes in land management {{and land use}} undertaken to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions can simultaneously deliver positive outcomes for conservation of biodiversity, and mitigation of desertification and land degradation. However, while there can be complementarities between the three environmental goals, there are often tradeoffs. Thus, the challenge lies in developing land use policies that promote optimal environmental outcomes, and in implementing these locally to promote sustainable development. The paper considers synergies and tradeoffs in implementing land use measures to address {{the objectives of the}} three global <b>environmental</b> <b>conventions,</b> both from an environmental and economic perspective. The intention is to provide environmental scientists and policy makers with a broad overview of these considerations, and the benefits of addressing the conventions simultaneously.
