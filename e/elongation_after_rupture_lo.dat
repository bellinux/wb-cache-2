40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Due {{to limited}} {{information}} about aneurysm natural history, choosing the appropriate management strategy for an unruptured aneurysm is challenging. By comparing unruptured and ruptured cases, studies {{have identified a}} variety of aneurysm morphologic and hemodynamic properties as risk factors for rupture. In this study, we investigated changes in 4 ruptured aneurysms before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> and tested whether previously published risk factors identified a risk before rupture. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: A retrospective review of ruptured aneurysms based on the inclusion criteria of documenting angiographic images before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> was performed. Such cases are extremely rare. To minimize hemodynamic influence due to location, we selected 4 cases at the posterior communicating artery. 3 D morphologic and hemodynamic analyses were applied to examine qualitative and quantitative risk factors in aneurysms before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture.</b> RESULTS: When we compared aneurysms before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture,</b> all increased in size. Volume, surface area, and morphology changed in both high and lowwall shear stress areas. Aneurysm surface ratio, nonsphericity index, and pulsatility index were the only risk factors to consistently identify risk before and <b>after</b> aneurysm <b>rupture</b> for all aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS: Although changes in shape and flow properties were found before and <b>after</b> aneurysm <b>rupture,</b> in this small study, we found that some risk factors were evident as early as 2 years before rupture.

40|$|Rupture of {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal complication. Intraperitoneal metastasis <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> of HCC is rare. We report {{a case of}} diffuse intraperitoneal metastases <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> of HCC. A previously asymptomatic 32 -year-old man was admitted because of massive ascites due to ruptured HCC. Poor liver reserve limited the therapeutic options. Transarterial chemoembolization was performed to stop tumor bleeding. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated multiple large peritoneal metastases 3 months <b>after</b> the <b>rupture</b> episode. Echo-guided fine needle aspiration from the suprapubic area was performed. Cytology was positive for HCC. It is rare for HCC to develop intraperitoneal metastases in as short as 3 months...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rupture risk of {{intracranial}} aneurysms {{may depend}} on hemodynamic characteristics. This has been assessed by comparing hemodynamic data of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. However, aneurysm geometry may change before, during, or just after rupture; this difference causes potential changes in hemodynamics. We assessed changes in hemodynamics {{in a series of}} intracranial aneurysms, by using 3 D imaging before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 9 aneurysms in 9 patients, we used MRA, CTA, and 3 D rotational angiography before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> to generate geometric models of the aneurysm and perianeurysmal vasculature. Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics were simulated by using computational fluid dynamics. Two neuroradiologists qualitatively assessed flow complexity, flow stability, inflow concentration, and flow impingement in consensus, by using flow-velocity streamlines and wall shear stress distributions. RESULTS: Hemodynamics changed in 6 of the 9 aneurysms. The median time between imaging before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> was 678 days (range, 14 - 1461 days) in these 6 cases, compared with 151 days (range, 34 - 183 days) in the 3 cases with unaltered hemodynamics. Changes were observed for flow complexity (n= 3), flow stability (n= 3), inflow concentration (n 2), and region of flow impingement (n= 3). These changes were in all instances associated with aneurysm displacement due to rupture-related hematomas, growth, or newly formed lobulations. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic characteristics of intracranial aneurysms can be altered by geometric changes before, during, or just <b>after</b> <b>rupture.</b> Associations of hemodynamic characteristics with aneurysm rupture obtained from case-control studies comparing ruptured with unruptured aneurysms should therefore be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|Isolated tendons {{subjected}} to cyclic tensile loads {{higher than those}} experienced in the tendons' recent history exhibit 'conditioning', i. e. gradually increasing elongations upon loading and gradually increasing residual <b>elongations</b> <b>after</b> unloading {{in the first few}} loading-unloading cycles. The present study examines whether this behaviour is a measurement artefact or an actual time-dependent property. The gastrocnemius tendons of six men who refrained from rigorous physical activities prior to the experiment were loaded cyclically by 10 repeated isometric plantarflexion contractions at 80 % of the moment generated during plantarflexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). In each contraction, the elongation of the gastrocnemius tendon at 80 % of MVC and the residual tendon <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> relaxation were obtained from the analysis of sonographs recorded during the test. The tendon elongation during activation and the residual tendon <b>elongation</b> <b>after</b> relaxation increased by ca. 5 mm from the first contraction to the tenth contraction, with no changes obtained after the fifth contraction. The behaviour of the tendon in the first five contractions indicates the presence of conditioning. It is therefore concluded that conditioning is a relevant property and not an artefact associated with in vitro testing. This has implications for joint kinematics and muscle excursion...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNDANDPURPOSE: Comparisonsof{{geometric}}dataof rupturedandunrupturedaneurysmsmayyield {{risk factors}} for rupture. Data on changes of geometric measures associated with rupture are, however, sparse, because patients with ruptured aneurysms rarely have under-goneprevious imaging of the intracranial vasculature. Wehad theopportunity to assess 3 D geometric differences of aneurysmsbefore and <b>after</b> <b>rupture.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate possible differences between prerupture and postrupture imaging of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using high-quality 3 D image data, we generated 3 D geometric models before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> and compared these for changes in aneurysm volume and displacement. A neuroradiologist qualitatively assessed aneurysm shape change, the presence of perianeurysmal hematoma, and subsequent mass effect exerted on aneurysm and parent vessels. RESULTS: Aneurysm volume was larger in the postrupture imaging in 7 of 9 aneurysms, with a median increase of 38 % and an average increase of 137 %. Three aneurysms had new lobulations on postrupture imaging; 2 other aneurysms were displaced up to 5 mm and had changed in geometry due to perianeurysmal hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Geometric comparisons of aneurysms before and <b>after</b> <b>rupture</b> show a large volume increase, origination of lobulations, and displacement due to perianeurysmal hematoma. Geometric and hemodynamic comparison of series of unruptured and ruptured aneurysms in the search for rupture-risk-related factors should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
