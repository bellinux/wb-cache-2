We use a polynomial goal programming model to create optimal portfolios of hedge funds, conditional to investor preferences and diversification constraints (maximum allocation per strategy). For each portfolio we build CFO structures that have different levels of leverage, and analyze both the stand alone performance as well as potential diversification benefits (low systematic risk exposures) of investing in the Equity Tranche of these structures. We find that the unconstrained mean-variance portfolio yields a high performance, but greater exposure to systematic risk. We observe the exact opposite picture in the case of unconstrained optimization where a skewness bias is added, thus proving the existence of a trade-off between stand alone performance and low exposure to systematic risk factors. We provide evidence that leveraged exposure to these hedge fund portfolios through the structuring of CFOs creates value for the Equity Tranche investor.

40|$|Abstract. Collateralized Funds of Hedge <b>Fund</b> <b>Obligations</b> (CFOs) are rel-atively recent {{structured}} finance products {{linked to the}} performance of un-derlying funds of hedge funds. The capital structure of a CFO is similar to traditional Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), meaning that investors are offered different rated notes and equity interest. CFOs are structured as arbitrage market value CDOs. The fund of funds manager actively manages the fund to maximize total return while limiting price volatility within the guidelines of the structure.

While a financial liberalization yields efficiency gains, adverse macroeconomic effects can arise if the creditworthiness of the nonfinancial sector is weak. In this situation, financial liberalization may also increase the authorities’ expected deposit insurance <b>funding</b> <b>obligations</b> even with strong prudential supervision. Moreover, given the distortions in a repressed financial system, an increase in the required bank capital-asset ratio may increase the <b>funding</b> <b>obligations</b> associated with deposit insurance, particularly when the debt-servicing capacity of nonfinancial firms is low.

The proposed model is able to capture skewness, excess-kurtosis in hedge funds’ log-returns distribution and to generate a more complex dependence structure than the linear one. At the same time, this new model can be calibrated to the empirical correlation matrix. Finally, the adopted approach allows to find explicit relations among physical and risk neutral processes and distributions at both marginal and joint level...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to describe and compare mutual funds in the Czech Republic. In the theoretical part I will explain what mutual funds are, {{and how they are}} traded. I will also explain how the funds are classified, and how they are regulated by the legislation. The history of collective investing and mutual funds in the world and in the Czech Republic will be mentioned also. At the end of the theoretical part is mentioned the economic recession, which has had great effect on the mutual funds, and investing in general. The main goal of this thesis is included in the practical part, where I carefully chose a total of twenty mutual funds of the five main investment companies based in the Czech Republic. There are four kinds of funds to compare: The equity <b>funds,</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>funds,</b> mixed funds and monetary fund. The indicators that will be compared in every category of funds will be: performance, volatility and fees.

40|$|Loan spreads are {{analysed}} for {{two types of}} loans.

Using data on General Motors stock during the year 2002 / 2003, we show that the use of spectrally negative Lévy processes is capable of delivering realistic spreads without in‡ating debt levels, de‡ating debt maturities or deviating from the estimated probability laws.
