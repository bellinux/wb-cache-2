40|$|R 22 is an {{hydrochlorofluorocarbon}} {{widely used}} in refrigerant and air conditioning plants and although it has a low ozone depletion potential (0. 05), {{it is necessary to}} consider the large amount that commonly escapes from commercial units to the atmosphere. This paper presents experimental investigation on the performance of a window air conditioner operated with R 22 and the M 20 (80 % R 407 C and 20 % HC blend by wt.) refrigerant mixture tested under different refrigerant charge levels and outdoor conditions. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the Bureau of <b>Indian</b> <b>standards</b> <b>procedure</b> in a psychrometric test facility. Capillary and charge optimization tests were conducted for the both R 22 and the M 20 refrigerant mixture based on maximum coefficient of performance. Refrigerant charge in the air conditioner was systematically varied and the influences of refrigerant charge quantities and outdoor conditions on system performance are studied for both R 22 and the M 20 refrigerant mixture. At each charge levels, the outdoor room conditions were changed in accordance with Bureau of <b>Indian</b> <b>standards.</b> It is observed that R 22 is more sensitive to deviations in charge levels as compared to the M 20 refrigerant mixture. A decrease in charge level of about 7 % reduced the system refrigerating capacity by 11. 3 % with R 22 while with the M 20 refrigerant mixture it reduces by 6. 9 % only. Similarly an over charge by 7 % reduces the refrigerating capacity of the system by 13. 8 % with R 22 while with M 20 it reduces by 6. 5 % only...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — {{this paper}} {{presents}} the variation in the strength of concrete when replacing sand by quarry dust and also effect of inclusion of Fly Ash with the addition Quarry Dust. Slump cone test, carried out on fresh concrete to check the workability while compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength was carried out on hardened concrete. The reduction in the sources of natural sand and the requirement for reduction {{in the cost of}} concrete production has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregates in the production of concretes. In such a situation the Quarry dust can be an economic alternative to the river sand. The study analyses the effect on strength characteristics by various % of quarry dust as a replacement of natural sand in M 40 grade concrete and also the combination of various % of quarry dust and Fly ash as a replacement of natural sand and cement in M 40 grade concrete. Natural sand is replaced by quarry dust with 0 %, 15 %, 35 %, 55 %, and 75 % and in combination Natural sand is replaced by quarry dust with 0 %, 15 %, 35 %, 55 %, 75 % & Cement replaced by fly ash with 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. Compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength were conducted according to <b>Indian</b> <b>standard</b> code <b>procedure.</b> The effect of % of Quarry dust and fly ash in cement concrete is studied in detailed. Test results for each variation are tabulated an...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{depleting}} sources of natural aggregates challenges {{the production of}} technically and environmentally adequate concrete. Alternative material from marine sources {{is good enough for}} the replacement of fine aggregate in the concrete. The material was stockpiled in the open air and no washing, drying or decontamination process was carried out. Physical and chemical properties of DMS material were determined. All the materials used in the concrete were selected and tested as per the <b>standard</b> <b>procedures</b> of the <b>Indian</b> <b>standards.</b> A unique design mix will be done based on the entire material test results.
