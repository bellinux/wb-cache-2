50|$|On {{the night}} of July 27, 1945, two Boeing B-29 Superfortresses dropped flares {{and a total of}} 60,000 {{leaflets}} on the city of Aomori. The leaflets, depicting a bomber dropping bombs, listed 11 cities (including Aomori), and stated that at least 5-6 of these cities would soon be destroyed, and urged the civilian population to leave. As in other cities, the Japanese government decreed that citizens must turn such leaflets over to the police without reading the contents on pain of 3 months imprisonment or a fine of 10 Yen. Discussion of the contents could result in indefinite imprisonment, and the restrictions were to be enforced by the kempeitai and local tonarigumi. On {{the night of}} July 28-29, 1945, 63 B-29 bombers from the USAAF 58th Bombardment Wing departed from Iwo Jima, with their <b>flight</b> <b>routing</b> via Sendai and the Oga Peninsula, approaching Aomori via Ajigasawa village. One aircraft was forced back, but the remaining 63 arrived over Aomori at 22:10 and commenced a firebombing attack with E-48 500 lbs incendiary bombs on {{the central part of the}} city from an altitude of 5000 feet, lasting until 23:10. The bombers released a total of 83,000 new M74 incendiary devices on the largely wooden city. The resultant firestorm destroyed most of the city. The estimated civilian casualties in the July 29 raid was an estimated 1,767 killed and 18,045 homes destroyed. Efforts by citizens and civil defense authorities to extinguish the napalm-filled M74 bomblets using traditional water bucket brigades and fire trucks contributed to the casualties and extent of damage. A year after the war, the United States Army Air Forces's Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War) reported that 88 percent of the city had been totally destroyed. However, the Toyo Seikan factory was undamaged.|$|E
40|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{have a major}} impact on air traffic management in planning as well as in flight. Since the volcanic eruptions in 2010 caused enormous disturbance of the air traffic over Europe, much effort has gone into the task of finding clear routes in case of occurrence of aviation obstacles like ash clouds or hazardous weather. In this contribution the development of a 4 D optimization model of a trajectory-based air traffic management is described. The model makes use of a multicriteria cost function which takes into account fuel flow, time, distance and the specialized performance parameters for an aircraft. We create an individual network for each flight in which the single <b>flight</b> <b>routing</b> problem can be formulated as a minimum cost single commodity network flow problem, wellknown as the shortest path problem. Solutions are generated using the A* algorithm, which is a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. The multiple <b>flight</b> <b>routing</b> problem is formulated as a dynamic multicommodity network flow problem. We generate feasible solutions using Lagrangian relaxation in combination with a Lagrangian based heuristic. The Lagrangian subproblem decomposes into several single commodity network flow problems in each iteration, and thus the solution approach makes use of the methods developed for the single <b>flight</b> <b>routing</b> problem...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} strategically scheduling flights on user-preferred routes in the Central East Pacific to reduce trajectory crossing points. After first casting the flight scheduling problem {{in terms of a}} job shop scheduling problem, a 0 - 1 integer programming model is used to calculate the optimal departure and en route controls required to generate feasible flight schedules. To enhance the solution, a ration-by-schedule based heuristic is introduced to transform the original model into a subset of problems. By varying attributes of the machines in the job shop scheduling formation, two distinct types of feasible schedules are obtained. The first type of schedules are highly restrictive yet but free of all four-dimensional trajectory crossing points, while the second type are less restrictive but may require limited tactical flight separation maneuvers to alleviate residual crossing points. The average adjusted time savings per flight varied between 1. 8 minutes and 4. 6 minutes per flight when allowing for both strategic flight scheduling and user-preferred <b>flight</b> <b>routing...</b>|$|E
40|$|Within {{the present}} work, the {{dependency}} of air traffic climate effects {{with respect to}} the emission location and altitude is investigated by means of the three-dimensional chemistry-climate-model ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM/ATTILA. Numerous simulations employing idealized aircraft-like emissions are carried out to systematically study effects of air traffic on contrail coverage, water vapour, ozone and methane and air traffic induced radiative forcing {{with respect to the}} emission location and altitude. For the composition of present day air traffic emissions, the overall radiative forcing from non-CO 2 effects increases strongly with emission altitude and slightly from the extra-tropics to the tropics, with the largest potential contributions resulting from ozone and stratospheric water vapour. The results of these idealized simulations are used to test whether the climate impact of a realistic air traffic inventory can be reconstructed by linearly recombining these pre-calculated idealized data. This methodology may be particularly useful for the optimization of flight paths with respect to minimum climate impact, as this off-line reconstruction of air traffic perturbations could bypass time consuming global three-dimensional simulations. Perturbations determined by the linear recombination indeed compare well with effects determined by comprehensive chemistry-climate-model simulations. Furthermore, the findings indicate a high potential to reduce non-CO 2 air traffic climate effects through optimized <b>flight</b> <b>routing...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an optimization-based cooperative planning system for the efficient routing and scheduling of flight formations. This study considers the use of formation flight as a means to reduce the overall fuel consumption of civil aviation in long-haul operations. It elaborates on the operational implementation of formation flight, particularly focusing on formation <b>flight</b> <b>routing.</b> A completely decentralized approach is presented, meaning that formation flight is not anticipated pre-flight and is not subjected to any predefined routing restrictions. A greedy communication scheme is defined through which all participating aircraft are allowed to communicate with neighboring aircraft in order to establish flight formations. The communication range of aircraft is used as a system parameter to control the allowed communications. A constraint on formation flight induced additional flight time is introduced in order to suppress the occurrence of large detours in the assembly of flight formations. A transatlantic case study is presented that contains 347 eastbound flights. Assuming a 10 % fuel flow reduction for any trailing aircraft in formation, overall obtainable fuel savings were estimated at 4. 3 % at the expense of an additional flight time of 10. 3 minutes per flight on average. In this transatlantic long-haul scenario, a formation flight usage rate of 73 % was realized. Aerospace Transport & Operation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} wind changes on {{aircraft}} routing {{has been identified}} as a potential impact of climate change on aviation. This is of particular interest for trans-Atlantic flights, where the pattern of upper-level winds over the north Atlantic, in particular the location and strength of the jet stream, strongly influences both the optimal flight route and the resulting flight time. Eastbound trans-Atlantic flights can often be routed {{to take advantage of the}} strong tailwinds in the jet stream, shortening the flight time and reducing fuel consumption. Here we investigate the impact of climate change on upper-level winds over the north Atlantic, using five climate model simulations from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, considering a high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario. The impact on aircraft routing and flight time are quantified using <b>flight</b> <b>routing</b> software. The climate models agree that the jet stream will be on average located 1 ° further north, with a small increase in mean strength, by 2100. However daily variations in both its location and speed are significantly larger than the magnitude of any changes due to climate change. The net effect of climate change on trans-Atlantic aircraft routes is small; in the annual-mean eastbound routes are 1 min shorter and located further north and westbound routes are 1 min longer and more spread out around the great circle. There are, however, seasonal variations; route time changes are larger in winter, while in summer both eastbound and westbound route times increase...|$|E
40|$|Ice {{supersaturation}} (ISS) in {{the upper}} troposphere and lower stratosphere {{is important for the}} formation of cirrus clouds and long-lived contrails. Cold ISS (CISS) regions (taken here to be ice-supersaturated regions with temperature below 233 K) are most relevant for contrail formation. We analyse projected changes to the 250 hPa distribution and frequency of CISS regions over the 21 st century using data from the Representative Concentration Pathway 8. 5 simulations for a selection of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models. The models show a global-mean, annual-mean decrease in CISS frequency by about one-third, from 11 to 7 % {{by the end of the}} 21 st century, relative to the present-day period 1979 – 2005. Changes are analysed in further detail for three subregions where air traffic is already high and increasing (Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes) or expected to increase (tropics and Northern Hemisphere polar regions). The largest change is seen in the tropics, where a reduction of around 9 percentage points in CISS frequency by the end of the century is driven by the strong warming of the upper troposphere. In the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes the multi-model-mean change is an increase in CISS frequency of 1 percentage point; however the sign of the change is dependent not only on the model but also on latitude and season. In the Northern Hemisphere polar regions there is an increase in CISS frequency of 5 percentage points in the annual mean. These results suggest that, over the 21 st century, climate change may have large impacts on the potential for contrail formation; actual changes to contrail cover will also depend on changes to the volume of air traffic, aircraft technology and <b>flight</b> <b>routing...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{response to}} perturbations in NO x emissions from global air traffic is investigated by performing a coherent set of sensitivity experiments. The importance of cruise altitude, {{size of the}} emission perturbation and geographical distribution of emissions is systematically analyzed using two global chemistry transport models and an off-line radiative transfer model. NO x emissions from a contemporary aircraft inventory {{have been used to}} assess the impact of global air traffic on ozone and methane. In further experiments the NO x emissions are perturbed, in turn, in 16 cruise altitude bands between 5 and 15 km altitude. In the p-TOMCAT model we diagnose an annual mean ozone increase of up to 6 ppbv and a decrease in the methane lifetime of 3 % due to global air traffic in 2002. Associated radiative forcings of 30 mWm− 2 for ozone and − 19 mWm− 2 for methane are diagnosed; a simple method is used to estimate the forcing due to the methane-induced ozone change and this yields an additional − 11 mWm− 2. Results show that up to the tropopause, ozone production efficiency and resulting impacts increase per emitted mass of NO x with the altitude of the perturbation. Between 11 and 15 km we find that the geographical location of the NO x emissions plays a crucial role in the potential O 3 impact and lifetime change of CH 4. We show that changes in <b>flight</b> <b>routing</b> in this altitude range can have significant consequences for O 3 and CH 4 concentrations.
