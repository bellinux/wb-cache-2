40|$|Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the extent, magnitude, and pattern of brain activity in response to rapid frequency-modulated sounds. We examined this by manipulating the direction (rise vs. fall) and the rate (fast vs. slow) of the apparent pitch of iterated rippled noise (IRN) bursts. Acoustic parameters were selected to capture features used in phoneme contrasts, however the stimuli themselves were not perceived as speech per se. Participants were scanned as they passively listened to sounds in an event-related paradigm. Univariate analyses revealed a greater level and extent of activation in bilateral auditory cortex in response to frequency-modulated sweeps compared to steady-state sounds. This effect was stronger in the left hemisphere. However no regions showed selectivity for either rate or direction of frequency modulation. In contrast, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed feature-specific encoding for <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> in auditory cortex bilaterally. Moreover, this effect was strongest when analyses were restricted to anatomical regions lying outside Heschl’s gyrus. We found no support for feature-specific encoding of frequency modulation rate.

40|$|Rho 1 receptor-channels (1 Rs) are GABA-gated {{chloride}} chan-nels that exhibit slow kinetics, little desensitization, and inert pharmacology to most anesthetics, {{except for}} neuroactive ste-roids (NSs). NSs differentially modulate 1 Rs {{dependent on the}} steric arrangement of the hydrogen atom at the fifth carbon position. In particular, the NS allotetrahydrodeoxycortico-sterone (5 -THDOC) potentiates, whereas 5 -pregnane- 3 -ol- 20 -one (pregnanolone) and 5 -dihydroprogesterone (5 -DHP) inhibit 1 GABA currents. Here, we used Xenopus laevis oo-cytes expressing 1 Rs as a model system to study the mech-anism of NS modulation. The second transmembrane residue, Ile 307, was mutated to 16 amino acids. Subsequent testing of these mutants with 5 - and 5 -NSs, at equivalent GABA ac-tivity, showed the following paradigm. For 5 -DHP, Ile 307 mu-tation either altered the degree of inhibition or entirely reversed the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation,</b> rendering 5 -DHP a potentiator. Dependent on the mutation, pregnanolone remained an inhib-itor, transformed into a potentiator, or converted to inhibitor and potentiator based on concentration. The extent of mode reversal for both 5 compounds showed a correlation with the side-chain hydrophilicity of the 307 residue. In contrast, Ile 307 substitutions did not alter the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> for 5 -THDOC but caused {{a significant increase in}} the level of poten-tiation. Paradoxical to their impact on the mode and/or the degree of modulation, none of the mutations altered the con-centration range producing the response significantly for any of the above NSs. Moreover, preincubation of Ile 307 mutants with 5 or 5 alone produced an equivalent effect on the activation time course. Based on the above data, a universal model is presented wherein anesthetic compounds like NSs can poten-tiate or inhibit the activity of ligand-gated ion channels distinct from interaction with alternative binding sites.

Specifically, on-demand optogenetic excitation or inhibition of parvalbumin-expressing neurons, including Purkinje cells, in the lateral or midline cerebellum results in a decrease in seizure duration. In contrast, a consistent reduction in spontaneous seizure frequency occurs uniquely with on-demand optogenetic excitation of the midline cerebellum, and was not seen with intervention directly targeting the hippocampal formation. These findings demonstrate that the cerebellum is a powerful modulator of temporal lobe epilepsy, and that intervention targeting the cerebellum as a potential therapy for epilepsy should be revisited...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{structure}} the sensory environment our brain needs to detect {{changes in the}} surrounding that might indicate events of presumed behavioral relevance. A characteristic brain response presumably related to the detection of such novel stimuli is termed mismatch negativity (MMN) observable in human scalp recordings. A candidate mechanism underlying MMN at the neuronal level is stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) which has several characteristics in common. SSA is the specific decrease in the response to a frequent stimulus, which does not generalize to an interleaved rare stimulus in a sequence of events. SSA was so far mainly described {{for changes in the}} response to simple pure tone stimuli differing in tone frequency. In this study we provide data from the awake rat auditory cortex on adaptation in the responses to frequency- modulated tones (FM) with the deviating feature being the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> FM <b>modulation.</b> Adaptation <b>of</b> cortical neurons to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> FM <b>modulation</b> was stronger for slow modulation than for faster modulation. In contrast to pure tone SSA which showed no stimulus preference, FM adaptation in neuronal data differed sometimes between upward and downward FM. This, however, was not the case in the local field potential data recorded simultaneously. Our findings support the role of the auditory cortex as the source for change related activity induced by FM stimuli by showing that dynamic stimulus features such as FM modulation can evoke SSA in the rat in a way very similar to FM-induced MMN in the human auditory cortex...|$|R
40|$|Research is {{presented}} on {{the perception of}} rhythm, specifically, the detection of changing or 2 ̆ 2 modulating 2 ̆ 2 inter-onset intervals in simple musical stimuli. The types of changes of rhythmic patterns examined are 2 ̆ 2 rhythm modulation 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 tempo modulation. 2 ̆ 2 These two terms are akin to the musician 2 ̆ 7 s concepts of agogics, rubato, accelerando and ritardando, all being common expressive devices in musical performance. Rhythm modulation occurs when an initially even or isochronous rhythm becomes increasingly more uneven. Tempo modulation occurs when the beat rate of a rhythm accelerates or decelerates.;Two approaches are adopted to elucidate how such modulating patterns might be perceived, a theoretical one and an experimental one. Following {{a review of the}} pertinent literature, a theoretical model of time-interval perception in music is proposed that attempts to synthesize the findings of previous experimentation. The main thrust of the model is that rhythm perception is mediated by two complementary processes: (1) a so-called OSCILLATOR BANK that entrains to stimulus time-intervals on a note-to-note basis, and (2) a SHORT AUDITORY STORE that is responsible for integrating temporally separated events.;The model generates the hypothesis that rhythm modulation will be detected in the OSCILLATOR BANK, whereas tempo modulation will be detected in the SHORT AUDITORY STORE. This hypothesis is tested in three perceptual experiments. To compare the difficulty of detecting rhythm and tempo modulation under various conditions, certain variables are manipulated: the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> (whether a change onset occurs earlier or later than expected), the initial beat rate, the metrical location of modulation, and {{the presence or absence of}} beat subdivision. To measure perceptual difficulty, a type of reaction-time dependent variable and a modulation-type-identification dependent variable are used.;The following results are observed: (a) the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> is significant only for tempo modulation, (b) rhythm and tempo modulation exhibit contrasting trends across the musical initial-beat-rate range, (c) metrical location does not affect detection and (d) detection is easier with beat subdivision. These results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that rhythm and tempo modulation detection are mediated by contrasting perceptual processes...|$|E
40|$|Voluntarily {{directing}} visual {{attention to}} a cued position in space leads to improved processing of forthcoming visual stimuli at the attended position, and attenuated processing of competing stimuli elsewhere, due to anticipatory tuning of visual cortex activity. In EEG, recent evidence points to a determining role of modulations of posterior alpha-band activity (8 - 14 Hz) in such anticipatory facilitation (alpha-power decreases) versus inhibition (alpha-power increases). Yet, while such alpha-modulations are a common finding, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> varies {{to a great extent}} across studies implying dependence on task demands. Here, we reveal opposite modulation of posterior alpha-power with early/initiation versus later/sustained processes of anticipatory attention orienting. Marked alpha-decreases were observed during shifting of attention (initial 700 ms) over occipito-parietal areas processing to-be-attended visual space, while alpha-increases dominated in the subsequent maintenance phase (> 700 ms) over occipito-parietal cortex tuned to unattended positions. Notably, the presence of alpha-modulation strongly depended on individual resting alpha-power. Overall, this provides further support to an active facilitative versus inhibitory role of alpha-power decreases and increases and suggests that these attention-related changes are differentially deployed during anticipatory attention orienting to prepare versus maintain the cortex for optimal target processing...|$|E

The aerosils hydrogen bond together to form a gel which imposes a weak quenched disorder on the liquid crystal. The smectic-A fluctuations are well characterized by a two-component line shape representing thermal and random-field contributions. An elaboration on this line shape is required to describe the fluctuations in the smectic-C phase; specifically the effect of the tilt on the wave-vector dependence of the thermal fluctuations must be explicitly taken into account. Both the magnitude and the temperature dependence of the smectic-C tilt order parameter are observed to be unaffected by the disorder. This may be a consequence of the large bare smectic correlation length in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> for this transition. These results show that the understanding developed for the nematic to smectic-A transition for octylcyanobiphenyl (8 CB) and octyloxycyanobiphenyl (8 OCB) liquid crystals with quenched disorder can be extended to quite different materials and transitions.

40|$|Measuring phosphene {{thresholds}} (PTs) {{is often}} used to investigate changes in the excitability of the human visual cortex through different brain stimulation methods like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In several studies, PT increase or decrease has been shown after rTMS or tDCS application. Recently, using PT measurements we showed that the state of the neurons in the visual cortex after rTMS might have an influence on the modulatory effects of stimulation. In the present study we aimed to investigate whether visual cortex activity following stimulation influences the modulatory effects of tDCS as well. In a between-group design, anodal or cathodal tDCS was applied to the visual cortex twice per subject, with either high or low visual demand following stimulation. We observed no modulation of PT neither directly following both anodal and cathodal tDCS nor following the visual demand periods. We rather found high inter-individual variability in the response to tDCS, and intra-individual reliability in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> was observed for cathodal tDCS only.

40|$|We {{studied the}} existence, {{localization}} and attentional modulation of gamma-band oscillatory activity (30 [...] 130 Hz) {{in the human}} intracranial region. Two areas known to {{play a key role}} in visual object processing: the lateral occipital (LO) cortex and the fusiform gyrus. These areas consistently displayed large gamma oscillations during visual stimulus encoding, while other extrastriate areas remained systematically silent, across 14 patients and 291 recording sites scattered throughout extrastriate visual cortex. The lateral extent of the responsive regions was small, in the range of 5 mm. Induced gamma oscillations and evoked potentials were not systematically co-localized. LO and the fusiform gyrus displayed markedly different patterns of attentional modulation. In the fusiform gyrus, attention enhanced stimulus-driven gamma oscillations. In LO, attention increased the baseline level of gamma oscillations during the expectation period preceding the stimulus. Subsequent gamma oscillations produced by attended stimuli were smaller than those produced by unattended, irrelevant stimuli. Attentional modulations of gamma oscillations in LO and the fusiform gyrus were thus very different, both in their time-course (preparatory period and/or stimulus processing) and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> (increase or decrease).

40|$|The {{basolateral nucleus}} of the {{amygdala}} (BLA) has been implicated in the modulation of learning after stress. Acute inescapable stress enhances classical eyeblink conditioning in male rats, whereas the same stressor impairs eyeblink conditioning in female rats. The experiments here directly assessed whether inactivation of the BLA during stress exposure would block both the stress-induced facilita-tion inmales and the retardation of eyeblink conditioning in females. To this end, the BLAwas temporarily inactivated by infusion of the GABA agonist muscimol before acute stressor exposure. All rats were trained {{in a different context}} 24 h later. Males infused with muscimol before the stressful event didnot exhibit facilitated eyeblink conditioning,whereas those infusedwith the vehicle emittedmore conditioned responses than unstressed males. Females infused with muscimol before stress did not express a deficit in conditioning, whereas those infused with vehicle and stressed emitted fewer conditioned responses than unstressed vehicle controls. These data demonstrate that neuronal activity within the BLA during stress exposure is necessary to modulate learning 24 h later in a new context. Thus, the BLA is necessary to induce the long-term effect of stressful experience on conditioning regardless of sex and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation.</b> Key words: stress; eyeblink conditioning; basolateral amygdala; muscimol; sex differences; pavlovian conditionin...|$|E

In this study, two experiments were conducted to explore whether the cueing <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> spatial Stroop is object based and/or space based. In Experiment 1, we found evidence favouring the view that the cueing <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> the spatial Stroop effect is entirely object based, as no differences were found in conflict reduction for the same-location and same-object conditions.

40|$|Subthreshold {{continuous}} theta burst {{stimulation of}} the visual cortex {{has been reported to}} cause inhibitory effects on phosphene threshold. In contrast, we observed no inhibition in a former study applying higher stimulation intensities. The main discrepancies between our experiments and the former studies were stimulation intensity and coil type. We aimed at investigating the role of these factors on the modulatory effects of continuous theta burst stimulation applied to the visual cortex. In a between-group-design, we used either a figure-of-eight-coil or a round coil, respectively. We measured phosphene thresholds prior and after continuous theta burst stimulation applied at 80 % of individual phosphene threshold. With the figure-of-eight-coil, phosphene thresholds significantly decreased following stimulation. This is in line with the results of our former study but contrary to the increase observed in the other two studies. Using a round coil, no significant effect was observed. A correlation analysis revealed an inhibitory effect in subjects with higher phosphene thresholds only. Furthermore, the slope of the baseline phosphene threshold seems to predict the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation,</b> independent from coil type. Thus, modulatory effects of continuous theta burst stimulation seem to depend on coil type and psychophysics parameters, probably due to different cortex volumes stimulated.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} striatum has a topographical {{organization of}} input-output connectivity, but a complex internal, nonlaminar neuronal architecture comprising projection neurons of two types interspersed among multiple interneuron types and potential local neuromodulators. From this cellular melange arises a biochemical compartmentalization of areas termed striosomes and extrastriosomal matrix. The functions of these compartments are poorly understood but might confer distinct features to striatal signal processing and be discretely governed. Dopamine transmission occurs throughout striosomes and matrix, and {{is reported to}} be modulated by the striosomally enriched neuromodulator substance P. However, reported effects are conflicting, ranging from facilitation to inhibition. We addressed whether dopamine transmission is modulated differently in striosome-matrix compartments by substance P. We paired detection of evoked dopamine release at carbon-fiber microelectrodes in mouse striatal slices with subsequent identification of the location of recording sites with respect to μ-opioid receptor-rich striosomes. Substance P had bidirectional effects on dopamine release that varied between recording sites and were prevented by inhibition of neurokinin- 1 receptors. The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> was determined by location within the striosomal-matrix axis: dopamine release was boosted in striosome centers, diminished in striosomal-matrix border regions, and unaffected in the matrix. In turn, this different weighting of dopamine transmission by substance P modified the apparent center-surround contrast of striosomal dopamine signals. These data reveal that dopamine transmission can be differentially modulated within the striosomal-matrix axis, and furthermore, indicate a functionally distinct zone at the striosome-matrix interface, which may have key impacts on striatal integration...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacteria {{have the}} ability to enhance or depress immune responses. This paper {{describes}} experiments designed to investigate the parameters determining the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation.</b> It has been shown previously that 10 (8) liver Mycobacterium bovis BCG depress the ability of mouse spleen cells to produce a primary antibody response in vitro to SRBC 2 - 3 weeks after i. v. injection, whereas the same number of dead organisms enhance this response. Using the same growth medium for the BCG (Glaxo glycerol-free medium), we now find that decreasing the BCG dose to mice from 10 (8) to 10 (6) liver organisms results in enhanced responses and increasing the dose to more than 10 (8) dead organisms results in depressed responses. It thus appears that bacterial load is the important factor determining whether depression or enhancement of the primary antibody response will occur, rather than the viability of the organisms per se. However, when the BCG was grown in Middlebrook 7 H 9 broth, doses as high as 4 X 10 (9) dead BCG/mouse failed to depress although depressed responses were found if sufficient live organisms (7 X 10 (8)) were injected. In view of the known growth characteristics of BCG in these 2 bacteriological media, it is suggested that the degree of aggregation of the injected suspension may also be of importance in determining whether or not depression will occur. A comparison of the effects of BCG injected untreated or after dispersion of bacterial aggregates supports this idea. Some degree of splenomegaly was always found in mice with depressed splenic responses but a large spleen did not necessarily yield cell suspensions with depressed responses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEvidence from lesion and cortical-slice studies {{implicate}} the neocortical {{cholinergic system}} in the <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> sensory, attentional and memory processing. In this review we consider findings from sixty-three healthy human cholinergic functional neuroimaging studies that probe interactions of cholinergic drugs with brain activation profiles, and relate these to contemporary neurobiological models. Consistent patterns that emerge are: (1) the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> cholinergic <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> sensory cortex activations depends upon top-down influences; (2) cholinergic hyperstimulation reduces top-down selective <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> sensory cortices; (3) cholinergic hyperstimulation interacts with task-specific frontoparietal activations {{according to one of}} several patterns, including: suppression of parietal-mediated reorienting; decreasing ‘effort’-associated activations in prefrontal regions; and deactivation of a ‘resting-state network’ in medial cortex, with reciprocal recruitment of dorsolateral frontoparietal regions during performance-challenging conditions; (4) encoding-related activations in both neocortical and hippocampal regions are disrupted by cholinergic blockade, or enhanced with cholinergic stimulation, while the opposite profile is observed during retrieval; (5) many examples exist of an ‘inverted-U shaped’ pattern of cholinergic influences by which the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> functional neural activation (and performance) depends upon both task (e. g. relative difficulty) and subject (e. g. age) factors. Overall, human cholinergic functional neuroimaging studies both corroborate and extend physiological accounts of cholinergic function arising from other experimental contexts, while providing mechanistic insights into cholinergic-acting drugs and their potential clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|We perform {{observational}} {{tests of}} statistical isotropy {{using data from}} large-scale structure surveys spanning {{a wide range of}} wavelengths. Using data from 2 MASS, 2 MRS, and NVSS galaxies, and BATSE gamma-ray bursts, we constrain the amplitude and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> dipolar <b>modulations</b> in the number count of sources projected along the line of sight. We pay particular attention to the treatment of systematic errors and selection effects, and carefully distinguish between different sources of dipole signal previously considered in the literature. Dipole signals detected in these surveys are consistent with the standard, statistically isotropic expectation, except for the NVSS result, which is likely biased by remaining systematics in the data. We place constraints on the amplitude of any intrinsic dipole driven by novel physics in the early universe.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{crystals}} grown from melt {{depends on the}} flow field in the melt. To simulate melt conditions, a finite element analysis is performed on flow in a heated cavity under the driving forces of natural convection, thermocapillary effects, and rotation. In addition, the gravity field is modulated to simulate a microgravitational environment. The purpose for conducting this research is {{to determine whether the}} use of baffles can effectively reduce convection and suppress temperature oscillations. The results show that the baffle is able to suppress convection and reduce the amplitude of the temperature oscillations when placed perpendicular to the modulation direction. Under crystal and crucible rotation, the results with and without baffles are similar. In all cases, baffles did not induce temperature oscillations. From this study, it can be concluded that the effects of baffles on the flow behavior depends greatly on the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> gravity <b>modulation</b> and frequency...|$|R
