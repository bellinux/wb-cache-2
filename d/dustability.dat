40|$|The mining industry, {{minerals}} processing, {{transport and}} export infrastructure sectors are facing increasingly difficult {{challenges in the}} near future, such as sustainable development and operation (e. g. environmental emissions, social/ cultural impacts, economics). This paper describes {{some of the new}} technologies that are being researched, developed and employed to minimise dust emissions by addressing <b>dustability</b> and dust generation mechanisms. It also presents some results from the research being undertaken on the measurement of the dustiness of bulk materials...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{some of the}} {{new technologies}} that are being researched, developed and employed to minimise dust emissions by addressing the root cause/s of the problem, such as <b>dustability</b> or dustiness and the dust generation mechanisms. Some recent research results and case studies are presented to demonstrate some interesting findings obtained from this work. With improved understanding and modelling of dust generation mechanisms and also bulk material dustiness, it is possible to achieve a step-change improvement in the design, troubleshooting and application of more efficient dust control technologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} related to gravelled roads is their <b>dustability</b> during the warm {{season of the}} year. Bituminous {{emulsion}} and calcium chloride {{are among the most}} popular and widespread materials used to reduce dustiness in Lithuania. The article presents the findings obtained from the investigation of gravelled road No.   2517 Veisiejai–Viktarinas–Paliepiai sections treated with calcium chloride. It was established that the efficiency of calcium chloride used for reducing dust on gravelled roads ranged from 15 to 45  % depending on various conditions.   Article in Lithuanian </div...|$|E
40|$|The loss of {{dust from}} the mining, processing, storage, handling, {{transportation}} and loading of bulk materials is creating {{an increasing number of}} problems for industry and the community. This includes loss of valuable material and export income, increasing workplace dust emissions (e. g. from mine sites, loading, receival, ports, bulk berths) and decreasing ambient air quality and human health, especially for nearby communities. It is virtually impossible to estimate the total cost of these problems to industry and the community. An initial key step in addressing dust problems is to quantify the dustiness or <b>dustability</b> of bulk materials. This paper examines three different methods for testing dustiness. The first two methods are the rotating drum style dustiness testers {{that can be used to}} determine the Dust Extinction Moisture (DEM) for a bulk solid. They are the Australian standard AS 4156. 6 2 ̆ 2 Determination of Dust/moisture Relationship for Coal [1] and the International standard I. S. EN 15051 2 ̆ 2 Measurement of the Dustiness of Bulk Materials - Requirements and Reference Test Methods 2 ̆ 2 [2]. The third method is simulating conveyor belt conditions in a wind tunnel to determine dust pick-up or lift-off velocity. All three methods can be useful tools in the design of new plant and also the modification of existing plant to reduce dust generation...|$|E
