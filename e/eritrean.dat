5|$|The {{favourite}} for the men's {{race was}} <b>Eritrean</b> runner Zersenay Tadese (the defending champion with four straight wins), who {{had broken the}} world record earlier that year with a run of 58:23 minutes at the Lisbon Half Marathon. Newly minted African Champion Wilson Kiprop was {{the most prominent of}} the Kenyan contingent, which was the clear favourite for the team title through its hoard of sub-60 minute runners including Sammy Kitwara, Silas Kipruto and Moses Mosop. Other contenders were Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and <b>Eritrean</b> Samuel Tsegay. Kenya was the defending champion in the team race.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay Tadese (Tigrinya: ዘርእሰናይ ታደሰ; born 8 February 1982) is an <b>Eritrean</b> long-distance track, {{and road}} running athlete. He {{currently}} holds the men's half marathon world record. His bronze {{medal in the}} 10,000 metres at the 2004 Athens Olympics made him the first ever <b>Eritrean</b> Olympic medallist, and his 20km title at the 2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships also made him the country's first athlete to win at a world championship event. He does not use a sprint finish to win races: his strategy relies upon a combination of efficient running and fast pace setting.|$|E

25|$|Italian <b>Eritreans</b> also {{speak the}} country's de facto {{official}} languages Tigrinya, Arabic, and English.

5|$|Zersenay {{failed to}} make the podium for a second time at the 2006 World Cross Country Championships, but his fourth-place finish headed the <b>Eritrean</b> team towards silver medal in the team competition. The {{following}} month, Zersenay overcame both Fabiano Joseph and Boniface Kiprop to win the Great Manchester Run. He sprinted to the line with a finishing time of 27:36; an <b>Eritrean</b> record and the second fastest that year. In August that year, he significantly improved his 10,000m best at Memorial Van Damme; his time of 26:37.25 knocked almost thirty seconds off his previous mark, but he still finished behind the emerging Micah Kogo who ran the tenth fastest ever time. A new best of 59:16 by Zersenay at the Rotterdam Half Marathon equalled Samuel Wanjiru's course record and boded well for the upcoming championship race.|$|E
5|$|The Kenyan athletes {{emerged with}} both the {{individual}} and team titles in the men's and women's races. Despite limited experience in top level half marathon races, Wilson Kiprop and Florence Kiplagat won their respective races. Kiprop broke Zersenay Tadese's winning streak which dated back to 2006, out-sprinting the defending champion in the final stages. Sammy Kitwara won the men's bronze medal and helped Kenya to the men's team title. Led by Zersenay, the <b>Eritrean</b> men beat Ethiopia to the team silver medal spot.|$|E
5|$|Though only {{numbering}} about 3,000 {{soldiers and}} 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners {{in the former}} Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign. At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the <b>Eritrean</b> askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps {{in the east and}} sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation. The Belgian force quickly returned to Congo with their spoils of war. The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.|$|E

5|$|A quietly spoken athlete, he {{frequently}} states that his victories are {{a tribute to}} his country. Eritrea is one of Africa's newest and least populous countries, and Zersenay's achievements on the world athletics stage have {{made him one of}} the country's most identifiable sportsmen. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on <b>Eritrean</b> television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner who has competed at the World Cross Country Championships and the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Zersenay became {{only the}} second man (after Paul Tergat) to win three World Championship medals over three {{different}} surfaces in the same year: winning World Cross Country bronze, 10,000 metres World Championship silver on the track, and gold in road running at the World Half Marathon Championships. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on <b>Eritrean</b> television.

5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, <b>Eritrean</b> troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E

Eritrea {{is considered one of the}} most surveilled countries in the world with no independent media and no public internet service. Afwerki has been the country's only president since Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopian rule in 1991. The United Nations has described the kidnappings and human trafficking in Sinai as one of the most under-reported humanitarian crises in the world while the government of Eritrea’s human rights record is considered among the worst in the world. After Europe closed its borders in 2006, the only option for <b>Eritreans</b> fleeing their country towards Israel is across the Sinai desert in Egypt. Critics explain that those fleeing Eritrea are looking for better opportunities in Israel away from their repressive government, conditions of poverty, and prolonged incarceration and military service. It has been reported that people of the Rashaida Tribe, <b>Eritreans,</b> and Sudanese soldiers are all involved in the trafficking of <b>Eritreans</b> to Israel. Many <b>Eritreans</b> pay traffickers to transport them to the Israeli border but are instead held hostage by those they paid and sold to gangs in Sinai where they are tortured and held for ransom. These strategically organized kidnapping are known as the refugee kidnappings in Sinai.|$|R

5|$|The 2003 season saw Zersenay {{establish}} {{himself as}} an emerging force in cross country: he broke into the top ten at the 2003 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, and {{finished in the top}} three in all of his six races in Europe that winter. A 5000 metres win at the KBC Night of Athletics brought Zersenay an <b>Eritrean</b> record of 13:11.07, and a place at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. At the 2003 World Championships, he improved his record further to 13:05.57 and finished in eighth place in the 5000 metres final. More improvements came at the World Half Marathon Championships in Vilamoura, Portugal, where he recorded a personal best of 1:01:26 to finish in seventh position.|$|E
5|$|Three days of {{cold weather}} and rain preceded the offensive. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Edmond Van der Meersch led {{an attack on}} the brook. One Belgian {{lieutenant}} went scouting alone in no man's land and was killed in an ambush. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by snipers concealed in the bush. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were lost. Three Italians and an estimated 40 <b>Eritrean</b> ascari were killed, with approximately 70 ascari wounded.|$|E

5|$|All {{seventeen}} UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited {{and were}} obliged to attend the race. In January 2015, five UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard places into the race by the race organisers– Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) – to complete the 22-team peloton. Among the wildcard teams was , the first African trade team {{to participate in the}} Tour. As each team was entitled to enter nine riders, the peloton on the first stage consisted of 198 riders. These came from 32 countries. 41 riders – approximately a fifth of the peloton – were French; no other nation had more than 20 riders in the race. Merhawi Kudus and Daniel Teklehaimanot were the first ever <b>Eritrean</b> riders to participate in the Tour.|$|E
5|$|He opened 2005 with {{a second}} win in the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup.

On the track, he recorded a 5000m personal best of at the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha, and qualified to compete at the World Championships in both the 5000 and 10,000m. At the 2005 World Championships, he broke the national record in the 10,000 m final, but his time of 27:12.82 was only enough for sixth. The 5000 m final held little reprieve for the <b>Eritrean</b> as he finished in second last position. He ended the season on a positive note, however, improving his 10,000m best to 27:04.70 at the Memorial Van Damme, and winning the Great North Run with a world best time of 59:05 – which was only his second outing over the half marathon distance.|$|E
5|$|The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), {{set up in}} May 1940, {{was joined}} at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th <b>Eritrean</b> battalions, raised from émigré volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres {{consisting}} of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and £1 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major Orde Wingate was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join {{the headquarters of the}} SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British Royal Air Force managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the Arbegnoch north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma–Gondar road and the Italian garrison at Wolkait was withdrawn in February 1941.|$|E
25|$|All <b>Eritreans</b> {{between the}} ages of 18–40 must {{complete}} a mandatory national service, which includes military service. This national service was implemented after Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia, as a precautionary means to be protected against any threats on Eritrea’s sovereignty, to instill national pride, and to create a disciplined populace. Eritrea’s national service requires lengthy, indefinite conscription periods, which some <b>Eritreans</b> leave the country in order to avoid.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{owing to}} its colonial history, cuisine in Eritrea {{features}} more Ottoman and Italian influences than {{are present in}} Ethiopian cooking, including more pasta specials and greater use of curry powders and cumin.

5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a {{quota of}} 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, Mauritanian, Iraqi, Bhutanese, <b>Eritrean,</b> Palestinian and Somali refugees are amongst those who have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored a}} {{striking}} {{victory at the}} 2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, finishing the 20km race in 56:01 – a time which was second only to Haile Gebrselassie's world record and was forty seconds faster than the silver medallist Robert Kipchumba. It was first time that an <b>Eritrean</b> had won a major world title in sport. As Zersenay did not possess a strong sprint finish (crucial for success on the track) commentators suggested that a move to the marathon distance seemed an obvious career progression, but he downplayed the idea, stating {{that he would not}} change distances in the near future. He closed the season with a run at the New Year's Eve 10km road race: the San Silvestre Vallecana in Madrid. Zersenay and Eliud Kipchoge were awarded the same time of 26:54, but Kipchoge was announced as the race winner. Although this was faster than Haile Gebrselassie's world record of 27:02 at the time, it was not ratifiable as the runners benefited from the race's downhill circuit.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 the Ethio-Somali War {{broke out}} over the disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; {{although}} a former ally of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops {{under the command of}} General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the <b>Eritrean</b> People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support. Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. When U.S. state critics claimed that Castro had no right to interfere in these nations, he countered that Cuba had been invited into them, pointing out the U.S.' own involvement in various foreign nations.|$|E
