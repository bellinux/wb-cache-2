6000|$|Mrs. Lowder herself {{found it}} enough simply to reply, {{in respect to}} Kate, that she was indeed a luxury to take about the world: she {{expressed}} no more surprise than that at her [...] "rightness" [...] to-day. Wasn't it by this time sufficiently manifest that it was precisely as the very luxury she was proving that she had, from far back, been appraised and waited for? Crude elation, however, might be kept at bay, and the circumstance none the less demonstrated {{that they were all}} swimming together in the blue. It came back to Lord Mark again, as he seemed slowly to pass and repass and conveniently to linger before them; he was personally the note of the blue--like a suspended skein of silk within reach of the broiderer's hand. Aunt Maud's free-moving shuttle took a length of him at rhythmic intervals; and one of the intermixed truths that flickered across to Milly was that he ever so consentingly knew he was being worked in. This was almost like an understanding with her at Mrs. Lowder's expense, which she would have none of; she wouldn't for the world have had him make any such point as that he wouldn't have launched them at Matcham--or whatever it was he had done--only for Aunt Maud's beaux yeux. What he had done, it would have been guessable, was something he had for some time been desired in vain to do; and what they were all now profiting by was a change comparatively sudden, the cessation of hope delayed. What had caused the cessation easily showed itself as none of Milly's business; and she was luckily, for that matter, in no real danger of hearing from him directly that her <b>individual</b> <b>weight</b> had been felt in the scale. Why then indeed was it an effect of his diffused but subdued participation that he might absolutely have been saying to her [...] "Yes, let the dear woman take her own tone? Since she's here she may stay," [...] he might have been adding--"for whatever she can make of it. But you and I are different." [...] Milly knew she was different in truth--his own difference was his own affair; but also she knew that, after all, even at their distinctest, Lord Mark's [...] "tips" [...] in this line would be tacit. He practically placed her--it came round again to that--under no obligation whatever. It was a matter of equal ease, moreover, her letting Mrs. Lowder take a tone. She might have taken twenty--they would have spoiled nothing.|$|E

This cormorant forages for food by diving underwater, propelling itself by its feet. Its dives are brief, between 5 and 15 seconds. It is also known to forage in groups, with several birds beating the water with their wings to drive fish forward into shallows.|$|E

5000|$|An {{assessment}} of multiple research studies, {{published by the}} United States Department of Agriculture, concluded that [...] "these results refute prior claims that animal trampling associated with high stocking rates or grazing pressures in rotational grazing systems enhance soil properties and promote hydrological function". [...] Similarly, a survey article by Briske et al. (the same author) that examined rotational grazing systems found [...] "few, if any, consistent benefits over continuous grazing." [...] These confirm earlier research [...] that compared short duration grazing (SDG) and Savory Grazing Method (SGM) in southern Africa and {{found no evidence of}} range improvement, a slight economic improvement of a seven-unit intensive system with more animals but with <b>individual</b> <b>weight</b> loss. That study found no evidence for soil improvement, but instead that increased trampling had led to soil compaction.|$|E

First, a tradeoff method is used to elicit several probabilities with a known <b>individual’s</b> decision <b>weight.</b> Second, these probabilities are used as input for a certainty equivalent method to elicit an individual’s utility function. Third, an elicited individual’s utility function is used as input for a probability equivalent method to elicit an <b>individual’s</b> decision <b>weight</b> function. This elicitation procedure is robust {{in a sense that}} it is not affected by <b>individual’s</b> nonlinear <b>weighting</b> of probabilities. Additionally, this elicitation procedure is optimally efficient in a sense that it has a much slower speed of error propagation (though not necessary lower errors) than other available methods...|$|R
