25|$|Lambic {{is usually}} a blend {{of at least two}} {{different}} beers; many producers are blenders who buy beer from other brewers and blend them together to create the desired result. A <b>gueuze</b> may have occupied space in several different cellars over six years or more. While those outside Belgium are likely to find bottled <b>gueuze</b> and fruited versions, a wider variety of styles is available to local drinkers. Beers are often blended again or sweetened with sugar or flavoured syrups before drinking as some can be extremely tart.|$|E
25|$|Lambic refermented in the {{presence}} of sour cherries (usually the morello variety) and with secondary fermentation in the bottle results in kriek. Traditional versions of kriek are dry and sour, just as traditional <b>gueuze.</b>|$|E
50|$|While most {{commonly}} used for sparkling wines, flutes are also used for certain beers, especially fruit beers and Belgian lambics and <b>gueuzes.</b> The flute shows off the beer's color, and helps gather the aroma for the nose. The champagne flute is distinguished from the pilsner glass, which lacks a stem.|$|R

The {{also offer}} a rotating list of wild ales — lambics, <b>gueuzes,</b> and krieks similar to those you would find in Belgium. On-premises sales account for 95% of their bottle sales, and they rarely sell kegs outside the tasting room. Most of their beers are produced in quantities of fewer than 1,000 bottles.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{can also}} be applied to beer and ale or {{chocolate}} {{to refer to a}} batch that is blended by the manufacturers to produce a certain taste. Many lambics and <b>gueuzes,</b> sour beers with wine-like characteristics, are marketed as [...] "cuvee". When used of beer, ale, or chocolate, the term has no defined meaning, but is meant to evoke images of higher quality, similar to the use of [...] "reserve" [...] as a designation for wine in areas where the term is not regulated by law.|$|R
25|$|A {{mixture of}} young (one-year-old) and old (two- and three-year-old) lambics {{that have been}} bottled. Because the young lambics are not yet fully fermented, it {{undergoes}} secondary fermentation in the bottle and produces carbon dioxide. A <b>gueuze</b> {{will be given a}} year to carbonate in the bottle, but can be kept for 10–20 years.|$|E
25|$|Lambic {{is a type}} of beer brewed in the Pajottenland {{region of}} Belgium {{southwest}} of Brussels and in Brussels itself at the Cantillon Brewery. Lambic beers include <b>gueuze</b> and kriek lambic. Lambic differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeast. This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, , and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.|$|E

50|$|There is {{some debate}} {{on where the}} word <b>gueuze</b> {{originated}}. One theory is that it originated from Geysa (geyser), Old Norse for gush, as, during times of vigorous fermentation, <b>Gueuze</b> will spew out of the bunghole of its enclosing oak barrel. Another theory is that it originates from <b>gueuze,</b> the Old Norse word for wheat (which makes up {{a portion of the}} lambic grist).|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>gueuze</b> {{is made by}} {{blending}} lambics, {{it tastes}} different from traditional ale and lager style beers. Because aged hops are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma {{that can be found}} in most other styles of beer. Furthermore, the wild yeasts that are specific to lambic-style beers give <b>gueuze</b> a dry, cider-like, musty, sour, acetic acid, lactic acid taste. Many describe the taste as sour and [...] "barnyard-like". Because of its carbonation, <b>gueuze</b> is sometimes called [...] "Brussels Champagne".|$|E

5000|$|In modern times, some brewers {{have added}} {{sweeteners}} such as Aspartame to their gueuzes to sweeten them, {{trying to make}} the beer more appealing to a wider audience. The original, unsweetened version {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Oude Gueuze" [...] ("Old Gueuze") and has become more popular in the early 2000s. Tim Webb, a British writer on Belgian and other beers, comments on the correct use of the term [...] "'Oude gueuze' or 'oude geuze', now legally defined and referring to a drink made by blending two or more 100% lambic beer." [...] Traditionally, <b>gueuze</b> is served in champagne bottles, which hold either 375 ml or 750 ml. Traditionally, <b>gueuze,</b> and the lambics from which it is made, has been produced in the area known as Pajottenland and in Brussels. However, some non-Pajottenland/Brussels lambic brewers have sprung up and one or two also produce <b>gueuze</b> - see table below. <b>Gueuze</b> (both 'Oude' and others) qualified for the European Union's designation 'TSG' (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) in 1997/98 - see Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU).|$|E

50|$|<b>Gueuze</b> (or Geuze) {{is a type}} of lambic, a Belgian beer. It is made by {{blending}} young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, {{which is}} bottled for a second fermentation. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable sugars, which allow a second fermentation to occur. Lambic that undergoes a second fermentation in the presence of sour cherries before bottling results in kriek lambic, a beer closely related to <b>gueuze.</b>|$|E

50|$|Lambic can {{be broken}} into three subclasses: <b>Gueuze,</b> Fruit Lambic, and Faro.The first of these, <b>gueuze,</b> blends both old and young {{mixtures}} to stimulate a second fermentation. In its most natural form, Lambic is a draught beer which is rarely bottled, and thus only available in its area of production and a few cafes in and around Brussels. Fruit beers are made by adding fruit or fruit concentrate to Lambic beer. The most common type is Kriek, made with sour cherries. The last of the Lambic brews, Faro, is lambic with sugar or caramel added to prompt the fermentation.|$|E
