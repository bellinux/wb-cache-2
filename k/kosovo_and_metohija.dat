40|$|After {{five decades}} of {{insufficient}} reproduction of Vojvodina’s and Central Serbia’s population, {{the process of}} demographic ageing, came into {{the focus of the}} broadest public at last. Current Serbia’s population (without <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> <b>Metohija’s</b> population) belongs to the group of the oldest populations in the world according to a number of indicators of demographic change. Considering population ageing as a planetary process without precedent in the human history, we tried to point out the main features of its evolution regarding spatial implications on population living in this part of Europe. The evolution of the process of population ageing during the 1981 - 2002 period was considered through functional relations between specific age groups. It was ascertained that the process started its spreading over Vojvodina at first, but continued to spread over Central Serbia afterwards moving the pole of demographic ageing to that part of the country. Some specific centres of demographic ageing as well as the regions which are still demographically more vital than the others were located by the analysis at the municipality level...|$|R

25|$|Kosovo {{was split}} into four counties, three {{being a part}} of Serbia (Zvečan, <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> {{southern}} <b>Metohija)</b> <b>and</b> one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts (oblast) of the Kingdom: <b>Kosovo,</b> Raška <b>and</b> Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the Banate of Zeta, the Banate of Morava and the Banate of Vardar. In order to change the ethnic composition of <b>Kosovo,</b> between 1912 <b>and</b> 1941 a large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.|$|R

Attempts were made to increase the milk yield by cross-breeding with Awassi, East Friesian and Sarda stock. A project for the recovery of the traditional type of Istriana sheep has been launched in Croatia, and involves exchange of genetic material with Italy. A breeders' association, the Associazione degli Allevatori della Pecora Istriana nella Regione Istriana [...] "Istrijanka", was formed at Sanvincenti (Svetvinčenat) in 2005.

Pašić believed the area should be included into the Serbian political and administrative system through the democratic elections, while the army sought to keep the areas under military occupation. After one year of tension, Pašić dismissed the military administrator of Old Serbia and scheduled new elections for 1914, but the outbreak of World War I prevented it.|$|R
50|$|Novaković {{eventually}} {{entered into}} Serbian diplomacy in 1885. He was sent as the Serbian envoy to Constantinople, considered, along with Vienna and St. Petersburg, {{as one of}} the most important posts in that period. The diplomatic convention with Ottoman Turkey signed in 1886, due to Novaković's skilful negotiations, made possible the opening of Serbian consulates in Skopje, and Thessaloniki. Novaković stayed as Serbian envoy to Constantinople for almost seven years, until 1892. He was instrumental in organizing a huge network of Serbian consulates, secular and religious Serbian schools and Serb religious institutions throughout Turkey-in-Europe, in particular in <b>Kosovo,</b> <b>Metohija</b> <b>and</b> Macedonia between Skopje and Monastir (Bitolj, Bitola). Furthermore, Novaković initiated the establishment of closer Serbian-Greek cooperation, both with the government in Athens and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.|$|R

50|$|During the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18, Austrian forces {{aided by}} Serb volunteers {{penetrated}} into West Morava {{and set up}} a new border there. The war resulted in renewed persecution against the Serb population in <b>Kosovo,</b> <b>Metohija</b> <b>and</b> neighbouring regions. The Ottomans relied on the Albanians for securing their border regions with Austria, the Albanians becoming freed from the heaviest duties in return. In Vučitrn and the surrounding areas, the Serb rayah rose up in a large revolt, which was brutally suppressed. The Ottoman troops that were sent to pacify the people and investigate, carried out new violence. The harsh economic status, robberies, and threat of murder pushed the Kosovo Serbs into either accepting Islam, or seeking protection under a strong lord (accepting serfdom status). Many opted for a third alternative, to take refuge in neighbouring areas where life was more acceptable.|$|R

25|$|In 1188 Stefan Nemanja sent an {{envoy to}} Frederick Barbarossa, {{inviting}} {{him to stay}} in Serbia during his Crusade to the Holy Land. Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor, disembarked on the Third Crusade and arrived on 27 July 1189 at Niš with 100,000 Crusaders, hosted by Stefan Nemanja and Stracimir. A marriage was arranged between the daughter of Berthold, Duke of Merania and Miroslav's son Toljen to strengthen Serbian-German relations. Nemanja proposed that Barbarossa join him and the Venetians and strike at the Byzantines, but Barbarossa remained intent on his Crusade. Barbarossa recognized that he needed Byzantine help to transport his forces to Asia, but his plans changed when a Byzantine force stopped him from reaching his next stop at Sophia. The Byzantines also started raiding Barbarossa's army, which infuriated Barbarossa so much that he planned an offensive to Constantinople itself. Stefan Nemanja offered 20,000 men to support Barbarossa's military campaign, and the Bulgarians offered more than twice that number. Despite being in his early 70s, Stefan Nemanja followed the Crusader Army to the border at the Gate of Trajan. He then dispatched envoys to Adrianople to finalize this Western alliance. While Nemanja's envoys were negotiating with Berthold as Barbarossa's representative, Nemanja took Pernik, Zemen, Velbužd, Žitomisk, Stobi, Prizren and rest of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> <b>Metohija</b> and even Skopje. However, Barbarossa never consummated an alliance with Nemanja, instead signing a peace treaty with Byzantine representatives on 14 February 1190 in Adrianople.|$|E

500|$|Vukašin Mrnjavčević was a skilful politician, and {{gradually}} assumed the main {{role in the}} empire. In August or September 1365 Uroš crowned him king, making him his co-ruler. By 1370 Marko's potential patrimony increased as Vukašin expanded his personal holdings from Prilep further into Macedonia, <b>Kosovo</b> <b>and</b> <b>Metohija,</b> acquiring Prizren, Pristina, Novo Brdo, Skopje and Ohrid. In a charter he issued on 5April 1370 Vukašin mentioned his wife (Queen Alena) and sons (Marko and Andrijaš), signing himself as [...] "Lord of the Serb and Greek Lands, and of the Western Provinces" [...] (...) [...] In late 1370 or early 1371 Vukašin crowned Marko [...] "Young King", a title given to heirs presumptive of Serbian kings to secure their position as successors to the throne. Since Uroš was childless Marko could thus become his successor, beginning a new—Vukašin's—dynasty of Serbian sovereigns, and ending the two-century Nemanjić dynasty. Most Serbian lords were unhappy with the situation, which strengthened their desire for independence from the central authority.|$|E

Stefan Konstantin had a son, Stefan Vasoje, who was brought up at the court of Dušan the Mighty. Stefan Vasoje participated in the battles of Dušan, and when he had received sufficient experience, he was put by the Emperor as voivode at Sjenica.
