50|$|At Kensington Palace the {{planting}} of the parterres was by Henry Wise, whose nursery was nearby at Brompton. In an engraving from 1707-1708, (illustration, right), the up-to-date Baroque designs of each section are clipped scrolling designs, symmetrical around a centre, in low hedging punctuated by trees formally clipped into cones; however, their traditional 17th century layout, a broad central gravel walk dividing paired plats, each subdivided in four, {{appears to have}} survived from the Palace's former (pre-1689) existence as Nottingham House. Subsidiary wings have subsidiary parterres, with no attempt at overall integration. At Prince Eugene's Belvedere Palace, Vienna, a sunken parterre before the façade that faced the city was flanked in a traditional fashion with raised walks from which the pattern could best be appreciated. To either side, walls with busts on herm pedestals backed by young trees screen the parterre from the flanking garden spaces. Formal baroque patterns {{have given way to}} symmetrical paired free scrolling rococo arabesques, against the <b>gravel</b> <b>ground.</b> Little attempt seems to have been made to fit the framework to the shape of the parterre. Beyond (in the shadowed near foreground) paired basins have central jets of water.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to intense}} {{urbanization}} {{in the surrounding}} hill areas, the storm water that historically exited the canyons and percolated through the <b>gravel</b> below <b>ground</b> was channeled into pipes below the streets to Thompson Creek and Lake Cunningham.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the ground treatment is always critical for a tunnel excavated in unstable stratum. Laodongnanlu Xiangjiang Tunnel (Changsha, China) across the Xiangjiang River will be constructed in a sandy <b>gravel</b> <b>ground</b> which is characterized by loose structure, extensive porosity, elevated sensitivity, poor stability, and a high groundwater table. Permeation grouting will be employed to improve the bearing capacity and mitigate groundwater movement into the excavation. In order to seek suitable injection parameters and grouting method, a field trial of vertical grouting was conducted in the sandy gravel stratum in river floodplain. A series of tests focusing on grout material, grouting sequence of boreholes, injection pressure, and grouting volume were performed to improve the sandy gravel mass strength and reduce water permeability. The examination of the results obtained during water pressure testing and core drilling on completion of the grouting trial successfully demonstrated that the specified injection criteria had led to an expected effect. Grouting control method of this saturated sandy gravel stratum was concluded after the test, which would contribute to the future pregrouting work during the tunnelling...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Late Pleistocene to Holocene stratigraphy of the River Lambourn; a minor headwater of the River Thames in the Berkshire Downs. The Quaternary valley-fill comprises around 5 – 8 m of Late Pleistocene gravels overlain by Holocene peats and chalky clays. Quaternary deposits overlie an irregular rockhead erosion surface with deep scouring particularly evident on prominent bends in the valley. The gravels subdivide into a lower unit of chalky gravels overlain by coarse flint <b>gravels.</b> <b>Ground</b> penetrating radar suggests that gravels at depth are relatively structureless, {{but at the}} top show well-developed point-bar accretion surfaces which occur in association with peat-filled sinuous channels. These probably date from around the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary and may have formed in response to climate change and increased groundwater outflow as stream hydrology changed from the short-duration, high-magnitude flows of the Lower Dryas to the uniform, low-magnitude flows of the Holocene. Holocene peats initially infilled abandoned floodplain channels at around 10 kyr BP but later encroached {{over much of the}} Lambourn floodplain. A progressive upward decrease in organic material and an increase in the proportion of chalky clays from around 4 kyr BP probably occurred in response to floodplain accretion coupled with increased erosion of the chalk catchment related to agricultural clearance and a wetter climate...|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the Pleasure Gardens contrasted with the {{situation}} {{in the western part of}} the Forbury, which was still used for fairs. After one fair, the area was described as being covered 'with heaps of oyster shells, manure and other refuse'. In 1860, this section of the Forbury was purchased by the town for £6010 from Colonel Blagrave. It was decided that fairs should no longer be held there, but the emphasis remained on recreational use rather than botanical display, with the area grassed except for the outside walks and a <b>gravelled</b> parade <b>ground.</b>|$|R

The white house, the stables, the ‘Beware of the Dog,’—every {{landmark}} was passed, with a rapidity not unusual to a gentleman of a certain age when too late for dinner. After the lapse of a few minutes, Mr. Minns found himself opposite a yellow brick house with a green door, brass knocker, and door-plate, green window-frames and ditto railings, with ‘a garden’ in front, that is to say, a small loose bit of <b>gravelled</b> <b>ground,</b> with one round and two scalene triangular beds, containing a fir-tree, twenty or thirty bulbs, and an unlimited number of marigolds. The taste of Mr. and Mrs. Budden was further displayed by the appearance of a Cupid {{on each side of the}} door, perched upon a heap of large chalk flints, variegated with pink conch-shells. His knock at the door was answered by a stumpy boy, in drab livery, cotton stockings and high-lows, who, after hanging his hat on one of the dozen brass pegs which ornamented the passage, denominated by courtesy ‘The Hall,’ ushered him into a front drawing-room commanding a very extensive view of the backs of the neighbouring houses. The usual ceremony of introduction, and so forth, over, Mr. Minns took his seat: not a little agitated at finding that he was the last comer, and, somehow or other, the Lion of about a dozen people, sitting together in a small drawing-room, getting rid of that most tedious of all time, the time preceding dinner.|$|R

6000|$|Gabriel Nash had, as usual, {{plenty to}} say, {{and he talked}} of Nick's picture so long that Peter {{wondered}} {{if he did it}} on purpose to vex him. They went {{in and out of the}} house; they made excursions to see what form the vague meal was taking; and Sherringham got half an hour alone, or virtually alone, with the mistress of his unsanctioned passion--drawing her publicly away from the others and making her sit with him in the most sequestered part of the little <b>gravelled</b> <b>grounds.</b> There was summer enough for the trees to shut out the adjacent villas, and Basil Dashwood and Gabriel Nash lounged together at a convenient distance while Nick's whimsical friend dropped polished pebbles, sometimes audibly splashing, into the deep well of the histrionic simplicity. Miriam confessed that like all comedians they ate at queer hours; she sent Dashwood in for biscuits and sherry--she proposed sending him round to the grocer's in the Circus Road for superior wine. Peter judged him the factotum of the little household: he knew where the biscuits were kept and the state of the grocer's account. When he himself congratulated her on having so useful an inmate she said genially, but as if the words disposed of him, [...] "Oh he's awfully handy." [...] To this she added, [...] "You're not, you know"; resting the kindest, most pitying eyes on him. The sensation they gave him was as sweet as if she had stroked his cheek, and her manner was responsive even to tenderness. She called him [...] "Dear master" [...] again and again, and still often [...] "Cher maître," [...] and appeared to express gratitude and reverence by every intonation.|$|R

5000|$|Saline Valley Road is a {{sporadically}} maintained {{dirt road}} running north-south through {{the length of}} the valley, and is the most commonly used access route. From SR 168 in the north to SR 190 in the south, it is 95 miles (153 km) long, and ranges in elevation from 1094 to 7593 feet (333 to 2314 m). It goes through two mountain passes: the Inyo Mountains in the north, and the Nelson Range in the south. The northern pass is higher, but is better maintained and is about 20 miles (30 km) closer to the hot springs. One or both passes may be closed during the winter due to snow, ice, or washouts. The [...] "Road Closed" [...] signs are often left in place year-round in an attempt to deter motorists who may not realize how treacherous the road is, and to limit Inyo County liability.

During windstorms, large quantities of fine material is blown from the riverbed and deposited in locations generally downstream or west. The river itself is relatively shallow and wide and considered a class I float. It drops about 400 feet from the glacier to the Salt water, or roughly 16 feet per mile. The 4 miles above the hayflats bridge is unusual in that it remains unfrozen most winters because the eklutna project discharges warmer water into the tailrace.

They host a number of red-listed species not found elsewhere, illustrating that many plant species are threatened by extinction due to too little soil disturbance. Implementing a suitable disturbance regime is therefore crucial to ensure species-rich environments. We have reviewed the literature on soil disturbance as a restoration measure in dry sandy grasslands, with a special focus on xeric sand calcareous grasslands as these are severely threatened. Our objective was to elucidate the relations between diversity and disturbance regimes, and to determine how disturbance {{can be used to}} counteract acidification, to reduce nutrient availability and to create gaps in the vegetation. Our findings indicate that the current disturbance regime should be based on the historical disturbance regime, the productivity of the habitat and the propagule supply, in order to promote diversity at a landscape scale. Based on earlier studies and on the diversity/disturbance theory, we propose a conceptual model {{that can be used to}} determine the appropriate soil disturbance regime for restoration purposes.
