40|$|One of the {{important}} activities in computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) is computer aided process planning (CAPP). Although many CAPP systems {{have been reported in}} the literature, very few of them have actually been used in practice. This is largely due to the complex and dynamic nature of the process planning task, and the difficulties associated with representing and manipulating the required knowledge. In this paper, a hybrid expert-neural-based CAPP <b>intelligent</b> <b>function</b> model (CAPPIFM) and its detailed architecture are presented. Such a model is designed on the basis of the experience gained in developing an integrated CAPP system called SIP which is supported by the National 863 High Technology Plan of China.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} <b>Intelligent</b> Fitness <b>Functions</b> and Partial Fitness Functions both {{of which}} can improve {{the performance of a}} genetic algorithm which is limited to a fixed run time. An <b>Intelligent</b> Fitness <b>Function</b> is defined as a fitness function with a memory. The memory is used to store information about individuals so that duplicate individuals do not need to have their fitness tested. Different types of memory (long and short term) and different storage strategies (fitness based, time base and frequency based) have been tested. The results show that an <b>intelligent</b> fitness <b>function,</b> with a time based long term memory improves the efficiency of a genetic algorithm the most. A Partial Fitness Function is defined as a fitness function that only partially tests the fitness of an individual at each generation. Thus only promising individuals get fully tested. Using a partial fitness function gives the genetic algorithm more evolutionary steps in the same length of time as a genetic algorithm using a normal fitness function. The results show that a genetic algorithm using a partial fitness function can achieve higher fitness levels than a genetic algorithm using a normal fitness function. Finally a genetic algorithm designed to solve a substitution cipher is compared to one equipped with an <b>intelligent</b> fitness <b>function</b> and another equipped with a partial fitness function. The genetic algorithm with the <b>intelligent</b> fitness <b>function</b> and the genetic algorithm with the partial fitness function both show a significant improvement over the genetic algorithm with a conventional fitness function.
