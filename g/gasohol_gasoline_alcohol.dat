50|$|Excise {{taxes are}} {{typically}} charged on items like <b>gasoline,</b> <b>alcohol</b> or tobacco products.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{biotechnology}} offered another possible {{solution to a}} societal crisis. The escalation {{in the price of}} oil in 1974 increased the cost of the Western world's energy tenfold. In response, the U.S. government promoted the production of <b>gasohol,</b> <b>gasoline</b> with 10 percent alcohol added, as an answer to the energy crisis. In 1979, when the Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan, the Carter administration cut off its supplies to agricultural produce in retaliation, creating a surplus of agriculture in the U.S. As a result, fermenting the agricultural surpluses to synthesize fuel seemed to be an economical solution to the shortage of oil threatened by the Iran-Iraq war. Before the new direction could be taken, however, the political wind changed again: the Reagan administration came to power in January 1981 and, with the declining oil prices of the 1980s, ended support for the gasohol industry before it was born.|$|R

50|$|Both {{the federal}} and provincial governments impose excise taxes on inelastic goods such as {{cigarettes}}, <b>gasoline,</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and for vehicle air conditioners. A great bulk of the retail price of cigarettes and alcohol are excise taxes. The vehicle air conditioner tax is currently set at $100 per air conditioning unit.

40|$|This {{implies that}} low-income {{households}} {{in one year}} have some chance of being higher-income households in other years, and significantly affects the estimated distributional burden of excise taxes. This paper shows that household expenditures on <b>gasoline,</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and tobacco {{as a share of}} total consumption (a proxy for lifetime income) are much more equally distributed than expenditures as a share of annual income. From a longer-horizon perspective, excise taxes on these goods are therefore much less regressive than standard analyses suggest. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Renewable {{energy sources}} for the <b>gasoline</b> engines <b>alcohols</b> gain {{importance}} recently. These renewable energy sources have {{attracted the attention of}} researchers as alternative fuel due to their high octane number. In this paper investigations were carried out to evaluate performance parameters of two-stroke, single cylinder spark ignition (SI) engine with <b>gasohol</b> (80 % <b>gasoline,</b> 20 % ethanol, by vol) having copper coated engine [copper-(thickness, 300 μ) coated on piston crown and inner side of cylinder head] provided with catalytic converter with sponge iron as catalyst and compared with conventional SI engine with gasoline operation. Performance parameters [brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and volumetric efficiency] were determined at various values of brake mean effective pressure of the engine. Comparative studies were made on performance parameters with conventional SI engine with pure gasoline operation. Brake thermal efficiency increased with gasohol with both versions of the engine. Copper-coated engine showed improved performance when compared to conventional engine with both test fuels...|$|R

50|$|When a mole of {{nitrous oxide}} decomposes, it {{releases}} half a mole of O2 molecules (oxygen gas), and one mole of N2 molecules (nitrogen gas). This decomposition allows an oxygen concentration of 33% to be reached. Nitrogen gas is non-combustible {{and does not}} support combustion. Air—which contains only 21% oxygen, the rest being nitrogen and other equally non-combustible and non-combustion-supporting gasses—permits a 12-percent-lower maximum-oxygen level than that of nitrous oxide. This oxygen supports combustion; it alone combines with <b>gasoline,</b> <b>alcohol,</b> or diesel fuel to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor, along with heat, which causes the former two products of combustion to expand and exert pressure on pistons, driving the engine.|$|R
40|$|We build a {{model that}} {{incorporates}} {{the effect of the}} innovative ""flex"" car, an automobile that is able to run with either <b>gasoline</b> or <b>alcohol,</b> on the dynamics of fuel prices in Brazil. Our model shows that differences regarding fuel prices will now depend on the proportions of <b>alcohol,</b> <b>gasoline</b> and flex cars in the total stock. Conversely, the demand for each type of car will also depend on the expected future prices of <b>alcohol</b> and <b>gasoline</b> (in addition to the car prices). The model reflects our findings that energy prices are tied in the long run and that causality runs stronger from <b>gasoline</b> to <b>alcohol.</b> The estimated error correction parameter is stable, implying that the speed of adjustment towards equilibrium remains unchanged. The latter result is probably due to a still small fraction of flex cars in the total stock (approx. 5 %), despite the fact that its sales nearly reached 100 % in 2006. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|James M. Poterba in {{an article}} called [...] "Lifetime Incidence and the Distributional Burden of Excise Taxes" [...] determines to show that {{household}} income measured {{over the long run}} varies less than when analysts measure it annually. Poterba shows that excise taxes, which are taxes on consumption, may be less regressive that previous calculations indicate because they only use annual income. Furthermore, he shows that this same theory can be applied to excise taxes placed on things like <b>gasoline,</b> <b>alcohol</b> and tobacco. When the expenditure on these items is considered in correlation to the total consumption over a lifetime, it is more equally dispersed than when measured annually. Poterba argues that people need to distinguish between annual and lifetime measurements, and a failure to do this leads to overstating the degree of inequality that burdens from taxes place on the groups earning different income levels.|$|R

40|$|Federal {{and state}} governments in the United States use income and payroll taxes as their primary tools to collect revenue. In {{the rest of the}} world, governments also use income and payroll taxes, but rely much more heavily than does the United States on taxing consumption.

The U. S. government does not use a value-added tax, making the United States unique among high-income countries and a rarity in the larger world.

Value-added taxes are sophisticated forms of sales taxes in which taxes are withheld by businesses according to value added at every stage of production.
