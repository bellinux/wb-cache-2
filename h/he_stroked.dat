5|$|Before {{the final}} Test, Hassett's run-scoring peaked when <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> 232 against Brown's {{men in a}} drawn match for Victoria. In the Fifth Test at the MCG, he top-scored with 92 before his {{dismissal}} to a one-handed diving catch sparked a collapse and Australia managed only 217 batting first. The tourists took a first innings lead and Hassett made 48 in Australia’s second innings of 197. England made the 95 needed for victory, and the eight-wicket loss was Australia's first Test defeat since the resumption of international cricket after World War II, ending a streak of 25 Tests without defeat. Hassett and Brown described the series as the friendliest they had been involved in, but despite the success on the field, the series was poorly attended and revenue was down by around 25% from the corresponding tour four years earlier, mainly due {{to the absence of}} Bradman to spark public interest.|$|E
25|$|Chitty rowed in the Oxford University crew in {{both the}} Boat Races that were run in 1849, the March race and the December race, each {{university}} winning once. He rowed in the Oxford University eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 1850 {{when there was no}} Boat Race on the Tideway. He also rowed in the Oxford coxed four that won the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley and in the same year he won the Silver Goblets, the first year the coxless pair event was run under that name. His partner was James John Hornby and they beat Thomas Howard Fellows and C L Vaughan in the final. He repeated his success in the Grand Challenge Cup, and in the Silver Goblets in 1851 partnering James Aitken in the latter to beat John Erskine Clarke and C L Vaughan in the final. In 1852, <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> the winning Oxford crew in the 1852 Boat Race. In 1853 he was in the Oxford four that won Stewards again and was playing cricket for I Zingari. For many years Chitty umpired the Boat Race.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with three}} other players each {{separately}} displayed, Sports Illustrated featured Molina {{on the cover of}} their March 31 issue complementing the 2014 MLB season preview article. [...] On the 2014 Opening Day – the same day Sports Illustrated published the Molina cover edition – <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> his second season-entry home run and the 90th of his career, accounting for the difference in a 1–0 defeat of the Reds in Cincinnati. [...] It also secured the 100th win for batterymate Adam Wainwright. [...] Molina added a single for two of the Cardinals' five hits.|$|E

500|$|Before the All-Star break, Molina batted just [...]223. [...] However, he {{was voted}} {{to start his}} second {{consecutive}} game, and second overall, and played four innings. [...] After the All-Star break, his hitting improved, as <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> 63 hits in 200 at bats for [...]315 batting average. [...] During {{a game against the}} Cincinnati Reds on August 10, as second baseman Brandon Phillips came to bat, he exchanged words with Molina that escalated to a bench-clearing confrontation, although no one was ejected. [...] On September 17, he amassed a career-high five RBI and career-tying four hits against San Diego, including two doubles. [...] After an examination on his sore right knee on September 23, Molina was shut down {{for the rest of the}} season, missing 12 games.|$|E
500|$|The first multi-error game of Molina's career {{occurred}} July 13 {{against the}} Philadelphia Phillies on a catch and throw. [...] In {{a span of}} 11 starts from August 2–16, he racked up four three-hit games. [...] On August 16, he hit two home runs against the Brewers for his first career multi-homer game. [...] Molina homered and stroked the go-ahead double in an August 22 defeat of Florida. [...] One week later, he homered in back-to-back games against the Cincinnati Reds; he, Edmonds, and Rick Ankiel each drove in three runs in an 11–3 victory on September 2. [...] On Yadier Molina Bobblehead Night September 19 versus Philadelphia, <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> three hits including the game-winning single in the tenth inning.|$|E
500|$|Molina's {{first chance}} in the Major Leagues arrived when {{incumbent}} Matheny went {{on the disabled list}} (DL) with a strained rib in the Cardinals' pennant-winning season of 2004. [...] Molina made his Major League debut on June 3. [...] One of his first game-winning hits occurred on August 7. [...] <b>He</b> <b>stroked</b> a broken-bat single to shallow center field {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning against the New York Mets. [...] On the play, the center fielder, Mike Cameron started towards the outfield wall based on Molina's full swing, not immediately realizing that he had made only partial contact because of the broken bat. [...] By the time Cameron charged the ball, it was too late; it fell in for a hit, and Jim Edmonds was able to score. [...] Three weeks later (August 29), the Cardinals were victorious over the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–4 thanks in part to two separate plays in which Molina tagged out the runner at home plate, including a collision with Ty Wigginton.|$|E

2500|$|... "W. G." [...] {{was a very}} correct batsman. His left {{shoulder}} pointed to the bowler. He held his bat straight and brought it straight through to the ball. His beard hung right over the ball as <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> it– the ball, I mean, not his beard. He was the most powerful straight-driver I have ever seen. When he drove at a ball I was mighty glad I was behind the stumps.|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{was often}} dubbed a perfectionist, Wilson was an inexperienced musician, and his {{understanding}} of music theory was self-taught. The first instrument he learned to play was a toy accordion before quickly moving to piano and then bass guitar. From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for learning music by ear on keyboard. By age 10, Brian could play [...] "great boogie-woogie piano", according to brother Carl Wilson. Carl taught Brian how to play bass guitar. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> the strings using only his thumb, but switched to using a pick about a year later. Brian's experiments with his Wollensak tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for exotica and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work. At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of [...] "When You Wish Upon a Star". The song was eventually known as [...] "Surfer Girl". Though an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit.|$|E
2500|$|India {{were reduced}} to shambles at 62/3, and then Ganguly {{came out to the}} middle. Ganguly was the unenviable {{possessor}} of a batting average of below 30 in Australia, and his weakness at handling the short delivery was only too well-documented. Therefore, there were some suggestions that Ganguly would drop himself down the order to no.6, so as to delay facing the Australian pacemen as much as possible. [...] His first scoring shot was a streaky shot between gully and third slip, which brought him three runs. Then he played the odd shot outside the off-stump, but other than a few risky fours, there was nothing to suggest that he would fail. Ganguly then drove Andy Bichel between cover and mid-off for another boundary. This proved to be the integral part of his innings as he was decidedly more at ease and runs started to flow from his bat. Previously, on India's tour of England in 2002, <b>he</b> <b>stroked</b> a 128, which had a lot of unorthodox shots and some savage hitting. This innings, though, seemed to have reclaimed the majesty and beauty that Ganguly's batting had been known for. His footwork was noted to be the most intriguing part of his stay at the wicket. He did not move his feet exaggeratedly during his innings and unfurled a huge variety of strokes {{towards the end of the}} innings, without once breaking the momentum he had set. He also left the balls that were way outside the off-stump and his defense grew progressively secure and certain. He handled the short ball extremely well too, slapping them away, or ducking safely. There was superb timing and placement written all over his trademark off-side shots. In fact, Ganguly's innings provoked humorous comments from the fans who suggested that his superb strokes were a result of him dining at the Taj Mahal restaurant, whose owner was a spectator.|$|E
