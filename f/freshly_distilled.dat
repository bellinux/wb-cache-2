The resulting mixture was allowed to evaporate in fume hood. The residue was then diluted with water (20  mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 20  mL). The organic phases were combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was chromatographed on silica gel (CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH:NH 3 –H 2 O =  300 : 10 : 1) to afford the product (31, 92  mg, 95  %) as a yellow syrup.|$|E
