25|$|In {{addition}} to naturalisation, the British government can grant settlement to foreign nationals. This confers upon foreign nationals permanent {{residence in the}} UK, without granting them British citizenship. Grants of settlement are {{made on the basis}} of various factors, including employment, <b>family</b> <b>formation</b> and reunification, and asylum (including to deal with backlogs of asylum cases). The total number of grants of settlement to Somali nationals was 4,505 in 2011, 3,102 in 2012 and 4,341 in 2013 (out of totals of 166,878, 129,749 and 154,689, respectively, for all foreign nationals).|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of national differences in <b>family</b> <b>formations</b> has been addressed through the social policy debate over women's position in different welfare state regimes. However, {{the nature and}} effects of sub–national family geographies remains under–researched. In this paper we use census mapping to describe regional and local differences in partnering and parenting within Britain. We develop an index of the 'Motherhood Employment Effect' to indicate different geographical levels of adherence to the 'traditional' male breadwinner/female homemaker family, and use a 'Family Conventionality' index to describe geographical differences in the social evaluation of marriage. The geography of <b>family</b> <b>formations</b> thus described does not follow the better known 'north–south' or 'urban–rural' geographies of economic performance and prosperity. We use the example of Lancashire and Yorkshire to explore further the socio–economic associations of this family geography, employing additional indicators of 'household conventionality' and 'family restructuring'. Finally, we speculate as to how this relatively unfamiliar family geography {{may be related to}} the existence of regional gender cultures, and briefly outline some implications for social policy...|$|R

40|$|Giddens and Beck-Gernsheim {{argue that}} there has been a shift from stable <b>family</b> <b>formations</b> to {{relationships}} that are inherently fragile and temporary. Both propose that intimate relationships in late modernity have been marked by reflexivity and contingency.

In particular it discusses the suggestion that we are moving into an era in which ‘the normalisation of fragility’ will become central to people’s intimate relationships. ...|$|R
