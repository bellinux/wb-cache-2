5|$|Inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species, {{with a wide}} {{ecological}} range. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in all biomes from low-lying deciduous woodland to arctic-alpine areas. It typically {{grows on}} the ground in deciduous (or mixed) woodland, favouring beech. It grows best on chalky soil, among leaf litter. In North America, it favours sandy soil, clay or moss. It is also encountered on pathsides. As well as beech, the species has been recorded growing in association with hornbeam, hazel, oak and lime. Inocybe maculata f. fulva favours birch, spruce, pine, Populus, willow, (as well as Dryas and Polygonum in alpine regions). Mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups. Though widespread in the areas it is found, it is not a common species. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> from western Europe to eastern Asia; and in North America, from where it was first collected in the 1960s. Inocybe maculata f. fulva was first identified in France, and has since been found elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} {{are found in}} warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean it is found off the eastern coast of United States of America, the Gulf Stream, the Caribbean, and down past {{the southern part of}} Brazil.

In the Western Pacific Ocean <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> near Japan and north of Australia. In the Central Pacific Ocean, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen in bays and reefs.

It may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas. It is able to survive in other habitats also.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee is {{the name}} of a {{prominent}} character in the Transformers franchise. His name denotes his black-on-yellow vehicle paint job, directly referencing the bee genus because of its black and yellow stripes. Bumblebee is also the name of an automotive racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle; <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> mainly on Chevrolet Camaros (which happens to be the Transformers Autobot's most popular vehicle mode).|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in seawater in large amounts; {{it is estimated that}} seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is {{predominantly}} insectivorous; they eat {{a wide variety}} of insects, including beetles such as weevils, leaf-, jewel-, flea- and ground-beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, moths, wasps and cicadas. Insect larvae and eggs are eaten as well as spiders. Seeds and other plant material make up only a very small proportion of its diet. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and on the edges of bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon. Adults of both sexes as well as helper birds feed the young.|$|E

5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States where <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> {{in a variety of}} grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5mm in length. The {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs.

Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E

5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin {{may have been due}} to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal {{regions of the}} Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the Siberian–Beringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America. The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to Boletus edulis, and may appear in fairy rings. Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, where <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in the southern Brazilian states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
