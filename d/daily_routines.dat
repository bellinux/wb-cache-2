5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's <b>daily</b> <b>routines</b> for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their <b>daily</b> <b>routines.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the diagnostic efficacy (DE) and therapeutic efficacy (TE) of <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> chest radiographs (CXRs), {{and to establish}} the impact of abandoning this CXR from daily practice on total CYR volume, ICU length of stay (LOS), readmission rate, and ICU mortality. Design: Prospective controlled study in two parts. The first part comprised a I-year period during which attending physicians were blinded for findings on <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs and were only informed if something deemed important was seen by the radiologist (predefined major abnormalities) who reviewed all CXRs as usual. The second part comprised a half-year period during which <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs were replaced by clinically indicated CXR. Setting: Mixed medical-surgical ICU of a teaching hospital. Results: Data on 1, 780 <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs in 559 hospital admissions were collected. DE of <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs was 4. 4 %. The most frequent unexpected major abnormalities were new or progressive infiltrates (1. 8 %) and oropharyngeal tube malposition (0. 7 %). TE of <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs was 1. 9 %. The most frequent intervention was oropharyngeal tube adjustment (0. 6 %). No relation was found for DE or TE and hospital admission type or intubation and mechanical ventilation. In the second study part, 433 CXRs were obtained in 274 admissions. Abandoning <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs did not affect clinically indicated CXRs orders, or ICU LOS, readmission rate, and mortality. A total CXR volume reduction of 35 % (which equaled $ 9, 900 per bed per year [US dollars]) was observed after abandoning <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs. Conclusion: Diagnostic and therapeutic value of the <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXR is low. <b>Daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs can be safely abandoned in the IC...|$|R

5|$|Before their {{collaboration}} on the Diary, {{the brothers}} each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated {{nine of the}} principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote {{a large number of}} songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the <b>daily</b> <b>routines</b> and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.|$|E

Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his <b>daily</b> <b>routines</b> to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{clinical}} {{value of}} <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> chest radiographs (CXRs) in critically ill patients is unknown. We conducted {{this study to}} evaluate how frequently unexpected predefined major abnormalities are identified with <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs, and how often these findings lead {{to a change in}} care for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHOD: This was a prospective observational study conducted in a 28 -bed, mixed medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital. RESULTS: Over a 5 -month period, 2, 457 <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs were done in 754 consecutive ICU patients. The majority of these CXRs did not reveal any new predefined major finding. In only 5. 8 % of <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs (14. 3 % of patients) was one or more new and unexpected abnormality encountered, including large atelectases (24 times in 20 patients), large infiltrates (23 in 22), severe pulmonary congestion (29 in 25), severe pleural effusion (13 in 13), pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum (14 in 13), and malposition of the orotracheal tube (32 in 26). Fewer than half of the CXRs with a new and unexpected finding were ultimately clinically relevant; in only 2. 2 % of all <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs (6. 4 % of patients) did these radiologic abnormalities result in a change to therapy. Subgroup analysis revealed no differences between medical and surgical patients with regard to the incidence of new and unexpected findings on <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs and the effect of new and unexpected CXR findings on daily care. CONCLUSION: In the ICU, <b>daily</b> <b>routine</b> CXRs seldom reveal unexpected, clinically relevant abnormalities, and they rarely prompt action. We propose that this diagnostic examination be abandoned in ICU patient...|$|R

25|$|With {{regard to}} the <b>daily</b> <b>routines</b> of Buddhists in Myanmar, there are two most popular practices: merit-making and vipassanā. The weizza path is the least popular; it is an esoteric form {{somewhat}} linked to Buddhist aspiration that involves the occult. Merit-making {{is the most common}} path undertaken by Burmese Buddhists. This path involves the observance of the Five Precepts and accumulation of good merit through charity and good deeds (dana) to obtain a favourable rebirth. The vipassana path, which has gained ground since the early 1900s, is a form of insight meditation believed to lead to enlightenment. The weizza path is an esoteric system of occult practices (such as recitation of spells, samatha and alchemy) believed to lead to life as a weizza (also spelt weikza), a semi-immortal and supernatural being who awaits the appearance of the future Buddha, Maitreya (Arimeitaya).|$|E

PPS is a very slowly progressing condition marked by periods of stability followed by new declines in the ability to carry out usual daily activities.

25|$|Having {{lived in}} the steel town of Wheeling, West Virginia, Davis had {{first-hand}} experience with the controversies and hardships associated with industrialism. She utilizes the theme of industrialism in Life in the Iron Mills by {{calling attention to the}} dark and dismal setting of the iron mills. She not only provides vivid imagery of the dismal landscape, but imagery of the working class as well. By exploring the effects of the iron mills on its inhabitants, Davis is able to depict her own concerns and frustrations associated with the marginalization of the working class. Davis's depiction of the <b>daily</b> <b>routines</b> of the laboring class is a common theme throughout her writing, and most importantly serves the purpose of unveiling the maltreatment of such individuals. Her goal in relating the physical and mental starvation that plagues the inhabitants of these mills is to urge her audience to form spiritual solutions to these issues rather than social solutions.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe. For example, girls learn how to make doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having little boys follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what to do while hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn the same way. They watch the women of the society do their <b>daily</b> <b>routines</b> and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. Having a little girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E
