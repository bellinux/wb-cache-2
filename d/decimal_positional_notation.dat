50|$|Having been {{derived from}} the Hindu numerals, modern Khmer numerals also {{represent}} a <b>decimal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>notation</b> system. It is the script with the first extant material evidence of zero as a numerical figure, dating its use back to the seventh century, two centuries before its certain use in India. However, Old Khmer, or Angkorian Khmer, also possessed separate symbols for the numbers 10, 20, and 100. Each multiple of 20 or 100 would require an additional stroke over the character, so the number 47 was constructed using the 20 symbol with an additional upper stroke, followed by the symbol for number 7. This inconsistency with its decimal system suggests that spoken Angkorian Khmer used a vigesimal system.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Positional</b> <b>{{notation}}</b> or place-value notation is {{a method}} of representing or encoding numbers. <b>Positional</b> <b>notation</b> is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the [...] "ones place", [...] "tens place", [...] "hundreds place").

In modern usage, this latter symbol is usually a vinculum (a horizontal line placed over the repeating digits). In this more developed form, the numeral system can symbolize any rational number using only 13 symbols (the ten digits, decimal marker, vinculum, and a prepended dash to indicate a negative number).|$|R
