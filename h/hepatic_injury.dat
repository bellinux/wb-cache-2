Patients Patients from January 2000 through May 2003 with complex (grades 3 - 5) blunt <b>hepatic</b> <b>injuries</b> not requiring laparotomy in the first 24 hours. Intervention Nonoperative treatment of complex blunt <b>hepatic</b> <b>injuries.</b> Main Outcome Measures Complications and treatment strategies. Results: Of 699 patients with complex blunt <b>hepatic</b> <b>injuries,</b> 453 (65 %) were treated nonoperatively. Overall, 61 patients (13 %) developed 87 hepatic complications including bleeding (38), biliary (bile peritonitis, 7; bile leak, 9; biloma, 11; biliary-venous fistula, 1; and bile duct injury, 1), abdominal compartment syndrome (5), and infections (abscess, 7; necrosis, 2; and suspected abdominal sepsis, 6), which required 86 multimodality treatments (angioembolization, 32; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and stenting, 9; interventional radiology drainage, 16; paracentesis, 1; laparotomy, 24; and laparoscopy, 4). Hepatic complications developed in 5 % (13 of 264) of patients with grade 3 injuries, 22 % (36 of 166) of patients with grade 4 injuries, and 52 % (12 of 23) of patients with grade 5 injuries.

Additionally, wild-type mice were pretreated with anti-CD 1 d, -NK 1. 1, or -IL- 2 R-α antibodies before I/R injury.

Injury to hepatocyte and bile duct cells lead to accumulation of bile acid inside the liver. This promotes further liver damage.

Recent studies have shown that <b>hepatic</b> ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) <b>injury</b> and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. We aim to investigate the mechanism of FTY 720, which was originally applied as an immunomodulator, on suppression of liver tumor metastasis after liver resection and partial <b>hepatic</b> I/R <b>injury.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: An orthotopic liver tumor model in Buffalo rat was established using the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line McA-RH 7777. Two weeks after orthotopic liver tumor implantation, the rats underwent liver resection for tumor-bearing lobe and partial <b>hepatic</b> I/R <b>injury.</b> FTY 720 (2 mg/kg) was administered through the inferior caval vein before and after I/R injury. Blood samples were taken at days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 for detection of circulating EPCs (CD 133 +CD 34 +). Our results showed that intrahepatic and lung metastases were significantly inhibited together with less tumor angiogenesis by FTY 720 treatment. The number of circulating EPCs was also significantly decreased by FTY 720 treatment from day 7 to day 28. Hepatic gene expressions of CXCL 10, VEGF, CXCR 3, CXCR 4 induced by <b>hepatic</b> I/R <b>injury</b> were down-regulated in the treatment group.

Apoptosis and autophagy {{have been shown to}} contribute to cell death in <b>hepatic</b> I/R <b>injury.</b> Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is the third most common endogenously produced gaseous signaling molecule and is known to exert a protective effect against <b>hepatic</b> I/R <b>injury.</b> In this study, the purpose is to explore both the effect and mechanism of H 2 S on <b>hepatic</b> I/R <b>injury.</b> Methods. Balb/c mice were randomized into Sham, I/R, or two doses (14 [*]μmol/kg and 28 [*]μmol/kg) of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H 2 S donor) preconditioning groups. Results. NaHS significantly reduced the levels of TNF-α and IL- 6 at 12 [*]h and 24 [*]h after injection compared with ischemia/reperfusion challenge alone.
