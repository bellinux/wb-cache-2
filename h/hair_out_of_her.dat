2500|$|Glau {{trained with}} stunt {{coordinator}} Joel Kramer {{to prepare for}} the physical demands of her role. In learning martial arts for Serenity, Glau used her training in ballet to learn fight scenes by counts, as if they were choreographies. About bringing the practice to Terminator, Glau said, [...] "When you're working with a stunt guy ... and you need to anticipate every swing he's going to take at you ... it's important that you know exactly the timing that it's all going to play out." [...] Training focused heavily on the destruction of breakable set pieces, safety in hand-to-hand fights and the use of a variety of firearms. Glau was challenged during fight scenes by not being able to move or act humanly by things such as pushing her <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. Glau modeled Cameron's walk after that of a dressage horse for its precision.|$|E

50|$|Glooscap {{learned that}} hunters who kill too much {{would destroy the}} {{ecosystem}} and the good world he had sought to create. Frightened at this possibility, Glooscap sought Grandmother Woodchuck (Agaskw) and asked her for advice. She plucked all the <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> belly (hence the lack of hair on a woodchuck's belly) and wove them into a magical bag. Glooscap put all the game animals into the bag. He then bragged to Grandmother Woodchuck that the humans would never need to hunt again. Grandmother Woodchuck scolded {{him and told him}} that they would die without the animals. She said that they needed to hunt to remain strong. Glooscap then let the animals go.|$|R

"Seems to me {{that girl}} Ruler of yours is making a big fuss over nothing," [...] remarked Scraps, tossing her yarn <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes with a jerk of her patched head. [...] "I don't know what Ojo has done, but it couldn't be {{anything}} very bad, for you and I were with him all the time." ...|$|E
60|$|Mitford had {{consigned}} {{his wife}} {{to the care of}} his friend Massey, who at once undertook the duty by tying a kerchief round Peggy's head to keep her <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes, after which he did the same for Nellie. Both women were perfectly quiet and submissive--the first owing to fear and exhaustion, the last from native courage, which enabled her to rise to the occasion. Massey then stripped off all his own clothes, except shirt and trousers, so as to be ready for swimming, and, catching up a rope, advanced towards his wife, intending to fasten it round her waist.|$|E
5000|$|Ms. Viola Hennepin - {{the vice}} {{principal}} at Trace Middle School. She attempts to discipline Roy {{on several occasions}} such as suspending him from the school bus for two weeks, though she knows Dana strangled him.

5000|$|Two {{weeks after}} the filming started, the two had a {{confrontation}} that became notorious. Polanski pulled one <b>of</b> Dunaway's <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, without telling her, because it was catching the light. Dunaway was offended, describing his act as [...] "sadistic" [...] and left the set furious. [...] "It was not the hair, it was the incessant cruelty that I felt, the constant sarcasm, the never-ending need to humiliate me." [...] Years later, both shared their admiration for each other, with Polanski saying that their feud was not important — [...] "It’s the result that counts. And she was formidable," [...] while Dunaway admitted that [...] "it was way too much made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it," [...] added that she enjoyed working with Polanski, calling him [...] "a great director," [...] and stated that Chinatown was [...] "possibly the best film I ever made." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yuna, {{the typical}} harem anime [...] "housewife", {{transfers}} to Aoi Academy to become Kazuki's wife and even first introduced herself as [...] "Yuna Shikimori" [...] {{to the rest}} of Kazuki's class. Yuna {{is the only one who}} actually cares for Kazuki from the very beginning instead of just being interested in his genes. As the series progress, Yuna becomes extremely possessive of Kazuki and becomes very jealous when other girls show any kind of interests in him. Even later on the <b>hair</b> sticking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head acts as a locator to be able to find Kazuki.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Cameron {{drew her}} to the rock where she sat, and pushing the <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes, revived her with a hearty 'Bravo! bravo!' which assured the girl that her first act was a hit. Josie had often {{imagined}} her meeting with the great actress--the dignity and grace with which she would enter and tell her ambitious hopes, the effective dress she would wear, the witty things she would say, the deep impression her budding genius would make. But never in her wildest moments had she imagined an interview like this; scarlet, sandy, streaming, and speechless {{she leaned against the}} illustrious shoulder, looking like a beautiful seal as she blinked and wheezed till she could smile joyfully and exclaim proudly: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{one end of}} {{the room}} was an archway opening into a narrow inner room, hardly more than a recess, where the light fell from above on a small altar covered with fair white linen. Over the altar was a picture, {{discernible}} at the distance where the little party sat only as the small full-length portrait of a Dominican Brother. For it was shaded from the light above by overhanging branches and wreaths of flowers, and the fresh tapers below it were unlit. But it seemed that the decoration of the altar and its recess was not complete. For part of the floor was strewn with a confusion of flowers and green boughs, and among them sat a delicate blue-eyed girl of thirteen, tossing her long light-brown <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes, as she made selections for the wreaths she was weaving, or looked up at her mother's work in the same kind, and told her how to do it with a little air of instruction.|$|E
60|$|The old keenness {{was in his}} eye, the old {{firmness}} {{about the}} mouth, the old satirical smile on his lips as Warwick presented the seat, with an inclination that to her seemed ironical. She sat down, but when she cast about her mind for some safe and easy topic to introduce, every idea had fled; even memory and fancy turned traitors; not a lively sally could be found, not a pleasant remembrance returned to help her, and she sat dumb. Before the dreadful pause grew awkward, however, rescue {{came in the form}} of Tilly. Nothing daunted by the severe simplicity of her attire she planted herself before Warwick, and shaking her <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes stared at him with an inquiring glance and cheeks as red as her apple. She seemed satisfied in a moment, and climbing to his knee established herself there, coolly taking possession of his watch, and examining the brown beard curiously as it parted with the white flash of teeth, when Warwick smiled his warmest smile.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode's production, the pill would read [...] "Roofie", but it was {{eventually}} removed. Another scene that changed during production was the scene in which Homer uses Marge's hair to clean him up for their date. After he takes Marge's <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his ear, <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> would originally be covered with earwax, but it was removed when the animators looked over the episode's storyboard. The second segment originally had many more shots of buffalo being shot, but some were changed so that the deaths were off-camera.|$|R

"Oh, well, {{she had a}} wide-awake pair of eyes, a bright, jolly sort of a face, lots <b>of</b> curly <b>hair</b> tumblin' <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> net, a trig little figger, {{and a pair of}} the neatest {{feet and}} ankles that ever stepped. 'Pretty,' thinks I; 'so far so good.' The way she whacked the pillers, shook the blankets, and pitched into the beds was a caution; {{specially}} one blunderin' old feather-bed that wouldn't do nothin' but sag round in a pigheaded sort of way, that would have made most girls get mad and give up. Kitty didn't, but just wrastled with it like a good one, till she got it turned, banged, and spread to suit her; then she plumped {{down in the middle of}} it, with a sarcy little nod and chuckle to herself, that tickled me mightily. 'Plucky,' thinks I, 'better 'n' better.' Jest then an old woman came flyin' out the back-door, callin', 'Kitty! Kitty! Squire Partridge's son's here, 'long with a friend; been gunnin', want luncheon, and I'm all in the suds; do come down and see to 'em.' ...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2017 by The American Society of International Law. One dusty day in 2002, at Takhta Baig Voluntary Repatriation Centre near Peshawar {{in northwestern}} Pakistan, an Afghan woman - let us call her Amena - entered a nondescript {{room and sat}} down in front of a camera. A brief {{conversation}} took place with a woman sitting nearby at a computer terminal. Amena placed her chin where she was directed to do so, swept back a few strands <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> creeping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> veil, and stared straight ahead for a few seconds while a series of photographs <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes was taken. Almost immediately, a small alarm sounded on the computer terminal of the woman seated alongside her. Amena was gently ushered toward {{the other side of the}} room for discussions with other officials. Some short time later, she was advised that her request to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for a modest cash grant and some supplies to aid her and her family's repatriation to Afghanistan had been denied. This was because, according to output of the UNHCR's iris verification program, she had already received assistance earlier the same year. When asked, Amena admitted that she had indeed sought UNHCR repatriation assistance multiple times, under pressure from family members. She walked away. Soon, she could soon no longer be seen amid the press of trucks, cars, bicycles, and people that stretched to the suburbs in the distance...|$|R
60|$|Dick {{had turned}} northward across the Park, {{but he was}} walking in the spirit on the mud-flats with Maisie. He laughed aloud as he remembered {{the day when he}} had decked Amomma's horns with the ham-frills, and Maisie, white with rage, had cuffed him. How long those four years seemed in review, and how closely Maisie was {{connected}} with every hour of them! Storm across the sea, and Maisie in a gray dress on the beach, sweeping her drenched <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes and laughing at the homeward race of the fishing-smacks; hot sunshine on the mud- flats, and Maisie sniffing scornfully, with her chin in the air; Maisie flying before the wind that threshed the foreshore and drove the sand like small shot about her ears; Maisie, very composed and independent, telling lies to Mrs. Jennett while Dick supported her with coarser perjuries; Maisie picking her way delicately from stone to stone, a pistol in her hand and her teeth firm-set; and Maisie in a gray dress sitting on the grass between the mouth of a cannon and a nodding yellow sea-poppy. The pictures passed before him one by one, and the last stayed the longest.|$|E
60|$|But he had yielded in {{the main}} when he allowed himself to base his {{opposition}} on one immaterial detail. The breakfast was to be given at the King's Head, and, though it was acknowledged on all sides that no authority could be found for such a practice, it was known that the bill was to be paid by the bridegroom. Nor would Mr Ruggles pay the five hundred pounds down as in early days he had promised to do. He was very clear in his mind that his undertaking on that head was altogether cancelled by Ruby's departure from Sheep's Acre. When he was reminded that he had nearly pulled his granddaughter's <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, and had thus justified her act of rebellion, he did not contradict the assertion, but implied that if Ruby did not choose to earn her fortune on such terms as those, that was her fault. It {{was not to be}} supposed that he was to give a girl, who was after all as much a Pipkin as a Ruggles, five hundred pounds for nothing. But, in return for that night's somewhat harsh treatment of Ruby, he did at last consent to have the money settled upon John Crumb at his death,-- an arrangement which both the lawyer and Joe Mixet thought to be almost as good as a free gift, being both of them aware that the consumption of gin and water was on the increase. And he, moreover, was persuaded to receive Mrs Pipkin and Ruby at the farm for the night previous to the marriage. This very necessary arrangement was made by Mr Mixet's mother, a most respectable old lady, who went out in a fly from the inn attired in her best black silk gown and an overpowering bonnet, an old lady from whom her son had inherited his eloquence, who absolutely shamed the old man into compliance,--not, however, till she had promised to send out the tea and white sugar and box of biscuits which were thought to be necessary for Mrs Pipkin on the evening preceding the marriage. A private sitting-room at the inn was secured for the special accommodation of Mrs Hurtle,--who {{was supposed to be a}} lady of too high standing to be properly entertained at Sheep's Acre Farm.|$|E

5000|$|The nurse's cap {{originated}} {{from a group}} of women in the early Christian era, called [...] "deaconesses." [...] Deaconesses are now recognized as religious order nuns. These women were distinguished from other women during this time by white coverings worn on their heads. This particular head covering was worn to show that this group of women worked in the service of caring for the sick. Originally, this head covering was more of a veil, but it later evolved into a white cap during the Victorian era. It was during this era that proper women were required to keep their heads covered. The cap worn was hood-shaped with a ruffle around the face and tied under the chin, similar to cleaning ladies of that day. Long hair was fashionable during the Victorian era, so the cap kept the nurse's <b>hair</b> up and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face, as well as keeping it from becoming soiled.|$|R

Mark travels out to the woods to collect moss samples whenl z c x he stumbles across a rusty decaying station wagon. Intrigued, he continues down the path and eventually finds an abandoned farmhouse. He enters the house, explores the rooms, and stumbles across an injured man propped up against a wall. When he hears a woman scream, he rushes to her aid and finds her having a seizure on a dirty mattress. He brushes her <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face to comfort her and sees that she has {{the same sort of}} scars and deformities that the man had.

The head of the Old Drunkard is raised, her mouth is slightly open and her eyes stare off into space. Her skin is loose and hangs in folds over her cheeks and jaw. The Nasolabial fold is pronounced and crow's feet surround the eyes. The open mouth exposes two remaining teeth. The woman's hair is carefully styled, wrapped at the sides and gathered up with a band above the neck. Her headscarf is carefully wrapped around her head; a few locks peep out under it, as if by accident. She wears two rings on her left hand, one on her pointing finger and one on her ringfinger, which implies that she was wealthy and had some social status.|$|E
