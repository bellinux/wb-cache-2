The size and shape of the cages are very important for the growth and production of the fishes/ shell fishes living inside it. The design will vary depending on the selected site. The constructed cage must withstand the force of wind and wave while holding the stock safely. The cage must be safe, secure and easy to manage. Circular cage bags make the most efficient use of materials, and thus have the lowest costs per unit volume. Shape is likely to influence <b>effective</b> <b>stocking</b> densities and swimming behaviour, which in turn can influence production. Fish cages can be constructed from a variety of materials.

40|$|Many authors {{report on}} the effect of rice-fish culture on rice yields. Some reports show {{increased}} rice yields, others show no effect or even decreased yields. To verify the impact of rice-fish culture, data gathered over eight experiments (1995 - 1999) at the Co Do experimental rice-fish station, Vietnam, were analysed through multiple regressions with rice yield and different yield components as the dependent variables. We used eight independent variables: season, water depth, rice variety, rice seeding rate, and the <b>effective</b> <b>stocking</b> density (ESD) of silver barb, Nile tilapia, common carp and snakeskin gourami. Season had the biggest impact on nearly all dependent variables. Rice yields in the wet season were on average 2. 42 t/ha lower as compared to the dry season. Higher water levels decreased the number of panicles/m(2) and the rice yield. The rice seeding rate affected the yield component variables, but had no impact on the rice yield. Silver barb feeding decreased the number of panicles/m(2) but this was compensated by an increased number of grains/panicle. Snakeskin gourami had a positive effect on panicles/m(2) and, together with common carp, on sink capacity, probably through improved nutrient cycling in presence of fish and improved nutrient uptake by the rice plant. Snakeskin gourami had a negative effect on the ripening ability, whereas Nile tilapia had a positive effect. Fish did not have any impact on the rice yield. Increased water level and reduced rice arable area, the main two requirements for rice-fish culture, result in lower rice yields from rice-fish systems as compared to monoculture systems. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{thorough}} quantitative {{understanding of}} populations {{at the edge}} of extinction is needed to manage both invasive and extirpating populations. Immigration can govern the population dynamics when the population levels are low. It increases the probability of a population establishing (or reestablishing) before going extinct (EBE). However, the rate of immigration can be highly fluctuating. Here, we investigate how the stochasticity in immigration impacts the EBE probability for small populations in variable environments. We use a population model with an Allee effect described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and employ the Fokker-Planck diffusion approximation to quantify the EBE probability. Wefind that, the effect of the stochasticity in immigration on the EBE probability depends on both the intrinsic growth rate (r) and the mean rate of immigration (p). In general, if r is large and positive (e. g. invasive species introduced to favorable habitats), or if p is greater than the rate of population decline due to the demographic Allee effect (e. g., <b>effective</b> <b>stocking</b> of declining populations), then the stochasticity in immigration decreases the EBE probability. If r is large and negative (e. g. endangered populations in unfavorable habitats), or if the rate of decline due to the demographic Allee effect is much greater than p (e. g., weak stocking of declining populations), then the stochasticity in immigration increases the EBE probability. However, the mean time for EBE decreases with the increasing stochasticity in immigration with both positive and negative large r. Thus, results suggest that ecological management of populations involves a tradeoff as to whether to increase or decrease the stochasticity in immigration in order to optimize the desired outcome. Moreover, the control of invasive species spread through stochastic means, for example, by stochastic monitoring and treatment of vectors such as ship-ballast water, may be suitable strategies given the environmental and demographic uncertainties at introductions. Similarly, the recovery of declining and extirpated populations through stochastic stocking, translocation, and reintroduction, may also be suitable strategies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|Stocking rate (SR) is {{the primary}} {{management}} factor that influences livestock gains, plant community changes and forage production, {{as well as economic}} returns for livestock producers. More <b>effective</b> <b>stocking</b> decision making by ranchers in the semi-arid northern mixed-grass prairie requires clearly understanding forage production and yearling steer weight gain (SWG) responses to SR and high weather variability. The objectives of this study were to: (1) test the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management-Range (GPFARM-Range) model for predicting forage production and SWG under three experimental SR treatments and long-term weather conditions on semiarid northern mixed-grass prairie in southeast Wyoming, USA; and (2) quantify the threshold responses of forage production and SWG to SR and the yearly weather variability across years using long-term simulations with SR higher than those experimentally evaluated. We improved upon the GPFARM-Range model to simulate peak standing crop (PSC) and SWG for three experimental SR treatments (low, moderate and high; 0. 20, 0. 33 and 0. 44 steer ha- 1, respectively) from 1982 to 2012 at Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA. The improved model accurately predicted the effects of SR on PSC and SWG across years (root mean square errors from 355 to 387 kg ha- 1 for PSC and from 12. 8 to 14. 2 kg head- 1 for SWG). We ran the model with long-term weather data and 50 – 300 % higher SR (0. 66 – 1. 76 steer ha- 1) than the high SR experimental treatment. Differential responses of predicted total intake of digestible nutrients (quadratic increase) and metabolic maintenance (linear increase) to these higher SR resulted in a quadratic increase of predicted SWG with SR and high yearly variability at high SR levels. The financially-optimum SR with highest profits was reduced to 0. 33 steer ha- 1 for dry or normal seasons and 0. 44 steer ha- 1 for wet seasons. Such reduced SR can also benefit land conservation with high PSC and low harvest efficiency. The moderate SR with 25 % harvest efficiency was determined between 0. 22 and 0. 33 steer ha- 1 for dry or normal seasons, or between 0. 33 and 0. 44 steer ha- 1 for wet seasons. These results provide useful direction for selecting an effective SR to achieve high economic net return with lower yearly variability (risk) and reduced likelihood of rangeland degradation...|$|E

The optimal <b>effective</b> capital <b>stock</b> is shown to be lower than the optimal capital stock under disembodied technical change.

Five treatment fish died, providing a non-significant mortality of 4 %.

While sand mullet appear quite tolerant of catch and release, their welfare nevertheless could be improved through simple changes to fishing strategies...|$|R

The discussion on the relevance of the precautionary principle is illustrative of this role. Although there is an extensive literature dealing with the theoretical aspects of this problem, economists still lack an operational decision rule. The matter is that the real option theory, now widely used to deal with markovian uncertainty, i. e. independent exogenous repeated chocks affecting the expected return from an irreversible project as time goes, is not adequate to analyze problems characterized by Bayesian uncertainty, i. e. problems where uncertainty about the effective value of parameters is resolved with time by a learning process based on the acquisition of information in the form of quantitative as well as qualitative signals.

In the limit, the networks cease to grow with the size of the economy. A larger economy, therefore, accumulates a larger tock of total knowledge but not necessarily a larger <b>effective</b> <b>stock</b> of knowledge that is useful to the individual firm.
