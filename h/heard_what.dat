5|$|I {{was told}} by my {{publishers}} that Cher heard my version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual. But the original writers were happy {{for me to do}} that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval about what happened to the song. Now apparently she's <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when they saw and <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> had happened. Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E
5|$|While G Company {{was trying}} to escape from Hill 464, {{the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion was cut off at the eastern base of Hill 380, to the south. Nist {{organized}} all the South Korean carriers he could find before dark and loaded them with water, food, and ammunition for the 2nd Battalion, but the carrier party was unable to find the battalion. At dawn on September 7 the men in G Company was discovered and attacked by North Korean troops in nearby positions. At this time, West <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> he recognized as fire from American weapons on a knob to his west. There, G Company was reunited with its Weapons Platoon which had become separated from him during the night.|$|E

5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> was happening to Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not}} know about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Swedish {{painter and}} film {{producer}} Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> he interpreted {{to be his}} dead father's voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name. He went on to make several more recordings, including one that he said contained a message from his late mother.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{round at}} 'is wife, as though 'e {{expected}} she'd ask 'im not to go, {{but she took}} no notice, and {{he opened the door}} softly and went out, while old Burge, who 'ad come into the room and <b>'eard</b> <b>what</b> he was saying, trotted off upstairs to pack 'is chest for 'im.|$|R
60|$|I {{doubt whether}} Sir Damask {{would have said}} a word about it to his wife as he was {{dressing}} for dinner, had he calculated what might be the result to himself.

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1976, a {{restaurant}} in Fire Island Pines, New York, denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on July 4, 1976, sailed to the Pines by water taxi. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the Invasion of the Pines.|$|E
25|$|Csonka claims that, as {{he walked}} away from the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which {{normally}} allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he would certainly have overruled Gibson had he <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> was coming.|$|E
25|$|The play {{proceeded}} {{without incident}} until the intermission between {{the fourth and}} fifth act, which occurred shortly after 11pm. During this time, the drop curtain was down, hiding the stage, and the orchestra was playing for the intermission. Some attendees in the parquet circle <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> sounded like a brawl behind the curtain, shouting by men, and the working of machinery; they could easily hear it above the playing of the orchestra.|$|E

25|$|Deux Amis left Jersey on 23 May and at 3:30 in {{the morning}} she hit a rock. Despite efforts to save her, water entered the ship faster than the pumps could remove it. After the {{passengers}} left in a boat, Willson decided to run her ashore, which he did. As a result, there were no casualties. While Deux Amis was in distress at sea, local fishing boats came to help; once she ran ashore, the local populace gave priority to plundering rather than rescue. When Captain Green of the North Hants militia <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> was happening, he and his officers sent a strong detachment to enforce order.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} of the witnesses recognized the first gunshot they heard as weapon fire, but there was hardly any reaction to the first shot from {{a majority of the}} people in the crowd or those riding in the motorcade. Many bystanders later said that they <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> they first thought to be a firecracker or the backfire of one of the vehicles shortly after the President began waving. Although some close witnesses recalled seeing the limousine slow down, nearly stop, or completely stop, the Warren Commission, based on the Zapruder film, found that the limousine had an average speed of 11.2miles per hour over the 186ft of Elm Street immediately preceding the fatal head shot.|$|E
25|$|Astronaut Gordon Cooper {{reported}} {{suppression of}} {{a flying saucer}} movie filmed in high clarity by two Edwards AFB range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 June 1972, Catholic {{civilian}} Jean Smith (or Smyth) was shot dead on the Glen Road. Jean was a 24-year-old mother of one. She was shot while sitting {{in the passenger seat}} of a car at the Glen Road bus terminus. As her male companion turned the car, he <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> he thought was a tyre bursting. When he got out to check, the car was hit by a burst of automatic gunfire. Smith {{was shot in the head}} and died shortly afterward. Her companion stopped a passing taxi and asked the driver to take her to hospital. However, the taxi was then stopped by police and diverted to Andersonstown RUC base, where they were held for several hours.|$|E
25|$|William's troops {{set fire}} to the {{abandoned}} villages of Laaxum and Warns and started to advance towards Stavoren. In the countryside around Warns the Hollandic count was attacked by the local inhabitants. With their heavy armour the knights were no match for the furious Frisian farmers and fishermen. As they fled they entered a swamp where they were decisively beaten. Their commander William IV of Holland was killed, and was succeeded by his sister Margaret of Holland, wife of Louis IV. When John of Beaumont <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> had happened, he ordered a retreat back to the ships. They were pursued by the Frisians and most did not make it back. Count William's death in this battle {{paved the way for the}} Hook and Cod wars, and 26 September, the day of the battle, remains a national holiday in Friesland today.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, Cattrall {{took part}} in the BBC One {{documentary}} series Who Do You Think You Are?, where she discovered some uncomfortable facts about her grandfather, George Baugh. Baugh, who disappeared in 1938, having abandoned his family – including Cattrall's then 8-year-old mother and two younger sisters – turned out to have bigamously married his new wife, Isabella Oliver, the following year in Tudhoe, County Durham, and subsequently had another four children. She was told that in 1961 he emigrated to Australia, where he became a postmaster, retiring in 1972 and dying in Sydney in 1974. Cattrall's mother and aunts had known nothing of their father's life after he left until they <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> the Who Do You Think You Are? researchers had discovered, nor had the family previously seen a clear photograph of him. An edited version of the episode was later shown {{as a part of the}} U.S. series of the same name.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} year, Guo Yuan assisted the general Cao Ren in suppressing a rebellion by Tian Yin (田銀) and Su Bo (蘇伯) in Hejian Commandery (河間郡; around present-day Cangzhou, Hebei). After the revolt was crushed, many rebels were rounded up {{and sentenced to}} death. Guo Yuan advised Cao Cao to grant clemency to those rebels {{because they were not}} the masterminds. Cao Cao approved. Over 1,000 rebels were spared due to Guo Yuan's effort. At the time, it was not uncommon for officials to exaggerate their achievements in the reports they submitted after winning battles or suppressing rebellions. Guo Yuan, however, gave the exact figures in his report. When a surprised Cao Cao asked him why, Guo Yuan said that it was not something he was proud of because the rebellion was a sign of government failure. Cao Cao was so pleased when he <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> Guo Yuan said that he promoted him to be the Administrator (太守) of Wei Commandery (魏郡; around present-day Handan, Hebei).|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} {{sometime}} around or after 4pm, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator {{of the nearby}} Drexel Building, at 319 South Main Street, to use the top-floor restroom, which was restricted to blacks. He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. The two likely knew each other at least by sight, as this building {{was the only one}} nearby with a restroom which Rowland had express permission to use, and the elevator operated by Page {{was the only one in}} the building. A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store located on the first floor of the Drexel, <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> sounded like a woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building. The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in what he said was a distraught state. Thinking she had been assaulted, he summoned the authorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} seize Biên Hòa failed, and Kỳ circled Tân Sơn Nhứt, {{threatening}} {{to bomb the}} rebels. Most of {{the forces of the}} III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels, and took no action. At 20:00, Phát and Thảo met with Kỳ in a meeting organised by the Americans, and insisted that Khánh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, around midnight, loyal ARVN forces swept into the city from the south and some loyal to Kỳ from Biên Hòa in the north. Whether the rebels were genuinely defeated or a deal was struck with Kỳ to end the revolt in exchange for Khánh's removal is disputed. Before fleeing, Thảo broadcast a message stating that the coup had been effective in removing Khánh. This was not the case, but the chaos led the Armed Forces Council to adopt a vote of no confidence in Khánh the following day. This motion was precipitated by Thi, who gained the support of Kỳ, and the final vote was unanimous. Kỳ assumed control of a junta that continued with Suu and Quat as a civilian front, although General Trần Văn Minh was the nominal head as Commander in Chief of the armed forces. Khánh was then north of Saigon, inspecting a display of captured communist weapons. When he <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> was happening, he refused to accept his fate and used his personal aircraft to fly to different provinces, trying to rally support, promising to promote those which would be natural allies, but received little support. Having ousted Khánh, the generals made a press conference in the afternoon, but claimed that no decision had been definitively made.|$|E
