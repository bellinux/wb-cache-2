5|$|In 23BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his {{possible}} death {{threatened to}} plunge the Roman world <b>into</b> <b>chaos</b> again. Historians generally {{agree that it}} is during this time that the question of Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that Agrippa and Marcellus would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.|$|E

Nevertheless, his estrangement from Zeke and Moya, coupled with the {{responsibilities}} of heroism, lead him to realize that he will always be alone. If Cole is Infamous, he allows Empire City to slip further <b>into</b> <b>chaos,</b> and disregards Kessler's warning about the Beast, believing himself to be the strongest to ever exist.|$|E

5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base <b>into</b> <b>chaos,</b> the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world <b>into</b> <b>chaos</b> and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} {{in a much more}} sympathetic and honorable light. In {{one of the most famous}} renditions of the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E

5|$|Valve {{considered}} {{adding a}} competitive mode to Portal 2. According to Wolpaw, the mode {{was similar to}} the video game Speedball; one team would try to transport a ball {{from one side of the}} playing field to the other using portals, while the other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals. Matches would commence with this objective in mind, but quickly descended <b>into</b> <b>chaos.</b> Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and therefore they focused on the cooperative mode.|$|E
5|$|Despite his proclaimed lack of {{interest}} in the gubernatorial nomination, Brown's name was entered as a candidate on the first ballot, along with Parker Watkins Hardin, former Congressman William J. Stone, and William Goebel, President Pro Tempore of the state senate. The convention was thrown <b>into</b> <b>chaos</b> when a widely known agreement between Stone and Goebel – designed to get Hardin out of the race – broke down. As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.|$|E
5|$|Flagg first {{appeared}} in The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain <b>into</b> <b>chaos.</b> Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower—the linchpin of existence—so he can claim it for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand {{in which he was}} portrayed by Jamey Sheridan and The Dark Tower film adaptation in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown <b>into</b> <b>chaos</b> by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 popular uprisings {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots, and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by General Joan Prim), who {{were concerned about the}} ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. However, the intellectuals behind the Republic were powerless to prevent a descent <b>into</b> <b>chaos.</b> Uprisings were crushed by the military. The old monarchy returned with the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, as reform was deemed less important than peace and stability. Despite the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1890, elections were controlled by local political bosses (caciques).|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Loxton {{helped to}} select David Hookes {{to make his}} debut in the Centenary Test, after {{receiving}} a recommendation from Bradman, who had retired from the panel. Hookes famously struck five consecutive fours in one Tony Greig over in an Australian win. The later period of Loxton's tenure was thrown <b>into</b> <b>chaos</b> {{when most of the}} leading players abandoned the existing establishment to sign contracts with the breakaway World Series Cricket—which offered substantially more remuneration—meaning that an almost-entirely new team had to be cobbled together; the 42-year-old Bob Simpson was brought out of a decade of retirement to lead the outfit. During this time, Australia's depleted team suffered many heavy defeats.|$|E

5|$|Just as they {{finished}} their report, the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia. The Ustaše called {{for help from}} Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment, engaging them with mortars and light artillery. Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the cover of darkness. About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by a mortar round, which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters.

Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into the Irish Sea region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated <b>into</b> <b>chaos</b> following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús seems to have taken it upon himself to reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into the Irish Sea region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement, sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E
