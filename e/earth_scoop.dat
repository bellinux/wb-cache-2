50|$|At {{the age of}} 21 {{he bought}} the 'Irishman Creek' sheep station in South Canterbury. After a trip to England became fascinated with motor cars and raced a Bentley. He decided to develop his own heavy machinery.Ạθ He built a workshop, {{developed}} an excavator with an <b>earth</b> <b>scoop</b> and built a dam to supply water for a hydroelectric plant to supply power for domestic use and for his engineering projects, and started a manufacturing business.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few moments}} he {{had arrived at the}} picket-line, the men on duty there lying in groups of two and four behind little banks of <b>earth</b> <b>scooped</b> out of the slight {{depression}} in which they lay, their rifles protruding from the green boughs with which they had masked their small defenses. The forest extended without a break toward the front, so solemn and silent that only by an effort of the imagination could it be conceived as populous with armed men, alert and vigilant--a forest formidable with possibilities of battle. Pausing a moment in one of these rifle-pits to apprise the men of his intention Searing crept stealthily forward {{on his hands and knees}} and was soon lost to view in a dense thicket of underbrush.|$|R
60|$|Warned by {{his former}} failure in {{kidnapping}} strangers, he now pursues {{a quite different}} plan. When seamen come ashore, he makes up to them like a free-and-easy comrade, invites them to his hut, and with whatever affability his red-haired grimness may assume, entreats them to drink his liquor and be merry. But his guests need little pressing; and so, soon as rendered insensible, are tied hand and foot, and pitched among the clinkers, are there concealed till the ship departs, when, finding themselves entirely dependent upon Oberlus, alarmed at his changed demeanor, his savage threats, and above all, that shocking blunderbuss, they willingly enlist under him, becoming his humble slaves, and Oberlus the most incredible of tyrants. So much so, that two or three perish beneath his initiating process. He sets the remainder--four of them--to breaking the caked soil; transporting upon their backs loads of loamy <b>earth,</b> <b>scooped</b> up in moist clefts among the mountains; keeps them on the roughest fare; presents his piece at {{the slightest hint of}} insurrection; and in all respects converts them into reptiles at his feet--plebeian garter-snakes to this Lord Anaconda.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. At Emily Bay, {{domestic}} structures include <b>earth</b> ovens, <b>scoop</b> hearths and {{a possible}} rectangular house inferred from posts and postholes. An area of stone paving nearby is argued to be a religious structure, or marae. Made of naturally available stone, it lies slightly {{below the surface of}} the darker sand cultural layer. Obsidian flakes were found above it and postholes beneath. Several edging blocks of various shapes are noted. Radiocarbon dated to c. 700 – 600 B. P., this platform fits within the known parameters of other East Polynesian marae of similar age...|$|R
60|$|It {{was indeed}} open country, wide and high. They talked and bounded on, Jude cutting {{from a little}} covert a long {{walking-stick}} for Sue as tall as herself, with a great crook, which made {{her look like a}} shepherdess. About half-way on their journey they crossed a main road running due east and west--the old road from London to Land's End. They paused, and looked up and down it for a moment, and remarked upon the desolation which had come over this once lively thoroughfare, while the wind dipped to <b>earth</b> and <b>scooped</b> straws and hay-stems from the ground.|$|R
50|$|A fair is held twice {{annually}} {{for three days}} on Bhadon 28 (August-September)and Chet 16 (March- April) at the shine of Jogi Pir. It is attended by both Hindus and Sikhs. The people pay their obeisance at the shrine, especially {{after the birth of}} a child or the solemnization of marriage. <b>Earth</b> is also <b>scooped</b> one of the tank by the people for invoking the blessings of Jogi Pir.|$|R
50|$|The {{maker of}} the kawala selects his reeds while they {{are still in the}} <b>earth,</b> and <b>scoops</b> out the inside, {{hollowing}} them out so that they stop growing taller but instead grow thicker and harder. The reeds are left in the earth until they are ripe for harvest, at which point they are culled and left in the sun to dry out completely. Then comes the stage of dividing each stalk into segments of four knots each, starting at the thinner end, so that a musician gets (in order) a leading pipe and a following pipe in a 1:2 ratio (two follower pipes for each leader). The maker is careful to select the leader and its follower from the same stalk so as to ensure uniformity in the color of the tone. The internal divisions that divide the reed into chambers at each knot from the inside are then removed, resulting in a hollow pipe open at both ends. Any excess is then trimmed away, together with the remainder of the internal divisions, for a smooth, even interior texture.|$|R
50|$|They've {{gone and}} put up iron gates at the {{entrance}} to Patchin Place — {{in the middle of the}} entrance — leaving the little openings by the new brick posts free. And they've pulled down the Prison — but so far not the Clock tower. In the foundations of this fallen Bastille, from where of so many Sundays we heard the imprisoned Baggages sing about heaven, is an iron clutcher with a dragonish dew-lap <b>scooping</b> <b>earth</b> and hissing with a steamy vibrant roar. I am deaf of one ear — but this noise is very strident. But do you know we can now see the Woolworth tower and also the Singer Tower from the entrance of Patchin Place....|$|R
5000|$|Sand was dug {{from the}} creek bed near No. 1 Camp for the {{hundreds}} of concrete pipes forming most of the culverts under the road. The eucalypt forest and then the rainforest, marked on Main Roads working drawings as [...] "vine scrub" [...] or [...] "jungle", had to be manually cleared. Initially, the only mechanical aids were a few trucks, two tractors and two air compressors, with cuttings being blasted through the granite with gelignite and most work being done with picks and shovels. After the trees were cleared, horse-drawn ploughs broke up the softer <b>earth,</b> while horse-drawn <b>scoops,</b> wheelbarrows or mining trolleys on portable lengths of track removed the overburden. [...] "Tumbling tommies", small scoops that were towed behind the crawler tractors, were used later on.|$|R
60|$|Lights out, we in our berths, and {{the wind}} rising, the voice grows angrier and deeper. Under the {{mattress}} and under the pillow, under the sofa and under the washing-stand, under the ship and under the sea, seeming {{to rise from the}} foundations under the <b>earth</b> with every <b>scoop</b> of the great Atlantic (and oh! why scoop so?), always the voice. Vain to deny its existence in the night season; impossible to be hard of hearing; screw, screw, screw! Sometimes it lifts out of the water, and revolves with a whirr, like a ferocious firework,--except that it never expends itself, but is always ready to go off again; sometimes it seems to be in anguish, and shivers; sometimes it seems to be terrified by its last plunge, and has a fit which causes it to struggle, quiver, and for an instant stop. And now the ship sets in rolling, as only ships so fiercely screwed through time and space, day and night, fair weather and foul, CAN roll.|$|R
60|$|The plain marked 355 feet (as ascertained by the {{barometer}} and by angular measurement) is {{a continuation}} of the above-mentioned 330 feet plain: it extends in a N.W. direction along the southern shores of the estuary. It is capped by gravel, which in most parts is covered by a thin bed of sandy <b>earth,</b> and is <b>scooped</b> out by many flat-bottomed valleys. It appears to the eye quite level, but in proceeding in a S.S.W. course, towards an escarpment distant about six miles, and likewise ranging across the country in a N.W. line, it was found to rise at first insensibly, and then for the last half-mile, sensibly, close up {{to the base of the}} escarpment: at this point it was 463 feet in height, showing a rise of 108 feet in the six miles. On this 355-463 feet plain, I found several shells of Mytilus Magellanicus and of a Mytilus, which Mr. Sowerby informs me is yet unnamed, though well-known as recent on this coast; Patella deaurita; Fusus, I believe, Magellanicus, but the specimen has been lost; and at the distance of four miles from the coast, at the height of about four hundred feet, there were fragments of the same Patella and of a Voluta (apparently V. ancilla) partially embedded in the superficial sandy earth. All these shells had the same ancient appearance with those from the foregoing localities. As the tides along this part of the coast rise at the Syzygal period forty feet, and therefore form a well-marked beach-line, I particularly looked out for ridges in crossing this plain, which, as we have seen, rises 108 feet in about six miles, but I could not see any traces of such. The next highest plain is 710 feet above the sea; it is very narrow, but level, and is capped with gravel; it abuts to the foot of the 840 feet plain. This summit-plain extends as far as the eye can range, both inland along the southern side of the valley of the Santa Cruz, and southward along the Atlantic.|$|R
