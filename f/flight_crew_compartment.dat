As in the B-29 and B-50, the {{pressurized}} <b>flight</b> {{deck and}} <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> were linked to the rear compartment by a pressurized tunnel through the bomb bay. In the B-36, movement through the tunnel was on a wheeled trolley, pulling on a rope. The rear compartment featured six bunks and a dining galley, {{and led to the}} tail turret.|$|R

40|$|Effective {{contamination}} control {{as applied to}} manned space flight environments is a discipline characterized and controlled by many parameters. An introduction is given to issues involving Orbiter <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> {{contamination control}}. An effective ground processing contamination control program is an essential building block to a successful shuttle mission. Personnel are required to don cleanroom-grade clothing ensembles before entering the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> and follow cleanroom rules and regulations. Prior to <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> entry, materials and equipment must be checked by an orbiter integrity clerk stationed outside the white-room entrance for compliance to program requirements. Analysis and source identification of <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> debris studies {{have been going on}} for two years. The objective of these studies is to determine and identify particulate generating materials and activities in the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment.</b> Results show a wide spectrum of many different types of materials. When source identification is made, corrective action is implemented to minimize or curtail further contaminate generation...|$|R

5000|$|The C-87 did not climb {{well when}} heavily loaded, a {{dangerous}} characteristic when {{flying out of}} the unimproved, rain-soaked airfields of India and China; many were lost on takeoff {{with the loss of}} just a single engine. Gann's book recounts a near-collision with the Taj Mahal after takeoff in a heavily loaded C-87 when full flaps had to be hastily deployed to increase the aircraft's altitude to avoid the edifice. The aircraft's auxiliary long-range fuel tanks were linked by improvised and often leaky fuel lines that crisscrossed the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> choking <b>flight</b> <b>crews</b> with noxious gasoline fumes and creating an explosion hazard. The C-87 also had a tendency to enter an uncontrollable stall or spin when confronted with even mild icing conditions, a frequent occurrence over the Himalayas. Gann said they [...] "could not carry enough ice to chill a highball".|$|R
50|$|The <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> {{occupies}} {{the central and}} rear parts of the hull and is used for accommodating the crew, installing the assemblies required for operation of the crew, and placing various equipment, ammunition, and SPTA.

On the rear side of the crew section a locker for clothes and electric devices is mounted. Entry to the mechanical compartment is possible through two doors.

5000|$|The {{cross-section}} of the gondola, front to back, was generally rectangular, vertically oriented. The {{tip of the}} nose was very rounded to accommodate the main AI radar's dish antenna, merging quickly to a rectangular cross-section that tapered slightly towards the bottom. This cross-section lost its taper but became clearly rounded at the bottom moving back through the forward <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> and nose gear well. Height increased at both steps in the forward canopy, with the second step being flush with {{the top of the}} aircraft (not counting the dorsal gun turret). At the rear of the forward <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> the cross-section's bottom bulged downwards considerably and continued to do so until just past the midpoint between the rear of the forward <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> and the front of the rear <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> where the lower curvature began to recede. Beginning {{at the front of the}} rear <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> the top of the cross-section began to taper increasingly inwards above the aircraft's center of gravity when progressing towards the rear of the gondola. The cross-section rounded out considerably by the downward step in the rear canopy, and rapidly became a straight-sided oval, shrinking and terminating in the tip of the blown-Plexiglas [...] "cone" [...] described above.|$|R

However, the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> is now further forward and the new GAZ-41 {{gasoline}} V-8 engine is in the rear. Thanks to this, the engine is much better protected from enemy fire.
