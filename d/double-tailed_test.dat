40|$|Compression {{tests have}} been {{performed}} according to ASTM D 6641 to check whether 12 mm is a sufficient width for off-axis tests of a unidirectional Non Crimp Fabric (NCF) reinforced carbon-fibre composite. Various off-axis angles are tested in a larger context {{and it is important}} to establish a representative material volume. The test matrix consists of two different widths for two off-axis cases, 15 0; and 20 0; with a total sample size of 24. A two-sample T-test is performed for each off-axis angle to check if there is a statistically significant difference of the compressive strength between specimens with different widths. The null hypothesis, that there is no difference between the mean values is tested with a <b>double-tailed</b> <b>test</b> on a 5 % significance level. Neither of the cases may be rejected, i. e. there is no statistically significant difference on the 5 % level. The 15 0; off-axis case returns a p-value of 7. 4 % and the 20 0; off-axis case gives a p-value of 21. 3 %. It can be concluded that the effect is small and not statistically significant. It means that remaining off-axis testing in the larger context can proceed with the nominal width of 12 mm...|$|E
