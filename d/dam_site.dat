5|$|The city of Las Vegas had lobbied {{hard to be}} the {{headquarters}} for the dam construction, closing its many speakeasies when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior Ray Wilbur came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was {{to be built in}} the desert near the <b>dam</b> <b>site.</b> This town became known as Boulder City, Nevada. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the <b>dam</b> <b>site</b> began in September 1930.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while all {{construction}} was stayed, Reclamation conducted evaluations of the seismic potential of the <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> even though these delays caused {{the cost of the}} project to rise with every passing year. The studies concluded that a major fault system underlay the vicinity of the Auburn <b>Dam</b> <b>site,</b> with many folds of metamorphic rock formed by the contact of the foothill rocks and the granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada. Reclamation predicted that the Auburn Reservoir could induce an earthquake of up to a 6.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey projected a higher magnitude of 7.0. Nevertheless, Reclamation redesigned the Auburn Dam based on their 6.5 figure, even though a 7.0 would be three times stronger. The design for the Auburn Dam was changed to a concrete thick-arch gravity dam, to provide better protection against a possible earthquake induced by its own reservoir.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} {{irrigation}} {{water in the}} Sacramento area {{and other parts of}} the Central Valley were also growing. In 1854, a diversion dam was constructed on the North Fork American River at the site of Auburn Dam, to divert water into ditches that supplied downstream farms. Irrigation with dam and canal systems was favored because the seasonal nature of the American River caused floods in some years and droughts in others. A large dam at the Auburn site was thus considered for both flood control and water supply. In the 1950s, the Bureau of Reclamation created the first plans for a high dam at Auburn. Several designs, ranging from earth-fill to concrete gravity dams, were considered. Before the dam could be built, the Auburn-Foresthill Road – which crosses the river just upstream of the <b>dam</b> <b>site</b> – had to be relocated. Even before the project was authorized, contracts were let for the construction of a high bridge to carry the road over the proposed reservoir, as well as preliminary excavations at the <b>dam</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the November to May dry season, {{power output}} {{is limited by}} the river's flow rate, as seen in the {{diagrams}} on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the <b>dam</b> <b>site</b> {{occurred}} in May 1957 with {{the relocation of}} the Western Pacific Railroad tracks that ran through the Feather River canyon. The Burns-Porter Act of the California Legislature, which authorized the SWP, was not passed until November 8, 1960 – and only by a slim margin. Engineer Donald Thayer of the DWR was commissioned to design and head construction of Oroville Dam, and the primary work contract was awarded to Oro Dam Constructors Inc., a joint venture led by Oman Construction Co.|$|E

5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E
5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California's statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E
5|$|Living River Siam was {{launched}} on March 14, 1999, the International Rivers Day of Action, {{by a group}} of NGO workers and Thai academics. Its first action, on March 23, was to support an occupation of the Pak Mun <b>Dam</b> <b>site</b> by 5,000 villagers. The Pak Mun Dam, funded partially by the World Bank, was built in 1994 and slowly became the focus of national controversy. It received widespread complaints from Thai villagers and was the focus of the Assembly of the Poor's 99-day, 20,000-person protest in Bangkok in 1997. The dam generates 0.5 percent of Thailand's electric capacity; 40 percent of Thailand's total electric capacity goes unused on an everyday basis.|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli dam adenine-N 6 methyltransferase modifies DNA at GATC sequences. It is {{involved}} in post-replicative mismatch repair, control of DNA replication and gene regulation. We show that E. coli dam acts as a functional monomer and methylates only one strand of the DNA in each binding event. The preferred way of ternary complex assembly is that the enzyme first binds to DNA and then to S-adenosylmethionine. The enzyme methylates an oligonucleotide containing two <b>dam</b> <b>sites</b> and a 879 bp PCR product with four sites in a fully processive reaction. On l-DNA comprising 48, 502 bp and 116 <b>dam</b> <b>sites,</b> E. coli <b>dam</b> scans 3000 <b>dam</b> <b>sites</b> per binding event in a random walk, that on average leads to a processive methylation of 55 sites. Processive methylation of DNA considerably accelerates DNA methylation. The highly processive mechanism of E. coli dam could explain why small amounts of E. coli dam are able to maintain the methylation state of <b>dam</b> <b>sites</b> during DNA replication. Furthermore, our data support the general rule that solitary DNA methyltransferase modify DNA processively whereas methyltransferases belonging to a restriction-modification system show a distributive mechanism, because processive methylation of DNA would interfere with the biological function of restriction-modification systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In any <b>dam</b> <b>siting</b> {{study in}} arid regions, {{rainfall}} records, runoff measurements and their greatest magnitudes are very important. Unfortunately, {{the data are}} scarce and, therefore, empirical approaches and charts obtained from similar regions {{in other parts of}} the world are necessary for complete applications. The lack of observed data presents the major problem tor runoff modelling in arid regions. These regions have characteristically high rainfall intensity and consequent flash floods with large amounts of sediments. Occurrence of rainfall is sporadic, both temporally and spatially, which makes the interpretation of the rainfall-runoff relationship quite difficult. Flood estimations play a significant role in <b>dam</b> <b>siting</b> from the point of view of water availability. This paper presents the basic calculations of floods and sediment amounts that are necessary in <b>dam</b> <b>siting</b> and construction in an arid area by considering the southwestern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic fault that underlay the <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{fourteen}} potential water sources {{considered by the}} city – which included Lake Tahoe, the Eel River, and tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers– Hetch Hetchy was considered superior for its excellent <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> abundant sediment-free water, lower cost and hydroelectric potential. At the time, Hetch Hetchy was an isolated, seldom visited subalpine valley, visited intermittently by gold seekers and sheepherders. However, since 1890, Hetch Hetchy Valley and the surrounding lands {{had been part of}} Yosemite National Park and thus off-limits to utility development, let alone at the grand scale proposed by the city. Even though the valley was not well known to the general public, organizations such as the Sierra Club treasured it for its spectacular beauty, often compared to that of Yosemite Valley itself. Led by naturalist and mountaineer John Muir, the Sierra Club adamantly opposed the city of San Francisco as it sought permission from the federal government to build a dam in the valley.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Mountain Mine, {{the most}} {{productive}} copper mine in California {{in at least one}} point along its history, operated along the banks of two Spring Creek tributaries, upstream from the current <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> from 1879 to the 1960s. The mine extracted iron ore, silver, gold, copper sulfide ore, and pyrite from a rock formation dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The potential of a mine at the site was discovered in 1860, when two men, surveyor William Magee and settler Charles Camden, discovered an extensive iron ore deposit along one of the tributaries of Spring Creek. In 1879, silver was also discovered at the site, and the mine was begun. The ownership was transferred to Mountain Mines Ltd., a London company, in 1894. At {{the very end of the}} 19th century, Iron Mountain Mine took blames for several fish kills in the Sacramento River. Nevertheless, mining activity continued, and by 1928, 600 tons of ore were being extracted from the site per day.|$|E
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{is known}} to regulate several prokaryotic replication origins. In particular, the Escherichia coli chromosomal origin oriC and the pMB 1 plasmid origin (which is homologous to the ColE 1 origin) replicate poorly when hemimethylated at <b>dam</b> (GATC) <b>sites.</b> Because the mismatch repair protein MutH {{is known to}} recognize hemimethylated <b>dam</b> <b>sites,</b> {{its role in the}} replication of these origins was investigated. The results presented here show that the mutH gene product is partially responsible for the poor replication of the pMB 1 origin when hemimethylated but has no effect on the replication of oriC. Methylation levels at individual <b>dam</b> <b>sites</b> suggest that the MutH protein binds to an inverted repeat in the pMB 1 replication primer promoter. These findings suggest a mechanism for the coordinated control of DNA repair and replication...|$|R

Until this time, the Sacramento had still been flowing through the middle of the <b>dam</b> <b>site,</b> between the two nearly completed abutments of the dam. An earth/rock filled cofferdam was constructed across the river, which now began to flow through the tunnel, drying out the <b>dam</b> <b>site</b> and enabling work to begin on the middle section of the dam, which contained the spillway bays. The spillways with their 18 high-pressure river outlet valves and massive triple drum gates were completed in the summer of 1943.
