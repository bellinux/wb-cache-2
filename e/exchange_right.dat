50|$|The {{success of}} the grain trade was secured by a {{conservative}} take on property, which restricted the right of peasants to exploit for their own gain those plots of land they leased on boyar estates (the Regulament allowed them to consume around 70% of the total harvest per plot leased, while boyars were allowed to use {{a third of their}} estate as they pleased, without any legal duty toward the neighbouring peasant workforce); at the same time, small properties, created after Constantine Mavrocordatos had abolished serfdom in the 1740s, proved less lucrative in the face of competition by large estates - boyars profited from the consequences, as more landowning peasants had to resort to leasing plots while still owing corvées to their lords. Confirmed by the Regulament at up to 12 days a year, the corvée was still less significant than in other parts of Europe; however, since peasants relied on cattle for alternative food supplies and financial resources, and pastures remained the exclusive property of boyars, they had to <b>exchange</b> <b>right</b> of use for more days of work in the respective boyar's benefit (as much as to equate the corresponding corvée requirements in Central European countries, without ever being enforced by laws). Several laws of the period display a particular concern in limiting the right of peasants to evade corvées by paying their equivalent in currency, thus granting the boyars a workforce to match a steady growth in grain demands on foreign markets.|$|E

Diffractive events with hard processes ("hard diffraction"), such as production of high P T jets in diffractive interactions (See Fig 1), have been studied {{to understand the nature}} of the exchanged "Pomeron", which is a color singlet object with vacuum quantum numbers.

40|$|THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM COMPRISES SEVERAL SCALES OF BIOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY: the genes, {{cells and}} tissues {{that work in}} concert to {{generate}} resultant function. Malfunctions of the structure or function of components at any spatial scale can result in diseases, {{to the detriment of}} gas <b>exchange,</b> <b>right</b> heart function and patient quality of life. Vast amounts of data emerge from studies across each of the biological scales; however, the question remains: how can we integrate and interpret these data in a meaningful way? Respiratory disease presents a huge health and economic burden, with the diseases asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affecting over 500 million people worldwide. Current therapies are inadequate owing to our incomplete understanding of the disease pathophysiology and our lack of recognition of the enormous disease heterogeneity: we need to characterize this heterogeneity on a patient-specific basis to advance healthcare. In an effort to achieve this goal, the AirPROM consortium (Airway disease Predicting Outcomes through patient-specific computational Modelling) brings together a multi-disciplinary team and a wealth of clinical data. Together we are developing an integrated multi-scale model of the airways in order to unravel the complex pathophysiological mechanisms occurring in the diseases asthma and COP...|$|E
40|$|It is {{convenient}} to consider 2 broad categories of climate-related modeling studies {{for which it}} is necessary to specify some kind of lower boundary conditions. The first of these categories is the use of general circulation or weather forecasting models, perhaps modified to carry out climate simulations. In these models, one normally has to specify something about the albedo of the surface to get the radiation balance right, the surface roughness to get the momentum <b>exchange</b> <b>right,</b> and the surface moisture availability to get the surface heat and water vapor fluxes right. Correctly specifying the surface moisture availability can be a major problem and may involve a sophisticated land surface parameterization scheme to take into account plant and soil characteristics. It is reasonable to expect that misrepresenting the water vapor flux by 10 [...] 20 % on average over continental scales could lead to significant errors in simulated precipitation, temperatures, and circulation patterns. The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is focused, however, on clouds and radiation; and it has chosen Cloud and Radiation Testbeds (CART) as the principal tool with which to carry out its work. In this context, what the authors are concerned about for the lower boundary conditions is somewhat different. What they want to known is show the incoming radiation is partitioned into various components by surface processes, and [...] more importantly [...] what is the resultant sensitivity of the cloud and radiation fields to that partitioning. These features then determine the accuracy to which they need to describe the lower boundary conditions...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{exchange}} of gases between the stratosphere and the troposphere is important for determining how pollutants enter the stratosphere and how they leave. This study does a global analysis of that {{the exchange}} of mass between the stratosphere and the troposphere. While {{the exchange of}} mass {{is not the same}} as the exchange of constituents, you can t get the constituent <b>exchange</b> <b>right</b> if you have the mass exchange wrong. Thus this kind of calculation is an important test for models which also compute trace gas transport. In this study I computed the mass exchange for two assimilated data sets and a GCM. The models all agree that amount of mass descending from the stratosphere to the troposphere in the Northern Hemisphere extra tropics is approx. 10 (exp 10) kg/s averaged over a year. The value for the Southern Hemisphere by about a factor of two. (10 (exp 10) kg of air is the amount of air in 100 km x 100 km area with a depth of 100 m - roughly the size of the D. C. metro area to a depth of 300 feet.) Most people have the idea that most of the mass enters the stratosphere through the tropics. But this study shows that almost 5 times more mass enters the stratosphere through the extra-tropics. This mass, however, is quickly recycled out again. Thus the lower most stratosphere is a mixture of upper stratospheric air and tropospheric air. This is an important result for understanding the chemistry of the lower stratosphere...|$|E
