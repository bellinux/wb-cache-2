The proof of this relies on only (ACCP) not (ACC), so in any integral domain with (ACCP), an irreducible factorization exists. (In other words, any integral domains with (ACCP) are atomic. But the converse is false, as shown in [...]) Such a factorization may not be unique; the usual way to establish uniqueness of factorizations uses Euclids lemma, which requires factors to be prime rather than just irreducible.

40|$|AbstractRetinal {{progenitor}} cells (RPCs) are programmed {{early in}} development {{to acquire the}} competence for specifying the seven retinal cell types. Acquiring competence is a complex spatiotemporal process that is still only vaguely understood. Here, our objective was to more fully understand the mechanisms by which RPCs become competent for specifying a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) fate. RGCs are the first retinal cell type to differentiate and their abnormal development leads to apoptosis and optic nerve degeneration. Previous work demonstrated that the paired <b>domain</b> <b>factor</b> Pax 6 and the bHLH factor Atoh 7 are required for RPCs to specify RGCs. RGC commitment is marked by {{the expression of the}} Pou <b>domain</b> <b>factor</b> Pou 4 f 2 and the Lim <b>domain</b> <b>factor</b> Isl 1. We show that three RPC subpopulations can specify RGCs: Atoh 7 -expressing RPCs, Neurod 1 -expressing RPCs, and Atoh 7 –Neurod 1 -expressing RPCs. All three RPC subpopulations were highly interspersed throughout retinal development, although each subpopulation maintained a distinct temporal pattern. Most, but not all, RPCs from each subpopulation were postmitotic. Atoh 7 –Neurod 1 double knockout mice were generated and double-mutant retinas revealed an unexpected role for Neurod 1 in specifying RGC fate. We conclude that RPCs have a complex regulatory gene expression program in which they acquire competence using highly integrated mechanisms...|$|R

In transfected baby ham-ster kidney cells, Rat 1 fibroblasts, and normal IM 9 lym-phoblasts, PTP 1 D directly binds activated insulin receptor. This interaction is mediated by catalytic do-main-proximal SH 2 determinants of the phosphatase and phosphotyrosine 1146 of the activated insulin recep-tor. While the receptor and the phosphatase do not serve as substrates for each other, their interaction promotes IRS- 1 binding to the receptor, indicating that PTP 1 D functions as an adapter for insulin receptor and IRS- 1.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, a {{new data}} mining methodology, Domain Driven Data Mining (D 3 M), has been developed.

It strongly appreciates {{the involvement of}} domain intel-ligence in {{the whole process of}} data mining, and consequently leads to the deliverables that can satisfy business user needs and decision-making. Follow-ing the methodology of D 3 M, this paper investigates local exceptional patterns in real-life microstructure stock data for detecting stock price manipulations. Different from existing pattern analysis mainly on interday data, we deal with tick-by-tick data. Our approach proposes new mechanisms for constructing mi-crostructure order sequences by involving <b>domain</b> <b>factors</b> and business logics, and for measuring the interestingness of patterns from business concern pers-pective. Real-life data experiments on an exchange data demonstrate that the outcomes generated by following D 3 M can satisfy business expectations and support business users to take actions for market surveillance. ...|$|E

40|$|Factor VIIIa {{functions}} as a cofactor for factor IXa in the phospholipid surface-dependent activation of factor X. Both the C 2 <b>domain</b> of <b>factor</b> VIIIa and the Gla <b>domain</b> of <b>factor</b> IXa are involved in phospholipid binding and are required for the activation of factor X. In this study, we have examined the close relationship between these <b>domains</b> in the <b>factor</b> Xase complex. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based and surface plasmon resonance-based assays {{in the absence of}} phospholipid showed that Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified factor IXa bound to immobilized recombinant C 2 domain (rC 2) dose-dependently (Kd = 108 nm). This binding ability was optimal under physiological conditions. A monoclonal antibody against the Gla <b>domain</b> of <b>factor</b> IXa inhibited binding by approximately 95 %, and Gla domainless factor IXa failed to bind to rC 2. The addition of monoclonal antibody or rC 2 with factor VIIIa inhibited factor IXa-catalyzed factor X activation in the absence of phospholipid. Inhibition was not evident, however, in similar experiments in the absence of factor VIIIa, indicating that the C 2 domain interacted with the Gla <b>domain</b> of <b>factor</b> IXa. A fragment designated C 2 -(2182 - 2259), derived from V 8 protease-cleaved rC 2, bound to Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified factor IXa. Competitive assays, using overlapping synthetic peptides encompassing residues 2182 - 2259, demonstrated that peptide 2228 - 2240 significantly inhibited both this binding and factor Xa generation, independently of phospholipid. Our results indicated that residues 2228 - 2240 in the factor VIIIa C 2 domain constitutes an interactive site for the Gla <b>domain</b> of <b>factor</b> IXa. The findings provide the first evidence for an essential role for this interaction in factor Xase assembly. 博士（医学）・乙第 1297 号・平成 24 年 5 月 28 日Copyright © 2009 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biolog...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine postoperative levels of physical and psychological distress and, also, care needs and their related factors in newly diagnosed oral cavity cancer patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess symptom distress, psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and disease impact), care needs, and disease-/treatment-related characteristics in 112 hospitalized oral cavity cancer patients receiving surgery. The major results showed that patients had moderate-to-severe levels of distress and high overall care needs in five domains, with the highest level in the "physical and daily living" <b>domain.</b> <b>Factors</b> related to overall need and each unmet domain were identified.
