50|$|Two basic {{configurations}} are {{in common}} use: Those {{with a soft}} elastomer skirt which seals around {{the periphery of the}} face, and those with a rigid frame supporting the other components, which is sealed to the face by a soft <b>foam</b> <b>ring</b> which is clamped to the frame by a metal band, to which the straps are secured.|$|E
50|$|To reach higher altitudes, a {{pressurized}} cockpit {{was added}} to the H models. The canopy was sealed via a circular tube filled with rubber foam which was inflated by a compressed air bottle, while the engine compartment was also sealed from the cockpit with a rubber <b>foam</b> <b>ring.</b> A Knorr 300/10 air compressor provided the pressure, maintaining the cockpit at 0.36 atmospheres (5.29 psi) above 8,000 m (26,250 ft). To prevent fogging, the windscreen was of a double-glazed style with a 6 mm (.236 in) thick outer pane and a 3 mm (.118 in) inner pane with a 6 mm (.24 in) gap. The gap was fitted with several silica gel capsules to absorb any moisture forming between the panes. The cockpit was not pressurized in the C models.|$|E
50|$|The RingMute is a {{dampening}} ring (Patent US 7049501 B2) that {{attaches to the}} bell rim of a standard Bb trumpet. Since the mute {{is attached to the}} outside of the trumpet and is not placed inside the trumpet, it is known as an external mute. The construction consists of a lightweight urethane <b>foam</b> <b>ring</b> held in place by an adhesive strip. The distinctive round shape of the RingMute is maintained over time by a cardboard (or similar material) round mold that is placed inside the {{dampening ring}} where the bell rim would normally go. The purpose of the RingMute is twofold:1)According to the University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia, the highest overtones that typically give the trumpet its brassy sound, are emitted at the bell rim.(Brass Acoustics: An Introduction(newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html). The absorbent foam dampening ring is attached to the bell rim of a Bb trumpet and assists in diminishing the higher overtones. This is helpful when performing in small areas where the sound of a trumpet can be overbearing but the performer wishes to maintain an open trumpet sound. 2)The other use of the RingMute is when practicing in apartments or close areas where the sound can be disturbing to others. An interesting feature that the RingMute possesses that many mutes do not is that intonation is basically unaltered. With almost all internal mutes such as Harmon, Straight, Cup, Renuzit, etc. that are fitted into the trumpet, the main tuning slide must be extended from its normal setting in order to be in tune. This adjustment is due to the opening of the trumpet bell being plugged. The RingMute Dampening Ring (by virtue of being an external mute and fitted onto the trumpet)requires no altering of the main tuning slide.|$|E
40|$|HIV is a {{pandemic}} which has continually posed {{challenges to the}} scientific society in large and to medical fraternity in particular in terms of treatment as well as prevention. The treatment is lifelong suppressive than curative; hence the importance {{has always been to}} prevention strategies. The strategies like abstinence, monogamy and consistent condom use have various societal and behavioural issues and HIV vaccine is still not at the horizon. In such a scenario, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and microbicides have emerged as newer options of prevention. Microbicides are referred to as topical PrEP. They are compounds that can be applied inside the vagina or rectum to protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. Microbicides can be vaginal and rectal and can be formulated as gels, <b>foams,</b> <b>rings,</b> hydrogels, silicone elastomer gels, diaphragm, quick-dissolve polyvinyl alcohol based films, and bioadhesive vaginal tablets. The microbicides have been divided into various categories based on where they disrupt the pathway of sexual transmission of HIV. The article highlights the classes of microbicides and various trials conducted on them. It also enumerates various approaches in pipeline like antimicrobial peptides, aptamers, flavonoids, small interfering RNAs and DNAs, and bioengineered lactic acid bacilli...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedReissued 10 Jan 2017 with corrected degree. Aerial videos {{of the surf}} zone at Sand City, Monterey Bay, CA, were acquired using an unmanned aerial vehicle. Videos of 26 individual bores were converted to still images and were georectified, georeferenced, and post processed. The size, shape, and evolution of the wave generated foam patterns within the surf zone were analyzed. The results were tested against two existing hypotheses of foam pattern generation, Obliquely Descending Eddies (ODEs) and self-organization due to bubble rise. Three foam regions within the surf zone were recognized. The largest region, the foam mat, encompasses nearly the entire surf zone and {{is described as a}} mat of foam that develops obvious foam holes. The areas of the holes grew in area and elongated with time. The results were inconsistent with the two theories of foam hole generation. The fringe region is the most seaward foam region and is marked with circular <b>foam</b> <b>rings</b> that become larger in area and more distinct with time. The fringe region data are contrary to observations of ODEs but is consistent with the theory of self-organization due to bubble rise. The gap region, located between the plunge point and the splash up created by the bore collapse, is marked by horizontal foam tubes oriented in the cross-shore direction. The foam tubes are likely created in the convergent region between two counter-rotating vortices. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{application}} of a cervical collar (C-collar) in trauma patients can be life-saving. Previous studies, however, describe development of pressure ulcers related to C-collars. Objective: To retrospectively compare collar-related pressure ulcers (CRPUs) occurring in trauma patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} wearing a C-collar before and after implementation of preventive interventions and to identify risk factors for CRPU development. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 88 trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit before (2006) and after (2008) implementation of preventive interventions; early C-collar removal (< 24 hours) and an occipital <b>foam</b> <b>ring.</b> Data were collected in the first 14 days of admission on pressure ulcer incidence, risk factors, and preventive interventions. Results: The incidence of CRPUs was 1. 1 %. Although risk factors were present in the sample, it was impossible to identify significant risk factors for CRPU development and explore the effect of preventive interventions. Conclusion: The incidence of CRPUs in this study was low. CRPUs, however, should never be accepted as an inevitable complication of cervical immobilization. To identify trauma patients at risk and to apply effective preventive interventions for CRPU development, further research is needed...|$|E
40|$|An {{instrumentation}} system for direct {{measurement of the}} thermal conductivity of {{a small sample of}} a highly insulating material has been devised. As used here, (1) "small" signifies having dimensions of the order of two centimeters - significantly less than the sizes of specimens for which prior devices for direct measurement of thermal conductivity have been designed; and (2) "highly insulating" signifies having thermal conductivity of the order of that of air. The heart of the system is an assembly that includes two copper disks - one electrically heated, the other cooled with chilled water. The disks are separated by a guard ring made of strong, thermally insulating polymethacrylamide foam. The sample fits between the copper disks and within the ring (see figure). Matched thermocouples are used to measure the temperatures of the heated and cooled disks. The heated and cooled disks are affixed to larger foam disks, and the essentially still air in the gap between the larger disks insulates the sides of the specimen. This air gap region can be further divided by extending the <b>foam</b> <b>ring</b> into the gap region. The entire assembly as described thus far is lightly clamped together by means of nylon threaded rods and is placed inside a cylindrical chamber wherein the temperature is maintained at a set value (typically, 25 C) ...|$|E
25|$|The cone {{surround}} can be rubber or polyester <b>foam,</b> or a <b>ring</b> of corrugated, resin coated fabric; it {{is attached}} to both the outer diaphragm circumference and to the frame. These diverse surround materials, their shape and treatment can dramatically affect the acoustic output of a driver; each implementation having advantages and disadvantages. Polyester foam, for example, is lightweight and economical, though usually leaking air to some degree, but is degraded by exposure to ozone, UV light, humidity and elevated temperatures, significantly limiting useful life with adequate performance.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} mutes {{have been used}} on brass instruments, most of which either squeeze inside the bell of the instrument, or are hung or clipped {{to the outside of}} the bell. The most common type is the {{straight}} mute, a hollow, cone-shaped mute that fits into the bell of the instrument. The second most common brass mute is the cup mute. There are a range of other mutes for brass, such as the solotone mute, the buzz-wah mute, the Wah-wah mute, bucket mutes, and hats or plungers. Muting woodwind instruments is very uncommon. Saxophone mutes which are usually made of a soft material, which is placed in the bell to soften the tone. Percussion instruments often require no specialist mutes. The triangle is muted by simply gripping the instrument with the hand, stopping it from vibrating so much. Drums may require muting if they [...] "ring" [...] too much with cloth, gaffer tape or special rubber or <b>foam</b> rubber <b>rings.</b> The soft pedal of the piano can be seen as having the effect of a mute. It used to be common for pianos to be fitted with another kind of mute — a piece of felt or similar material which would sit between the hammers and the strings. This results in a very muffled and much quieter sound. It was not used in any serious context, but was useful for reducing the volume of the instrument when practicing and was often termed a [...] "Practice Pedal". Few pianos, apart from some uprights, have this device today.|$|R
