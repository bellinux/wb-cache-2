When we did I heard them saying to each other, 'Well, I thought we would come down overboard, in a lump--sticks and all--blame me if I didn't.' 'That's what I was thinking to myself,' would answer wearily another battered and bandaged scarecrow. And, mind, these were men without the <b>drilled-in</b> habit of obedience. To an onlooker they {{would be a lot}} of profane scallywags without a redeeming point. What made them do it--what made them obey me when I, thinking consciously how fine it was, made them drop the bunt of the foresail twice to try and do it better? What? They had no professional reputation--no examples, no praise. It wasn't a sense of duty; they all knew well enough how to shirk, and laze, and dodge--when they had a mind to it--and mostly they had. Was it the two pounds ten a month that sent them there? They didn't think their pay half good enough. No; it was something in them, something inborn and subtle and everlasting. I don't say positively that the crew of a French or German merchantman wouldn't have done it, but I doubt whether it would have been done in the same way. There was a completeness in it, something solid like a principle, and masterful like an instinct--a disclosure of something secret--of that hidden something, that gift, of good or evil that makes racial difference, that shapes the fate of nations.|$|E
60|$|The {{front part}} {{of the room was}} well filled, rows of {{listeners}} showing themselves like a <b>drilled-in</b> crop of which not a seed has failed. They were listeners of the right sort, a majority having noses of the prominent and dignified type, which when viewed in oblique perspective ranged as regularly as bow-windows at a watering place. Ethelberta's plan was to tell her pretended history and adventures while sitting in a chair--as if she were at her own fireside, surrounded by a circle of friends. By this touch of domesticity a great appearance of truth and naturalness was given, though really the attitude was at first more difficult to maintain satisfactorily than any one wherein stricter formality should be observed. She gently began her subject, as if scarcely knowing whether a throng were near her or not, and, in her fear of seeming artificial, spoke too low. This defect, however, she soon corrected, and ultimately went on in a charmingly colloquial manner. What Ethelberta relied upon soon became evident. It was not upon the intrinsic merits of her story as a piece of construction, but upon her method of telling it. Whatever defects the tale possessed--and they were not a few--it had, as delivered by her, the one pre-eminent merit of seeming like truth. A modern critic has well observed of De Foe that he had the most amazing talent on record for telling lies; and Ethelberta, in wishing her fiction to appear like a real narrative of personal adventure, did wisely to make De Foe her model. His is a style even better adapted for speaking than for writing, and the peculiarities of diction which he adopts to give verisimilitude to his narratives acquired enormous additional force when exhibited as viva-voce mannerisms. And although these artifices were not, perhaps, slavishly copied from that master of feigning, they would undoubtedly have reminded her hearers of him, had they not mostly been drawn from an easeful section in society which is especially characterized by the mental condition of knowing nothing about any author a week after they have read him. The few there who did remember De Foe were impressed by a fancy that his words greeted them anew in a winged auricular form, instead of by the weaker channels of print and eyesight. The reader may imagine what an effect this well- studied method must have produced when intensified by a clear, living voice, animated action, and the brilliant and expressive eye of a handsome woman--attributes which of themselves almost compelled belief. When she reached the most telling passages, instead of adding exaggerated action and sound, Ethelberta would lapse to a whisper and a sustained stillness, which were more striking than gesticulation. All that could be done by art was there, and if inspiration was wanting nobody missed it.|$|E
5000|$|For this reason, argues Maghen,"genuine {{anger and}} hatred, {{of the kind}} that is really “meant” and {{strongly}} felt, are inefficient tools for creating or sustaining an atmosphere conducive to long-term persecution or mass murder." [...] This is why, he argues, the most gruesome tragedies in history—enslavements, inquisitions, terrorisms, genocides—have been 'perpetrated not in hot blood but in cold: not as a result of urgent and immanent feeling but {{in the name of a}} transcendent ideology and as a result of painstaking indoctrination." [...] Maghen reminds us of the holocaust, in which the majority of Germans in World War II did not passionately hate Jews. In fact, most had never even met the people they were butchering in mass. The murder of six million Jews was made possible not by an intensive hatred by a <b>drilled-in</b> ideology of mindless hate.|$|E
40|$|In the UK {{and other}} {{countries}} roadside masonry parapet walls are commonplace. Such walls were, however, generally not designed from the outset to resist out-of-plane impact loadings from highway vehicles. The consequences of an impact can obviously be severe, {{particularly in the case}} of railway overbridges. Following a programme of experimental impact tests performed in the 1990 s on unreinforced masonry walls, this paper describes an investigation of the performance of reinforced masonry walls, tested under carefully controlled conditions in the laboratory. A total of 17 tests were performed on unreinforced and reinforced walls. The reinforced walls incorporated either bed joint reinforcement or one of two different types of <b>drilled-in</b> reinforcement. Whereas the bed-joint reinforcement was found to be largely ineffectual, the <b>drilled-in</b> reinforcing systems were found to be capable of enhancing the ability of plain masonry walls to resist impacts, ensuring a ductile response to the applied transient loading. The effect of <b>drilled-in</b> reinforcement on the resistance of walls with low-strength mortar was found to be particularly dramatic, changing the response from that of penetration and disintegration of the masonry to ductile behaviour, with the integrity of the wall maintained and only minimal wall displacement.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{investigations and}} theoretical models, tafoni weathering {{is still not}} fully understood largely because of limited data available on temperature, moisture and salt regimes. We investigated tafoni developed in granite in the Tafraoute region, Morocco, through an exploratory, two-week multi-method field campaign. Temperatures were measured with iButtons and by means of infrared thermography; moisture distribution and progress were captured with handheld moisture sensors and with <b>drilled-in</b> iButtons. Salts were analysed in drill dust samples from different positions and rock depths. The results derived from very different techniques mutually support one another. Salts and moisture are concentrated near {{the base of the}} investigated tafoni, probably due to a saturated pore water body around the base of rock tors. Salts are accumulated close to the rock surface in tafoni, but not on the surrounding rock surfaces. A clear correlation was found between moisture and salt contents. Within a tafone, areas of higher humidity also display increased salt concentration near the surface. The temperature/humidity records allied with ionic analyses suggest that sodium sulfate dominates and is likely to undergo frequent phase changes from thenardite to mirabilite and vice versa. Two pathways of salt transport in and around tafoni are assumed based on the data: infiltration with rainfall on the top and around tors and boulders, and capillary rise from saturated pore water bodies to the surface. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hydrothermal {{circulation}} plays {{a fundamental}} {{role in the}} chemical transfer from deep in the Earth’s interior to the ocean crust, the oceans and the atmosphere. It is also on of the principal mechanisms for heat transfer from the mantle to the oceans, atmosphere and ultimately, outer space. This process fundamentally influences the composition of the ocean crust during formation and aging as it spreads away from the ridge axis. However, despite much research into hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust questions still remain including: the thermal and chemical evolution of hydrothermal fluids, the geometry of hydrothermal fluid flow, and the factors that control {{the nature and extent of}} hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust. In this study, whole rock and secondary mineral characteristics of <b>drilled-in</b> situ ocean crust are used to (i) Characterise hydrothermal alteration for a range of drilled, in-situ fast spread ocean crust sites (ii) assess the factors that control hydrothermal alteration within fast spread ocean crust and (iii) assess the evolution and architecture of hydrothermal fluid. Deep Sea Drilling Project, Ocean Drilling Program, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites 504, 896, 843, 1179, 1149, 1224, 1243 and 1256 represent some the most significant penetrations into the upper portion of intermediate and fast spread crust to date. Analyses of whole rock chemical changes, Sr, O. C and S isotope systematics, petrographic observations and analysis of secondary minerals indicate that all sites underwent variable degrees of cold seawater dominated hydrothermal alteration. All these sites represent variations in the composition of the upper crust, basement topography, sedimentation rates, spreading rates, capping rocks, and age. Comparisons between these factors and style and intensity of alteration for each site indicate that spreading rate and age exherts the strongest influence on hydrothermal activity. Sites 1256 and 504 are the only sites in which both low temperature and high temperature alteration are recovered, both sites now have complete chemical and isotopic records which trace the evolution of hydrothermal fluid through the crust. Chemical and isotopic analyses of anhydrite within the ocean crust and consideration of the sulfur budget at these sites imply that the majority of hydrothermal fluid is heated to moderate temperatures (~ 250 oC) and returns to the oceans as warm diffuse fluids at unaccounted for venting sites.
