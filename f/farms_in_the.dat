5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E
5|$|Before 1950, Gulfton {{consisted}} of farm land {{and much of}} the area belonged to Westmoreland <b>Farms.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-1950s, the Shenandoah subdivision was established; consisting of sixteen city blocks of ranch-style homes. Shenandoah was located adjacent to the land which would later become the site of the Gulfton apartment complexes. Decades later these communities would clash as the apartments surrounding Shenandoah deteriorated and property values became threatened.|$|E

5|$|Instead, {{these factors}} {{resulted}} in distinctive traditions in Norwegian vernacular architecture, {{which have been}} preserved in existing <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> many Norwegian open-air museums that showcase buildings from the Middle Ages through to the 19th century; prominent examples include the Norsk Folkemuseum in Oslo and Maihaugen in Lillehammer, as well as extant buildings still in service on farms {{such as those in}} the Heidal valley.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, {{residents}} lost {{significant amounts of}} income in the storm-affected areas, particularly <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year after the storm. Higher food prices also resulted in less income for other residents. The area's economy largely recovered to pre-flood levels by 2010.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, {{away from the}} polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Domestic mammals form a {{large part}} of the {{livestock}} raised for meat across the world. They include (2011) around 1.4 billion cattle, 1.2 billion sheep, 1 billion domestic pigs, and (1985) over 700 million rabbits. Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas.

5|$|During the 13th century, {{agricultural}} land {{around the town}} was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater, land at Watendlath, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale. Keswick was at {{the hub of the}} monastic <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants paid their rents. Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was born}} in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born {{in the back of}} his father's tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his profits to buy <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.|$|E
5|$|In 1549 a {{grammar school}} was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first {{lighthouse}} was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked {{off the coast}} of Skagen. In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away. In 1595, 25 <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area were covered in drifting sand. As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.|$|E

In 1951–52 the Ministry of Defence and the Central Ordnance Depot had a new housing estate of some 200 houses built in the village. The Government bought a significant area of land {{from most of the}} <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parish. There are three types of house, all designed by the architect R.

5|$|Malvern's rapid {{urbanisation}} {{during the}} latter half of the 19th century spread eastwards and northwards from Great Malvern, the traditional town centre on the steep flank of the Worcestershire Beacon, and engulfed the manors and <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate area. It was often the farms, such as Pickersleigh (now known as Pickersleigh Court and previously known as Pickersleigh House), near Great Malvern, and the Howsells in Malvern Link which merged with Great Malvern in 1900 that gave their names to many of the new neighbourhoods. The urban agglomeration continued to spread, and by the middle of the 20th century had reached the suburban parishes of West Malvern, Malvern Wells, Newland, Madresfield, and Guarlford.|$|E
5|$|Many {{farmers in}} central Washington build dams on their {{property}} for irrigation and to control frost on their crops. The Washington Department of Ecology, using new techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated there may {{be as many as}} a hundred such dams in the area, most of which are illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.|$|E

By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye.

5|$|The major {{agricultural}} products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water {{have reduced the}} productive capacity of <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing.
