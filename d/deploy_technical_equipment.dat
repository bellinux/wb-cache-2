40|$|The {{deployment}} of technical building management services {{is a requirement}} to further reduce energy demand of future and existing buildings. Automating the process of configuring and <b>deploying</b> <b>technical</b> building management services such as fault detection and diagnosis of <b>technical</b> <b>equipment</b> {{seems to be a}} promising path to intensify the adoption of these services. In this work we present a data processing and analytics execution platform which allows the {{deployment of}} ontology-based, automated technical building management services on a large-scale. We present the platform architecture and results from a reference implementation performing rule-based fault detection on offline air handling unit data...|$|R

50|$|The {{permanent}} {{staff of the}} Agency {{will be more than}} doubled between 2015 and 2020. The new proposal provides for a reserve of European border guards and <b>technical</b> <b>equipment.</b> The Agency will be able to purchase its own equipment (this is not a novelty). However - and this is new - the Member States where this equipment is registered (this refers mainly to big equipment items such as patrol vessels, air crafts, etc. which need a flag of state) will be obliged to put it at the Agency's disposal whenever needed. this will make it possible for the Agency to rapidly <b>deploy</b> the necessary <b>technical</b> in border operations. A rapid reserve pool of border guards and a <b>technical</b> <b>equipment</b> pool will be put at the disposal of the agency, intending to remove the shortages of staff and equipment for the Agency's operations.|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the incidence of <b>technical</b> <b>equipment</b> problems during lap-aroscopic procedures. Methods: A video-capturing system was used, consisting of an analog video recorder with three camera image inputs and a microphone. Problems with all <b>technical</b> <b>equipment</b> used by the surgical team, such as the insufflator, diathermy apparatus, monitors, light source, camera and camera unit, endoscope, suction devices, and instruments, were registered. Results: In total, 30 procedures were randomly video-taped. In 87 % (26 / 30) of the procedures, one or more incidents with <b>technical</b> <b>equipment</b> (49 incidents) or instruments (9 incidents) occurred. In 22 of those inci-dents (45 %) the <b>technical</b> <b>equipment</b> was not correctly positioned or not present at all; in the other 27 (55 %), the equipment malfunctioned {{as a result of a}} faulty connection (9), a defect (5), or the wrong setting of the equipment (3). In 10 (20 %) cases the exact cause of equipment malfunctioning was unclear. Conclusions: The incidence of problems with laparo-scopic <b>technical</b> <b>equipment</b> is high. To prevent such problems, improvement and standardization of equip-ment is needed, combined with the incorporation of checklist use before the start of a surgical procedure. Future research should be aimed at development, implementation, and evaluation of these measures into the operating room...|$|R
