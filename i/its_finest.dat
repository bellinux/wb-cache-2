25|$|The {{buildings}} and architecture of Ancient Rome were impressive even by modern standards. The Circus Maximus, for example, was {{large enough to}} be used as a stadium.

25|$|Unlike most Southern cities, Postbellum {{life for}} Augusta was very prosperous. By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Augusta had become one of the largest inland cotton markets in the world. A new military cantonment, named Camp Hancock, opened nearby during World War I. In 1916 a large fire destroyed over 700 buildings in the city including many of <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> residences.|$|E

In 1986 {{production}} of the GTV6 ceased and Alfa Romeo turned its Group A racing and rallying efforts to the 75/Milano saloons, which were based on the same rear transaxle chassis. However, 1986 also saw the GTV6 post one of <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> rallying victories when Yves Loubet's example won the Group A in the tragic 1986 Tour de Corse and placed 3rd overall among the monstrously powerful four-wheel-drive Group B cars.|$|E
25|$|His works having {{fallen out}} of print, Hazlitt {{underwent}} a small decline, though in the late 1990s his reputation was reasserted by admirers and his works reprinted. Two major works then appeared,The Day-Star of Liberty: William Hazlitt's Radical Style by Tom Paulin in 1998 and Quarrel of the Age: The Life and Times of William Hazlitt by A. C. Grayling in 2000. Hazlitt's reputation has continued to rise, and now many contemporary thinkers, poets, and scholars consider {{him one of the}} greatest critics in the English language, and <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> essayist.|$|E

25|$|The 1,600-year-old Sigiriya frescoes are {{an example}} of ancient Sri Lankan art at <b>its</b> <b>finest.</b> They {{are one of the}} best {{preserved}} examples of ancient urban planning in the world. They have been declared by UNESCO as one of the seven World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka. Among other structures, large reservoirs, important for conserving water in a climate with rainy and dry seasons, and elaborate aqueducts, some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile, are most notable. Biso Kotuwa, a peculiar construction inside a dam, is a technological marvel based on precise mathematics that allows water to flow outside the dam, keeping pressure on the dam to a minimum.|$|E
25|$|MCC {{decided to}} commemorate Grace's {{life and career}} with a Memorial Biography, {{published}} in 1919. Its preface begins with this passage:Never was such a band of cricketers gathered for any tour as has assembled to do honour to {{the greatest of all}} players in the present Memorial Biography. That such a volume should go forth {{under the auspices of the}} Committee of MCC is in itself unique in the history of the game, and that such an array of cricketers, critics and enthusiasts should pay tribute to <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> exponent has no parallel in any other branch of sport. In itself this presents a noble monument of what W. G. Grace was, a testimony to his prowess and to his personality.|$|E
25|$|Ostrogothic Ravenna {{refers to}} the time period in which Ravenna was {{the capital of the}} Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy. Ravenna is a city in Northeastern Italy that served as the capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom which existed between 493 and 553 CE. During that time Ravenna saw a great renovation, in {{particular}} under Theodoric the Great (454–526). During his rule Ravenna saw many of <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> monuments constructed or renovated including the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, the Palace of Theoderic and Mausoleum of Theodoric. Many of these monuments reflected Theodoric's, as well as the Goths as a people, religion of Arian Christianity. Though an Arian Christian himself, Theodoric's rule was a time of religious tolerance in the city of Ravenna. His religious tolerance extended also to forging a balance between the Romans and Goths in Ravenna. Theodoric attempted to model Ravenna as a capital equivalent to that of Rome or Constantinople and as such was a defender of classical antiquity in a western world that saw much of its classical heritage disappearing.|$|E

500|$|Referring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journal—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored {{his work}} in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers: [...] "His Iron Man is {{certainly}} a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> expression in self-irony."

500|$|The {{film was}} first shown at Loew's State Theater in New York City on July 2, 1958. [...] During the opening week, it ranked number five in box office {{earnings}} on the Variety national survey. Billboard wrote: [...] "Elvis Presley's new film shapes up as a box-office winner. It's {{got plenty of}} action and characterisation and the star gives his best acting performance to date ... (the) Incidents and characters of the original novel are distorted, but the plot stands up well and the dialog is salty and emotion-packed. As Danny, Presley exhibits improved histrionics and provides many moving and tense moments. Carolyn Jones is a knockout as a fallen thrush {{who would like to}} love him; their aborted romance gives the pic <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} a {{biography}} for a tree was well received. The writing was called engaging, lyrical, and compelling. Robert Wiersema wrote, [...] "Tree is science writing at <b>its</b> <b>finest.</b> It's sweeping but focused, {{keenly aware of}} both the minutiae and the big picture. ...Although some of the concepts are complex, the writing is always accessible... Scientific matters are explained in layman's terms, and the text never bogs down or bottlenecks." [...] However, some reviewers found the language too technical. In the Montreal Gazette, Bronwyn Chester wrote that the scientific language [...] "dilut our feeling and concern for this tree through too much information". Robert Bateman's black and white illustrations, while skilled, were said to add little to the narrative.|$|E

500|$|Nicholas de Jongh, in {{a tribute}} written after Le Mesurier's death, {{suggested}} {{that it was in}} the role of Wilson that Le Mesurier became a star. His interaction with Arthur Lowe's character Captain George Mainwaring was described by The Times as [...] "a memorable part of one of television's most popular shows". Tise Vahimagi, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, agreed, and commented that [...] "it was the hesitant exchanges of one-upmanship between Le Mesurier's Wilson, a figure of delicate gentility, and Arthur Lowe's pompous, middle class platoon leader Captain Mainwaring, that added to <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> moments". Le Mesurier enjoyed making the series, particularly the fortnight the cast would spend in Thetford each year filming the outside scenes. The programme lasted for nine series over nine years, and covered eighty episodes, ending in 1977.|$|E
500|$|In April 2009, {{three months}} after the Bushes left office, Martha Gore wrote an op-ed piece titled, [...] "Laura Bush: A First Lady who made America proud," [...] where she {{positively}} assessed Bush's role as First Lady and expressed Bush's successes were rooted in the dignity she brought to the office despite her reserved style as well as her making a good role model for young women and representing American womanhood at <b>its</b> <b>finest.</b> Gore concluded, [...] "Now that Ms. Bush has returned to private life, she will continue to be remembered as a First Lady who did America proud." [...] A 2014 poll which asked who was the most popular First Lady in the past 25 years found Bush ranked in fourth place (out of 4 candidates), behind Hillary Clinton, mother-in-law Barbara and direct successor Michelle Obama.|$|E
500|$|Far Side Virtual {{appeared}} on several [...] "best of 2011" [...] lists and features. In Tiny Mix Tapes' end-of-year wrap-up column on nostalgia in pop music, Jonathan Dean wrote, [...] "You {{may want to}} throw Far Side Virtual against a wall upon hearing its relentlessly arch, kitschy blandness, but it manages to successfully turn pop against itself, which, like it or not, is a politically progressive project. Its pure, bold conceptualism stood out in a year that was dominated by the 'febrile sterility' of post-internet microgenres and tail-swallowing postmodernism." [...] Music critic Jonah Weiner cited Far Side Virtual for his end-of-year article on contemporary protest songs, and called it [...] "antagonizingly, alienatingly, wondrously bland." [...] Fact named Hippos in Tanks the best label of the year, listing the signing of Ferraro and subsequent release of Far Side Virtual as one of <b>its</b> <b>finest</b> accomplishments.|$|E
