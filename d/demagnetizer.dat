30|$|Before {{demagnetization}} {{experiments were}} carried out, low-field magnetic susceptibility (volumetric) and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements {{were performed on}} all specimens using a KLY- 3 Kappabridge susceptibility meter (AGICO, Czech Republic). The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was measured using an RF-SQUID Cryogenic magnetometer model 750 R (2 G Enterprises, USA). Progressive alternating field demagnetization (AFD) with a static 3 -axis was performed in 5  mT increments up to 60  mT using a separate AF <b>demagnetizer</b> (DEM- 8601 C, Natsuhara-Giken, Japan), and progressive thermal demagnetization (THD) was performed in 50  °C increments up to 600  °C in air using a thermal <b>demagnetizer</b> (TD- 48, ASC Scientific, USA). The measurements were performed at Ibaraki University, Japan. To deduce relative paleointensity, progressive AFD must be employed as the main demagnetization technique because after the demagnetization of the NRMs, the same specimen is repeatedly used for the acquisition of artificial remanent magnetizations to estimate relative paleointensities. The results of the progressive AFD and THD were displayed using an orthogonal vector diagram (Zijderveld 1967). Characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions were determined by principal component analysis (Kirschvink 1980) using more than five vector endpoints.|$|E

The samples {{were taken from the}} gouge that seemed to have not experienced high-temperature conditions during friction. Seven fragment samples were demagnetized at 100  mT using an alternating field (AF) <b>demagnetizer</b> (DEM- 93; Natsuhara Giken, Osaka, Japan), and five of the seven were then placed in a direct current (DC) magnetic field of 100  μT thermal <b>demagnetizer</b> (TDF- 98; Natsuhara Giken) and heated stepwise in a quartz glass tube with a low-oxygen state close to a vacuum (0.4  mbar, similar to conditions at 3  km depth). The heating steps were 100, 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600  °C, and after each remanent, magnetization of the samples was measured using a fluxgate spinner magnetometer with a sensitivity of 5  ×  10 − 6  mAm 2 (ASPIN; Natsuhara Giken).|$|E
30|$|For the {{remanent}} magnetization measurements, stepwise AF demagnetizations, and the impartment of ARMs, we used {{an automated}} spinner magnetometer with an AF <b>demagnetizer</b> (DSPIN, Natsuhara Giken). The demagnetizations were conducted up to 180 mT, with the steps at 2 -mT intervals up to 30 mT, at 5 -mT intervals up to 100 mT, and 10 -mT intervals up to 180 mT. ARMs were imparted using a DC bias field of 50 μT with a peak AF of 180 mT, by setting the bias field direction approximately {{parallel to the}} NRM and laboratory TRM directions. LTD was conducted such that specimens were soaked in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and subsequently left {{at room temperature for}} 30 min in a zero field. For the impartment of TRMs, we used a thermal <b>demagnetizer</b> equipped with a DC field coil (TDS- 1, Natsuhara Giken). The specimens were heated to 610 °C in a vacuum (1 to 10 Pa) with the hold time of 10 (TRM 1) and 20 (TRM 2) min at that temperature and subsequently cooled down to room temperature for approximately 2 h in a 40 -μT DC field throughout this process.|$|E

Whenever possible, we avoided rheomorphic ignimbrites {{as they might}} compromise reliable remanence record. Fifty-four oriented samples were taken from six sites by in situ drilling. These sites are distributed {{in the western part}} of the study area where slopes are relatively gentle. In 24 sites where drilling was inapplicable due to high topography and steep slopes along the mountain side, oriented block samples were collected. Six to ten 2.5 -cm cylindrical specimens of each sample were alternating-field (AF) demagnetized in 12 steps to 90 mT using a Molspin AF <b>demagnetizer</b> (ASC Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). In addition, other specimens were thermally demagnetized, usually in 50 °C steps to 500 °C and then in smaller steps to 700 °C using a non-inductive thermal <b>demagnetizer</b> (ASC Scientific Model TD- 48, ASC Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Optimum demagnetization step to calculate a mean remanence direction was defined as that producing the minimum dispersion in direction.

30|$|To orient {{the samples}} to {{geographic}} coordinates, we used paleomagnetic directions. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurements with stepwise alternating field (AF) demagnetization were performed using a cryogenic magnetometer system with an in-line static AF <b>demagnetizer</b> (2 G Enterprises model 760, Applied Physics Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) in a magnetically shielded room of GSJ, AIST.

A composite of IRMs were imparted along three orthogonal axes of a sample with strong (2.4 T), moderate (0.4 T), and weak (0.12 T) magnetic fields, respectively (Lowrie, 1990).

Here, we describe a graphics-based program for controlling a fully automatic system combining a spinner magnetometer and a thermal <b>demagnetizer,</b> and for acquiring and processing the magnetization data. A single fluxgate sensor, which can measure the vector magnetization by spinning and translating a standard-sized 1 -in. specimen, was calibrated with a rotatable reference specimen that can make the magnetization parallel or perpendicular to the spinning axis. By placing a cooling chamber between the furnace and the sensor for the updated system, the specimen can be heated up more efficiently to ensure an identical thermal history for the double heatings of the Thellier method. The direction of the vector magnetization was precisely obtained as well as the intensity, the results being comparable with those from an ordinary spinner magnetometer.
