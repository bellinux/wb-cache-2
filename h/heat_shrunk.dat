50|$|Another Out of {{autoclave}} {{method for}} achieving external compression on prepreg based composite parts {{is through the}} use of <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape. This method, however, does not achieve the high quality of RTM or autoclave processes because without the autoclave or a closed mold, the part must be cured in a non-pressurized oven. These compression tapes are typically made from polyester (PET) film. <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape is applied to a composite part prior to the heating, or curing cycle. When heated, the tape will shrink in the linear (machine direction). <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape works best on parts that are cylindrical or semi-circular in cross section, as this allows the tape to exert even compaction forces on the part surface. Examples would be composite tubes for aerospace, wind energy, consumer sporting goods, etc. <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape allows these parts to be processed without the need to cure with the heat and pressure of an autoclave.|$|R

The test media {{is sold in}} a tubing glass bottle which may break if dropped or weakened in shipment to the laboratory.

In many cases, the delivery rollers (upper and lower) in the upper or final stage of the paper exit are worn or unserviceable.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tubing {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tubing prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R

Travelling wave wall used for Micro Air Vehicle flow control is studied {{to find out}} its drag reduction effect. Aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil with and without a streamwise travelling wave on its surface are calculated. The interrelationship is also analyzed among lift, drag and ratio of motion phase speed to the external flow velocity. The flexible airfoil that can generate streamwise travelling waves is realized via electromagnetic coil actuation. Thirty-six coils are placed streamwisely under <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> film and magnets producing magnetic field are placed under coils. Every single coil is controlled by current to move vertically in harmonic motion with 30 degrees phase difference between adjacent ones. So <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> film is actuated, and streamwise travelling wave is generated. Meanwhile, a prototype is designed and tested in wind tunnel.
