5|$|Kappa Pyxidis was catalogued but {{not given}} a Bayer {{designation}} by Lacaille, however Gould felt the star was {{bright enough to}} warrant a letter. Kappa has a magnitude of 4.62 and is 560 ± 50 light-years distant. An orange <b>giant</b> <b>of</b> spectral type K4/K5III, Kappa has a luminosity approximately 965 {{times that of the}} Sun.

5|$|North of Sirius lie Theta and Mu Canis Majoris, Theta {{being the}} most northerly star with a Bayer {{designation}} in the constellation.

5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red <b>giant</b> <b>of</b> {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red <b>giant</b> <b>of</b> spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian mythographer Karl Kerényi, one of {{the founders}} of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in Gods of the Greeks (1951).

Kerényi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his {{stepmother}} and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of Aegypius and Oedipus.|$|E

Delta2 is a red <b>giant</b> <b>of</b> spectral type M4.5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.2, located 325 light-years from Earth. It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of our sun. Mu Gruis, composed of Mu1 and Mu2, is also an optical double—both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. Mu1 is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4.8 located around 275 light-years from Earth, while Mu2 the dimmer at magnitude 5.11 lies 265 light-years distant from Earth. Pi Gruis, an optical double with a variable component, is composed of Pi1 Gruis and Pi2.

One of the brightest S-class stars to Earth viewers, it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 with sunlike properties, being a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. The pair make up a likely binary system. Pi2 is a giant star of spectral type F3III-IV located around 130 light-years from Earth, and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5.6.

5|$|Zeta Coronae Australis is {{a rapidly}} {{rotating}} main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4.8, 221.7 light years from Earth.

5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} <b>giant</b> <b>of</b> {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 {{light years away}} from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8.

5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red <b>giant</b> <b>of</b> up to 2.25 , {{the mass of}} the helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E
