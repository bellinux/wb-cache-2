40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of long-run relationships among <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> {{of the three major}} currency futures, namely Duetsche Mark, Japanese Yen and British Pound, in the currency futures market of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. Tests of cointegration and vector autoregressive relationships among the variables are conducted. The stationarity property of each series is tested using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, from which it is found that each of the series is non-stationary. A cointegrating relationship among <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> is examined for the underlying long-run economic relationships. Cointegration tests and vector autoregressive models of the rates of return were unable to establish any long-run relationships among the variables. Thus, there is no empirical evidence, in general, indicating that long-run relationships exist among the <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> for individual currency futures in Singapore...|$|R

In {{comparison with the}} past, much more attention and researches are dedicated to forecasting methods also at the universities. In the following text we will present possibility of forecasting time series of <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> of chosen metals at the London Metal Exchange (LME), using extrapolation of time series. More specifically, we will forecast monthly averages of cash seller and <b>settlement</b> <b>price</b> of chosen metals (Tin, Aluminum, Copper and Zink) using exponential smoothing method. This method belongs to classic mathematical / statistical methods of forecasting, named also quantitative methods - based on technical analysis. To examine the mentioned method, we performed an empirical experiment using real data of LME. We used average monthly cash seller and <b>settlement</b> <b>prices</b> of chosen metals, in period from January 1990 till June 2006.

Data, from which the forecasting model of exponential smoothing was outgoing, was always from January 1990, till quarter from which the model carried out a forecast on next 6 months. Forecasts achieved by this process were compared with real prices from LME, available in time of experiment realization. For the success measurement of each forecast were calculated forecast errors - M. E. (mean error), M. S. E. (mean squared error), M. A. E. (mean absolute error), M. A. P. E.

40|$|Towards an European {{integrated}} financial market: {{the impact}} of the settlement platform T 2 S The European Central Bank (ECB) will offer to banks in 2015 an european shared platform for securities settlement, named TARGET 2 Securities (T 2 S), in order to open the national financial markets. This paper develops a spatial competition model to understand {{the impact of}} this new organisation on european post-trading services. We analyse the incentives of the Central Securities Depositaries (CSD) to move to T 2 S when they become competitors in the market for settlement services and remain in a dominant position for depositary services. Settlement and depositary services are complementary because banks have to pay for these two services to buy or sell a security. We show that such a reform should induce a decrease in the <b>settlement</b> <b>price</b> and more generally in the post-trading prices, but that prices depend strongly on the market organisation and on the attractivity of T 2 S. Under certain conditions, partial adhesion would make prices increase and this configuration appears as a Nash equilibrium.
