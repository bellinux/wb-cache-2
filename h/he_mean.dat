2500|$|What does <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> He goes on {{to explain}} that [...] "not one of the cabalettas begins with the usual {{instrumental}} anticipation..... the numbers are welded together with greater coherence even than Ernani..... the scoring is more sensitive than in any of the operas previously written and a good many written after..." [...] In all, Foscari is more of a step forward than might be initially imagined.|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokeswoman}} for Bubp {{said that the}} state representative [...] "did not mention Congressman Murtha by name nor did <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to disparage Congressman Murtha" [...] and that he felt [...] "the words that Congresswoman Schmidt chose did not represent their conversation." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Bubp said [...] "he never mentioned[...] [...] Murtha... by name when talking with Schmidt, {{and he would never}} call a fellow Marine a coward." ...|$|E
2500|$|By mid-December, it {{was obvious}} that Buford was sick, {{possibly}} from contracting typhoid, and he took respite at the Washington home of his good friend, General George Stoneman. On December 16, Stoneman initiated the proposal that Buford be promoted to major general, and President Abraham Lincoln assented, writing as follows: [...] "I am informed that General Buford will not survive the day. It suggests itself to me that he will be made Major General for distinguished and meritorious service at the Battle of Gettysburg." [...] Informed of the promotion, Buford inquired doubtfully, [...] "Does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> it?" [...] When assured the promotion was genuine, he replied simply, [...] "It is too late, now I wish I could live." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{this really}} {{was not a}} cliffhanger, {{the end of the}} fifth episode of the {{original}} Dallas miniseries saw J.R. go up to the loft of the barn to talk to Pam, who had gone up there to find her cousin Jimmy, after Digger had fallen off the wagon at the Ewing barbecue. J.R., intoxicated, tries to convince her to tell Bobby not to leave the ranch. However, she {{does not want to be}} bothered, and, in trying to escape J.R., she falls from the loft, landing square on her stomach. Pam, who is pregnant, miscarries her unborn child. Later, Sue Ellen questions J.R. as to whether it was really an accident or did <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> for Pam to fall on purpose. J.R. says, [...] "I did not." [...] When Sue Ellen asks J.R. if he cares that Pam lost the baby, J.R. does not answer her, leaving it up to the viewer to decide.|$|E
6000|$|Trevennack knit his brows. [...] "What does <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> then, by dogging my steps?" [...] he cried. [...] "What does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> {{by coming}} after {{me up to}} London like this? What does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by tempting me? I can't stand the sight of him. I won't be challenged, Lucy; I don't know whether it's the devil or not, but when I saw the fellow to-day I had hard work to keep my hands off him. I wanted to spring at his throat. I {{would have liked to}} {{throttle}} him!" ...|$|E

5000|$|By the beast, then, {{coming up}} out of the earth, <b>he</b> <b>means</b> the kingdom of Antichrist; and by the two horns <b>he</b> <b>means</b> him and the false prophet after him. And in {{speaking}} of [...] "horns like a lamb," [...] <b>he</b> <b>means</b> that <b>he</b> will make himself like the Son of God, and set himself forward as king. And the terms, [...] "it spoke like a dragon," [...] <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> is a deceiver, and not truthful.|$|R
60|$|Our honourable {{friend has}} sat in several parliaments, and given bushels of votes. He {{is a man}} of that profundity in the matter of vote-giving, that you never know what <b>he</b> <b>means.</b> When <b>he</b> seems to be voting pure white, he may be in reality voting jet black. When he says Yes, it is just as likely as not - or rather more so - that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> No. This is the statesmanship of our honourable friend. It is in this, that he differs from mere unparliamentary men. YOU may not know what he meant then, or what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> now; but, our honourable friend knows, and did from the first know, both what he meant then, and what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> now; and when he said <b>he</b> didn't <b>mean</b> it then, <b>he</b> did in fact say, that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> it now. And if you mean to say that you did not then, and do not now, know what <b>he</b> did <b>mean</b> then, or does mean now, our honourable friend will be glad to receive an {{explicit}} declaration from you whether you are prepared to destroy the sacred bulwarks of our nationality.|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, come, my dear!" [...] he said, in {{his most}} {{soothing}} manner, [...] "now don't be angry, and don't be hard on poor Godfrey! He has evidently said some unfortunate thing.

2500|$|In {{the larger}} {{sense of the}} word, Aristotle makes {{philosophy}} coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as [...] "science". Note, however, that {{his use of the}} term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term [...] "scientific method". For Aristotle, [...] "all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical" [...] (Metaphysics 1025b25). By practical science, <b>he</b> <b>means</b> ethics and politics; by poetical science, <b>he</b> <b>means</b> the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, <b>he</b> <b>means</b> physics, mathematics and metaphysics.|$|R

60|$|Lawford peered as if {{out of a}} {{gathering}} dusk, that thickened and flickered with shadows before his eyes. 'What's <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> then,' he muttered huskily, 'coming here with his black, still carcase--peeping, peeping--what's <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> I say?' There was a moment's silence. Then with lifted brows and wide eyes that to {{every one of his}} three witnesses left an indelible memory of clear and wolfish light within their glassy pupils, he turned heavily, and climbed back to his solitude.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Silverman {{endorsed}} Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, saying, [...] "He {{says what}} <b>he</b> <b>means</b> & <b>he</b> <b>means</b> what <b>he</b> says & he's not for sale."

60|$|Now the quite plain point {{before the}} party {{journalist}} is this: If <b>he</b> really <b>means</b> that a corrupt bargain between a Government and a contractor {{ought to be}} judged by public opinion, <b>he</b> must (nowadays) <b>mean</b> Parliament; that is, the caucus that controls Parliament. And he must decide between one of two views. Either <b>he</b> <b>means</b> {{that there can be}} no such thing as a corrupt Government. Or <b>he</b> <b>means</b> that it is one of the characteristic qualities of a corrupt Government to denounce its own corruption. I laugh; and I leave him his choice.|$|R

6000|$|Yet Descartes {{has defined}} what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by innate ideas {{with so much}} precision, that {{misconception}} {{ought to have been}} impossible.
