Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} is triggered when Detective Jimmy McNulty meets privately with Judge Daniel Phelan following the acquittal of D'Angelo Barksdale for murder after a <b>key</b> <b>witness</b> changes her story. McNulty tells Phelan that the witness {{has probably been}} intimidated by members of a drug trafficking empire run by D'Angelo's uncle, Avon Barksdale, having recognized several faces at the trial, most notably Avon's second-in-command, Stringer Bell. He also tells Phelan {{that no one is}} investigating Barksdale's criminal activity, which includes {{a significant portion of the}} city's drug trade and several unsolved homicides.|$|E
5|$|Three warrant {{officers}} survived: the gunner and carpenter were spared {{because they}} were considered useful to the ship, and Southcott the master was spared so he could navigate. Southcott lived to be a <b>key</b> <b>witness,</b> along with Casey, who was also spared, and their eyewitness accounts and testimony were key to the trials {{of many of the}} mutineers. Three petty officers joined the mutiny, one midshipman, Surgeon's Mate Cronin, and Master's Mate Turner.|$|E

5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a <b>key</b> <b>witness</b> for the prosecution, something {{that would not have}} been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|Under {{interrogation}} by MI5 officer William Skardon at {{an informal}} meeting in December 1949, Fuchs initially denied being a spy {{and was not}} detained. In January 1950, Fuchs arranged another interview with Skardon and voluntarily confessed {{that he was a}} spy. Three days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier. Fuchs's statements to British and American intelligence agencies were used to implicate Harry Gold, a <b>key</b> <b>witness</b> in the trials of David Greenglass and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a <b>key</b> <b>witness</b> for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E

5|$|The script {{calls for}} five actors to portray ten {{characters}}. The two main characters are Jason, a young Canadian lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute {{who claims to}} be fifteen years old {{and has been a}} prostitute for six years. The drama centers on Jason's infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls into Bangkok. Jason comes to believe that Number 18 could be a <b>key</b> <b>witness</b> to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect how traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number, which in some cases is branded onto the victim's body. Waldschmidt said he hoped that She Has a Name will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists.|$|E
5|$|Jason starts {{work with}} an NGO in Thailand, having left his wife and {{children}} in Canada and abandoned a lucrative job at his father-in-law's legal firm. He communicates with his wife Ali over Skype. Jason's first task is to find witnesses to or survivors from a human-trafficking incident and then to shut down the brothels into which they have been trafficked; his boss Marta sends him into the brothels as she cannot enter herself. His specific focus is an Asia-wide brothel ring's trafficking of girls into Bangkok for prostitution as part of the child sex tourism industry. An abandoned storage truck has been discovered containing the bodies of dead sex workers. Attempting to build a legal case against the brothel ring, Jason pays to see prostitutes in the hope that one of them witnessed the incident. The first prostitute he sees is Number 18, whose attempts to seduce him make him uneasy. Thinking Number 18 could be a <b>key</b> <b>witness,</b> he tries to persuade her to testify. The other prostitutes Jason encounters are too afraid to give evidence. Number 18 answers some of Jason's questions about where she is from, where she has worked, and how long she has been working, but only on the condition that Jason pay 100 baht for each response. She reveals that she has been prostituted in Thailand and Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Rushmore {{became a}} <b>key</b> <b>witness</b> in the House Un-American Activities Committee's {{hearings}} in Washington, D.C., {{the first of}} two investigations of the film industry, the purpose being to assess communist infiltration of Hollywood through groups like the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and labor unions and the extent of communist propaganda that made it into films. The investigations were motivated by the domestic activities of the brothers Gerhart and Hanns Eisler, both communist refugees from Europe living in America during the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|Spain also {{questioned}} a <b>key</b> <b>witness,</b> Dicky Barrett, who had acted as interpreter in the Port Nicholson sale, concluding he had barely understood {{the terms of}} the sale, let alone had the ability to translate it accurately; nor had he explained to Wakefield the political undercurrents of the sale. In January 1843 acting Governor Willoughby Shortland advised both Spain and Wakefield he approved of the plan to compensate Maori for land that had not been properly alienated; from that point the focus of Spain's commission switched from investigating the validity of the sales to negotiating the amount of compensation to be paid when the evidence for a proper sale was slight.|$|E
25|$|For years, Turner {{has engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of intimidation against public officials and private citizens alike. Even Turner’s arrest in this case failed to deter him. Turner continued his tactics by using intimidation against a <b>key</b> <b>witness</b> in the government’s case against him. All the while, Turner has displayed defiance and no regret for his actions. Turner remains utterly incapable of acknowledging the genuine fear experienced by his innumerable victims – that is, except when he {{is the victim of}} a perceived threat. Turner has committed a serious crime, engaged in witness intimidation, lied repeatedly under oath, and has shown no regret whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|In September 2017, Zach Adams was {{the first}} to go on trial. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, as there was no DNA or other {{forensic}} evidence tying Zach to the murder. Jason Autry, the state's <b>key</b> <b>witness,</b> testified to a series of events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction, but that he went to Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime. He said Zach had a body {{in the back of his}} truck wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel.|$|E
