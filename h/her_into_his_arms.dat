2500|$|George Mendonsa of Newport, Rhode Island, {{on leave}} from the , was {{watching}} a movie with his future wife, Rita, at Radio City Music Hall when the doors opened and people started screaming the war was over. George and Rita joined the partying on the street, but when they could not get into the packed bars decided {{to walk down the}} street. It was then that George saw a woman in a white dress walk by and took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and kissed her, [...] "I had quite a few drinks that day and I considered her one of the troops—she was a nurse." [...] In one of the four pictures that Eisenstaedt took, Mendonsa claims that Rita is visible in the background behind the kissing couple.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} {{her eyes for a}} moment. Then he took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
60|$|He took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> It {{was one of}} {{the moments}} of his lifetime.|$|E
60|$|He took <b>her</b> {{suddenly}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> In {{that moment}} he was the lover she had craved for--strong, passionate, and reckless.|$|R
60|$|Now {{she seemed}} to faint and slid from <b>her</b> horse <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> and lay there a moment, while Godwin turned aside his head.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked into}} the love light which gleamed in her wet eyes, and stooping down he took <b>her</b> again <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and kissed <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed as}} he took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> She {{did not make the}} least resistance.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} fingers upon his shoulders. Her eyes shone {{as he drew}} <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
60|$|She drooped towards him, and he {{gathered}} <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> For a novice, {{he did it}} uncommonly well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will make}} them understand!" [...] said Felix. He drew <b>her</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> and they wandered about in the garden, talking, for an hour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not--if YOU'VE been?" [...] He {{looked at}} her a little, quietly, and then, putting out his hand, passed <b>her</b> own <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> [...] "Exactly because I have." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Anne {{had some}} letters in her hand, which she handed to Julien. He threw them hastily aside and drew <b>her</b> {{suddenly}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and <b>into</b> {{the shadow of}} the giant palm.|$|R
60|$|When Blake {{was alone}} with Millicent in the dimly lighted drawing-room, he took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> very gently.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt that}} he was telling the truth. He {{gathered}} <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and kissed away her fears and doubts.|$|E
60|$|He took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> {{from which}} she {{presently}} escaped, and carefully disengaged herself. Already he felt better {{at the sight of}} her.|$|E
60|$|He took <b>her</b> silently <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> With {{the half}} closing of her eyes, the first touch of her {{responsive}} lips, himself dimly {{conscious of the}} change, he passed into the world where stronger men live.|$|R
5000|$|At the feast, Domenica Baccalieri cries, {{anxious to}} go on the tea cup ride again. As an exasperated Janice looks on, Tony placates Nica, picking <b>her</b> up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> {{swinging}} <b>her</b> around as she giggles and laughs.|$|R
60|$|He drew <b>her</b> close <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> {{and as he}} {{felt her}} heart beating against his he {{understood}} {{that he had found}} the way back to simple happiness and true wisdom, the wisdom of loving and the happiness of being loved.|$|R
60|$|Sir John, frankly {{oblivious}} {{of the possibility}} of passers-by, took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and kissed her. Then he stood up and hailed a fiacre.|$|E
60|$|She {{had risen}} and was {{standing}} by his side, a beautiful, but a suffering woman. He took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and kissed her forehead.|$|E
60|$|He took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> At {{their first}} kiss she thrilled {{from head to}} foot. For a moment she laid her head upon his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|He {{went and}} put her shawl--it was a white cashmere, {{consigned}} to her by the Major himself from India--over her shoulders. He saw {{there was nothing for}} it but to obey, and she put <b>her</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> and they went away.|$|R
60|$|Presently in sweeps Aunt Tommy, in {{an elegant}} dress, not a hair out of place. She looked {{perfectly}} sweet, only her nose was a little red. Dick looked at her for just a moment, then he stepped forward and took <b>her</b> right <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Cure you of what, darling? Say it, please say it," [...] {{the young}} man murmured, drawing <b>her</b> hand surreptitiously <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
60|$|Her exclamation, {{the light}} in her eyes, the {{pleasure}} which swiftly took the place of her first amazement, intoxicated him. He drew <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and his voice shook.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, my poor child, {{you have}} no one's leave to ask!" [...] he said; [...] "you belong to us, only to us,"—-and he drew <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> and kissed her.|$|E
60|$|Not a {{word was}} spoken. With an {{expression}} of tender compassion Mr. Wells received <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> The four missionaries turned fearful, questioning eyes upon the hunter, {{but they could not}} speak.|$|E
60|$|The {{third time}} when he said with suicidal {{conviction}} {{that he could not}} live without <b>her,</b> she burst <b>into</b> tears of pity and yielded. And instantly, amazingly, with the famished swiftness of a springing panther he caught <b>her</b> body <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and kissed <b>her</b> on the lips....|$|R
6000|$|Madame de Bellegarde rose, and her {{companion}} rising {{at the same}} time, she put <b>her</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> She answered nothing for an instant, and then, as he remained silent, {{she said with a}} smile, [...] "It would be polite for Lord Deepmere to say it was very interesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> fingers dug <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> [...] "Nearby?" [...] Her {{voice was}} like iron. [...] "Where would it be? Would they store it underground? Hidden underground?" ...|$|R
60|$|They {{entered the}} house, {{and in the}} hall he drew <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> She {{wrenched}} herself free, and crouched back in the corner, with her hands stretched {{out in front of}} her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it wonderful?" [...] murmured the girl, and she {{had other}} things in her heart to murmur; but a man's lips smothered hers as Bridge {{gathered}} <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and strained her to him.|$|E
60|$|He took <b>her</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> with {{a little}} laugh of happiness. Time and life itself stood still. Her feeble remonstrances were swept away in the tide of his passion. His lips hung burning against hers.|$|E
60|$|Each dreaded speech. It {{seemed as}} though a single word must drag them down from a new heaven to an old earth. Yet those murmured passionate words of his, as he drew <b>her</b> softly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> and <b>her</b> head sank upon his shoulder--they were {{scarcely}} words. And then again there was silence.|$|R
60|$|She leaned {{a little}} towards him. A long wisp {{of her hair}} blew in his face. A moment of madness came to him with the gust of wind which blew <b>her</b> almost <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> For one {{exquisite}} moment he held her. The violets at her bosom were crushed against his coat. Then she tore herself away.|$|R
60|$|Nels ran forward, {{jerked the}} halter out of Sneed's hand, and pulled Bonita's horse {{in close to}} the porch. As he slit the rope which bound <b>her</b> she fell <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
