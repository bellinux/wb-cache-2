50|$|Critics {{argue that}} if this view was true, investors (i.e., capital-seeking parties) would be {{inclined}} to demand capital in large quantities and would be buying capital goods from this capital. This high demand for capital goods would certainly lead to inflation and thus the central banks {{would be forced to}} raise interest rates again. As a boom pepped by low interest rates fails to appear these days in industrialized countries, this is a sign that the low interest rates seem to be necessary to ensure an equilibrium on the capital market, thus to balance capital-supply—i.e., savers—on one side and capital-demand—i.e., investors and the government—on the other. This view argues that interest rates would be even lower {{if it were not for}} the high <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> (i.e., capital demand from the government).|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of major policy changes, federal {{government}} budget deficits will probably constitute a serious impediment to any increase inthe U.

Elaborating on existing theoretical literature, {{which suggests that the}} incidence of liquidity constraints and the degree of myopia may be affected by the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio,</b> this paper investigates the role of government debt in the degree of excess sensitivity. Using a panel of OECD countries in the 1990 s, we estimate a consumption function with the degree of excess sensitivity depending on the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> and the degree of financial liberalisation. We find that a higher government debt leads to more excess sensitivity. This result supports the idea that a higher debt induces private lenders to tighten credit conditions, which raises the incidence of liquidity constraints. As to the effects of financial liberalisation on excess sensitivity in the 1990 s, we obtain no clear evidence. fiscal policy, private consumption, liquidity constraints, government debt, panel data...|$|E

The extensive borrowing of past years has enlarged the share of interest payments in government spending, thus restricting the scope for future fiscal policy action.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the various concepts of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> in the euro area with {{particular emphasis on}} its size and composition. In terms of size, the paper focuses on different definitions that are in use, in particular the concept of gross general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> used in the surveillance of the euro area countries, the total liabilities from the government balance sheet approach, and the net debt concept which subtracts government fi nancial assets from the liability side. In addition, it discusses “hidden debt” {{in the form of}} implicit and contingent liabilities. In terms of composition, the paper provides information about euro area <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> broken down by maturity, holder or the currency of issue.

Unlike almost all other European countries, Sweden has had budget surpluses and a <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> around 40 percent of GDP during the recent crisis. We attribute this to two important factors. First, Sweden entered the crisis with strong {{public finances}} and second that unemployment did not rise as much as normally during recessions. The Swedish fiscal framework that was introduced after the banking crisis in the early 1990 s with expenditure ceilings, a top-down budget process, balanced budget requirement for local governments has played an important role. We show that the behavior of budget deficits has changed significantly recently, from a deficit bias to a surplus bias. Aggregate demand remained strong during the crisis even though exports fell sharply. As unemployment in the manufacturing sector increased, it was {{to a large extent}} offset by increased employment in the service sector.

40|$|On March 25 th 2011, the European Council {{passed the}} Euro-plus Pact {{in order to}} enhance the {{competitiveness}} of European countries especially for the four Mediterranean countries which were trapped in a sovereign-debt crisis. One of the main focuses of the Pact was to restrain the growth rate of wages to make it below the growth rate of productivity. The introduction of this so-called ‘competitiveness pact’ aroused widely debate on the effectiveness of the wage restraint and some fairness issues within Euro system. This paper aims to figure out whether wage restraint can help the debt-trapped countries out of trouble. We first divided the European countries into two groups: North and South and then implemented the research by three main parts: facts overview, theoretical analysis and empirical analysis. In the facts part, plenty of macroeconomics indicators have been presented and compared between countries and over times to provide a clear view on the current crisis in Europe and differentiations in economic performance across countries. Great differences have been found in economic indicators like trade balance, export performance, <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio,</b> etc. in which the North shows better results than the South. There are also distinctions between countries in export patterns and commodity structures. The North focuses more on relative higher technology industries while the South more on the lower ones. For the theoretical part, the model of Fagerberg (1988) has been used combining with a Ricardian Model to describe the relation between export shares and possible impact factors such as labor costs, technology progress, technical change and other country specific factors. In the empirical part, quantitative relations are found within a panel dataset across 15 OECD countries and 24 industries (classified under ISIC Rev. 3) over 12 years from 1995 to 2006. Compared to the Mediterranean countries, Germany has stronger cost competitiveness coming from its strongly increasing labor productivity rather than wage moderation. However, the labor productivity can also partially attribute to the technology competitiveness which in our analysis shows weak direct influence on export performance. Country specific factors {{play an important role in}} explaining the variations in export market shares but it is hard to find good indicators for them. Even though nominal wages in the South were rising significantly stronger than the North (represented by Germany), wages are not the core reason which deteriorates the cost competitiveness in the Mediterranean countries but the slow productivity growth. Structural competitiveness cannot be ignored due to its potential impact on policy making but needs further research.

40|$|The {{economic}} and financial environment has become much gloomier in recent months, with the slowdown in activity and international trade, the dramatic worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area {{and its impact on}} financial institutions, and the plummeting confidence of business leaders and consumers. The prospects for the euro area have therefore been sharply downgraded since all the main categories of demand are likely to contribute to the weakness of activity, including public expenditure on consumption and investment in the countries implementing fiscal consolidation measures. In Belgium, during the summer of 2011, the deterioration in the external environment, the rising financial tensions and the accompanying heightened uncertainty halted the recovery apparent since mid- 2009. According to the NAI’s flash estimates, GDP stagnated in the third quarter and growth is expected to remain close to zero {{at the end of the}} year and in early 2012. Activity is expected to pick up thereafter, but the revival is likely to be modest. GDP growth is estimated at 2 % in 2011 and 0. 5 % in 2012. These figures have been revised downwards by 0. 6 and 1. 8 percentage points respectively since the projections published in June. The slowdown in activity has brought a marked reduction in job creation, even though the figures are still supported by the expansion in the number of persons employed under the service voucher system and in the health sector and other non-market services. In net terms, the increase in the number of persons employed is expected to fall from around 56 000 units in the course of 2011 to 5 000 in 2012. The declining trend in unemployment, down from 8. 5 % in the spring of 2010 to 6. 6 % in October 2011, will be reversed in 2012. On average, the harmonised unemployment rate is put at 7 % for that year. While the recovery of GDP gradually spread to all factors of demand up to the second quarter of 2011, the resurgence of financial tensions and the widespread deterioration in the business climate and the outlook will probably affect both exports and demand for household consumption and private investment. The rise in energy prices has propelled overall inflation to more than 3 % since the beginning of 2011. Taking account of the assumption of a slight dip in oil prices compared to the previous year, inflation should gradually subside during 2012. As an annual average, inflation is forecast at 3. 5 % in 2011 and 2. 4 % in 2012, which will fuel the rise in labour costs. The projections for public finances presented in this article do not go beyond 2011, since the budgetary agreement concluded on 26 November 2011 in connection with the formation of the federal government came after the cut-off date for the projections. Public finances are expected to record a deficit of 4. 2 % of GDP at the end of 2011. The <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> has increased as a result of the loans contracted by the Belgian State to finance the purchase of Dexia Bank Belgium and by the loans granted to Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

40|$|The global {{economic}} recovery which {{had begun in}} mid 2009 has continued, though its strength has varied from one region to another. The emerging economies have been the driving force, propelling the revival of international trade. The upturn is more gradual in the advanced economies, as is generally the case after an economic recession accompanied by a financial crisis. Moreover, {{there has been some}} loss of momentum {{in the past few months}} owing to the difficult transition to a self-sustaining recovery, as the fiscal stimuli initially introduced in the midst of the crisis are giving way to a general move towards the consolidation of public finances. In the euro area, significant divergences have become apparent between the performance of the economies which have been able to take advantage of the strengthening foreign demand and that of countries facing major structural adjustments. In that context, the projections indicate that the recovery will be maintained, but will be weaker for a time than at the beginning of 2010. In Belgium, too, the hesitant revival in activity which had begun in the second half of 2009 was consolidated and has since been maintained. So far it has been slightly stronger than previously expected. Overall, following a contraction of 2. 7 p. c. in 2009, growth is forecast at 2. 1 p. c. in 2010 and 1. 8 p. c. in 2011, slightly outpacing growth in the euro area. In view of the slump in GDP during the recession, the resilience of the labour market was a welcome surprise. The decline in employment was both limited and short-lived: altogether, job losses totalled 38, 400 units between the end of 2008 and the end of 2009. These losses were already more or less offset by jobs created during the first two quarters of 2010. According to the projections, job creations are likely to exceed 56, 000 units during 2010, with a further 15, 000 units in 2011. The resilience of employment is due to the use of flexible arrangements during the period of the economic slowdown and to a decline in the hourly productivity. In that context, the unemployment rate increased from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 7. 9 p. c. in 2009 and 8. 5 p. c. in 2010. It is projected at 8. 6 p. c. in 2011. The recovery was initiated in 2009 by the end of the movement towards stock reduction and by the export revival triggered by the marked strengthening of international trade. Domestic demand excluding the change in stocks is also likely to gain momentum, boosted initially by private consumption. Households are in fact expected to reduce their savings ratio to its pre-crisis level, as uncertainties regarding the labour market prospects and the value of financial assets have receded. In 2011, housing and business investments will also start contributing to the growth of domestic demand. Inflation measured by the HICP is forecast to dip slightly during the coming year, so that – as an annual average – it will increase from the rate of 0 p. c. recorded in 2009 to 2. 3 p. c. this year before subsiding to 2. 1 p. c. in 2011. According to the latest data, Belgium’s public finances will end the year 2010 with a deficit of 4. 8 p. c. of GDP, which is a 1. 2 percentage point improvement on 2009. In the absence of a budget for the federal government and social security for 2011, assuming no policy change, and given the continuing consolidation of economic conditions, the deficit is forecast at 4. 7 p. c. The <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> is projected to continue rising in 2010 and 2011, but at a much more modest pace than in the two previous years.

The medium-term scenario {{prepared by the}} IMF staff assumes continued fiscal consolidation and thus is compatible with sustainable debt levels even {{in the presence of}} adverse economic shocks. Stress tests show that stabilizing the debt/GDP ratio for the public sector at around the levels prevailing in 2002 / 03 would allow the absorption of economic shocks without generating unstable debt dynamics. Most temporary shocks would, however, shift the <b>debt</b> <b>ratio</b> upward, and further adjustment would be necessary to restore the preshock level.

Agricultural production rebounded from the drought in 2001, but the 2004 harvest {{was affected by}} a drought. Macroeconomic imbalances, high interest rates, and infrastructure constraints have adversely affected the non-agricultural economy. Malawi’s performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, approved in December 2000, was disappointing.

The third OECD Sovereign Borrowing Outlook† Raising large volumes of funds at lowest cost, with acceptable roll-over risk, remains a great challenge for several countries, with most OECD debt managers continuing to rebalance the profile of debt portfolios by issuing more long-term instruments and moderating bill issuance. provides revised estimates for 2010 and projections for 2011. Gross borrowing needs of OECD governments are expected to reach almost USD 17. 5 trillion in 2010, up from an earlier estimate of almost USD 16 trillion. In 2011, the borrowing needs of OECD sovereigns are projected to reach almost USD 19 trillion, nearly twice that of 2007. Against this backdro,p <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> are expected to further deteriorate. An additional challenge for government issuers is {{how to deal with the}} complications generated by the pressures of a rapid increase in sovereign risk, whereby “the market” suddenly perceives the debt of some sovereigns as “risky”.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} Interim Staff Report Under Intensified Surveillance for Jamaica. Following the adverse {{economic}} impact of Hurricane Ivan, the outlook for FY 2005 / 06 is for a rebound in growth {{in the context of}} broad macroeconomic stability. Real GDP growth slowed, and damage to agriculture contributed to double-digit inflation in FY 2004 / 05. Achieving the envisaged further reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 100 percent {{over the next four years}} will be challenging and demand high fiscal discipline. The IMF staff welcomes the continuing progress toward strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the impact of debt issued by one government in a monetary union on the yields of bonds issued by other governments in the union. These debt spillovers may occur if there is a risk of monetary accommodation, implicit or explicit inter-jurisdictional bailout provisions, or interdependent revenue sources. The analysis empirically distinguishes between two channels through which debt spillovers may affect bond yields: currency depreciation risk and default risk. Data on the yields of individual Canadian provincial government bonds for the period 1983 - 2003 are employed. No evidence is found of debt spillover effects between provinces, but a 1 percentage point increase in the central <b>government’s</b> <b>debt</b> to GDP <b>ratio</b> raises the yield on provincial government bonds by 4. 3 basis points — 3. 0 basis points by increasing the expected depreciation rate of the Canadian dollar and 1. 3 basis points by raising the risk of provincial government default. These results imply that a rise in the Canadian central <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to GDP <b>ratio</b> from. 25 to. 58, equivalent to the rise that occurred between 1983 and 1995, would lead to an increase in provincial government bond yields of 142 basis points...|$|R
40|$|Overall, the program's {{macroeconomic}} targets {{have been}} broadly met. The program embodies a renewed {{emphasis on the}} non-oil revenue mobilization effort and continuation of a prudent expenditure stance. Reversing {{the deterioration of the}} financial operations of the public companies and the utilities is critical. The key objective is strengthening fiscal transparency. Executive Directors welcome the government’s commitment to move forward with the implementation of structural reforms. Close and sustained monitoring, and enhanced coordination within the government, will be critical to the successful implementation of the program.
