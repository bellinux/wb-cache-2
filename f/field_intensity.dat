This means that in this particular example with a rotating magnetic disk and a stationary conducting disk, the induced electric field cannot be described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation, which describes the curl of the electric field induced by a changing magnetic flux density.|$|E

Also, to investigate the probable relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the users’ general health, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used. The questionnaires were completed by 69 employees, both {{in the study and}} control groups. Data from the questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS software. Results The magnetic <b>field</b> <b>intensities</b> were less than commonly accepted standards such as The Swedish confederation of professional employers (TCO) for both laptop and desktop displays.

40|$|Endogenous bioelectric fields guide {{morphogenesis}} during embryonic {{development and}} regeneration by directly regulating the cellular functions {{responsible for these}} phenomena. Although this role has been extensively explored in many peripheral tissues, the ability of electric fields to regulate wound repair and stimulate regeneration in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has not been convincingly established. This dissertation explores the role of electric fields in regulating the injury response and controlling the regenerative potential of the mammalian CNS. We place particular emphasis on their influence on astrocytes, as specific differences in their injury-induced behaviors {{have been associated with}} differences in the regenerative potential demonstrated between mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. For example, astrocytes in both mammalian and non- mammalian vertebrates begin migrating towards the lesion within hours and begin to proliferate after an initial delay of two days; subsequently, astrocytes in non-mammalian vertebrates support neurogenesis and assume a bipolar radial glia-like morphology that guides regenerating axons, whereas astrocytes in mammals do not demonstrate robust neurogenesis and undergo a hypertrophic response that inhibits axon sprouting. To test whether injury-induced electric fields drive the astrocytic response to injury, we exposed separate populations of purified astrocytes from the rat cortex and cerebellum to electric <b>field</b> <b>intensities</b> associated with intact and injured mammalian tissues, as well as to those electric <b>field</b> <b>intensities</b> measured in regenerating non-mammalian vertebrate tissues. Upon exposure to electric <b>field</b> <b>intensities</b> associated with uninjured tissue, astrocytes showed little change in their cellular behavior. However, cortical astrocytes responded to electric <b>field</b> <b>intensities</b> associated with injured mammalian tissues by demonstrating dramatic increases in migration and proliferation, behaviors that are associated with their formation of a glial scar in vivo; in contrast, cerebellar astrocytes, which do not organize into a demarcated glial scar, did not respond to these electric fields. At electric <b>field</b> <b>intensities</b> associated with regenerating tissues, both cerebellar and cortical astrocytes demonstrated robust and sustained responses that included morphological changes consistent with a regenerative phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that physiologic electric fields drive the astrocytic response to injury, and that elevated electric fields may induce a more regenerative response among mammalian astrocytes...|$|R
