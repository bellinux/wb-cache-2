40|$|International audienceIn {{pink-footed goose}} () {{wintering}} in Denmark, The Netherlands and Belgium, {{the proportion of}} juveniles in the hunting bag is consistently higher than that observed in the autumn population. Such juvenile bias in the bag is usually ascribed to young geese lacking experience with hunting or disruption of juveniles from families. An alternative explanation may be that flocking behaviour of families make juveniles more vulnerable. Observations of morning flights of pink-footed geese to the feeding grounds from two of the major autumn-staging areas showed that geese were distributed in many small flocks (median flock size[*]=[*] 9). This was {{not significantly different from}} the flock size distribution shot at by hunters (median[*]=[*] 8), suggesting that hunters targeted <b>goose</b> <b>flock</b> size in proportion to the general probability of encounter. The rate at which hunters downed geese was independent of flock size.

The likelihood of being shot at was 2. 4 times higher for juveniles and 3. 4 times higher for older birds in small flocks (< 10 individuals) compared to larger flocks.

40|$|We {{report on}} the effects of salt {{deposition}} on food plants on the foraging preferences of Dark-bellied Brent Branta bernicla and Barnacle Geese B. leucopsis in a coastal staging habitat. Within one salt-marsh plant community, dominated by Red Fescue Festuca rubra, grazing pressure by geese increased with elevation (related to mean high tide), although both standing crop and nitrogen content of the forage were highest at plots lower on the salt marsh. Salt deposition on Festuca leaves decreased with increasing surface height along the elevational gradient. The, matching of census data for three spring seasons and data on soil surface elevation revealed that flocks of Barnacle Geese forage, on average, 0. 4 m higher on the salt marsh than sympatric Dark-bellied Brent Geese. 84 % of the Barnacle <b>Goose</b> <b>flocks</b> were encountered in areas characterised by an inundation frequency of less than 20 during the period from February through April, whereas this applied to only 44 % of the Dark-bellied Brent <b>Goose</b> <b>flocks.</b> Barnacle Geese avoided foraging on salt-marsh vegetation experimentally sprayed with seawater, showing a significant preference for untreated control plots, whereas Dark-bellied Brent Geese did not react to the treatment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the infectious agents isolated from infection – suspected geese sent for the diagnostic examination to National Veterinary Research Institute. The birds were sent from <b>goose</b> <b>flocks</b> localized in different parts of Poland. Totally, 1, 013 birds from 122 flocks were examined. The presence of goose parvovirus (GPV), goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV), and goose circovirus (GoCV) was detected by triplex PCR. The presence of GPV DNA was shown in 36 flocks. The disease was most frequently diagnosed in goslings aging 3. 5 weeks (ten flocks), and 2. 5 weeks (six flocks). The analysis of the nucleotide sequence of VP 1 encoding region has shown close similarity of Polish GPV strains within the group which ranged from 92 % to 100 %. Moreover, the similarity level of these strains with GPV isolated in Europe was from 91. 3 % to 100 %. The occur-rence of GoCV DNA was shown in 25 <b>goose</b> <b>flocks.</b> The presence of GoCV DNA was found among geese aged from 2 to 6 weeks, but predominantly in those aging 3. 5 (three flocks) and 5 weeks (five flocks).

We investigated HR responses to social encounters in 24 free-living greylag geese in an intact social environment. We recorded 1602 social interactions of various intensities in which the focal individual either attacked another member of the flock or was attacked itself. We analysed five HR parameters (mean HR, maximum HR, HR increase, duration until maximum, time until the baseline value was reached again). Generally, HR scaled positively with increasing intensity of agonistic interactions as well as with increasing duration. Individuals showed higher HRs when attacking than when being attacked. In addition, focal individuals responded with a greater HR increase when confronted with an opponent winning a higher percentage of interactions than itself. Repeated agonistic interactions against a specific opponent were related to greater HR responses than single events and focal individuals responded more strongly to male opponents than to females. Our results indicate a differential HR response depending on the intensity and duration of an interaction as well as the identity of the opponent. This differential physiological investment may reflect differences in emotional involvement depending on the social context of a particular agonistic interaction.

40|$|Expanding {{populations of}} {{resident}} Canada geese that remain in suburban and urban areas year-round often result in increased conflicts with humans. Non-lethal and humane means {{are needed for}} managing the size of Canada goose flocks residing near or on airports, golf courses, industrial parks, government sites, and city parks. A side effect of nicarbazin, a veterinary drug used to control coccidiosis in chickens, is decreased egg production and hatching. Exploiting this side effect, studies of nicarbazin for reducing the hatchability of eggs from Canada geese were conducted. An initial study in Coturnix quail verified reduction in hatchability in a species other than chickens. Because plasma nicarbazin was not routinely measured, a study in chickens was conducted to determine the relationship between plasma and egg nicarbazin. A comparative study in chickens, mallards, and Canada geese showed that nicarbazin absorption was lowest in geese. Studies in both penned and wild Canada geese showed that reduction in hatchability was possible but neither study used bait suitable for general field application. Bait development led to the OvoControl-G® (Innolytics LLC) bait, which resulted in reduction in hatchability of 51 % at treated sites compared to control sites in the field. Previous studies showed that nicarbazin is practically non-toxic and is environmentally friendly; timing and management of baiting will minimize non-target hazards.

We conducted a fixed-kernel, home-range analysis for each brood using the Animal Movement Extension in ArcView® 3. 3 GIS (ESRI, Redlands, Calif.) software and calculated 95 % and 50 % utilization distributions (UD) for each brood. We classified 25 broods as sedentary (8 ha 95 % UD), three as shifters (84 ha 95 % UD), two as wanderers (110 ha 95 %UD); two were unclassified because of low sample size. We measured 5 habitat variables (i. e., percentage of water, percentage of pasture, percentage of development, number of ponds, and distance to nearest unused pond) within a 14. 5 -ha buffer at nesting locations. We used linear regression, using multi-model selection, information theoretic analysis, to determine which, if any, habitat variables influenced home-range size at a landscape level. The null model was the best information-theoretic model, and the global model was not significant, indicating that landscape level habitat variables selected in this study cannot be used to predict homerange size in the Upper Cumberland region <b>goose</b> <b>flock.</b> We analyzed associations among broods, using a coefficient of association of at least 0. 50, and determined association areas by overlaying individual home ranges.

We believe that abundance of quality forage and pond habitat, high survivorship, and a lack of movement corridors (i. e., rivers, lakes, and reservoirs) were responsible for the relatively small home ranges of geese in the Upper Cumberland region.

40|$|Introduction. Geese {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient poultry species, domesticated about 3000 – 2500 B. C. There are {{currently}} several different goose production techniques, some of them known from time immemorial: 1) force-feeding for fat liver (Egypt, 2686 – 2181 B. C.); 2) selection for extremely large body size, exceeding that of modern Toulouse geese (Egypt, 600 B. C. – 200 A. D.); and 3) feather plucking, introduced by ancient Egyptians and Romans. Commercial goose breeding today is dispersed as almost cosmopolitan. The majority of world <b>goose</b> <b>flocks</b> are concentrated in Asia, predominantly in China. In Europe, especially eastern Europe, we observe plentiful goose breed diversity (Fig. 1). The main goose products are raw and processed foodstuffs (meat, fat liver, and goose fat) and down and feathers for stuffing [...] . Conclusion. Further progress in goose production will depend on new tendencies in world market development and diversification, and will rely on advances in selection and management utilizing goose biological and economic features.

The causative agent of HNEG is the goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV), which has a circular double-stranded DNA genome encoding the structural proteins VP 1, VP 2 and VP 3. In vitro culture of GHPV has been problematic, so the baculovirus system was used to construct a recombinant virus expressing the VP 1 gene of GHPV under control of the polyhedrin promoter in Sf 9 insect cells. The expression and the identity of recombinant goose polyomavirus VP 1 in the crude Sf 9 cell extracts were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Experimental oil-emulsion vaccines containing two different doses of antigen were prepared using this crude extract. Goslings were vaccinated either once at day old or twice by boosting 18 days after the primary vaccination, and were challenged with a virulent polyomavirus isolate at 5 weeks of age.

40|$|International audienceGoose {{haemorrhagic}} polyomavirus (GHPV) is the viral {{agent of}} haemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese (HNEG), a lethal disease of goslings. It was recently shown that GHPV {{also can be}} detected in Muscovy and mule ducks. The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate the pathobiology of GHPV in ducks. In the first experiment, field GHPV isolates from Muscovy or mule ducks were fully sequenced and compared to goose GHPV. These duck isolates were then used to inoculate one-day-old goslings. Typical clinical signs and lesions of HNEG were reproduced, indicating that "duck-GHPV"isolates are virulent in goose. In the second experiment, 1 -day-old and 21 -day-old Muscovy ducklings were infected by a reference GHPV strain. In both cases, neither clinical signs nor histopathological lesions were observed. However, the virus was detected in cloacal bursae and sera, and serological responses were detected at 12 days post infection. These findings suggest firstly that one common genotype of GHPV circulates among ducks and geese. Secondly the study shows that ducks are infected by GHPV but show no pathologic evidence of infection, whereas geese express clinical signs. GHPV infection should therefore be considered as a carriage in ducks, of epidemiological relevance in case of contact with <b>geese</b> <b>flocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary 1. Increasing {{population}} {{sizes of}} geese are {{the cause of}} numerous agricultural conflicts in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Scaring is often used {{as a tool to}} chase geese away from fields, either as a means to protect vulnerable crops or as part of goose management schemes to drive geese to accommodation areas. Geese are quick to habituate to stationary scaring devices; hence, active scaring by humans is often employed. However, it remains undocumented how much effort is required for active scaring to be effective. 2. We explored the relationship between intensity of active human scaring on field use and behaviour by geese. Using an experimental framework, we applied four different scaring doses per day (geese were scared either 2, 5, 7 or 10 times per day), to random pastures in a pink-footed goose spring staging area in mid-Norway, and recorded <b>goose</b> <b>flock</b> sizes, fleeing response distances, and average weekly goose densities assessed by dropping densities. In addition, we counted droppings in fields without scaring. We used mixed models to test for changes in the effects of different scaring doses over time and compared observed with predicted dropping levels. 3. Cumulative dropping densities increased at different rates depending on the scaring dose. Scaring dosage did not affect flock size and fleeing response distance during the study period, but both flock sizes and fleeing response distances changed with time. 4. Scaring dose 2 did not show any decrease in relative goose use compared to the fields without scaring, whereas doses 5, 7 and 10 all showed 74 – 78 % fewer droppings {{by the end of the}} spring staging period, indicating a possible threshold between dose 2 and 5. The largest effect of scaring appeared during the first week of scaring. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study is the first to show a dose–response relationship between active scaring and field use of flocking geese. For individual farmers, the study provides guidance on the level of scaring effort needed to be cost-effective. If implemented as part of a management scheme with subsidy/accommodation areas in combination with systematic and persistent scaring, it can be used as a tool to keep geese away from areas where they are not wanted, thereby assisting in the alleviation of goose–agriculture conflicts. The approach in this study can be adapted and used in a wider range of wildlife interactions with human economic interests...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Goose circovirus (GCV) {{presents}} an immunosuppressive problem in production of geese. The infection’s clinical symptoms include growth retardation or feathering disorders but the infection process may remain non-symptomatic {{what makes the}} infected birds more susceptible for secondary viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Diagnosis of GCV infection is made by histopathological examination, dot blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR. However these techniques require application of thermocyclers and qualified staff which may be cost-consuming for some diagnostic units. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) as a simple method of GCV detection. Results The presented study has shown LAMP as a rapid tool of detecting DNA of goose circovirus (GCV) as soon in 30 min time. The method used three sets of primers: two outer primers (F 3 and B 3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP) and two loop primers (FL and BL) to accelerate the reaction. The optimum reaction temperature and the time were 61 °C for 30 min, respectively. The results were analysed using SYBR Green dye and GelRedTM solutions. Thirty-eight isolates of GCV collected from <b>geese</b> <b>flocks</b> in Poland were examined. For comparison, real-time polymerase chain reaction with F 3 and B 3 primers and SYBR Green dye was conducted.

However, ND outbreaks have been frequently reported in <b>goose</b> <b>flocks</b> in China since the late 1990 s with the concurrent emergence of genotype VIId NDV in chickens. Although the NDVs isolated from both chickens and geese in the past 15 [*]years have been predominantly VIId viruses, published data comparing goose- and chicken-originated ND viruses are scarce and controversial. Results In this paper, we compared genotype VIId NDVs originated from geese and chickens genetically and pathologically. Ten entire genomic sequences and 329 complete coding sequences of individual genes from genotype VIId NDVs of both goose- and chicken-origin were analyzed. We then randomly selected two goose-originated and two chicken-originated VIId NDVs and compared their pathobiology in both geese and chickens in vivo and in vitro with genotype IV virus Herts/ 33 as a reference. The results showed that all the VIId NDVs either from geese or from chickens shared high sequence homology and characteristic amino acid substitutions and clustered together in phylogenetic trees. In addition, geese and chickens infected by goose or chicken VIId viruses manifested very similar pathological features distinct from those of birds infected with Herts/ 33. Conclusions There is no genetic or phenotypic difference between genotype VIId NDVs originated from geese and chickens. Therefore, no species-preference exists for either goose or chicken viruses and more attention should {{be paid to the}} trans-species transmission of VIId NDVs between geese and chickens for the control and eradication of ND. </p...|$|R

The effect was significant when at least 10 shots were fired per site but not when 1 – 10 shots were fired. The timing of shooting in relation to migratory phenology did not affect the time taken by the geese to return to the hunting site, but after a hunt in the early part of the staging season, the number of geese in the study area increased more rapidly than towards the end of the season. The maximum number of geese shot per hunting event was obtained when hunting events were separated by three days. Our results indicate that hunters can increase local harvest by temporal and spatial optimisation of practices. These results may be used as a tool in wider-scale regional and international processes to regulate the population size of pink-footed geese by shooting, depending on the willingness of landowners, hunters and managers to coordinate hunting practices...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Flight {{behaviour}} {{and orientation}} of 303 flocks (31 200 individuals) of migrating Knots and Turnstones and 77 flocks (3200 individuals) of Brant Geese departing from Iceland towards Nearctic breeding grounds were recorded during three spring seasons 1986 - 88. Flocks were tracked by telescope and optical range finder at three observation sites in western Iceland {{during the peak}} period of migratory departure, 25 May- 1 June. Departing waders climbed steeply, often by circling and soaring flight, with an average climbing rate of 1. 0 mas”, up to altitudes 600 - 2000 m asl. With unfavourable winds, the waders descended to fly low over the sea surface. Brant Geese usually travelled at lower altitudes, the majority below 100 m above the sea, and were more prone towards following coastlines than waders. The birds departed in flight formations, with mean flock sizes 100 - 200 individuals in the Knot, 13 - 70 individuals in the Turnstone and about 40 individuals in the Brant <b>Goose</b> <b>flocks.</b> Waders generally departed in the afternoon or evening, during rising or high tide. Significant differences in daily timing between seasons were associated with between-year differences in the tidal cycle. Within the season, departures took place earlier in relation to high tide as the season progressed. Brant Goose departures occurred {{in the morning and}} late evening. Mean orientation was close to 3000 in all three species, with angular deviation 21 - 26 O. It is concluded that {{the overwhelming majority of the}} birds are bound for breeding sites in northern Canada and northwest Greenland. The main flight route, as can be deduced on the basi...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to increasing populations, damage complaints, {{and a desire}} to understand population and spatial dynamics, we studied population size, survival rates, home ranges, movements, and site fidelity of female resident Canada geese (Branta canadensis) at 18 study sites within 23 km of Lincoln, Nebraska, during 1991 – 1994. Based on mean flock size (2 ̆ 6 #;x = 93) and number of collared <b>geese</b> in <b>flocks</b> (x 2 ̆ 6 #; = 13), the estimated population of resident Canada geese was nearly 4, 000. Estimated monthly survival for female Canada geese was 0. 94, mean home range was 25 km 2, and mean maximum distance moved between use areas was 13 km. Collared female Canada geese exhibited strong site fidelity, with 16...|$|R
5000|$|A social holon {{does not}} possess a {{dominant}} monad; it possesses only a definable [...] "we-ness", {{as it is}} a collective made up of individual holons. In addition, rather than possessing discrete agency, a social holon possesses what is defined as nexus agency. An illustration of nexus agency is best described by a <b>flock</b> of <b>geese.</b> Each goose is an individual holon, the flock makes up a social holon. Although the flock moves as one unit when flying, and it is [...] "directed" [...] by the choices of the lead <b>goose,</b> the <b>flock</b> itself is not mandated to follow that lead goose. Another way to consider this would be collective activity that has the potential for independent internal activity at any given moment.|$|R
