40|$|As Government {{contractors}} {{expand their}} business overseas, they expose {{themselves to the}} risk of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the high sanctions that accompany those violations. Given the nature of a Government contractor’s business, they are naturally at greater risk of violating the FCPA than those companies that do not interact with Government officials on a regular basis. This article begins by providing an overview of the FCPA and a review of recent FCPA enforcement trends, and then considers the collateral consequences of a violation of the FCPA by Government contractors. In addition to fines, penalties, and possible incarceration, Government contractors have additional concerns, including the risk of suspension or <b>debarment</b> <b>from</b> the U. S. procurement regime. Exclusion from contracting with foreign governments and international organizations, including the World Bank and EU member states, is also an increasing risk. This article is an essential primer for any Government contractor that may be exposed to FCPA liability and seeks to avoid or limit the potential collateral consequences...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960 presidential election, Democratic {{candidate}} and eventual winner John F. Kennedy [...] "criticized President Eisenhower for not ending discrimination in federally supported housing" [...] and [...] "advocated a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission". Shortly after taking office, Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925 in March 1961, requiring government contractors to [...] "consider and recommend additional affirmative steps {{which should be}} taken by executive departments and agencies to realize more fully the national policy of nondiscrimination…. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin". The order also established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (PCEEO), chaired by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. Federal contractors who failed to comply or violated the executive order were punished by contract cancellation and the possible <b>debarment</b> <b>from</b> future government contracts. The administration was [...] "not demanding any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities" [...] but was rather [...] "advocating racially neutral hiring to end job discrimination". Turning to issues of women's rights, Kennedy initiated a Commission on the Status of Women in December 1961. The commission was charged with [...] "examining employment policies and practices {{of the government and}} of contractors" [...] with regard to sex.|$|R
