40|$|The recent {{collapse}} of the non-residential real estate development & construction market rises the question, what the future demand will be for real estate space and how these will influence future development activities. The aim {{of this research is}} to provide a framework for stock-flow analysis and forecasting of real estate development (macro, per sector and per property type, such as office, industrial, commercial, health care, school and public buildings). The economic approach of <b>investment</b> <b>for</b> <b>expansion</b> of the space stock is based on the growth of production by the observed economic sectors and on the growth of {{the economy as a whole}} (GDP). This is confronted with analysis of the physical growth of a sectoral stock (in square meters or otherwise), as production and accommodation capacity. Moreover with the growth of the use of the stock (such as employees in offices, scholars in schools and so on). Additionally future investment for renewal of the building stock depends on the life time structure of the present building stock and the capability of this stock to meet contemporary requirements (after refurbishment). Topical problems in The Netherlands are a high vacancy and underutilization of offices and of other buildings and business complexes. Re-use and transformation activities are limited. The agrarian, industrial and logistical sector tend to a high replacement activity, with relocation and spatial concentration. Consequently this leads to high disinvestment and disposal of buildings which cannot meet contemporary technological, economic and environmental standards. Generally, the (trend of) new development for expansion and replacement of the building stock is slightly downward. An exception is the health sector, with a growing shortage of facilities for an ageing population. Unfortunately, development activity for the health care and the non-profit sector will be limited by financial conditions. Real Estate and HousingArchitectur...|$|E

30|$|The reader may now {{argue that}} the {{emergence}} of certain staffing strategies could suffer from omitted variable bias, {{even if we have}} carefully evaluated based on industry-adjusted indicators whether the prevalence of the five staffing patterns varies across dominance and growth regimes. However, despite this strategy of dividing establishments into more homogeneous subgroups, the emergence of our staffing patterns could depend on additional factors, such as the size of the establishment, whether it is located in the former East Germany, or whether it has an older or a younger workforce. If, at the same time, these factors are related to whether an establishment is growing or declining, or whether it is able to act as a dominant employer on the labor market, the depicted differences in the emergence of a certain staffing pattern across dominance and growth regimes may be no more than a statistical artefact. We therefore check whether (i) the dominance and growth regime and (ii) the (industry-adjusted) staffing strategies vary across establishment size, location, the condition of the technological equipment and per-worker <b>investments</b> <b>for</b> <b>expansions,</b> as well as across additional workforce characteristics, such as average age, age-heterogeneity and average tenure, and the share of academic, female and part-time workers (see Table A. 4).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{charcoal}} {{production from}} planted forests has been insufficient {{to take care}} of the demand and has implied in more pressure on the forest remainders, in special of the biome Cerrado. In 2005, the charcoal consumption in Brazil reached 38 million of MDC (Meter of Charcoal). The evolution of the charcoal consumption produced from native species passed of 86 % of the total, in 1980, to approximately 49. 6 %, in 2005, whereas the charcoal produced from planted forests jumped of 14, 1 %, in 1980, to 50, 4 %, in 2005. Minas Gerais is the greatest consumer of charcoal and consumed 66 % of the Brazilian production, in 2005. In Brazil, in 2004, 115, 580 ha of energy forests had been planted, of which 83. 6 % in Minas Gerais. Of the 5, 5 million tons of charcoal produced in Brazil in 2005, 34. 5 % had been produced with native species of the Cerrado.

Methods:Using decision analysis incorporating multiple Markov processes (Markov modelling), we compared expected tuberculosis morbidity, mortality and costs in Haiti with DOTS expansion to reach all of the country, and achieve WHO benchmarks, or if the current situation did not change. Probabilities of tuberculosis related outcomes were derived from the published literature. Government health expenditures, patient and family costs were measured in direct surveys in Haiti and expressed in 2003 US$. Results:Starting in 2003, DOTS expansion in Haiti is anticipated to cost $ 4. 2 million and result in 63, 080 fewer tuberculosis cases, 53, 120 fewer tuberculosis deaths, and net societal savings of $ 131 million, over 20 years. Current government spending for tuberculosis is high, relative to the per capita income, and would be only slightly lower with DOTS.

30|$|Most of {{the world}} major {{airports}} have operational constraints or capacity limits based upon noise. But the future potential growths of air traffic imply that emission sources {{in the future will}} increase in importance. The study of integrated airport impact shows {{that it is necessary to}} introduce the concept of airport traffic (operational) capacity according to environmental safety conditions. Evaluation of an airport impact on surrounding environment could be realized by defining environmental capacity of an airport. It means reduction of an airport’s capacity so as to ensure that airport environmental performances comply with the environmental rules. Operational capacity of an airport can be measured as the number of runway-taxiways slots, the terminal capacity or capacity of the apron areas. It is limited only by means of flight safety. The economic capacity of an airport can be measured as the maximum number of passengers or aircraft, which can be accommodated on a particular day with a given amount of infrastructure under given economic conditions. In a short term, airport service load during peak and off-peak period determine these conditions. In long term, the availability of <b>investments</b> <b>for</b> airport <b>expansion</b> principally determines the economic conditions.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{political}} economy of three significant policy decisions of the Congress-United Progressive Alliance government between November 2005 and February 2006. These decisions improved the regulatory incentives for the smaller and efficient firms in the Indian GSM industry, which were heavily dependent on foreign <b>investment</b> <b>for</b> their <b>expansion.</b> India's telecommunications sector became more attractive to foreign investors {{as a result of these}} regulatory changes. This was a notable departure from the past when government policy had favoured large domestic investors using CDMA technology who were not dependent on foreign capital. A globalisation friendly policy change occurred after a Centre-Left United Progressive Alliance coalition came to power. The paper argues that these decisions, which promoted both competition and foreign investment, occurred due to the increased sensitivity of the Department of Telecommunications towards the needs of the relatively smaller GSM service providers, driven by considerations of efficiency. They were not driven by a crisis of private investment, foreign pressure, or stealth. The shift occurred in normal times when the Department of Telecommunications under a persistent ministerial stewardship took on a regulator, which was less interested in engineering this shift. This globalisation-friendly strategy depended to a large extent on the particular industrial sub-sector that the ruling party or coalition supported for spreading telecommunications in India. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{problem in the}} new strategies of telecom development is attracting private <b>investment</b> <b>for</b> network <b>expansion.</b> Following the insights of institutional economists, and from evidence gained through the case study of the telecom liberalization process in India, this paper contends {{that the success of}} private investment depends on the creation of a regulatory mechanism that provides 'credible commitment' [...] that is, provides both a set of rules and regulations that ensure prospective private investors a reasonable return on investment, as well as a governance mechanism that insures them against the possibility of arbitrary governmental discretion. The problems of the liberalization process in the telecom sector in India reflect the failure to institute such a regulatory regime. Following a process of macro-economic liberalization in 1991, India adopted the New Telecom Policy (NTP) in 1994, opening up the basic telecom sector to foreign investment. The implementation of NTP, however, was marked by a series of conflicts and controversies, resulting in extensive litigation and conflict between the Department of Telecommunications and the private operators, and erosion of investor confidence. These problems of implementation represent a problem of institutional change associated with a fundamental shift in the institutional regime, from one based on a high level of discretionary power on the part of state actors, to institutions based on transparency, accountability, expertise and insulation from the political process. ...|$|R
