5|$|The amended Constitution of Singapore also {{provided}} for a Council of Ministers {{appointed by the}} Governor upon {{the recommendation of the}} Chief Minister, consisting of three unelected Official Members and six Elected Members. As the Constitution was unclear on the powers of the ministers, the discretion to make crucial decisions and formulate policies was understood to reside in the <b>Governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Official Members.|$|E

5|$|As {{the state}} capital, Providence houses the Rhode Island General Assembly, {{as well as}} the offices of the <b>Governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lieutenant Governor in the Rhode Island State House. The city itself has a Mayor-council government. The Providence City Council {{consists}} of 15 councilors, one for each of the city's wards, who enact ordinances and pass an annual budget. Providence also has probate and superior courts. The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island is located downtown across from Providence City Hall adjacent to Kennedy Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-six {{individuals}} {{have served as}} governor, four of whom served non-consecutive terms, totaling 60 distinct terms; the official numbering only lists each governor once, so there have officially been fifty-six governors. This numbering includes one acting governor: the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after {{the resignation of the}} governor, under the 1777 State Constitution. The list does not include people who have acted as governor when the governor was out of state, such as Lt. Gov. Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt's vice presidential campaign in 1900, or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein, who acted as governor for ten days in 1968 while the governor, the lieutenant <b>governor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> senate majority leader were out of the state, attending the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E

Sveagruva is a dormitory town, with workers commuting from Longyearbyen weekly.|$|E
5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main reason was that the police was {{under the control of}} the <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable reason was that the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the General Assembly's contest committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital, awaiting the contest committee's findings. On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. As expected, the contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make Goebel <b>governor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly voted to certify the recommendation. Goebel was sworn in as governor, but he died on February 3. Beckham then took the oath of office and continued the legal challenge against Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvania State Capitol is {{the seat}} of {{government}} for the U.S. state of Pennsylvania and is in downtown Harrisburg. It was designed by architect, Joseph Miller Huston in 1902 in a Beaux-Arts style with decorative Renaissance themes throughout. The capitol houses the legislative chambers for the Pennsylvania General Assembly, {{made up of the}} House of Representatives and the Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme and Superior Courts of Pennsylvania, as well as the offices of the <b>Governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lieutenant Governor. It is also the main building of the Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{under the}} presidency comprised only Madraspatnam and surrounding regions. But, after the Anglo-French wars {{and the consequent}} alliance between the English East India Company and the Nawab of Arcot, it was expanded to comprise the region from Northern Circars to Cape Comorin. Alongside, the governance structure also evolved from a modest secretariat with a single secretary for the Public Department in 1670 to six departments overseen by a Chief Secretary by 1920. With the enactment of Government of India Act 1919, the first legislature was formed in 1920 after general elections. The term of the legislative council was three years. It had 132 members of whom 34 were nominated by the <b>Governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest were elected.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Constantinople, he was tasked (late 1092/early 1093), along with Manuel Boutoumites, with the {{suppression}} of the revolts in Crete by Karykes and in Cyprus by Rhapsomates. The rebellion of Karykes was subdued easily, as the news of the imperial fleet's approach caused a counter-coup that overthrew him. At Cyprus, Rhapsomates's initial resistance was overcome, and he himself was captured soon after. Eumathios Philokales was installed as the island's new <b>governor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fleet returned to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|When {{the third}} statehouse was {{condemned}} in 1876 the government abandoned the building. The General Assembly relocated {{to a large}} office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court. The <b>Governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> executive staff relocated to another office building. The office building {{was used as the}} statehouse during the interim period that the new statehouse was being built. In 1887, before the new statehouse had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government {{to move out of the}} cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.|$|E
5|$|After Parliament {{partially}} repealed the Townshend {{duties in}} 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended. Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained. Hancock tried {{to improve his}} relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence. In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the Boston Cadets, a militia unit whose primary function {{was to provide a}} ceremonial escort for the <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> General Court. In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the Council, the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the General Court to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of {{governor}} becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|In 1648, the Fronde insurrection {{broke out}} in Paris, {{prompted}} by high taxes, increased food prices and disease. The Parlement of Paris, the Regency government of Anne of Austria and rebellious noble factions fought for several years {{to take control of}} the city and wider power. On 26 August, during the period known as the First Fronde, Anne ordered the arrest of some of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris; violence flared as a result, and the 27 August became known as another Day of the Barricades. The governor of the Bastille loaded and readied his guns to fire on the Hôtel de Ville, controlled by the parliament, although the decision was eventually taken not to shoot. Barricades were erected across the city and the royal government fled in September, leaving a garrison of 22 men behind in the Bastille. On 11 January 1649, the Fronde decided to take the Bastille, giving the task to Elbeuf, one of their leaders. Elbeuf's attack required only a token effort: five or six shots were fired at the Bastille, before it promptly surrendered on the 13 January. Pierre Broussel, one of the Fronde leaders, appointed his son as the <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fronde retained it even after the ceasefire that March.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{plagued by}} {{political}} missteps and personal scandals, {{the administration of}} Republican Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift appeared vulnerable, and many Republicans viewed her as unable to win a general election. Prominent party figures– {{as well as the}} White House– wanted Romney to run for <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opportunity appealed to him for reasons including its national visibility. A poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50percentage points. On March 19, 2002, Swift announced she would not seek her party's nomination, and hours later Romney declared his candidacy, for which he would face no opposition in the primary. In June 2002, the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney's eligibility to run for governor, noting that state law required seven years' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000. In response, the bipartisan Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission unanimously ruled that he had maintained sufficient financial and personal ties to Massachusetts and was, therefore, an eligible candidate.|$|E
5|$|Sledd {{played a}} key role in the {{formation}} and ultimate success of the new university, but his time as its president was a relatively short four years. His political backing ended with the retirement of Governor Broward, and the inauguration of his successor Albert Gilchrist in January 1909. The Florida Board of Education, which then consisted of the <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> state's elected cabinet members, oversaw the Board of Control and made no secret of its desire to remove Sledd, in part because members of the Board of Education believed that Sledd's admissions standards were too high and that the university was not growing quickly enough. Nevertheless, the Board of Control continued to back Sledd, and its members threatened to resign in protest. Seeking to avoid an unwinnable political controversy, Sledd resigned, and the Board of Control replaced him with Albert Murphree, the political favorite of several legislative leaders and the Board of Education.|$|E
