5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature).</b> The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the mean curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{can be used}} {{to prove}} an isoperimetric {{inequality}} for surfaces whose <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> is a non-increasing function of the distance from the origin, such as the paraboloid. On such a surface, the smooth compact set that has any given area and minimum perimeter for that area is necessarily a circle centered at the origin. The proof applies the curve-shortening flow to two curves, a metric circle and the boundary of any other compact set, and compares the change in perimeter of the two curves as they are both reduced to a point by the flow.|$|E
25|$|Most {{surfaces}} {{will contain}} regions of positive <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> (elliptical points) and regions of negative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> {{separated by a}} curve of points with zero <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> called a parabolic line.|$|E

40|$|The energy {{landscapes of}} electrostatically charged {{particles}} embedded on constant mean curvature surfaces are analysed {{for a wide}} range of system size, curvature, and interaction potentials. The surfaces are taken to be rigid, and the basin-hopping method is used to locate the putative global minimum structures. The defect motifs favoured by potential energy agree with experimental observations for colloidal systems: extended defects (scars and pleats) for weakly positive and negative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvatures,</b> and isolated defects for strongly negative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvatures.</b> Near the phase boundary between these regimes the two motifs are in strong competition, as evidenced from the appearance of distinct funnels in the potential energy landscape. We also report a novel defect motif consisting of pentagon pairs. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Physical Review Letter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{complete}} description of all rotational linear Weingarten surface into the Euclidean sphere S 3.

25|$|<b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> is {{the product}} of the two {{principal}} curvatures. It is an intrinsic property that can be determined by measuring length and angles and is independent of how the surface is embedded in space. Hence, bending a surface will not alter the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature,</b> and other surfaces with constant positive <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> can be obtained by cutting a small slit in the sphere and bending it. All these other surfaces would have boundaries, and the sphere is the only surface that lacks a boundary with constant, positive <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature.</b> The pseudosphere {{is an example of a}} surface with constant negative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature.</b>|$|E
25|$|For example, {{a sphere}} of radius r has <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> 1/r2 everywhere, and a flat plane and a {{cylinder}} have <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> 0 everywhere. The <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature</b> {{can also be}} negative, {{as in the case}} of a hyperboloid or the inside of a torus.|$|E

25|$|Hilbert's theorem (1901) {{states that}} there exists no {{complete}} analytic (class C) regular surface in R3 of constant negative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvature.</b> In fact, the conclusion also holds for surfaces of class C2 immersed in R3, but breaks down for C1-surfaces.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} using curvatures in digital space for 3 D object {{analysis}} and recognition. Since direct adjacency has only six types of digital surface points in local configurations, {{it is easy}} to determine and classify the discrete curvatures for every point on the boundary of a 3 D object. Unlike the boundary simplicial decomposition (triangulation), the curvature can take any real value. It sometimes makes difficulties to find a right value for threshold. This paper focuses on the global properties of categorizing curvatures for small regions. We use both digital <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvatures</b> and digital mean curvatures to 3 D shapes. This paper proposes a multi-scale method for 3 D object analysis and a vector method for 3 D similarity classification. We use these methods for face recognition and shape classification. We have found that the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvatures</b> mainly describe the global features and average characteristics such as the five regions of a human face. However, mean curvatures can be used to find local features and extreme points such as nose in 3 D facial data. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

More precisely, we combine a fully parallel pipeline on GPU to extract an adaptive triangu-lated isosurface of the digital object, with a curvature tensor estimation at each surface point based on integral invariants.

40|$|In this thesis, a reduced-order {{model is}} {{constructed}} {{to study the}} physiological flow and wall shear stress conditions for aneurysms. The method of local proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to construct the reduced-order modes using a series of CFD results, which are subsequently improved using a QR-factorization technique to satisfy the various boundary conditions in physiological flow problems. This method can effectively construct a computationally efficient physiological model, which allows us to examine the fluid velocities and wall shear stress distributions over a range of different physiological flow parameters. Aneurysms are the dilation, bulging, or ballooning-out of part of {{the wall of a}} human artery. Repetitive forces on an existing aneurysm can lead either to its gradual expansion or to a devastating event of rupture. Traditionally, clinicians use the largest diameter as the sole parameter for standard risk stratification outside of clinical trials. However, {{there seems to be no}} safe small aneurysm size and a more accurate answer depends on the exact distributions of material and geometrical properties of the aneurysms. Aneurysms can have a very non-uniform distribution of thickness, modulus, and failure tension. We focus on the thins-shell fluid-structures interactions (FSI) with thickness inhomogeneity by studying the influence of one or multiple thin spots on the flow-induced instabilities of flexile shells of revolution with non-zero <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvatures.</b> The results show that for shells with positive <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvatures</b> conveying fluid, the existence of a thin spot results in a localized flow-induced buckling response of the shell in the neighborhood of the thin spot, and significantly reduces the critical flow velocity for buckling instability. For shells with negative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curvatures,</b> the buckling response is extended along the shell’s characteristic lines and the critical flow velocity is only slightly reduced. Finally, the shell model with non-uniform thickness is combined with the ROM of hemodynamic loads. We show that based on a growth and remodeling (G 2 ̆ 6 R) model, the rate of aneurysmal wall’s elastin degradation can be predicted efficiently with various degrees of thickness inhomogeneity...|$|R
