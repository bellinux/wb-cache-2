5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

500|$|Fischer and Spassky gave ten press {{conferences}} during the match. Seirawan attended the match {{and met with}} Fischer on several occasions; the two analyzed some match games and had personal discourse. Seirawan later wrote: [...] "After September 23 , <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> most of what I'd ever read about Bobby out of my head. Sheer garbage. Bobby is the most misunderstood, misquoted celebrity walking {{the face of the}} earth." [...] He added that Fischer was not camera shy, smiled and laughed easily, was [...] "a fine wit" [...] and [...] "wholly enjoyable conversationalist".|$|E
500|$|Almost a {{year after}} filming her final scenes, Lister {{explained}} that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: [...] "It felt {{it was time to}} go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, I was nervous but now I know I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [...] was the break I'd been praying for. <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> myself into the part and enjoyed every minute of it. I had three superb years and it was brilliant." ...|$|E

500|$|Thomas Owen was a {{carpenter}} from Pennsylvania. Severely injured {{in an accident}} {{a week before the}} executions, Owen reportedly confessed to the bombing on his deathbed by saying, [...] "I was at the Haymarket riot and am an anarchist and say that <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> a bomb in that riot." [...] He was an anarchist and apparently had been in Chicago at the time but other accounts note that long before his accident he had said he was at the Haymarket and saw the bomb thrower. Owen may have been trying to save the condemned men.|$|E
500|$|Jerry's parents, Helen (Liz Sheridan) and Morty Seinfeld, {{are staying}} at Jerry's {{apartment}} in New York City, making themselves at home. He bursts in, wearing baseball clothes, carrying a bat and glove, and proudly tells them that during his softball game, [...] "I made an incredible {{play in the}} field! There was a tag-up at third base and <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be {{in the championship game}} Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "get {{it out of}} here, get it {{away from}} the guys and myself.

And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|E

500|$|Cudi {{commented that}} the way the song was {{recorded}} {{was similar to the}} way prior collaborations between the two were recorded; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas. In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about. He just kind of told me {{what he was trying to}} say, <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> out some words, we rearranged words, and we came out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook." ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Davis {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of her husband's capture as described below: [...] "Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> over his head a little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2005, Feldman and two {{teammates}} threw {{a perfect}} {{game against the}} Corpus Christi Hooks. It was the first combined nine-inning perfect game in Texas League history, and the third overall. Feldman was tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth he let the count get to 3–1. [...] "I was just telling myself, 'Don't walk him,'" [...] Feldman said. [...] "Once it got to 3–1, <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> it right down the middle. [...] If they got a hit, they got a hit. [...] But they're not going {{to break up a}} perfect game on a walk." [...] The batter grounded out. [...] On July 31, the three pitchers shared the Texas League Pitcher of the Week Award.|$|E

500|$|Hualālai last {{erupted in}} 1800–1801. This {{eruption}} produced very fluid alkalic basalt lava flows that entered the ocean off the western tip of Hawaii island. Although five vents were active at the time, only two produced flows that eventually reached the ocean. The total output {{volume of the}} flow is estimated at over [...] One volcanic vent, situated high on the slope, produced a large a'a flow, dubbed the Kaʻūpūlehu flow, that reached the ocean as two distinct lobes. On its way down, it overran a village and a valuable [...] fishing pond. There is a local legend that after the failure of several offerings of animals and other items to the gods, the flow was finally stopped when Kamehameha <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> a lock of his own hair into the fire. The Ka'ūpūlehu flow is also known for the particularly large quantity of mafic and ultramafic xenoliths that came up with it.|$|E
500|$|In the California Medical Facility, Kemper was incarcerated in {{the same}} prison block as other notorious criminals such as Herbert Mullin and Charles Manson. Kemper showed {{particular}} disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders {{at the same time}} in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as [...] "just a cold-blooded killer... killing everybody he saw for no good reason". However, Kemper himself commented on his [...] "self-righteous talking like that , considering what [...] done". Despite this concession, Kemper still manipulated and physically intimidated the diminutive Mullin, who, standing at , was over a foot shorter than Kemper. Kemper stated that [...] " [...] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 3, Muenter (who {{went under}} the {{pseudonym}} Frank Holt) {{burst into the}} Glen Cove, New York home of Jack Morgan, son of financier J.P. Morgan, demanding that he stop the sale of weapons to the allies. [...] Morgan told the man {{he was in no}} position to comply with his demand; Muenter shot him twice and escaped. Muenter was later apprehended and confessed to attempted assassination of the vice president. Marshall was offered a personal security detachment after the incident, but declined it. [...] Marshall had been receiving written death threats from numerous [...] "cranks" [...] for several weeks. [...] "Some of them were signed," [...] Marshall told the press, [...] "but most were anonymous. [...] <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> them all into the waste basket." [...] Marshall added that he was [...] "more or less a fatalist" [...] and did not notify the Secret Service about the letters, [...] "but that he naturally was startled when he heard of the explosion at the Capitol." ...|$|E

500|$|By the 1970s, a {{combination}} of the recession, overpriced food, and fear of football hooligans had greatly reduced the services' popularity. The quality of the food declined substantially and, because of its prominent location, the services became a byword for poor catering. Roy Harper wrote a song criticising the food at the Watford Gap on his 1977 album, Bullinamingvase, writing: [...] "Watford Gap, Watford Gap / A plate of grease and a load of crap". The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food, as did an EMI board member who was also a non-executive director of Blue Boar. Harper defended his decision to write the song, claiming the food was [...] "junk. Absolute junk". [...] In 1989, one journalist claimed the services had some of the worst food found on the road network, adding [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> the toast out of the window, it would probably still be bouncing up the M1." [...] Roadchef purchased the motorway businesses from Blue Boar in 1995 and have since improved facilities. In 2011 and 2012 it was rated as 3 stars by quality assessors at Visit England.|$|E
500|$|Minority Report is {{a futuristic}} film which portrays {{elements}} of a both dystopian and utopian future. The movie renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book, and contains new technologies not in Dick's story. From a stylistic standpoint, Minority Report resembles Spielberg's previous film A.I., but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he [...] "wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> myself a film festival. Asphalt Jungle. Key Largo. The Maltese Falcon." [...] The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production. The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son's kidnapping at the pool {{is the only one}} shot in [...] "normal" [...] color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film's colors, {{to the point that it}} nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture. The color was reduced by [...] "about 40%" [...] to achieve the [...] "washed-out" [...] appearance. Elvis Mitchell, formerly of The New York Times, commented that [...] "he picture looks as if it were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late '70s car." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E
