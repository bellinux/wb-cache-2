Archaeology exhibits particular relevance within public schools, whose population holds one of the discipline’s largest, most inclusive captive audiences.

In response, {{federal and state governments}} have recently devoted up to $ 500 million annually to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>outreach</b> campaigns to increase take-up among those eligible.

There is also no evidence that early enrollment in Medicaid improves outcomes. Children in need of hospitalization who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled are typically enrolled in Medicaid at the point of hospitalization. In addition, estimation of the impact of early enrollment in Medicaid on health-care utilization and child health is hindered by the endogeneity of the enrollment decision: children in greater need of medical care are more likely to enroll. Thus, straightforward estimation of the impact of Medicaid enrollment on child health will underestimate the effect of Medicaid enrollment on health.

This study aims to identify critical factors influencing the viability <b>of</b> <b>outreach</b> nurseries in South Africa through an evaluation of existing and past projects, and to assess the impact of the projects on the lives of community participants. The central questions of the study are: (i) What factors influence the survival <b>of</b> <b>outreach</b> nurseries? (ii) How did these projects affect the different stakeholders, in particular, community participants? (iii) Are outreach nurseries the best means of achieving conservation and socioeconomic goals? (iv) If so, how can project implementation be improved? Outreach nurseries are defined as decentralised nurseries that are established and managed by one or more community participants with varying degrees of support from implementing organisations. The nurseries included in this study are limited to those with NRM objectives. The key issues affecting the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>outreach</b> projects are reviewed, starting with a brief overview of the evolution of people-centred approaches to NRM. Disentangling the complex inter-related political, socioeconomic and environmental factors influencing the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> even small-scale projects such as outreach nurseries is challenging at both research and implementation levels. A model adapted from Choucri (1999) is presented to facilitate the assessment of projects and the assumptions on which they are based by deconstructing the key dimensions of sustainability: ecology, economic activity, political behaviour, governance and institutional performance. An evaluation of 65 South African outreach nurseries was initially conducted. Biophysical problems such as a lack of water, inadequate infrastructure, poor soils, insufficient space and steep slopes were commonly experienced. Unlike small-scale nurseries in India and other parts of Africa, which are often implemented to meet subsistence needs, South African projects frequently include financial objectives to enable the enterprise to become independent of external funding and generate incomes for community participants.
