500|$|The Ledder, or Ledbury Run, is a [...] {{cross country}} race that starts in [...] the town of Ledbury, goes over the Malvern Hills and {{finishes}} on the Senior, the main cricket pitch in {{the centre of the}} College. The first 9 runners receive Ledder Caps. In its early days there was no organised route and pupils simply <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to college as fast as they could.|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980 (UK time), whilst {{staying at}} Starr's ex-wife's home, she {{received}} a phone call from Starr, two hours after Lennon had been shot in New York. [...] "The memory of Ringo's words, the sound of his tearful voice crackling over the transatlantic line, is crystal clear: 'Cynthia, I'm so sorry, John's dead'. I had only one clear thought. My son, our son, [...] was at home in bed, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Ruthin so that I could tell him about his father's death." ...|$|E
500|$|Their food worries {{were now}} resolved, {{but they still}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Hut Point before 1 March deadline. The final leg of their march was {{interrupted}} by a blizzard, which held them in camp for 24hours. On 27 February, when they were still [...] from safety, Marshall collapsed. Shackleton then decided that he and Wild would make a dash for Hut Point in hopes of finding the ship and holding her until the other two could be rescued. They reached the hut late on 28 February. Hoping that the ship was nearby, they sought to attract its attention by setting fire to a small wooden hut used for magnetic observations. Shortly afterwards Nimrod, which had been anchored at the Glacier Tongue, came into view: [...] "No happier sight ever met the eyes of man", wrote Wild later. It was a further three days before Adams and Marshall could be picked up from the Barrier, but by 4 March the whole southern party was aboard and Shackleton was able to order full steam towards the north.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane will have to come clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the strike}} on the Pentagon by American Airlines Flight 77, Rumsfeld {{went out to}} the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts. He later {{recalled}} that [...] "I wanted to see what had happened. I wanted to see if people needed help. I went downstairs and helped for a bit with some people on stretchers. Then I came back up here and started – I realized I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> up here and get at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Views on Patlabor the Movie 2 {{have been}} very positive. One review from the Anime Cafe states that Patlabor the Movie 2 is an [...] "intellectually {{stimulating}} anime", combining the movie's mecha concept with the plot similar to a Tom Clancy novel. Anime World Order states that while the sequel {{is better than the}} first in terms of action and drama, some viewers may not understand the political aspects of the film, though its philosophical themes may be easier to understand, especially with the concept of just war and unjust peace. Japan Hero's review of the movie commented well on the side story that the movie showcased the main characters who had to let go of their past and to move on and grow up, with the fact that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together and face a threat that could make a country ruled by civilian authority or one ruled by fear and paranoia. Anime News Network has noted the background music used in the movie [...] "favors heavy, pulsing techno beats backed by airy, haunting vocals for the intense scenes and soaring synthesized scores in other places ... If you’re looking for something wholly dramatic, insightful, and mature then you’ve come to the right place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's me, Kramer." [...] His fingers {{tightened}} {{against the}} microphone handle. [...] "You must release the controls, Professor. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Terra. You must." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too bad! but no {{girls are}} allowed," [...] {{returned}} Sam. [...] "Just the same, I don't think we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the college very early." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] assented Bosinney. [...] "But we'll hurry up, if {{you don't}} mind. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in time <b>to</b> take June to the theatre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because them as goes up the Congo never, comes back. It's a fool's trip {{among those}} wild {{people of the}} interior. Stanley went up, {{but look at the}} big party he took with him and the many fights he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> alive." ...|$|E
60|$|But thank you--we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> And run the {{gauntlet}} of that stinking, stinking lane? Never. Towering with fury--quite unreasonable, but there you are--I marched the q-b down a declivity through a wood, over a ploughed field, along a cart-track, {{and so to}} the great high-road above the village and above the inn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Discreet as ever, my dear! I {{understand}}! And I {{hope you}} understand about that old affair, too, by this time. It was a complication. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> at Lioncourt somehow; and I don't honestly {{think now that}} his admiration for a young girl was a very wholesome thing for her. But never mind. You had that Boston goose in Florence, too, last winter, and I suppose he gobbled up what little Miss Milray had left of me. But she's charming. I could go {{down on my knees}} to her art when she really tries to finish any one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{willing to}} go," [...] said Henshaw. [...] "Only we can't {{stay on the}} island too long, for we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> before it <b>gets</b> too dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks very much; I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> dinner. I met Jon by accident, and {{we thought}} it would be rather jolly just to see his home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} do {{something}}. Take her away from those people. I went to Almayer; the biggest blind fool that you ever [...] . Then Abdulla came--and she went away. She took away with her something of me which I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> I had to do it. As far as you are concerned, the change here had to happen sooner or later; you couldn't be master here for ever. It isn't what I have done that torments me. It is the why. It's the madness that drove me to it. It's that thing that came over me. That may come again, some day." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerry Muskrat {{had been}} {{home at the}} Smiling Pool for several days. But he couldn't stay there long. Oh, my, no! He just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to see what his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, was doing. So {{as soon as he}} was sure that {{everything}} was all right at the Smiling Pool he hurried back up the Laughing Brook to Paddy's pond, deep in the Green Forest. As soon as he was in sight of it, he looked eagerly for Paddy. At first he didn't see him. Then he stopped and gazed over at the place where Paddy had been cutting aspen trees for food. Something was going on there, something queer. He couldn't make it out.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} be an Episcopal clergyman," [...] she said, in a haughty summing up. [...] "From his name I should have {{supposed}} he was Scotch and a Presbyterian." [...] She began to patronize the trip we were making, and to abuse it; she said that she did not see what could have induced them to undertake it; but one <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> from Niagara somehow, and they had been told at the hotel there that the boats were very comfortable. She had never been more uncomfortable in her life; as for the rapids, they made her ill, and they were obviously so dangerous that she should not even look at them again. Then, from having done all the talking and most of the eating, she fell quite silent, and gave her daughter a chance to speak to my wife. She had hitherto spoken only to her mother, but now she asked Mrs. March if she had ever been down the St. Lawrence before.|$|E
6000|$|... “Then I suppose we’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> once more,” said Phil. “Well, we’ve had a {{long enough}} vacation,—if {{you can call it}} such,” he added, with a grin.|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't be {{long now}} before we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Putnam Hall," [...] {{observed}} Sam, {{as they drove}} along. [...] "Dear old school! How I love it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not enough. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a {{government}} office and file your record before you're safe. Well, considering everything, I guess I'll {{start for the}} cache at sun-up." ...|$|R

5000|$|In Cuneta's version, its {{lyrics are}} {{delivered}} from a female point of view; the line [...] "I {{had to get}} home to the kids and the wife" [...] was changed to [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the kids and my life".|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Urals." [...] Sherikov {{grinned at}} her over his bushy black beard as he headed out of the room. [...] "Some very {{important}} business to attend to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yep," [...] was his answer. [...] "Too much fog {{might make}} us soggy. What we're after is betwixt an' between, an' we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> {{from the coast}} a ways to find it." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "An AFP {{reporter}} {{was able to}} access one wing of the military compound, where soldiers who refused to be quoted confirmed that the base was rebelling in protest at the regime’s repression of opposition demonstrations.
