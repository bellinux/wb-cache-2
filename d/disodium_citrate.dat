40|$|Background- In {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) alkalinisation of urine is a common practice, which may change or altered the effect of some antimicrobial treatment. Pefloxacin, a well-known fluoroquinolone used for treatment of {{urinary tract infection}} {{is found to be}} effective. On this background, the study was done to evaluate the effect of pefloxacin in presence of alkalinising agent. AIM - To evaluate the antimicrobial effect of pefloxacin both in presence and absence of alkalinising agent.   SETTINGS AND DESIGN- Prospective, interventional, randomized, assessor blind, fixed dose with two parallel treatment groups and unicentric.   RESULTS: Pefloxacin was effective in 100 % when used alone, but in presence of <b>disodium</b> hydrogen <b>citrate,</b> the urinary alkalinising agent solution, effectivity of pefloxacin came to 45. 71 %.   CONCLUSION To conclude, it is said that the efficacy of pefloxacin has been reduced after alkalinisation of urine.   KEY WORDS- UTI, Pefloxacin, <b>disodium</b> hydrogen <b>citrate</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, {{and safe}} {{extraction}} {{is a modern}} sample preparation method that involves a number of steps with a low susceptibility to error. The efficiency of a laboratory can be improved not only through labor reduction and consumable savings but also {{through the use of}} high-throughput methods and the reduction of wastes. In commercially available kits, different salts and buffers are mixed in anhydrous packages. The composition of these kits are optimized and fixed for particular applications by the suppliers. In this work three model compounds (ibuprofen and two of its main metabolites: hydroxyibuprofen and carboxyibuprofen) were chosen and the amount of each salt (magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, and <b>disodium</b> <b>citrate</b> sesquihydrate) in the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe content was optimized for three different soil samples (soils A, B, and C) with different organic carbon contents, using a 24 factorial design. The optimized extraction procedure was applied to 12 soil samples; ranging from river sediments to agricultural soils. Based on the analysis 100 samples, a price reduction of 5. 1 - (soil B), 5. 7 - (Soil C), and 6. 1 -fold (soil A) was achieved without compromising the performance of the method when compared to commercial kits. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Specialization for {{ecological}} niches is {{a balance of}} evolutionary adaptation and its accompanying tradeoffs. Here {{we focus on the}} Lenski Long-Term Evolution Experiment, which has maintained cultures of Escherichia coli in the same defined seasonal environment for 50, 000 generations. Over this time, much adaptation and specialization to the environment has occurred. The presence of citrate in the growth media selected one lineage to gain the novel ability to utilize citrate as a carbon source after 31, 000 generations. Here we test whether other strains have specialized to rely on citrate after 50, 000 generations. Results We show that in addition to the citrate-catabolizing strain, three other lineages evolving in parallel have acquired a dependence on citrate for optimal growth on glucose. None of these strains were stimulated indirectly by the sodium present in <b>disodium</b> <b>citrate,</b> nor exhibited even partial utilization of citrate as a carbon source. Instead, all three of these citrate-stimulated populations appear to rely on it as a chelator of iron. Conclusions The strains we examine here have evolved specialization to their environment through apparent loss of function. Our results are most consistent with the accumulation of mutations in iron transport genes that were obviated by abundant citrate. The results present another example where a subtle decision in the design of an evolution experiment led to unexpected evolutionary outcomes. </p...|$|E

Method: A total of 90 cases of patients with CRS were randomly divided into control group (n= 45) and observation group (n= 45) according to the lottery method. Both groups were treated with endoscopic sinus surgery. On the basis of this, control group was given Budesonide suspension and observation group was treated with Desloratadine <b>Citrate</b> <b>Disodium</b> combined with Budesonide suspension. The change of serum IgE, EOS and inflammatory factors were measured before and after operation in all subjects. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in IgE and EOS levels between control group and observation group before treatment. After treatment, the levels of serum IgE and EOS in the two groups were significantly lower than those before treatment. Moreover, after treatment, observation group was lower than control group, and the difference was significant.

40|$|I {{describe}} {{the use of}} latex agglutination as a simple readout for DNA hybridization assays. Latex agglutina-tion is a well-known readout for antibody-based diagnos-tics (1, 2) and uses “sandwich ” assay chemistry for which analogous DNA assays are well known (3, 4). Latex agglutination is extremely simple and chemically robust, and latex particles {{have been used as}} a label in DNA hybridization (5). Here I show that simple agglutination of particles is an efficient measure of DNA hybridization, one that is insensitive to the presence of proteases, deter-gents, and solvents. Cloned m 13 DNAs from the cytochrome f gene of Phormidium laminosum were kindly provided by Chris Howe (Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge, UK) (6). m 13 DNA was prepared essentially as described by Maniatis et al. (7). Polystyrene microparticles (5. 6 -mm polyvinylstyrene particles, density 1. 060 kg/L; 4. 5 -mm polystyrene/divinylbenzene particles, density 1. 100 kg/L) were obtained from Bangs Laboratories. Nitrocel-lulose filters were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemicals. DNA was cross-linked onto polystyrene, using 1 -ethyl- 3, 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide (EDAC), ac-cording to the methods of Nikiforov et al. (8) and Vary (9). Two milligrams of DNA was incubated overnight with 2 mg of EDAC and 25 mg of beads in a total volume of 330 mL of water at 18 °C. Another 10 mL of 0. 1 g/mL EDAC was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Coupled beads were washed three times in 0. 13 standard saline citrate (SSC; 13 SSC 5 8. 765 g of NaCl, 4. 1 g of <b>disodium</b> <b>citrate</b> per liter of water), stored at 4 °C. Parti-cles with a reduced surface density of DNA were pre-pared by reacting 2 mg of DNA with 2 mg of EDAC and 25 mg of beads in a total volume of 330 mL of water at 18 °C for 1 h; then the particles were washed. DNA was immobilized onto polystyrene plate surfaces using exactly the same protocol. All hybridizations were carried out in 53 SSC, 0. 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 60 °C in an orbital shaker.

40|$|Zosyn®, {{also known}} as Tazocin® for injection, {{contains}} piperacillin and tazobactam and {{was approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration in 1993 for the treatment of indicated serious infections. In 1995, United States Pharmacopoeia and European Pharmacopoeias reduced the particulate limit for injectables by 40 %, based on general safety concerns. Wyeth attempted to control sporadic batch failures (associated with increased particulate formation) by shortening product expiration dating from 36 to 24 months and optimizing the stopper siliconization process. These modifications did not correct the problem completely. Wyeth reformulated Zosyn by incorporating two stabilizing functional excipients, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA <b>disodium)</b> and sodium <b>citrate,</b> which solved the particulate formation problem. These two functional excipients also allowed for the first time Y-site coadministration of reformulated Zosyn product with amikacin and gentamicin at specific doses and concentrations, and with certain diluents, and the use of Ca++ ion-containing Lactated Ringer’s for admixture preparation. Reformulated Zosyn (approved 2005) may provide useful options of drug administration to healthcare professionals to lessen levels of particulates. Supportive data is provided for the expanded compatibility of reformulated Zosyn with different types of Ringer’s solutions used globally and for the Y-site coadministration of amikacin and gentamicin aminoglycosides...|$|R
40|$|Four {{batches of}} pasteurized process cheese were {{prepared}} {{from the same}} Cheddar cheese by cooking to 82 C {{in the presence of}} sodium <b>citrate,</b> <b>disodium</b> phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate or sodium aluminum phosphate. Each batch contained the same moisture (40. 6 %) and emulsifying salt concentration (2. 5 %). The process cheese was sampled for microstructural and rheological examination after 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min in the cooker at 82 C. Even though each emulsifying salt affected the physical properties of the process cheese differently, the cheese generally became firmer, stiffer, more elastic and less meltable as cooking time increased from 0 to 40 min. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dimension of fat masses and an increase in the degree of emulsification as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The degree of emulsification (fineness of fat particles) seemed directly related to firmness, poor meltability, toughness, breaking force, apparent stiffness modulus, degree of elasticity, apparent ultimate stress and inversely related to hysteresis and apparent ultimate strain. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate produced the most rapid emulsification of the fat in the cheese and sodium aluminum phosphate the slowest. The effect of the other salts was intermediate. The softest most meltable cheese was poorly emulsified while the firmest most sliceable was well emulsified. Sodium citrate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate crystals remained undissolved in the cheese after 40 min in the cooker while sodium aluminum phosphate crystals were still undissolved after 10 min. There was a close statistical relationship among several of the rheological measurements viz. meltability and firmness, toughness and breaking force, and meltability and breaking force. Future rheological studies on process cheese should not require all of the above measurements. An increase in the fineness of the fat emulsion as determined by scanning electron microscopy was generally accompanied by increased firmness, poorer meltability and increased toughness...|$|R
40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} cheese and milk gels are {{greatly influenced by}} molecular interactions between the casein proteins involving calcium. Novel experiments were designed to investigate the relationship between insoluble caseinbound cations and rheological properties of Cheddar cheese and rennet-induced milk gels. Cheddar cheese and rennet-induced milk gels were supplemented with Mg 2 + or Sr 2 + to compare their effects on their rheological properties to those previously reported in literature for Ca 2 + supplementation. Sr 2 + displayed behaviour similar to Ca 2 + as observed by its ability to increase the rigidity of cheese and rennet milk gels and also decrease cheese meltability. Mg+ 2 had no influence on cheese rheological properties and was greatly inferior to Ca 2 + and Sr 2 + {{in its ability to}} increase rennet milk gel elasticity. Cheddar cheese was supplemented with the calcium-chelating salts trisodium <b>citrate,</b> <b>disodium</b> hydrogen phosphate or disodium EDTA, in an attempt to reduce the CCP content of cheese and thereby modify its rheological and functional properties. TSC and EDTA were successful in decreasing cheese CCP, whereas DSP caused an initial increase in CCP content. Cheddar cheese was supplemented with chlorides of iron, copper and zinc at salting to investigate the effects of concentrations of these elements in excess of those found innately or commonly in fortification studies, with emphasis on mineral equilibria changes and resultant alteration of rheological properties. Zinc addition was the only added metal that significantly influenced cheese rheological properties, leading to an increase in cheese rigidity and decreased cheese melt at elevated temperatures. Gum tragacanth was used as a fat-replacer in the manufacture of reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, in an attempt to improve the rheological, functional and sensory properties of reduced-fat Cheddar. Overall, the experimental work reported in this thesis generated new knowledge and theories about how casein-mineral interactions influence rheological properties of casein systems...|$|R
40|$|Xylella fastidiosa Wells (Xf) 為一植物導管侷限細菌，可感染多種重要經濟作物並造成病害，如葡萄皮爾斯病 (Pierce''s disease, PD) ，自然界中，此菌可藉由昆蟲傳播。而在台灣，Xf則為梨葉緣焦枯病 (Pear {{leaf scorch}} disease, PLS) 及葡萄皮爾斯病 (Pierce''s disease, PD) 的病原菌。本實驗利用由台灣梨樹分離之Xylella fastidiosa菌株 PLS 235 、PLS 244 及由葡萄分離之PD 5 - 1 - 2 、GM菌株，分別對梨樹 (Pyrus pyrifolia) 、蟛蜞菊 (Wedelia trilobata) 、菸草 (Nicotiana tabacum) 及日日春 (Catharanthus roseus) 進行接種測試，以了解台灣分離之梨葉緣焦枯病菌與葡萄皮爾斯病菌是否能感染不同植物，以及病原菌可否在接種植物導管中移行。梨樹接種PLS及PD菌株之接種測試只於初次分離實驗中出現一次PCR正反應，並且無法從葉柄中分離出病原菌；蟛蜞菊之葉柄病原菌分離與PCR檢測結果皆為無檢出，顯示其並非Xylella fastidiosa之寄主；另菸草及日日春接種試驗中，四菌株皆分別有PCR 檢測正反應之樣本，且可從葉柄中成功分離病原菌，顯示台灣分離之 X. fastidiosa 可在菸草及日日春中生長並在導管中進行系統性移行。在實驗的過程中，發現上述四種接種的植物並未出現病徵，與接種水的對照組外觀上無明顯差異，可能與接種植物之生長環境與營養供給有關，又或許 Xf 菌株確實不會在這些測試植物中顯現病徵，而這些假設均需更進一步實驗才能證明。另外，為測試此四種菌株的培養營養需求，以Color {{changing}} units (CCU) 方式分別測試PD 2 培養基中的Succinate、Trisodium citrate、MgSO 4 、Hemin Cl及Bovine serum albumin (BSA) 是否為其生長必需成分。結果顯示PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 及GM等 Xf 菌株可在無添加succinate的培養基生長，但移除 PD 2 中的 MgSO 4 後，PLS 235 、PLS 244 及GM等菌株的生長狀況明顯較差，顯示在試管中培養 Xf 菌株時需添加適量 MgSO 4 。PD及PLS菌株於去除trisodium citrate之PD 2 培養基中生長狀況良好，顯示此成分可能並非生長必需物質。而在去除succinate及citrate的培養基中，細菌完全無法生長，但可以在添加malate或α-ketoglutarate後回復。在移除Bovine serum albumin (BSA) 的 PD 2 培養基，PLS 及 PD 菌株的生長明顯降低。測試不同濃度 BSA 對 Xf 菌株的生長時，發現降低 BSA 濃度至 0. 4 g/L 可促進細菌的生長。由營養需求測試結果可知 PLS 與 PD 菌株中存在菌株間生理及生化特性的差異，經由適當的調整培養基中的成分，可達到促進不同植物來源的Xf菌株在培養基上生長的目的。Xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterium (XLB); it causes many diseases {{on a wide}} host range of plant, including Pierce’s disease of grapevine. In nature, the bacterium is transmitted by insect vectors. In Taiwan, Xylella fastidiosa is the causal bacterium of pear leaf scorch disease (PLS) and Pierce’s disease (PD). To understand if the bacterium infects other plants, i. e. it can migrate within the xylem vessels or cause Xf-elicited disease symptoms, X. fastidiosa pear strains PLS 235, PLS 244 and grape strain PD 5 - 1 - 2 and GM were used to inoculate pear (Pyrus pyrifolia), periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and wedelia (Wedelia trilobata) by stem-stabbing method {{to find out the}} possible alternative hosts of X. fastidiosa in Taiwan. The inoculation of pear with PLS and PD strains showed only one PCR positive result in the first recovery of pear petioles, and no bacteria can be re-isolated from the inoculated pears. In wedelia, PLS bacteria cannot be detected by PCR in or recovered from petiole elutents, indicating that wedelia is not a host of PLSB. The results of PCR detection and bacterial isolation showed that X. fastidiosa strain PLS 235, PLS 244, PD 5 - 1 - 2 and GM can infected and migrate within the xylem vessels of tobacco and periwinkle plants, indicating that tobacco and periwinkle might be alternative host plants of Taiwan-isolated X. fastidiosa. However, Xf strains did not elicit apparent disease symptom on tobacco or periwinkle, which might be due to the inappropriate environmental conditions where the inoculated plants were kept. For testing in-vitro nutrient requirements of PD and PLS bacteria, a color changing unit (CCU) method was applied to test the ingredients of <b>disodium</b> succinate, trisodium <b>citrate,</b> MgSO 4, hemin Cl and bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PD 2 medium. The results showed that all tested Xf strains can grow in PD 2 medium without succinate, but the growth of PLS 235, PLS 244 and GM strains of Xf were greatly compromised without the addition of MgSO 4, indicating that MgSO 4 is essential for culturing Xf. In the modified PD 2 medium without succinate and citrate, bacterial growth was completely halted, and the growth can be restored by replacing succinate and citrate with malate or α-ketoglutarate. Removal of bovine serum albumin (BSA) from PD 2 medium compromised the Xf growth. Moreover, the concentration of BSA in PD 2 medium can be adjusted to 0. 4 g/L to promote the growth of PLS bacteria. Taken together, the nutrient requirement tests reveal strain-specific physiological and biochemical properties among Xf PLS and PD bacteria. Adjustment of the nutrients will optimize the formulation of a culture medium to promote the growth of Xf bacteria from different plant hosts. 中文摘要 [...] i 英文摘要 [...] -iii 目錄 [...] v 表目錄 [...] -vii 圖目錄 [...] viii 前言 [...] 01 一、病原菌Xylella fastidiosa之源起 [...] - 01 二、病原菌Xylella fastidiosa之分類、寄主、分佈及傳播 [...] 01 三、Xylella fastidiosa之生長及培養特性 [...] 02 四、台灣梨葉緣焦枯病之沿革 [...] 03 五、台灣葡萄皮爾斯病之沿革 [...] 04 六、實驗目的 [...] - 05 材料與方法 [...] - 07 一、寄主植物接種測試 [...] - 07 (一) 病原菌保存與製備 [...] - 07 (二) 測試植物之種類與製備 [...] - 07 (三) 病原菌之接種 [...] - 07 1. 梨樹接種試驗 [...] - 08 2. 蟛蜞菊接種試驗 [...] 08 3. 菸草接種試驗 [...] - 08 4. 日日春接種試驗 [...] 09 (四) 植物組織分離及PCR檢測病原菌 [...] - 09 1. 由植物組織分離病原菌 [...] 09 2. 由植物組織中萃取DNA [...] - 09 3. 聚合酶連鎖反應(Polymerase chain reaction, PCR) 與電泳分析 [...] 10 二、營養需求測試 [...] - 10 (一) 細菌懸浮液製備 [...] - 10 (二) 培養基製備 [...] 11 (三) 營養需求測試 [...] 11 1. 生長必需成分測試 [...] - 11 2. 必需營養成分最適濃度測試 [...] - 11 結果 [...] 13 一、寄主植物接種測試 [...] 13 二、營養需求測試 [...] - 14 三、BSA濃度調整測試 [...] - 15 討論 [...] 16 參考文獻 [...] 21 圖表 [...] 26 附錄 [...] - 41 表目錄 表一、蟛蜞菊接種Xylella fastidiosa之PCR檢測及病原菌分離結果 [...] - 26 表二、菸草接種Xylella fastidiosa之PCR檢測及病原菌分離結果 [...] 27 表三、日日春接種Xylella fastidiosa之PCR檢測及病原菌分離結果 [...] - 29 表四、本實驗使用之引子對 [...] 30 表五、Xylella fastidiosa PD及PLS菌株之營養需求測試結果 [...] - 31 表六、Xylella fastidiosa PD及PLS菌株之營養需求測試結果 [...] - 32 表七、PD 2 medium 添加不同濃度牛血清蛋白 (BSA) 對Xylella fastidiosa PLS菌株生長的影響 (CCU/mL) [...] - 33 圖目錄 圖一、以不含Disodium succinate之PD 2 培養基測試X. fastidiosa PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 與GM四菌株之培養基變色情形 [...] - 34 圖二、以不含MgSO 4 之PD 2 培養基測試X. fastidiosa PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 與GM四菌株之培養基變色情形 [...] 35 圖三、以不含BSA之PD 2 培養基測試X. fastidiosa PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 及GM菌株之培養基變色情形 [...] - 36 圖四、以不含Trisodium citrate之PD 2 培養基測試X. fastidiosa PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 及GM菌株之培養基變色情形 [...] - 37 圖五、以不含Hemin Cl之PD 2 培養基測試X. fastidiosa PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 及GM菌株之培養基變色情形 [...] - 38 圖六、以去除succinate及trisodium citrate並加入malate (1 g/L) 之PD 2 培養基測試X. fastidiosa PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 及GM菌株的培養基試管變色情形 [...] 39 圖七、以去除succinate及trisodium citrate並加入α-ketoglutarate (1 g/L) 之PD 2 培養基測試X. fastidiosa PLS 235 、PLS 244 、PD 5 - 1 - 2 及GM菌株的培養基試管變色情形 [...] - 4...|$|R
