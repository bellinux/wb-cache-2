40|$|Background: The United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS of 2006 {{stressed}} the need to strengthen policy and programme linkages between HIV and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). However, the effectiveness and best practices for strengthening SRH and HIV linkages are poorly researched {{in the context of}} <b>family-planning</b> <b>services.</b> In Cape Town, HIV-prevention services have been integrated into <b>family-planning</b> <b>services.</b> There are two models of service configuration: dedicated stand-alone reproductive health clinics and family planning services located in comprehensive primary-care facilities. Objective: To describe how reproductive health services are integrating HIV prevention and care strategies and to measure the coverage and quality of these integrated services. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using structured interviews with facility managers; a facility-based checklist; and a patient record review to assess the availability of resources, training, access, quality and integration. Results: Facilities in Cape Town are equipped adequately to offer integrated HIV-prevention and SRH services. Overall there was poor coverage of integrated services with 54 % of family planning clients having a known HIV status; 47 % being screened for a sexually transmitted infection and 55 % being offered HIV counselling and testing and receiving condoms. Quality and continuity of care seemed better at the dedicated clinics than at the comprehensive facilities,supported by better training coverage. Conclusion: Engaging middle-level management is crucial with regard to improving integration within a well-resourced setting. </p...|$|E

The second and third generation of Latino immigrants have historically not faired {{as well as their}} foreign-born parents on many health measures, such as life expectancy, unplanned pregnancy and drug use. To better prepare the children of immigrants for life in the U. S., we need to provide resources to their parents. As part of a larger study on <b>family-planning</b> <b>service</b> acquisition, 100 male and 100 female Latino immigrants in Boone County, Mo., were queried about their concerns regarding children raised in the U. S. and their intentions for addressing sexual-behavior issues with their children. This presentation will first describe demographic characteristics of the respondents, such as level of acculturation, education, age and gender, that might affect their views on how to educate their children. These demographic variables will then be related to how immigrants perceive the context of reception for childrearing in the U. S. Then, the respondents? views on the importance of discussing various sexual issues with their children will be presented. Finally, the role of the family and other social institutions in educating children about sexual issues will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{ascertain}} {{the perspectives of}} <b>family-planning</b> <b>service</b> providers in eight sites in China on the provision of sexual and reproductive health services to unmarried young people. METHODS: Data were drawn from a survey of 1927 family-planning workers and 16 focus group discussions conducted in eight sites in China in 1998 - 99. FINDINGS: Family-planning workers {{recognized the need to}} protect the sexual health of unmarried young people and were unambiguous about the need for government agencies to provide information and education on sexual and reproductive health to unmarried young people; however, perceptions about the appropriate age for and content of such education remained conservative. While about 70 % of family-planning workers were willing to provide contraceptives to unmarried young people, and about 60 % approved government provision of contraceptive services to unmarried young people, only one quarter agreed that the services could be extended to senior high schools. CONCLUSION: Family-planning workers in China are ambivalent about the provision of sexual and reproductive health services to unmarried young people, which potentially poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of safe sex behaviours by young people, {{as well as to the}} provision of sexual and reproductive health information and services to young unmarried people in China. Training programmes for family-planning workers are urgently needed to address this issue...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Low {{frequency}} of effective contraceptive use remains a challenging problem. This {{article examines the}} {{frequency of}} effective postpartum contraception and the methods used before discharge in public hospitals in Guatemala. It also discusses the need to implement best practices in providing <b>family-planning</b> and contraceptive <b>services.</b> Methods. In March 2006, a surveillance system was implemented {{to collect data on}} the initia-tion of effective contraceptive methods. Postpartum women were monitored in 34 public hospitals. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed, and a chi-square test for linear trends was used to compare female surgical sterilization rates after vaginal delivery and cesarean section. Results. Between 1 March 2006 and 31 December 2008, of the 218 656 women who had a postpartum event, 31 % received an effective contraceptive method before hospital discharge. The frequency of initiation of effective postpartum methods varied across hospitals. Hospital results were consistent with national data on women of reproductive age. Among women who underwent surgical sterilization, differences between those who had delivered vaginally and those who had a cesarean section were statistically significant. Conclusions. The overall frequency of initiation of effective postpartum contraceptive us...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} time price on medical-care demand and describes use of a reservation-wage question from a household survey to develop a measure of time price for obtaining medical care. A comprehensive three-equation model of the demand for female medical-care services examines choice of provider, entry demand, {{and the demand for}} physician visits. Results show that provider choice is based primarily on economic factors and that an expected high time price discourages women from choosing a public provider and from seeking gynecological, maternal-health, or <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> during the year, yet does not influence the number of visits made once care is used. The estimated model shows that medical-care demand equations should control for the type of provider chosen and the opportunity cost of time for alternative activities when testing for a negative time price effect of obtaining medical care. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo assess safety {{associated}} with tubal ligation performed by trained clinical officers (COs) in rural Uganda. MethodsBetween March and June 2012, 518 women in 4 regions of Uganda were recruited into a prospective cohort study and followed at days 3, 7, and 45 after undergoing tubal ligation {{performed by a}} trained CO. Intraoperative and postoperative adverse events (minor, moderate, or major), and acceptability were assessed. ResultsMean age was 36 years (range, 20 – 49 years) and mean number of living children was 6. 7 (range, 0 – 15). The overall rate of major adverse events was 1. 5 %: 0. 4 % intraoperatively; 1. 9 % at day 3; and 0. 2 % at day 7. The majority of women who underwent tubal ligation reported a good/very good experience at the facility (range, 94 %– 99 %) and would recommend the health services to a friend (range, 93 %– 98 %). ConclusionIn the present study, task sharing of tubal ligation to trained COs in private facilities was safe. Women reported high levels of satisfaction with the procedure. Training COs could be an effective strategy for expanding <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> to rural Uganda...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} several decades those engaged in shaping the Program of Action {{documents}} at international conferences on population have muted their voices when the topic of abortion has been raised. In a desire to side-step entanglement in a bitter debate over the morality of abortion, great care has been taken to define "family planning" in ways that explicitly exclude abortion. The "common-ground" approach to treating abortion can be summarized in two directives found in all contemporary international population documents: "in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning"; and all governments should work "to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved <b>family-planning</b> <b>services.</b> " This article has three goals: first, to examine the appropriateness of these directives with respect to what is currently known about the relationship between abortion, family planning, and population policy; second, to trace how this "contraception-only" definition of family planning became de rigueur at international population conferences; and third, to discuss the prospects for the emergence of a more appropriate "common-ground" approach to abortion and population policy.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between desire for children and subsequent abortions in the treatment and comparison areas of Matlab, where ICDDR,B: Centre for Health and Population Research has been maintaining a Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) since 1966. The women at risk of pregnancy, interviewed in the In-depth- 1984 (Cohort- 84) and KAP- 1990 (Cohort- 90) surveys, were followed for five years through the DSS to ascertain their subsequent pregnancy outcomes. The desire for children was negatively associated with the risk of subsequent abortion in recent years. The number of abortions was higher in the comparison area than in the treatment area and increased over time in both the areas among those who wanted no more children. Among the sample women, one in five abortees had repeated abortions in the comparison area, but none had repeated abortions in the treatment area. The other factors associated with high risk of abortion were: old age, education, Hindu religion, and use of contraceptives (at the time of survey). The findings suggest that targeting {{women who want to}} limit family size with high-quality <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> would reduce the incidence of once and repeated abortions...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to review the {{experience}} with the existing user-fee (pricing) strategies and examine the socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with payment behaviour among contraceptors in urban Bangladesh for selected contraceptive methods, such as injectables, pill, and condom. Data for the study were drawn from a {{survey of more than}} 5, 000 married women of reproductive age in Zone 3 of Dhaka city, Bangladesh, within the sample frame of the Urban Panel Survey of the ICDDR,B's former Urban MCH-FP Extension Project. The findings of the study showed that most (80 %) urban contraceptors have been paying for selected <b>family-planning</b> <b>services.</b> This indicates the existence of a notable demand for contraceptives which suggests that there is scope for improved financial sustainability of the family-planning programme through charging appropriate user-fees for contraceptives with proper analyses of willingness-to-pay among the contraceptors and price elasticities of demand. Higher socioeconomic status of households, marked by higher levels of education and house rent, and location of residence in non-slum areas, is predictive of paying for contraception.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether the quality of post-menstrual regulation <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> (post-MRFP) affected contraceptive use at 3 -month follow-up. Methods 915 women who received post-MRFP in 2 public and 1 NGO clinics in a district in Bangladesh were interviewed to obtain information on service quality and other characteristics. Quality was scored based on 21 items and the score divided into 3 categories: low (0 – 6); medium (7 – 11); and high (12 – 21). Three months after menstrual regulation, 902 {{of the women were}} interviewed at their residence or a clinic and contraceptive status was recorded. Adjusted odd ratios (aORs) for using contraception were calculated via multivariate logistic regression. ResultsContraceptive use was positively correlated with the level of service quality, with 78 % use among women who received the lowest-quality care and 92 % use among women who received the highest-quality care. The aOR for contraceptive use was 1. 80 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 11 – 2. 93) among women who received moderate-quality services and 3. 01 (95 % CI, 1. 43 – 6. 37) among women receiving high-quality services compared with those who received poor-quality services.

40|$|Human {{consumption}} is depleting the Earth’s {{natural resources and}} impairing the capacity of life-supporting ecosystems. Humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively over the past 50 years than during any other period, primarily to meet increasing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fibre and fuel. Such consumption, together with world population increasing from 2. 6 billion in 1950 to 6. 8 billion in 2009, are major contributors to environmental damage. Strengthening <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> is crucial to slowing population growth, now 78 million annually, and limiting population size to 9. 2 billion by 2050. Otherwise, birth rates could remain unchanged, and world population would grow to 11 billion. Of particular concern are the 80 million annual pregnancies (38 % of all pregnancies) that are unintended. More than 200 million women in developing countries prefer to delay their pregnancy, or stop bearing children altogether, but rely on traditional, less-effective methods of contraception or use no method because they lack access or face other barriers to using contraception. Family-planning programmes have a successful track record of reducing unintended pregnancies, thereby slowing population growth. An estimated $ 15 billion per year is needed for family-planning programmes in developing countries and donors should provide at least $ 5 billion of the total, however, current donor assistance {{is less than a}} quarter of this funding target...|$|E
40|$|Background: Namibia bears a large {{burden of}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and the youth are disproportionately affected. Objectives: To explore the current knowledge, attitudes and {{behaviour}} of female adolescents attending family planning to HIV prevention. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was {{used on a}} sample 251 unmarried female adolescents aged from 13 years to 19 years accessing primary care services for contraception using an interviewer- administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using Epi Info 2002. Crude associations were assessed using cross-tabulations of knowledge, attitude and behaviour scores against demographic variables. Chi-square tests and odds ratios {{were used to assess}} associations from the cross-tabulations. All p-values < 0. 05 were considered statisticallysignificant. Results: A quarter of sexually active teenagers attending the <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> did not have adequate knowledge of HIV prevention strategies. Less than a quarter (23. 9 %) always used a condom. Most respondents (83. 3 %) started sexual intercourse when older than 16 years, but only 38. 6 % used a condom at their sexual debut. The older the girls were at sexual debut, the more likely they were to use a condom for the event (8 % did so at age 13 years and 100 % atage 19 years). Conclusions: Knowledge of condom use as an HIV prevention strategy did not translate into consistent condom use. One alternate approach in family-planning facilities may be to encourage condom use as a dual protection method. Delayed onset of sexual activity and consistent use of condoms should be encouraged amongst schoolchildren, in the school setting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background During 1982 – 1992, the Maternal and Child Health Family Planning (MCH-FP) Extension Project (Rural) of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), in {{partnership}} with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), implemented a series of interventions in Sirajganj Sadar sub-district of Sirajganj district. These interventions were aimed at improving the planning mechanisms and for reviewing the problem-solving processes to build an effective monitoring system of the interventions at the local level of the overall system of the MOHFW, GoB. Methods The interventions included development and testing of innovative solutions in service-delivery, provision of door-step injectables, and strengthening of the management information system (MIS). The impact of an in-built monitoring system on the overall performance was assessed during the period from June 1995 to December 1996, after the withdrawal of the interventions in 1992. Results The results of the assessment showed that Family Welfare Assistants (FWAs) increased household-visits within the last two months, and there was a higher use of service-delivery points even after the withdrawal of the interventions. The results of the cluster surveys, conducted in 1996, showed that the selected indicators of health and <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> were higher than those reported by the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 1996 – 1997. During June 1995 -December, 1996, the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) increased by 13 percentage points (i. e. from 40 % to 53 %). Compared to the national CPR (49 %), this increase was statistically significant (p Conclusion The in-built monitoring systems, including effective MIS, accompanied by rapid assessments and review of performance by the programme managers, have potentials to improve family planning performance in low-performing areas. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introducing the post-coital {{birth control}} method in the <b>family-planning</b> <b>services</b> of Latin American {{countries}} {{has not been}} an easy task. Catholic and other conservative groups with great influence in the political arena have time and again stopped it from being adopted as an alternative method and have even succeeded in having it removed from official directives after formal acceptance by health authorities. The main objections are triggered by the erroneous supposition that "emergency contraception" pills are abortifacients. However, a large dose of cultural discrimination against women seems also to be involved. It has been extremely difficult to register dedicated products and make them available in drugstores and even more difficult to distribute them without charge at public health centers. They are hard to find, expensive, and unavailable to adolescents at risk for unwanted pregnancies and to most low-income women, especially in rural areas. Dissemination of appropriate information has been scarce and slow and there are still great numbers of people that do not understand how or why the method works. Brazil has been the only exception, as its open society has readily accepted this method of contraception. The Latin American Consortium on Emergency Contraception founded in the year 2000 and its regional conference two years later had an important impact on the situation, as they encouraged the coordination of efforts by governmental and nongovernmental entities with those of women's groups to fight for sexual and reproductive rights. A number of {{studies have shown that the}} more people learn about emergency contraception, the more they find it acceptable and necessary, and radio spots and other media techniques have begun to educate the public about this matter. In spite of the many difficulties encountered, in the last few years several countries have made strides to include this method in their public health guidelines. However, because of the powerful forces against it, accessibility and distribution of the emergency pills are not always implemented as planned and there are still many areas that require work. Details are given on the situation in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru...|$|E
40|$|Bangladesh is {{distinct}} among developing countries in achieving a low maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 322 per 100, 000 livebirths despite the very low use of skilled care at delivery (13 % nationally). This variation {{has also been}} observed in Matlab, a rural area in Bangladesh, where longitudinal data on maternal mortality are available since the mid- 1970 s. The current study investigated the possible causes of the maternal mortality decline in Matlab. The study analyzed 769 maternal deaths and 215, 779 pregnancy records from the Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) and other sources of safe motherhood data in the ICDDR,B and government service areas in Matlab during 1976 - 2005. The major interventions {{that took place in}} both the areas since the early 1980 s were the family-planning programme plus safe menstrual regulation services and safe motherhood interventions (midwives for normal delivery in the ICDDR,B service area from the late 1980 s and equal access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care [EmOC] in public facilities for women from both the areas). National programmes for social development and empowerment of women through education and microcredit programmes were implemented in both the areas. The quantitative findings were supplemented by a qualitative study by interviewing local community care providers for their change in practices for maternal healthcare over time. After the introduction of the safe motherhood programme, reduction in maternal mortality was higher in the ICDDR,B service area (68. 6 %) than in the government service area (50. 4 %) during 1986 - 1989 and 2001 - 2005. Reduction in the number of maternal deaths due to the fertility decline was higher in the government service area (30 %) than in the ICDDR,B service area (23 %) during 1979 - 2005. In each area, there has been substantial reduction in abortion-related mortality— 86. 7 % and 78. 3 %—in the ICDDR,B and government service areas respectively. Education of women was a strong predictor of the maternal mortality decline in both the areas. Possible explanations for the maternal mortality decline in Matlab are: better access to comprehensive EmOC services, reduction in the total fertility rate, and improved education of women. To achieve the Millenium Development Goal 5 targets, policies that bring further improved comprehensive EmOC, strengthened <b>family-planning</b> <b>services,</b> and expanded education of females are essential...|$|E
