Trace levels of OCs were observed in the Santana reservoir (44. 8 ng g- 1 d. w. of p,p'-DDT), while in the Funil reservoir the levels were below detection level. Forty-eight percent of the found sigmaocs were polychlorinated biphenyls, 29 % dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), 18 % Drins, and 5 % other pesticides (HCB, Heptachlor, <b>Heptachlor-epoxide,</b> gamma-HCH and a-Endosulfan).

40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) and {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) residue levels were determined in 53 unhatched eggs from greater roseus flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber). Eggs {{were collected in}} 1996 from the National Park of Doñana (Guadalquivir marshes, Southwest Spain), immediately after one breeding colony abandoned the nesting site due to predator attacks. The main metabolite of p,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDE, was the OCP residue found at higher concentrations, with a geometric mean of 721 ng/g wet weight. Residues of other pesticides, including some hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, hexachlorobenzene, aldrin, heptachlor, and <b>heptachlor-epoxide,</b> were detected at much lower concentrations. The sum of PCBs was 528 ng/g, with PCB congeners # 187 and # 153 being the most prominent in eggs. The pattern observed in these compounds of industrial origin corresponded more to Aroclor 1260 than to any other commercial mixture. Levels of organochlorine residues indicate a medium degree of exposure, {{and they are not}} considered of any concern for the flamingo population. In particular, neither p,p′-DDE nor PCB levels were found to be correlated with the eggshell thickness. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Inc. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Levels of {{persistent}} organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined {{in the blood}} serum of people {{living and working in}} the urban area of greater Rio de Janeiro city. Blood samples from 33 volunteers (16 males, 17 females, 19 - 63 years old) were taken in January 1999. OCP residues (op'DDT, pp'DDT, pp'DDD, pp'DDE, Aldrin, Dieldrin, Endrin, Heptachlor, <b>Heptachlor-epoxide,</b> alpha-, beta- and gamma-Hexachlorocyclo-hexane, Hexachlorobenzene) and PCBs (congeners: 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) were extracted with n-hexane and analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Except for pp'DDE (detection limit = 1. 4 µg/L) no other OCP residue was found in the samples. No PCB congener (detection limit = 2. 0 µg/L) was detected either. pp'DDE was found in 17 out of 33 samples in concentrations that ranged from 1. 4 to 8. 4 µg/L of serum or, on a fat basis, from 0. 200 to 3. 452 µg/g of serum lipids.

DDT, HCH and its metabolites found most dominating while Endrin, Dieldrin and Heptachlor recorded higher among the fifteen monitored pesticides in Damb (Sonmiani) coastal water. All these pesticides are found below the chronic concentration levels as {{set by the}} Coastal Water Quality Criteria for Washington State. HCH and Heptachlor were observed to behighest in the coastal sediments of Damb (Sonmiani) coastal area and these values are higher than the Canadian Interim Sediment Quality Standard. DDT, Endosulfan, its metabolites and isomers detected high concentration in marine biota, while α-BHC, Heptachlor and Endrin were also detected in low concentration.

40|$|AbstractIn {{an attempt}} to {{evaluate}} the toxicological condition of the Egyptian Mediterranean Sea from El-Sallum to El-Arish, 10 surficial sediment samples were collected from different locations covering the region that receives {{the majority of the}} industrial, agricultural and urban effluents (land-based activities), and thus is expected to be contaminated with different degrees of pollution. Sediment samples were analyzed for PCBs (PCB 18, 28, 44, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180 and 194), and organochlorine pesticides (α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, δ-HCH, heptachlor, methoxychlor, <b>heptachlor-epoxide,</b> aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde, endrin ketone, γ-chlordane, α-endosulfane, β-endosulfane, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDT). The investigated sediments were dominated by the sand fraction, except Rosetta station. The concentration of organic pollutants in sediments followed the order: Total cyclodienes>PCBs>DDTs>HCHs. Sediments were dominated by the metabolites of DDT (DDD and DDE) indicating that the detected DDTs in the bay sediments are not recently introduced into the bay. At the same time, DDE concentrations were higher than DDD in all the sediment samples (except El-Sallum and Sidi-Kreer) indicating oxic conditions. The risk assessment for organic pollutants were studied, indicating a greater possibility of the occurrence of toxic adverse ecological effects with respect to all investigated organic pollutants and frequent toxic effect is expected for lindane and p,p′-DDT...|$|E
40|$|Water is {{a crucial}} natural resource, {{indispensable}} to food production, life, the environment, power generation, industry, sanitation and hygiene. The presence of Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) in the environment is not wanted due to their negative effects on human beings and animals. As a result, {{there is a need}} to continuously monitor their presence in the environment. In this study, surface water samples were collected once a month during the dry season and during wet season from the selected five points along the Olifants River and stored at a temperature of < 50 C before analysis. The OCPs were extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) using the Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE) method. After undertaking the sample through the clean- up process, the crude extracts obtained were put into the column chromatography and eluted with hexane, about 1. 5 μL of the purified extracts were analysed by the Gas Chromatographic- Mass Spectrophotometer (GC/MS). The percentage recoveries, varied from 32 - 116 % for p, p’-DDT and 4, 4 '-DDD respectively in triply spiked water samples. The standard deviation for most of the compounds is less than± 0. 04, with the exclusion of Heptachlor (± 0. 14). The seasonal variability of OCPs in water samples along Olifants River results show that in dry season, the Olifants River is mostly polluted at the Oxford site with (BHC-beta, Aldrin, <b>Heptachlor-epoxide,</b> Endosulfan-alpha and Endrin), at the Ga- Selati site with (<b>Heptachlor-epoxide</b> and Endrin) and at the Wolvekrans site with (Endosulfan-alpha), with Aldrin up to 834. 20 ng/ L indicating the highest hazard toward the aquatic environment while in summer the Olifants River is mostly polluted at the Ga- selati site with BHC-beta and at the Waterval site with (Heptachlor and BHC-gamma) with BHC- gamma up to 560 ng/ L indicating the highest hazard toward the aquatic environment. The levels reached from the Olifants River catchment were meaningfully above the drinking water quality guidelines for organic chemical recommended by WHO, 2006 i. e. (BHC-gamma,DDT- 44, Aldrin, dieldrin and Endrin are (2. 0, 1. 0, 0. 03, 0. 03 and 0. 6) respectively for the protection of the domestic use, aquatic ecology and agricultural use (irrigation and livestock watering) for compounds with local guideline values; while, the international water quality guidelines to protect the aquatic ecosystems are 0. 00083 ng/mℓ (4, 4 ’DDD), 0. 00059 ng/mL (4, 4 ’DDE), (4, 4 ’DDT), 0. 00021 ng/mL (heptachlor), 0. 0092 ng/mℓ (α-HCH), 0. 0186 ng/mL (γ- HCH), and chronic values are 0. 056 ng/mL (ENDO I and II) and 0. 0023 ng/mL endrin) (USEPA, 2002).

OCP residues (op'DDT pp'DDT, pp'DDD, pp'DDE, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, <b>heptachlor-epoxide,</b> alpha-, beta- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, and hexachlorobenzene) were analyzed by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. Tests detected pp'DDE in 16 out of 26 samples, but pp'DDE concentration exceeded 1. 4 µg/L (i. e. 1. 8, 2. 4 and 4. 4 µg/L) in only 3 of these. beta-HCH was found in 6 (23. 1 %) out of 26 samples. In one sample beta-HCH did not exceed 1. 4 µg/L, but in the remaining samples concentrations ranged from 1. 4 to 5. 3 µg/L. The percentage of positive pp'DDE samples increased from the youngest (£ 29 yrs: 30. 0 %) to the oldest age group (&sup 3; 40 yrs: 100 %).

40|$|Since Ethiopia {{is going}} through a rapid {{transformation}} of its agricultural sector, we assessed the human health and environmental risks due to the past use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) as well as the risks of the current pesticide use by farmers. A monitoring programme and risk assessment was carried out for the Wedecha-Belbela irrigation system in the Debra Zeit area. The Wedecha and Belbela rivers and adjacent temporary ponds were sampled and examined for the presence of OCPs between August and October 2014, while data on the current pesticide use by small- and large-scale farmers was collected by interviews. The usage patterns were evaluated for risks of using the river or temporary ponds as source of drinking water and for risks for the aquatic ecosystems in the river and ponds with the aid of the PRIMET_Registration_Ethiopa_ 1. 1 model. The samples were collected in five sampling periods, and results indicate that most of the 18 target OCPs were not detected above the detection limit, while g-chlordane may pose chronic risks when surface water is used as drinking water. Endosulfan and heptachlor pose risks to aquatic organisms at second-tier level, while for <b>heptachlor-epoxide</b> B, g-chlordane and b-BHC only risks could be determined at the first tier {{due to a lack of}} data. For all nine pesticides used by small-scale farmers the calculated acute risks to humans were low.
