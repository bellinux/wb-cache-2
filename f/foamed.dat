50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>foam</b> that can form from this process. They are wet <b>foam</b> (or kugelschaum) and dry <b>foam</b> (or polyederschaum). Wet <b>foam</b> tends to form at the lower portion of the <b>foam</b> column, while dry <b>foam</b> tends to form at the upper portion. The wet <b>foam</b> is more spherical and viscous, and the dry <b>foam</b> tends to be larger in {{diameter}} and less viscous. Wet <b>foam</b> forms closer to the originating liquid, while dry <b>foam</b> develops at the outer boundaries. As such, what most people usually understand as <b>foam</b> is actually only dry <b>foam.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Foam</b> {{fraction}} can be {{retrieved from}} space-based microwave radiometric data at frequencies from 1 to 37 GHz. The retrievals require modeling of ocean surface emissivity fully covered with sea <b>foam.</b> To model <b>foam</b> emissivity well, knowledge of <b>foam</b> properties, both mechanical and dielectric, is necessary because these control the radiative processes in <b>foam.</b> We present a physical description of <b>foam</b> dielectric properties {{obtained from the}} <b>foam</b> dielectric constant including <b>foam</b> skin depth; <b>foam</b> impedance; wavelength variations in <b>foam</b> thickness, roughness of <b>foam</b> layer interfaces with air and seawater; and <b>foam</b> scattering parameters such as size parameter, and refraction index. Using these, we analyze the scattering, absorption, reflection and transmission in <b>foam</b> and gain insights into why volume scattering in <b>foam</b> is weak; why the main absorption losses are confined to the wet portion of the foam; how the <b>foam</b> impedance matching provides the transmission of electromagnetic radiation in <b>foam</b> and maximizes the absorption; {{and what is the}} potential for surface scattering at the <b>foam</b> layers boundaries. We put all these elements together and offer a conceptual understanding for the high, black-body-like emissivity of <b>foam</b> floating on the sea surface. We also consider possible scattering regimes in <b>foam...</b>|$|R

During the last decade polymers (mainly polyelectrolytes and proteins) have become frequently used additives to <b>foaming</b> solutions.

The nature of surfactant–polymer interactions is complicated and prediction of resulting <b>foaming</b> properties of such formulations is not straightforward.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the processing, morphology, mechanical properties, and acoustic properties of new polymeric <b>foam</b> materials. A batch <b>foaming</b> process, a rotational mold <b>foaming</b> process and a constrained mold <b>foaming</b> process were designed and {{applied in the}} producing of polymeric <b>foams.</b> Microcellular closed cell polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) <b>foams</b> were produced using the batch <b>foaming</b> process. The <b>foam</b> morphologies and mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break were investigated by varying the <b>foaming</b> parameters. The PMMA microcellular <b>foam</b> showed superior mechanical properties in tensile strength and elongation at break over conventional <b>foams.</b> Nanoclay was used as reinforcement filler and a nucleation agent for PMMA in the batch <b>foaming</b> process. The nanoclay affected the <b>foaming</b> behavior and enhanced the mechanical properties of the microcellular PMMA <b>foams.</b> The PMMA nanocomposite <b>foam</b> with 0. 5 wt % nanoclay exhibited optimized mechanical properties. Fine celled Polypropylene (PP) and low density Polyethylene (LDPE) <b>foams</b> were also produced using the rotational mold <b>foaming.</b> The processing parameters such as the particle sizes and processing time were important parameters in this process. The obtained PP <b>foam</b> exhibited a greatly improved energy absorption capacity. Opened cell PMMA <b>foams</b> were produced using a particulate leaching/gas <b>foaming</b> method for acoustic absorption applications. The <b>foam</b> morphology i. e. porosity and cell sizes were independently controlled by altering the processing settings. Consequently, the acoustic performance of the <b>foams</b> was manipulated. Finite element analysis was then employed to predict the macroscopic properties of polymeric <b>foams</b> correlated to their microstructure. The predicted elastic responses of both opened cell and closed cell <b>foams</b> showed great agreement with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at elucidating some {{important}} parameters affecting the cellular morphology of poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) /clay nanocomposite <b>foams</b> prepared with the supercritical CO 2 technology. Prior to <b>foaming</b> experiments, the SAN/CO 2 system has first been studied. The effect of nanoclay on CO 2 sorption/desorption rate into/from SAN is assessed with a gravimetric method. Ideal saturation conditions are then deduced {{in view of}} the <b>foaming</b> process. Nanocomposites <b>foaming</b> has first been performed with the one-step <b>foaming</b> process, also called depressurization <b>foaming.</b> <b>Foams</b> with different cellular morphology have been obtained depending on nanoclay dispersion level and <b>foaming</b> conditions. While <b>foaming</b> at low temperature (40 °C) leads to <b>foams</b> with the highest cell density (1012 – 1014 cells/cm 3), the <b>foam</b> expansion is restricted (d 0. 7 – 0. 8 g/cm 3). This drawback has been overcome {{with the use of the}} two-step <b>foaming</b> process, also called solid-state <b>foaming,</b> where <b>foam</b> expansion occurs during sample dipping in a hot oil bath (d 0. 1 – 0. 5 g/cm 3). Different <b>foaming</b> parameters have been varied, and some schemes have been drawn to summarize the characteristics of the <b>foams</b> prepared – cell size, cell density, <b>foam</b> density – depending on both the <b>foaming</b> conditions and nanoclay addition.
