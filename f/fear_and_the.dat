Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 the brothers Avila Echeverría and group of friends decided to kill the president using a bomb along his way.

After Kirito's true gender was revealed, an angered Sinon attempts to leave him, but they meet again during the BoB. The two are confronted by Death Gun, who causes Sinon's PTSD to relapse when his weapon was revealed to be a Type 54 pistol, the same weapon she had used in the post office shooting. She is rescued by Kirito and the two escape, though she is afraid to attack Death Gun. With his help, Sinon overcomes her <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two defeat Death Gun. Afterwards, the two end the tournament as co-winners after Sinon kills them both with a «Gift Grenade». Upon exiting GGO, Shino is visited by Shinkawa, who congratulates her on winning the BoB. However, angry at Kirito, he attacks her with intentions of raping and eventually killing her, revealing himself to be Death Gun's creator. Shino manages to resist his attack and escape, but is stopped by Shinkawa before she could exit the house; Kirito arrives and fights Shinkawa, the latter eventually being knocked out by Shino throwing her stereo at him.|$|E

Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal noted that Rockwell's [...] "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop.

500|$|Rater {{intended}} {{the theme of}} the episode to be [...] "paranoia", elaborating: [...] "After Richard dropped the bomb that the hospital would be merging with Mercy West, we knew that this episode would have to deal with people's paranoia.

The worst case scenarios that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia. So, when we started talking about this episode, the theme of paranoia emerged pretty quickly."

Hades, the god of the underworld—after hearing Orpheus' moving music—allowed Orpheus to retrieve his wife as long as he does not look back at her until they are safely out of the underworld. Orpheus fails, and his wife's soul slips back into the underworld. Bush compared Orpheus's otherworldly singing to the [...] "broadband signal which is the catalyst for the events on the rig".

500|$|Written while Donne was {{a student}} at Lincoln's Inn, the poem is one of his {{earliest}} works and is thematically considered to be the [...] "first" [...] work in Songs and Sonnets. Although referred to as a sonnet, the work does not follow the most common rhyming scheme of such works—a 14-line poem, consisting of an eight-line stanza followed by a six-line conclusion—but is instead 21 lines long, divided into three stanzas. [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] is written {{from the point of view}} of an awaking lover and describes the lover's thoughts as he wakes next to his partner. The lover's musings move from discussing sensual love to spiritual love as he realises that, with spiritual love, the couple are liberated from <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need to seek adventure. The poem makes use of biblical and Catholic writings, indirectly referencing the legend of the Seven Sleepers and Paul the Apostle's description of divine, agapic love – two concepts with which, as a practising Catholic, Donne would have been familiar.|$|E

Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family {{back into the living room}} and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was [...] "not in his right mind".|$|E

500|$|... "Blink" [...] {{received}} universal critical acclaim, {{with many}} praising the acting, the script, {{the level of}} <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Weeping Angels themselves.

IGN's Travis Fickett gave the episode 9.1 out of 10, praising the way the audience felt they had known Sally Sparrow for a while, as well as the strength of Mulligan's performance, although he noted that [...] "all of the performances in this episode are exceptional". He concluded that, [...] "it's difficult to believe that so much was accomplished in such a short amount of time. The story of not one, but two relationships was told, several time lines intersected and a new and rather frightening enemy was vanquished without The Doctor ever coming face to face with them". Ross Ruedinger of Slant Magazine believed that the episode was not just the best Doctor Who episode, but also a great episode of the science fiction and horror genre that could allow it to stand alone. He also praised the fear-inducing concept of the Weeping Angels as well the [...] "tenderness of the story and the characters" [...] which were [...] "quite intricate given how much is going on in these 45 minutes". The Daily Telegraph named the episode one of the best of the show's entire run, noting that, while the Doctor [...] "is somewhat on the periphery here", it [...] "adds to the threat".|$|E
