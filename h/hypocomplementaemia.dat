40|$|Background: In some rheumatic {{diseases}} such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), low serum complement ('hypocomplementaemia') is a feature of active disease. However, the role of <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is unknown. We sought to determine the frequency, clinical associations and relationship to disease activity of <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> in SSc. Methods: The study included 1140 patients fulfilling the 2013 American College of Rheumatology criteria for SSc. Demographic, serological and clinical data, obtained prospectively through annual review, were analysed using univariable methods. Linear and logistic regression, together with generalised estimating equations, {{were used to determine}} the independent correlates of <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> ever, and at each visit, respectively. Results: At least one episode of <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> (low C 3 and/or low C 4) occurred in 24. 1  % of patients over 1893 visits; these patients {{were more likely to be}} seropositive for anti-ribonucleoprotein (OR[*]=[*] 3. 8, p[*]=[*] 0. 002), anti-Ro (OR[*]=[*] 2. 2, p[*]=[*] 0. 002), anti-Smith (OR[*]=[*] 6. 3, p[*]=[*] 0. 035) and anti-phospholipid antibodies (OR[*]=[*] 1. 4, p[*]=[*] 0. 021) and were more likely to display features of overlap connective tissue disease, in particular polymyositis (OR[*]=[*] 16. 0, p[*]=[*] 0. 012). However, no association was found between <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> and either the European Scleroderma Study Group disease activity score or any of its component variables (including erythrocyte sedimentation rate) in univariate analysis. Among patients with SSc overlap disease features, those who were hypocomplementaemic were more likely to have digital ulcers (OR[*]=[*] 1. 6, p[*]=[*] 0. 034), tendon friction rubs (OR[*]=[*] 2. 4, p[*]=[*] 0. 037), forced vital capacity < 80  % predicted (OR[*]=[*] 2. 9, p[*]=[*] 0. 008) and lower body mass index (BMI) (OR for BMI[*]=[*] 0. 9, p[*]<[*] 0. 0005) at that visit, all of which are features associated with SSc disease activity and/or severity. Conclusions: While <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> is not associated with disease activity in patients with non-overlap SSc, it is associated with some features of increased SSc disease activity in patients with overlap disease features.

40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} with infective endocarditis (IE) are described, fourteen with Staph. aureus and ten with other organisms. Despite the acute {{nature of the}} infection, ten of the fourteen with Staph. aureus IE were hypocomplementaemic; six of these ten had normal levels of C 4 associated with low C 3 levels, suggesting activation of the alternate complement pathway. Factor B (C 3 PA) was also low in three of these six cases. In the ten {{patients with}} non-Staph. IE, three had <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> {{with low levels of}} C 4, C 3, and Factor B, probably due to C 1 (classical pathway) activation with feedback activation of the alternate pathway. In addition, thrombocytopenia was noted in nine of the twenty-four patients and was associated with hypocomplementaemia; the degree of renal insufficiency noted in these patients also correlated with <b>hypocomplementaemia.</b> In Staph. aureus IE thrombocytopenia and <b>hypocomplementaemia,</b> occurring early {{in the course of the}} disease, may be due to a non-immune interaction of Staph. cell wall products (Protein A) with immunoglobulin, complement components, and thrombocytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} human sera {{to prevent the}} {{precipitation}} of antigen-antibody complexes has been investigated. The early complement components including C 3 are required for optimal prevention of immune precipitation, whereas the later components are not required. The sera of 36 of 75 patients with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 14 of 32 with SLE and four of 17 with glomerulonephritis exhibited reduced capacities to prevent immune precipitation. In contrast sera from patients with seronegative RA, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or degenerative joint disease were normal in this respect. In SLE and GN sera <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> was frequently associated but not always with failure to prevent immune precipitation, whereas only {{a small proportion of}} the patients with seropositive RA and reduced capacity to retain complexes in a soluble form were hypocomplementaemic. Thus the failure of sera to prevent the precipitation of antigen-antibody complexes is not always associated with <b>hypocomplementaemia...</b>|$|E

40|$|An unusual patient, with dermal nodules, flexion contractures of {{the fingers}} and toes, cold-induced urticaria, dermographism and serum <b>hypocomplementaemia,</b> had necrotizing {{cutaneous}} venulitis underlying the spontaneous lesions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} HLA type and <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> on the duration and severity of joint involvement in parvovirus infection (HPV). METHODS: Forty seven patients were selected on a geographical basis from 83 with proven HPV infection during an outbreak that occurred in Oxfordshire in 1993. They were contacted by questionnaire a year later. Thirty five patients were available for examination and blood sampling. Subjects were typed for HLA-DRB 1 alleles and HLA-B 27 status. Immunological profiles, including C 3 and C 4 complement components, were determined. RESULTS: Joint symptoms occurred in all patients. They resolved within a week in 12 patients and persisted beyond one year in 19. On review, none had a picture of rheumatoid arthritis, but three patients had developed carpal tunnel syndrome. Decreased C 4 was found in four. The HLA frequencies were similar to those in controls; however, joint symptoms persisted for more than one week in all HLA-DR 4 positive patients (p = 0. 009). There was no relation between the severity of joint symptoms and either HLA type, or <b>hypocomplementaemia.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Joint symptoms are common in parvovirus infection and the presence of HLA-DR 4 may be associated with persistence of joint symptoms beyond one week.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To develop {{criteria}} for disease activity in systemic sclerosis (SSc) that are valid, reliable, {{and easy to}} use.  METHODS—Investigators from 19  European centres completed a standardised clinical chart for a consecutive number of patients with SSc. Three protocol management members blindly evaluated each chart and assigned a disease activity score on a semiquantitative scale of 0 - 10. Two of them, in addition, gave a blinded, qualitative evaluation of disease activity ("inactive to moderately active" or "active to very active" disease). Both these evaluations {{were found to be}} reliable. A final disease activity score and qualitative evaluation of disease activity were arrived at by consensus for each patient; the former represented the gold standard for subsequent analyses. The correlations between individual items in the chart and this gold standard were then analysed.  RESULTS—A total of 290  patients with SSc (117  with diffuse SSc (dSSc) and 173  with limited SSc (lSSc)) were enrolled in the study. The items (including Δ-factors—that is, worsening according to the patient report) that were found to correlate with the gold standard on multiple regression were used to construct three separate 10 -point indices of disease activity: (a) Δ-cardiopulmonary (4. 0), Δ-skin (3. 0), Δ-vascular (2. 0), and Δ-articular/muscular (1. 0) for patients with dSSc; (b) Δ-skin (2. 5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 30 mm/ 1 st h (2. 5), Δ-cardiopulmonary (1. 5), Δ-vascular (1. 0), arthritis (1. 0), <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> (1. 0), and scleredema (0. 5) for lSSc; (c) Δ-cardiopulmonary (2. 0), Δ-skin (2. 0), ESR > 30 mm/ 1 st h (1. 5), total skin score > 20 (1. 0), <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> (1. 0), scleredema (0. 5), digital necrosis (0. 5), Δ-vascular (0. 5), arthritis (0. 5), TLCO < 80 % (0. 5) for all patients with SSc. The three indexes were validated by the jackknife technique.

We report a case of right-sided sudden hearing loss in a female patient in which the clinical manifestations, in addition to ANA positivity and <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> allowed us to hypothesize an auto-immune inner ear disease. The immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine-A was capable of a recovery of the hearing that, however, occurred progressively with normalization of the hearing function after 1 year of treatment. cyclosporine-A could be proposed as a therapeutic option in case of auto-immune inner ear disease allowing the suspension of corticosteroids that, at high dose, expose patients to potentially serious adverse events...|$|E

The results showed a trend towards more consistent overall improvement in the first two weeks after IVMP administration compared with placebo, but this difference was not maintained at one month or subsequently. They also suggested a quicker resolution of <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> in the treatment group. Other parameters of disease activity showed no difference. Side effects were generally mild and were similar in incidence between the two groups.

It was noted that low levels of serum complement activity (CH 50 less than 25 U/ml) occurred in five of six patients with fetal loss, but in only two of 22 with a live birth. Serial studies also confirmed a close association between decreased serum complement activity and poor fetal prognosis in lupus pregnancy.

The defect in clearance of the IgG cells in the membranous patients was associated with the presence of HLA-B 8 and DR 3. In the mesangio-capillary glomerulonephritis patients, the clearance rates of the IgG cells were fast-normal in six and enhanced in two, and correlated with the clearance of HDE.

METHODS: Investigators from 19 European centres completed a standardised clinical chart for a consecutive number of patients with SSc. Three protocol management members blindly evaluated each chart and assigned a disease activity score on a semiquantitative scale of 0 - 10. Two of them, in addition, gave a blinded, qualitative evaluation of disease activity ("inactive to moderately active" or "active to very active" disease). Both these evaluations {{were found to be}} reliable. A final disease activity score and qualitative evaluation of disease activity were arrived at by consensus for each patient; the former represented the gold standard for subsequent analyses. The correlations between individual items in the chart and this gold standard were then analysed. RESULTS: A total of 290 patients with SSc (117 with diffuse SSc (dSSc) and 173 with limited SSc (lSSc)) were enrolled in the study. The items (including Delta-factors-that is, worsening according to the patient report) that were found to correlate with the gold standard on multiple regression were used to construct three separate 10 -point indices of disease activity: (a) Delta-cardiopulmonary (4. 0), Delta-skin (3. 0), Delta-vascular (2. 0), and Delta-articular/muscular (1. 0) for patients with dSSc; (b) Delta-skin (2. 5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 30 mm/ 1 st h (2. 5), Delta-cardiopulmonary (1. 5), Delta-vascular (1. 0), arthritis (1. 0), <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> (1. 0), and scleredema (0. 5) for lSSc; (c) Delta-cardiopulmonary (2. 0), Delta-skin (2. 0), ESR > 30 mm/ 1 st h (1. 5), total skin score > 20 (1. 0), <b>hypocomplementaemia</b> (1. 0), scleredema (0. 5), digital necrosis (0. 5), Delta-vascular (0. 5), arthritis (0. 5), TLCO < 80 % (0. 5) for all patients with SSc. The three indexes were validated by the jackknife technique. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed in order to define the value of the index with the best discriminant capacity for "active to very active" patients. CONCLUSIONS: Three feasible, reliable, and valid preliminary indices to define disease activity in SSc were constructed...|$|E
