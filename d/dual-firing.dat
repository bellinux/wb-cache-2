5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel for {{domestic}} heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for <b>dual-firing</b> electricity generation.|$|E

50|$|Though an {{otherwise}} basic vertical shooter, Grid Seeker featured a unique style of attack to players: by using their Grid item, a <b>dual-firing</b> shield {{similar to that}} of the Force from R-Type, players could absorb enemy shots using their Grid. As the Grid absorbed their shots, a meter would rise and eventually fill the player’s bomb stock. The bombs varied depending on which weapon the players picked-up.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis of}} 210 MW <b>dual-fire,</b> subcritical, reheat steam power plant, situated near Jamshoro, Pakistan has been performed. Firstly, {{the plant is}} modeled by EES (Engineering Equation Solver) software. Moreover; a parametric study is performed to assess the impacts of various operating parameters on the performance. The net power output, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are considered as performance parameters of the plant whereas, condenser pressure, main steam pressure and main steam temperature are nominated as operating parameters. According to the results, the net power output, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are determined as 186. 5 MW, 31. 37 % and 30. 41 % respectively, under design operating conditions. The condenser contributed a major share in the total energy loss i. e. 280 MW (68. 7 %) followed by boiler with 89 MW (21. 8 %). The major exergy destructing area {{is found in the}} boiler with 350 MW (82. 11 %) of the total exergy destruction followed by turbine with 43. 1 MW (10. 12 %) and condenser 12 MW (5. 74 %). According to the parametric study, variation in operating parameters had great influence on the plant performanc...|$|R
