5|$|Roystonea is a genus of pinnate-leaved palms {{which range}} from south Florida and Mexico south to Venezuela. Seven species are endemic to the Greater Antilles and the Virgin Islands - four of these are Cuban <b>endemics.</b> The only species which is absent from the insular Caribbean, R. dunlapiana, is found on the Caribbean coast of Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{serpentine}} outcrops where A.viridimontanum thrives {{have relatively}} few <b>endemics,</b> compared to serpentine exposures globally. A.viridimontanum {{is one of}} only five taxa (four species and a variety) that are strictly endemic to serpentine in eastern North America, and two of these, A.aleuticum and Aspidotis densa, grow on non-serpentine substrates elsewhere in North America.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 310 {{species of fish}} {{recorded}} from the rivers and lakes of Wallacea, 75 species of them are <b>endemic.</b> Although little is still known about the fishes of the Moluccas and the Lesser Sunda Islands, 6 species are recorded as <b>endemic.</b> On Sulawesi, there are 69 known species, of which 53 are <b>endemic.</b> The Malili lakes in South Sulawesi, with its complex of deep lakes, rapids and rivers, have at least 15 <b>endemic</b> telmatherinid fishes, two of them representing <b>endemic</b> genera, three <b>endemic</b> Oryzias, two <b>endemic</b> halfbeaks, and seven <b>endemic</b> gobies.|$|R
50|$|The Afrotropical realm {{is home to}} {{a number}} of <b>endemic</b> plant {{families}}. Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands are home to ten <b>endemic</b> families of flowering plants; eight are <b>endemic</b> to Madagascar (Asteropeiaceae, Didymelaceae, Didiereaceae, Kaliphoraceae, Melanophyllaceae, Physenaceae, Sarcolaenaceae, and Sphaerosepalaceae), one to Seychelles (Mesdusagynaceae) and one to the Mascarene Islands (Psiloxylaceae). Twelve plant families are <b>endemic</b> or nearly <b>endemic</b> to South Africa (including Curtisiaceae, Heteropyxidaceae, Penaeaceae, Psiloxylaceae and Rhynchocalycaceae) of which five are <b>endemic</b> to the Cape floristic province (including Grubbiaceae). Other <b>endemic</b> Afrotropic families include Barbeyaceae, Montiniaceae, Myrothamnaceae and Oliniaceae.|$|R

5|$|Thrinax is a genus of fan palms. Three of {{the four}} species of are endemic to the insular Caribbean, while the fourth occurs in the insular Caribbean and in Florida, Mexico and Central America. Three species are single-island <b>endemics</b> - two to Jamaica and one to Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater molluscs (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 <b>endemics.</b> Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are the mussels Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species of freshwater molluscs are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are mostly}} birds of humid lowland rainforests. Few species are found at higher elevations, {{with less than}} 10% of species having ranges above 2000 m (6500ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000 m (10000ft). The highest species {{diversity}} {{is found in the}} Amazon basin, with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The number of species drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family's range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised <b>endemics,</b> however. The Yapacana antbird, for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand soil (the so-called Amazonian caatinga) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, the bamboo antshrike is predominantly found in bamboo patches.|$|E

50|$|About 50 <b>endemic</b> molluscs, three <b>endemic</b> crab species, and {{a number}} of <b>endemic</b> shrimp species are also known from the Wallacea.|$|R
50|$|The islands have a moist {{tropical}} climate, and {{are largely}} covered with tropical moist broadleaf forests. The Louisiade Archipelago rain forests form a distinct ecoregion, and {{are home to}} a number of <b>endemic</b> species, including several <b>endemic</b> trees (in genera Pandanus, Diospyros, and Hopea), as well as five <b>endemic</b> frog species, two <b>endemic</b> lizard species, and five <b>endemic</b> bird species.|$|R
5|$|Sea {{levels were}} lower during the Pleistocene, {{so it was}} {{possible}} for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Réunion is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many <b>endemics</b> would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on Réunion prior to the volcanic eruption, it would {{have been one of the}} few survivors of this extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island <b>endemics.</b> The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The fauna {{includes}} {{several species of}} zooplankton and benthic animals. Since the lake is oligotrophic (nutrient-poor), the native fish fauna is relatively scarce, and the only <b>endemics</b> are Rasbora tobana (strictly speaking near-endemic, since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake) and Neolissochilus thienemanni, locally known as the Batak fish. The latter species is threatened by deforestation (causing siltation), pollution, changes in water level and the numerous fish species that have been introduced to the lake. Other native fishes include species such as Aplocheilus panchax, Nemacheilus pfeifferae, Homaloptera gymnogaster, Channa gachua, Channa striata, Clarias batrachus, Barbonymus gonionotus, Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Danio albolineatus, Osteochilus vittatus, Puntius binotatus, Rasbora jacobsoni, Tor tambra, Betta imbellis, Betta taeniata and Monopterus albus. Among the many introduced species are Anabas testudineus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis niloticus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Osphronemus goramy, Trichogaster pectoralis, Trichopodus trichopterus, Poecilia reticulata and Xiphophorus hellerii.|$|E
50|$|The ichthyofauna of the Neretva delta {{is rich in}} <b>endemic</b> species, {{and there}} are more than 20 <b>endemic</b> species, of which 18 species are <b>endemic</b> species of the Adriatic watershed, and three <b>endemic</b> species in Croatia.

25|$|In the {{original}} description Passiflora tarminina {{is described as}} a cultigen and there is little information about its biology in the wild. Many members of the subgenus Tacsonia are restricted <b>endemics</b> and it is unclear whether the widely cultivated species (such as P. tarminiana) are also local <b>endemics</b> which have been spread through widespread cultivation or whether they are naturally widespread species.
