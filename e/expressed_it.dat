A former nanny testified that she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted that she had not seen Tim Farrar for years and agreed that she had not reported Tim's fascination with fire to his parents or the police when he had <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> to her.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} {{due to the}} vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used as an academic work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it <b>expressed.</b> <b>It</b> {{is worth noting that}} the work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The Jain Temple at Lakkundi marked an {{important}} step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave (chhajja), used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> in a modified dravida outline. Miniature towers of both dravida and nagara types are used as ornamentation on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original dravida structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.|$|E

25|$|A {{major concern}} cited by Greek {{officials}} was {{a number of}} maps that have circulated by nationalist groups based in Skopje depicting parts of Greece (including Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city) as {{being part of a}} future United Macedonia, and the country's prime minister photographed laying a wreath under such a map just {{a few weeks before the}} summit. Also a poster displayed in Skopje just days before the Bucharest summit by an artist replacing the white cross on the Greek flag with the swastika, as a way of comparing modern Greece to Nazi Germany and caricatures of Greek PM Karamanlis depicted wearing a Nazi SS uniform led to vigorous Greek diplomatic protests and international condemnation although the government disassociated itself from the depictions and <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> has no connection and no authority over artists' works.|$|E

Shortly after the project had germinated {{in the minds of}} Begos and Ashbaugh, they contacted and recruited Gibson.

The Los Angeles Times viewed the flight number of 718 and its subsequent crash as a nod to co-creator J.J. Abrams' other series, Lost.|$|E
500|$|Though Hazlitt {{could find}} much to {{appreciate}} in the comedies, tragedy {{was to him}} inherently more important, and he weights the tragedies much more heavily.

As he <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> at the end of [...] "Lear", tragedy describes the strongest passions, and [...] "the greatest strength of genius is shewn here in describing the strongest passions: for the power of the imagination, in works of invention, must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions, which are the subject of them." ...|$|E

LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his recording on hold thinking about dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and L.A. Reid did. From this point Reid didn't {{know what to do}} with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with Puff Daddy to attend what Reid called [...] "Flavor Camp". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> as the [...] "Hardest days" [...] of his life.

500|$|Pusey, the {{influential}} [...] "high church" [...] Anglican theologian {{associated with the}} Oxford Movement, wrote a letter of support to Müller, reproduced in The Times. In his view, Boden's intentions would be best advanced by electing Müller. Missionaries could not win converts without knowing {{the details of the}} religion of those with whom they were dealing, he wrote, and Müller's publications were [...] "the greatest gifts which have yet been bestowed" [...] on those in such work. He added that Oxford would gain by electing him to a position where Müller could spend all his time on work [...] "of such primary and lasting importance for the conversion of India." [...] Beckerlegge finds Pusey's support noteworthy, since Pusey would not have agreed with Müller's particular [...] "broad" [...] approach to Christianity, and was thus providing a judgment on the academic abilities of the candidate best placed to advance missionary work in India. One anonymous writer of a letter to the press in support of Müller, shortly before the election, <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> thus: [...] "A man's personal character must stand very high, and his theological opinions can afford but little ground for animadversion on either hand, when he unites as his unhesitating supporters Dr. Pusey and Dr. Macbride"– a reference to John Macbride, described in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as [...] "a profoundly religious layman of the 'old' evangelical school". However, Dowling describes Müller as [...] "impercipient of the subtle twists of theological argument, the fine shadings and compunctions of Victorian religious feeling"– a weakness that was held against him.|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010) was {{released}} in November and made over US$950million. It set several box office records and opened to mostly favourable reviews in the media. His portrayal of Ron again earned him critical praise. Reviewing the adaption in Slate, Dana Stevens called {{all three of the}} leads [...] "terrific." [...] Despite giving Deathly Hallows – Part 1 a negative rating, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal publication stated [...] "Grint has grown up to be a skilful actor who knows the value of a slow burn". New York Post writer Lou Lumenick, however, observed that both Grint and Radcliffe had grown weary of playing the same characters and <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> in their performances. Grint's performance scored him nominations from the MTV Movie Awards and National Movie Awards for Best Fight and Performance of the Year in 2011. Grint reprised his role for the eighth time, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, the last Harry Potter instalment. This film picked-up from where the previous film left-off and included a lot of action, whereas the first part had focused more on character development. Rupert, along with the film, was critically acclaimed: Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asked, [...] "Who could have predicted that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson {{would turn out to be}} good actors?". The film broke several box office records, including biggest midnight release, biggest first-day opening, and biggest opening-weekend. Deathly Hallows – Part 2 got up to the 4th highest-grossing film of all time, and is the second highest-grossing non-James Cameron film with more than US$1.3 billion worldwide (behind The Avengers).|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{described}} {{the film as}} a [...] "flashback {{to a time when}} baggy basketball shorts, hip-hop music and black shoes were considered controversial and an affront to hoops purists". Washington Post columnist Jason Reid noted that the film went {{out of its way to}} present the inappropriate racial commentary by Jalen Rose when he described Duke basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski's recruits as Uncle Toms. Among those critical of the racial commentary was Duke player Grant Hill, who was cited in an Associated Press story that ran in major national media outlets. Hill blogged on The New York Times with a response naming a litany of Dukies castigated by Rose's general aspersions. His response was at the top of The New York Times [...] "most-emailed list" [...] for several days and was shared on Facebook by nearly 100,000 people within its first few days. King responded to Hill in The Wall Street Journal. In the midst of the media exchange, the 2011 editions of the teams advanced to meet on March 20 at 2011NCAA Tournament West Regional in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the Time Warner Cable Arena with Duke ranked as a #1 seed and Michigan as an #8 seed. Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski did not respond until after both teams were eliminated from the tournament, but he noted that he felt the statements were insulting and gave specific reasons why each of the Fab Five members did not go to Duke. Duke player and Michigan native Shane Battier supported Hill's statements saying, [...] "Maya Angelou couldn’t have written it and <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> better." ...|$|E
500|$|In the January–March 1995 {{edition of}} El Machete, the EBP {{published}} an essay discussing {{the origins of}} corruption, reaching the conclusion that [...] "the institutions creates by the capitalist and economic power to regulate the daily life of its citizens [...] represents the biggest example of corruption" [...] by proving a stage for corrupt individuals seeking individual benefit. In calling for a [...] "political, economic and social revolution", the organization concluded that only [...] "an organized force [...] political liberty." [...] In another section, the organization argued that Roselló was an [...] "inexperienced politician and administration" [...] and a [...] "figure manufactored by the wealthy interest to do their bidding". The EPB cited their belief that the governor was carrying out an agenda to discredit and dismantle the public workforce {{in an attempt to}} facilitate statehood by reducing public spending and making Puerto Rico more appealable to the economically conservative elements in the United States. To counter this, the organization urged unions to move [...] "beyond economic issues and to open [...] national struggle" [...] against privatization efforts taken by the Rosselló administration. The EPB also criticized the governor and several politicians and such as Romero Barceló, Baltasar Corrada del Rio and General Emilio Díaz Colón that pursued {{the construction of a new}} home base for the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) at Puerto Rico in anticipation of the approaching deadline that the Torrijos-Carter Treaties established for the transfer of control over the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama in 1977. [...] The organization believed that this was an attempt to benefit economically and to fully integrate Puerto Rico into the military apparatus of the United States, [...] " [...] sip by sip". Led by advisor Alberto Goachet, the initiative offered to provide satellite dishes, ports, transportation and low cost accommodations and facilities. Citing that the base would serve as to launch incursions that secure control over Latin America, the EPB called out the lack of action by the PIP and its president, Manuel Rodríguez Orellana. The organization also <b>expressed</b> <b>it</b> support to the efforts of eviromentalist organizations that opposed the passing of a Japanese vessel carrying a load of plutonium through the Mona Passage in its route from France to the Panama Canal.|$|E
