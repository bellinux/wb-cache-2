The Charter, the basic instrument governing OAS, makes {{no reference to}} the use of official languages. These references {{are to be found in}} the Rules of Procedure governing the various OAS bodies. Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, the supreme body of the OAS, which meets once a year, states that English, French, Portuguese and Spanish are the four official languages. Article 28 stipulates that a Style Committee shall be set up with representatives of the four official languages to review the General Assembly resolutions and declarations. Article 53 states that proposals shall be presented in the four official languages. The Rules of Procedure and Statutes of other bodies, such as the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CIDI), the Permanent Executive Committee of the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CEPCIDI), the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM), the Inter-American <b>Drug</b> <b>Abuse</b> <b>Control</b> Commission (CICAD), the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Inter-American Juridical Committee (CJI), technical bodies of the OAS, also mention the four official languages in which their meetings are to be conducted. Policy is therefore dictated through these instruments that require use of the four official languages at meetings.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. We {{explored}} {{the effectiveness of}} an educational program accompanied by alcohol and <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>controls,</b> following the 2006 - 07 measures of the Italian State-Regions Conference, in reducing the rate of occupational injuries. Methods. Starting Novembre 2007, we implemented periodical controls of alcohol and <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> among workers of four hauling firms of the Cagliari province, using a rapid multi-test colorimetric method, serum levels of the γ-glutamil transferase enzyme (γGT), the mean red cell volume (MCV), and alcohol detection in the exhaled breath, accompanying such controls with an educational program on the causes, consequences, and prevention of occupational injuries. We measured the rate of occupational injuries per 105 working hours in 2005 - 2009; the severity rate was expressed {{by the number of}} lost working days due to occupational injuries over 103 working hours. Results. The annual rate of occupational injuries ranged 23. 9 - 29. 7 x 10 - 5 in 2005 - 07 and it decreased to 11. 7 x 10 - 5 in 2008 - 09 (χ 2 = 9. 78, p 0. 0018); the severity rate decreased from 12. 7 x 10 - 3 in 2005 - 07 to 5. 6 x 10 - 3 in 2008 - 09.
