25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> {{disappointed}} that {{this decision was}} not communicated to me personally {{but that it was}} faxed to my lawyers. I find it shameful that, after so many years of good cooperation and after all I have done for the team, I am being treated as a fax number.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> {{proud of}} the 19 wickets I took against the Rest of the World, even though, laughably, they have now been officially deducted from my Test playing record.

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> fond of jazz music, and I {{swear by}} all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band {{is in full swing}} at the time I have just mentioned.
