A Q Learning procedure {{is applied to the}} revised provenance graph model derived after merging of the significant models. If a newly calculated policy path is not destined to the same goal topic or event node then it is removed from farther consideration. Alternatively, the expected gain from executing action at a state is the difference between the expected Q value as reward value calculated from Eq.  16 from executing the changed action and earlier Q value associated with taking optimal action at the state. The Value of Perfect Information (VPI) associated with taking action at a state is the weighted sum of expected <b>gain</b> <b>measure</b> calculated for all discrete probabilities associating the state, action pair which separates the best classifier policy value and the considered classifier policy value. Here a strategy is selected that maximizes the sum of expected Q value for a state action pair and Value of Perfect Information associated with state action pair The alternatives to the best classifiers which when considered are re-ranked from this expected <b>gain</b> <b>measure.</b> The candidate <b>set</b> of classifiers which form the minimum cover set of classifiers or is the only member of a set of classifiers for a unified provenance graph model are considered for specifying recognition paths for relevant goal topics where these paths may be both general or discerning.|$|R

We investigate which sets can be written as a (disjoint) union of <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We show that every Borel nullset B⊂R of the second category is larger than any nullset A⊂R in the sense that there are partitions B=B_ 1 ∪ B_ 2, A=A_ 1 ∪ A_ 2 and gauge functions g_ 1, g_ 2 such that the Hausdorff measures satisfy H^g_i(B_i) = 1 and H^g_i(A_i) = 0 (i= 1, 2). This implies that every Borel set of the second category is a union of two <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We also present Borel and compact sets in R which are not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> This is done in two steps.

Most test organizations have their famous high and low gain pilots and the term “pilot gain” is understood very well on an intuitive level.
