5|$|Although {{the band}} did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to sell any records while touring, the album became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release. Five {{thousand}} copies was the label's average. Show No Mercy {{went on to}} sell between 15,500 and 20,000 copies in the United States; it also went on to sell more than 15,000 overseas, as Metal Blade had worldwide rights. The success of the album led to Slagel wanting the band to release a new record and an extended play.|$|E
5|$|In June 1957, Plath and Hughes {{moved to}} the United States, and from September, Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She found it {{difficult}} to both teach and <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> and energy to write {{and in the middle of}} 1958, the couple moved to Boston. Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evening sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that he would try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E
30|$|Also in Table  4, we {{summarize}} teachers’ self-report {{data from}} the survey on prompts related to <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to plan for all their content areas, to plan for mathematics or science instruction, to investigate additional resources, and to meet with other teachers about mathematics or science instruction. The first of these factors is significant for both mathematics and science, such that specialists {{are more likely to}} report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to plan for all of the subjects they teach. It is important to recognize that, even for these specialists, the mean is low, less than 3 for both content areas on a 1 – 6 scale. In mathematics, EMS are significantly more likely to report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to plan for their mathematics instruction. Although not statistically significant, specialists also are more likely to report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to investigate additional resources related to their mathematics or science instruction. Thus, the specialists’ indications of having more specialized content-focused planning time and the affordances that this provides are supported by the self-report survey data.|$|R

The crew built the incomplete silo on a sound stage around a completed spacecraft prop, {{and were able to}} digitally extend the set with computer generated interiors to give the impression of a much larger silo. Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced digitally, with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{creative}} staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Lasseter, upon returning from the European promotion of A Bug's Life, watched the development reels and {{agreed that it was}} not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was eliminated due to a failure in communication, which meant he did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> left for another fast lap {{at the end of the}} session. With the track still damp when qualifying began, times improved with every passing lap, with the drivers being able to switch from intermediate to slick tyres at the end of the first session. While the two Manor drivers once again qualified at the end of the grid, Jenson Button was also eliminated in Q1, leaving him with time penalties in the race, not being able to take the full extent of his 25-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor {{and gave him the}} chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The band {{decided to}} release a live album after their {{producer}} Tony Visconti did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> {{to work on a}} full studio session. The group listened through various archive recordings from earlier tours and compiled the album from the best versions. Various studio overdubs were made to the live recordings during early 1978 in Paris; exactly how much of the album is overdubbed has been a contentious topic since its release. The album reached No.2 in the UK album charts, ultimately selling over half a million copies. It has continued to attract critical acclaim and it has appeared in several lists of the greatest live albums of all time.|$|E

5|$|After Bakshi {{pitched the}} project to every major Hollywood studio, Warner Bros. bought it and promised an $850,000 budget. Bakshi hired animators he had worked with in the past, {{including}} Vita, Tyer, Anzilotti and Nick Tafuri, and began the layouts and animation. The first completed sequence was a junkyard scene in Harlem, in which Fritz smokes marijuana, has sex and incites a revolution. Krantz intended to release the sequence as a 15-minute short in case the picture's financing fell through; Bakshi, however, was determined to complete the film as a feature. They screened the sequence for Warner Bros. executives, who wanted the sexual content toned down and celebrities cast for the voice parts. Bakshi refused, and Warner Bros. pulled out, leading Krantz to seek funds elsewhere. He eventually {{made a deal with}} Jerry Gross, the owner of Cinemation Industries, a distributor specializing in exploitation films. Although Bakshi did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to pitch the film, Gross agreed to fund its production and distribute it, believing that it would fit in with his grindhouse slate.|$|E
5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations. Aircrew had to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders landing before the main force had to <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified, with complete brigades landing on one drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following the friendly fire incident over the convoy, more training was given to ships' crews in aircraft recognition, and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings. Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but {{not included in the}} original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E

5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E
5|$|Deal was {{satisfied}} with the material recorded up to this point, but realized {{she would not be}} able to tour without a band. She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time.</b> Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way.

5|$|The online {{functions}} {{planned for}} Nine {{were intended to}} be incorporated from release, but in August 2002, Atlus announced that they would divide the game in two parts: one stand-alone offline version, and one online version. The reason given for this was that the development team did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to integrate all online functions they wanted {{to include in the}} game, and that Atlus did not want to delay the game's release. Atlus planned to release the online version in 2002, but put development on hold due to the high costs of developing an online game, and postponed the release until 2003. In August 2003, they announced that they no longer had any plans to publish the online version for Xbox, due to problems relating to network-based development and the profitability of online games. With the cancellation of the Xbox Live version, development continued on a version of Nine for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PCs). This version formed the base for what would become , a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for PCs developed by Cave and released in Japan and Western regions across 2007 and 2009.|$|E

Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes.

5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event {{has been compared to}} a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E
