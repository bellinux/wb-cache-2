40|$|Applying and {{extending}} the open-economy loanable funds model, this article shows that more government borrowing or debt as {{a percent of}} GDP leads to a higher government bond yield, that a higher real money market rate, a higher expected inflation rate, a higher EU government bond yield, or depreciation of the <b>Estonian</b> <b>kroon</b> (<b>EEK)</b> would increase the Estonian government bond yield, and that the negative coefficient of the percent change in real GDP has an unexpected sign. When the conventional closed-economy or openeconomy loanable funds model is considered, the article finds that more government borrowing {{as a percent of}} GDP does not result in a higher government bond yield, that the positive coefficients of the real money market rate, the growth rate of real GDP, and the expected inflation are significant at the 1 %, 5 % or 10 % level, and that the negative coefficient of the ratio of the net capital inflow to GDP in the conventional open-economy loanable funds model is significant at the 1 % level. government deficits, long-term interest rates, loanable funds model, expected inflation, world interest rates, exchange rates...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} population-level costs, effects and {{cost-effectiveness}} of different {{alcohol and tobacco}} control strategies in Estonia. DESIGN: A WHO cost-effectiveness modelling framework was used to estimate the total costs and effects of interventions. Costs were assessed in <b>Estonian</b> <b>Kroon</b> (<b>EEK)</b> for the year 2000, while effects were expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Regional cost-effectiveness estimates for Eastern Europe, were used as baseline and were contextualised by including country-specific input data. RESULTS: Increased excise taxes are the most cost-effective intervention to reduce both hazardous alcohol consumption and smoking: 759 EEK (euro 49) and 218 EEK (euro 14) per DALY averted, respectively. Imposing additional advertising bans would cost 1331 EEK (euro 85) per DALY averted to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption and 304 EEK (euro 19) to reduce smoking. Compared to WHO-CHOICE regional estimates, interventions were less costly and thereby more cost-effective in Estonia. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions in alcohol and tobacco control are cost-effective, and broad implementation of these interventions to upgrade current situation is warranted from the economic point of view. First priority {{is an increase in}} taxation, followed by advertising bans and other interventions. The differences between WHO-CHOICE regional cost-effectiveness estimates and contextualised results underline the importance of the country level analysis...|$|E

Almost the entire amount of rubles in circulation in Estonia was exchanged to kroons at the same rate (deposits, money held by enterprises, etc.). The rate was considered under-priced by many opponents, but it actually corresponded to the market rate of that time. Time and the later course of events have indisputably proven the correctness of the choice made. All the laws and other legal acts planned for the beginning of the monetary reform came into effect.
