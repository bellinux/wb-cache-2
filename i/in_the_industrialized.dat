The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.|$|E

The small Labor Party, supported by industrial workers, gained one seat each in Virginia (VA-06) and Wisconsin (WI-04), while the Greenback Party maintained its one seat in Iowa (James B.

25|$|Union busting in the United States dates {{at least}} to the 19th century, when a rapid {{expansion}} in factories and manufacturing capabilities caused a migration of workers from agricultural work to the mining, manufacturing and transportation industries. Conditions were often unsafe, women worked for lower wages than men, and child labor was rampant. Because employers and governments did little to address these issues, labor movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world were formed to seek better wages, hours, and working conditions. The clashes between labor and management were often adversarial and were deeply affected by wars, economic conditions, government policies, and court proceedings.|$|E

25|$|When {{asked about}} the working {{condition}} in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior {{by the standards of}} developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' standard of living, those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1880s, {{birth rates}} began to drop {{steadily}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries, as women married later {{and families in}} urban living conditions increasingly favoured having fewer children. This trend was particularly acute in the United Kingdom, where birth rates declined from almost 35.5 births per 1,000 in the 1870s to about 29 per 1,000 by 1900. While the cause is uncertain, the 29% decline within a generation shows that the birth control methods Victorian women used were effective. Many women were educated about contraception and how to avoid pregnancy. While the rhythm method was not yet understood, condoms and diaphragms made of vulcanized rubber were reliable and inexpensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject.

From 1991 to 2005, the percentage of teens reporting that they had ever had sex or were currently sexually active showed small declines. However, the U.S. still has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> world.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{social welfare}} planning for <b>the</b> elderly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly <b>industrialized</b> countries, compares {{it to an}} industrialized country like Australia, and examines the differences that exist between them. METHOD: The social welfare policy matrix identifies gaps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> provision of health, social welfare, income security, housing and <b>the</b> environment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly <b>industrialized</b> countries. <b>The</b> focus of the finding is management-driven and is a definitive source for analyzing the extent of welfare for the elderly or its likely future. RESULTS: There exists a substantial difference between countries like Malaysia, Japan, Singapore and Australia. <b>In</b> Japan, <b>the</b> elderly enjoy comprehensive lifelong health lifestyles under the ÈNew Golden Plani, and in Malaysia ÈLong Term Care Insurancei provides the elderly access to public health care but does not have mandatory care insurance. Welfare through income supports to individuals is available in Australia, while in Malaysia income supports are disbursed to the needy. CONCLUSION: Conceptualizing policy responses to {{the present and future}} social welfare needs of <b>the</b> elderly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly <b>industrializing</b> countries does not necessarily mirror those of the developed countries. However the gaps essentially provide a possible benchmark to support the formulation of new policies or the adjustments that are needed to ensure that <b>the</b> elderly population <b>in</b> newly industrialized countries live well into their old age...|$|R
