40|$|The {{incremental}} {{sheet metal}} forming process combines a series of characteristics, such as the capacity to produce large deformations, flexibility and low-cost tooling, making it preferable to conventional forming processes. One of the key factors in this process are the contact conditions between the forming tool and the sheet to be formed. The incremental forming process of titanium and its alloys is widely studied; on the other hand, the influence of some heat treatments that can induce superficial modifications is not fully known and understood yet. In this study, the influence of thermal oxidation and tool-sheet contact conditions on the formability and the surface quality of grade 1 titanium thin sheets manufactured by incremental forming was investigated by using both a sphere and a hemispherical <b>head</b> <b>tool.</b> The results of the experimental campaign, based on the production of conical and pyramid frusta, highlight the beneficial effects of the heat treatment on the process repeatability, reducing the occurrence of galling for all the contact conditions, and provide information {{on the quality of}} the worked surfaces...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reliable machine vision system to automatically detect inserts and {{determine if they}} are broken. Unlike the machining operations studied in the literature, {{we are dealing with}} edge milling head tools for aggressive machining of thick plates (up to 12 centimetres) in a single pass. The studied cutting <b>head</b> <b>tool</b> is characterised by its relatively high number of inserts (up to 30) which makes the localisation of inserts a key aspect. The identification of broken inserts is critical for a proper tool monitoring system. In the method that we propose, we first localise the screws of the inserts and then we determine the expected position and orientation of the cutting edge by applying some geometrical operations. We compute the deviations from the expected cutting edge to the real edge of the inserts to determine if an insert is broken. We evaluated the proposed method on a new dataset that we acquired and made public. The obtained result (a harmonic mean of precision and recall 91. 43 %) shows that the machine vision system that we present is effective and suitable for the identification of broken inserts in machining head tools and ready to be installed in an on-line system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for in situ {{localization}} of multiple inserts {{by means of}} machine vision techniques, a challenging issue {{in the field of}} tool wear monitoring. Most existing research works focus on evaluating the wear of isolated inserts after been manually extracted from the <b>head</b> <b>tool.</b> The method proposed solves this issue of paramount importance, as it frees the operator from continuously monitoring the machining process and allows the machine to continue operating without extracting the milling head for wear evaluation. We use trainable COSFIRE filters without requiring any manual intervention. This trainable approach is more versatile and generic than previous works on the topic, as it is not based on, and does not require, any domain knowledge. This allows an automatic application of the method to new machines without the need of specific knowledge on machine vision. We use an experimental dataset that we published to test the effectiveness of the method. We achieved very good performance with an F 1 score of 0. 9674, in the identification of multiple milling head inserts. The proposed approach can be considered as a general framework for the localization and identification of machining pieces from images taken from mechanical monitoring systems...|$|E
40|$|The Bearded Head in the Krannert Art Museum (acquisition number 1970 - 11 - 1) poses a {{significant}} problem of identification. Although there is no disagreement {{over the fact that}} it is a work of ancient art, it is unclear as to the period in which it was created. It has been defined in the past as a work of Greek sculpture, although it is now recognized as possibly having been sculpted in the Roman period. Without any provenance information attached to the head, this identification is suggested only by studying clues found in the sculpture itself. Some of the clues examined in this study include the type of marble used to sculpt the <b>head,</b> <b>tool</b> marks present on the head, and similarities to examples of sculpture with known provenances. Following a close examination of the head and consideration of the possible era of its creation, a history of the acquisition of the head is reconstructed. The head was bought with the understanding that it was a work of Greek art by the assistant to the director of the Krannert Art Museum, who was eager to build an impressive collection of ancient art and may have been taken advantage of by a dealer who was extremely knowledgeable in ancient sculpture. An examination of the two parties??? backgrounds as well as correspondence between the assistant to the director and others concerning the head is studied to try and determine whether the dealer was aware of the questionable identification of the head and continued to represent it as a work of Greek art, or whether he was genuinely under the impression that the head was Greek in origin. Analyzing the documents surrounding the acquisition of the head will lead to a greater understanding of the process of the sale of artworks of questionable provenance to small museums without access to the means for thorough professional authentication...|$|E
