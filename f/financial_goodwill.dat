The IAASB proposes to replace the current three-paragraph standard by a new four-page report that will add two new elements: an opinion about management’s use of the going concern assumption and an auditor commentary. The rationale for this five- or six-fold expansion under the proposal is that the commentary should help users better understand the audited financial statements and the audit.

40|$|In recent years, {{the family}} {{business}} literature has been featured by an increasing interest on accounting choices in family firms. In this paper, we attempt to contribute to this growing stream of literature and, basing on the socio-emotional wealth (SEW) perspective, {{we focus on the}} differences within family firms regarding accounting discretion in goodwill impairment decisions. We investigate a sample of US public firms in the period 2003 - 2015. As predicted by the SEW, our findings show that family firms are less likely to exploit discretion in goodwill impairment decisions than non-family firms. We also find that first generation family firms are more likely to exploit accounting discretion in goodwill impairment decisions than second or later family firms. First generation family firms display SEW concerns different from those of second or later generation family firms. This leads to a different approach to goodwill impairment. Our paper can contribute to earnings management literature in family firms. We show that family firms cannot be considered as a homogeneous group with the same propensity to exploit the discretion allowed by accounting rules in highly subjective fair value measurements. We suggest that earnings management literature needs a more fine-grained investigation on how family ownership affect accounting discretion. Once the firm control is ensured, the level of ownership may be less relevant than other features, such as the generational stage. Our paper can also contribute to family business studies. We show that SEW concerns affect complex fair value measurements with relevant impact on the financial markets, on the assessment of the firm’s health and ultimately on the controlling family supervising activity of the management. Our study has practical implications. Investors, banks, bondholders and lenders are now informed that <b>goodwill</b> <b>financial</b> reporting quality can vary across family firms at different generational stages and that SEW-related concerns can affect goodwill write-off decision in first generation family firms...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} causes and consequences of the goodwill reporting choices made by Canadian firms following the adoption of revised standards on purchased goodwill in 2002. Standard setters believed that by forcing firms to test goodwill for impairment every year, its economic value would be better reflected on the balance sheet, and its reliability and relevance improved. However, critics were worried that the fair value could not be measured reliably enough to warrant the move towards an impairment-only approach, {{they were concerned about}} the potential for management interpretation and bias, and they doubted that goodwill impairment losses would provide timely information to market participants. The empirical analyses contained in this dissertation are motivated by this debate. First, the dissertation shows that transitional goodwill impairment losses are associated with managers' incentives to both overstate and understate them, after controlling for economic impairment. Furthermore, independent board of directors and audit committees act as a constraint on Canadian managers' transitional goodwill reporting choices to ensure that the economic value of goodwill is better reflected in financial statements. Second, it is shown that investors perceive goodwill as an asset, and goodwill impairment losses as sufficiently reliable measurements of a reduction in the value of goodwill to incorporate them in their valuation assessments. Lower valuation weights are put on transitional goodwill impairment losses reported by firms with an independent board of directors while a higher valuation weight is put on transitional goodwill impairment losses recorded by firms with market value of equity lower than book value. Finally, the dissertation shows that transitional goodwill impairment losses were impounded in stock prices prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 /Section 3062. Overall, the empirical evidence contained in the dissertation is consistent with SFAS 142 /Section 3062 improving the quality of the <b>financial</b> information on <b>goodwill</b> provided in the financial statements...|$|R

This thesis focuses on goodwill impairment implemented and practised {{in the first three}} years after Hong Kong's adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Three issues - compliance, discount rate and audit quality with respect to goodwill impairment testing - are the focus of analytical and empirical attention. Understandably, {{one of the most controversial}} issues that has been discussed in <b>financial</b> reporting is <b>goodwill.</b> Goodwill impairment is argued to be one of the most difficult issues in practice. This thesis commences with a review of literature relating to goodwill with regard to its conceptualisation, techniques to avoid or alter its recognition, ways to measure and adjust it, and a description of key technical requirements of goodwill impairment in the context of Hong Kong. These issues are demonstrably reviewed in this thesis. This study focuses on filling the gap in knowledge of compliance, discount rate and audit quality in relation to goodwill impairment. To do so, detailed annual reports of listed firms collected from the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the period from 2005 to 2007, were drawn upon. Employing analytical procedures and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the study provides persuasive evidence on the issues of compliance, discount rate and audit quality with respect to goodwill impairment. The thesis concludes that the rates of non-compliance and poor quality of disclosure pertaining to goodwill impairment conducted by Hong Kong firms reduced in the first three years after Hong Kong's adoption of IFRS. However, non-compliance levels and poor disclosure quality were still high. The sample firms had a tendency to understate discount rates in comparison with independently estimated discount rates in all three years of the investigation. In addition, audit quality among the Big 4 auditors is proved to be heterogeneous rather than homogeneous. The thesis concludes that a big gap exists between the standard requirements of goodwill impairment and practice. In the context of Hong Kong, this research demonstrates that the efficacy of this standard is low. It is therefore likely that the application of goodwill impairment in practice will continue to cause concern for policy makers and standard setters. Mode of access: World Wide Web. xii, 280...|$|R
40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) This {{research}} {{examines the}} value relevance of book intangible assets, namely the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, {{to the market}} value of public firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) by using data from 2005 to 2012. This was a period which witnessed a convergence to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the International Accounting Standards (IAS) by the HKEx, and covers the course of the global financial crisis in 2008. The findings employing the assets-based model of Landsman (1986), suggest that, on average, both the book goodwill and the identifiable intangible assets are value relevant to the market values of the listed firms. However, the market tends to recognize goodwill but not identifiable intangible assets. Moreover, the findings of this research show that the value relevance of the intangible assets were influenced by the global financial crisis in 2008. Based on separate analyses for the period of 2005 to 2008 and for the period of 2009 to 2012, respectively, it is concluded that the market perceived goodwill differently before and after the 2008 global financial crisis, while the perception of identifiable intangible assets remains the same. To further explain, the study presents evidence that goodwill had a positive relationship with the market values before the global <b>financial</b> crisis, whereas <b>goodwill</b> was insignificantly associated with the market values of the listed firms after the global financial crisis. In contrast, identifiable intangible assets were negatively related to the market values of the listed firms in the periods of both pre- and post-global financial crisis. Despite this, it is uncertain as to why this phenomenon happened in the Hong Kong stock market, and presumably can occur in other stock markets as well. One possible reason may be the limitations of the accounting of intangible assets, according to the IFRS and the IAS, which was applied by all the listed firms in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The IFRS 3 and IAS 38 emphasise fair value instead of cost should be counted for intangible assets and aim to provide better and meaningful information to the market. However, there are still many limitations on the treatment and measurement of intangible assets. According to IFRS 3, goodwill is under annual impairment test, while most of the identifiable intangible assets are amortized. In other words, the carrying amount of the goodwill can be accounted in accordance with the actual performance of the listed firms, while most of the identifiable intangible assets are amortized based on their initial recognized amount, without re-measuring in the carry-forward years, no matter whether the operation of the company is good or not. Besides, the self-created intangible assets cannot be recognised, but might exist. These limitations of the accounting of intangible assets may affect the market investors’ predictions of the market values of the listed firms. In this connection, it is required that the regulators of the stock market and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) find a more reliable way of disclosing and measuring intangible assets, such that market investors can better rely on the incremental information disclosed by public listed firms...|$|R
40|$|Anglo-American {{relations}} {{throughout the}} Second World War {{and the years}} that followed, were at times coloured by the history of Zionism. This {{was the result of}} transfer of the Zionists' main effort from London to Washington in the hope of capitalizing on, and increasing, Zionist pressure there. The Zionists, faced with abandonment of British support for their aspirations in Palestine, due to strategic considerations, hoped that American intervention in British Palestine policy might cause Britain to resume that support. But no serious American attempt was made to prevent the introduction, in May 1939, of the British anti-Zionist White Paper policy. This lack of American pressure continued throughout the war. But as soon as the war ended, active American intervention began. The result, according to the evidence of the British Foreign Minister of the time (Bevin), was Britain's decision to abandon Palestine. This thesis endeavours to show the course of these Anglo-American relations, and to describe the development of the forces that prompted and perpetuated this American intervention. The thesis shows how in a first phase, which lasted until the beginning of 1943, the Government of the United States was reluctant to intervene for virtually the same reasons as governed the change in British policy that dates from 1938, when in face of the Axis threat they abandoned their attempt to impose the partition of Palestine and sought to maintain relations with the Arabs that would be good enough to suit their strategic ends. Consequently, throughout the war, world Jewry was faced with a grim combination of Nazi persecution of the Jews in Europe [...] later to become their total extermination [...] and the closing of the asylum of Palestine by the British. This combination had two main effects on the Jews: in America it enhanced the recruitment of the majority of Jews to the ranks of the Zionist movement, while in Palestine it reinforced Jewish determination to fight the White Paper, even by resort to violence. The common characteristic of both developments was the increase in Zionist impatience and Zionist militancy. In the course of that development, American Zionists, inspired by visitors from London and Palestine, pursued a dream that realists considered impossible of fulfilment. Before anyone in America knew the full dimensions of the holocaust and before victory in the war seemed in any way assured, the American Zionists illustrated their belief that "the hour of redemption would soon strike," and produced the "Biltmore" programme. These American Zionists believed that a Jewish State in the whole of Palestine, should be given to them "by the world", {{at the end of the}} war, and that this was going to be the true outcome of Jewish suffering. In the second phase, which ran between the beginning of 1943 and the end of the war, their Messianic dream gradually turned into a political programme. 1943 was the year in which the German threat to the Middle East came to an end. As the Allies' victory loomed in sight, not only the Zionists, but both the British and the United States began to consider the future of Palestine. The British Cabinet, largely under the influence of Churchill, saw the final phase of the war as providing it a better chance to tackle the problem than the post-war era was likely to be. Before long, it reached the conclusion that the White Paper must be replaced by a partition and accordingly drew up concrete plans. Significantly, however, the Cabinet decided to make its stand secret, until implementation of its plan was possible. It decided to exclude even the United States from knowledge of it. In consequence, an asymmetric relation developed between the two powers in which the British were told of American schemes and proposals for Palestine (most of which were merely random improvisations) but did not tell the Americans their own. The relationship amounted to a dialogue of the deaf. When, for reasons that this thesis will explain, the chance to implement partition was missed, Britain appeared to the Americans, as well as to the rest of the world, as doggedly adhering to the White Paper policy. This impression both increased Zionist beligerency, helping to make the post-war British position in Palestine impossible, and hardened the attitude of President Truman, causing him to start intervening. After 1943, two conflicting tendencies developed simultaneously in America, both affecting Middle Eastern policy. On the one hand, a scare about oil shortage and about other American interests in the Middle East, awakened an American wish to win Arab goodwill. On the other hand, mounting Zionist and (through Zionist effort) American public pressure on the Administration, brought about growing support for Zionist aspirations, particularly in Congress. This coincidence of pressures became a source of profound embarrassment to United States foreign policy makers. Since the British were at the same time disturbed by the prospects of growing difficulties in Palestine, springing from growing Jewish militancy, the one sense in which the two governments co-operated during the war in regard to Palestine was in an attempt to damp down Zionist agitation. This attempt gave birth to plans for a joint statement, condemning this agitation as impeding the Allied war effort; but the Zionists and their supporters managed to defeat this move. The result of the inner embarrassment caused to Americans was an ambiguous policy, according to which soothing statements were simultaneously made both to Jews and to Arabs only the former received these reassurances publicly; the latter learned of them in secret. This "two-way-talk" policy reached its peak towards the end of the war. Before Roosevelt's death, in April 1945, he had reached the conclusion that a Zionist solution in Palestine was impossible to implement and to maintain without resort to force. This conclusion led him to abandon his earlier support for it and to seek solutions of a different character. He, however, did not have the time or the readiness to develop his ideas much further. In his last year in office, Roosevelt struggled to stem the mounting Zionist pressure on his administration. After his failure to issue the Anglo-American statement, he scored a temporary success by managing to shelve pro-Zionist resolutions in Congress. But he was ail-but completely disarmed during the 1944 election campaign. This campaign was marked by a flood of pro-Zionist utterances, made by both political parties and their candidates for the Presidency, as a result of skilful Zionist tactics; in this election campaign, as they were again to do in the future, the Zionists instead of adhering to one Party, as they had done in the past, put their vote up to auction. Nevertheless, politically, the American Zionists achieved very little during the war. Their only impressive success was the mass recruitment of Jewry itself. All their other seeming achievements, in the form of platforms and statements and promises, seemed, when the war ended, to have vanished into thin air. But the same happened to all the plans and schemes proposed during the war by Britain and the United States. Palestine was not discussed at Yalta and formed no part of mutual post-war arrangements. The secret partition plan of the British Cabinet lay in ruins and all the other alternatives looked just as unpalatable. What remained intact was the White Paper. In the third phase, which ran from the end of the war until early 1947, American intervention began and developed. But it did not take the form for which the American Zionists had hoped; nor did it in the end bring about the results they desired. While in Britain, the new Labour Government bitterly disappointed the Zionists, the new President of the United States a man little known to them [...] kept them in the dark from May until October 1945, even when he was acting, as they later discovered, "in their cause". Truman, as a matter of fact, was not exactly working "in the Zionists' cause. " His early intervention was confined to the attempt to solve what appeared to him the burning humanitarian problem of the Jewish displaced persons in the occupied zones of Germany. He believed that this was a problem limited in scope that could be solved comparatively easily. His efforts, throughout the first year and a half of his reign, were strictly confined to making Britain accept the admission of 100, 000 refugees into Palestine and not to furthering the Jewish State programme which he thought premature. But since the British Government failed to grasp the distinction he drew between these two aims, they gradually helped him to drift into greater support for Zionist aims. His shift culminated in the mid-term election campaign of the fall of 1946, when, for the first time, he was brought to support the idea of partition. The Labour Government was not deaf to American pressure. While they first regarded Palestine as their exclusive affair, the shock of Truman's intervention made them change course and try to harness American co-operation in solving the Palestine issue. But all their committees and the joint teams of experts which they formed together with the Americans, could not remove some basic disagreements in regard to the immigration of the 100, 000 which Truman continued to demand. The British were in fact giving way, step by step to this demand, but their retreat always came too late to match Truman's new leaning towards the Zionists. In consequence, both countries 1 hopes to amalgamate their Palestine policies did not materialize. The renewal of their war-time alliance, devised to contain the Soviet threat to the Middle East, failed to cover Palestine. Britain ended within a vicious circle. World events rendered her more and more dependent on American <b>goodwill,</b> <b>financial</b> and economic support for her sheer survival as a world power. She was therefore unable to act vigorously to quell Jewish terrorism in Palestine. At the same time she wished to replace the White Paper, long considered obsolete, with some better policy but to do this she needed tranquillity and moderation among the rival people of Palestine. But tranquillity was unattainable so long as Jewish terror remained active and that terror was the result of the continuation of the White Paper régime. In her despair, Britain tried to persuade both people, through simultaneous conferences held in London early in 1947, that they were both taking great risks by leaving her no choice but to withdraw. Her pleading, however, foundered on the rock of blinkered nationalism on both sides. This was the consideration that caused Britain, in February 1947, to throw the Palestine issue into the lap of the United Nations "without recommendations" [...] a step which led eventually to her complete withdrawal from Palestine. </p...|$|R
