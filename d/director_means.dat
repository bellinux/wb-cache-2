40|$|I {{would like}} to discuss with you the reason why {{agricultural}} commissioners are in the poison bait business. The {{following are excerpts from}} the Agricultural Code of the State of California. Section 100 describes a pest as follows: 2 ̆ 2 Pest means any of the following that is, or is liable to be dangerous or detrimental to the agricultural industry of this State 2 ̆ 2 and {{for the purpose of this}} talk only part two of this section is cited which states, 2 ̆ 2 any form of animal life. 2 ̆ 2 This is the part which covers vertebrate pests. Section 102 states, 2 ̆ 2 Each commissioner is an enforcing officer of all laws, rules and regulations relative to the prevention of the introduction into or spread within the State of pests and as to such activities is under the supervision of the director. 2 ̆ 2 (<b>Director</b> <b>means</b> the Director of the California State Department of Agriculture.) Section 129 states, 2 ̆ 2 The commissioner, whenever he deems it necessary, may enter and make an inspection of any premises, plant, conveyance or thing in his jurisdiction and if found infested or infested with a pest, etc., etc. - - -. 2 ̆ 2 This section and following sections provide the means by which abatement proceedings are carried out. To further facilitate the control of vertebrate pests, County Boards of Supervisors authorized their agricultural commissioners to prepare poison baits and sell them at cost and in some instances distribute them at no cost. This has been a common procedure since 1917 when the State Law prescribed rodent control as a specific function of the established agricultural regulatory set-up. Since 1917 large quantities of poison baits have been prepared. The 1920 Annual Report of the California Department of Agriculture states that counties in that year used 928, 538 pounds of strychnine bait for ground squirrel control. The agricultural commissioners have prepared and distributed an average of almost a million pounds of various poison baits per year. In addition to ground squirrels, baits are prepared for Kangaroo rats, meadow mice, rats, gophers, muskrats, jackrabbits and depredating birds. Bait mixing equipment remained quite simple for a number of years and consisted primarily of a rectangular box and a square nose shovel. In recent years there has been a replacement of hand mixing to mechanical mixers...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{emergency}} medicine clerkship director serves {{an important role}} in the education of medical students. The authors sought to update the demographic and academic profile of the {{emergency medicine}} clerkship director.  Methods: We developed and implemented a comprehensive questionnaire, and used it to survey all emergency medicine clerkship directors at United States allopathic medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. We analyzed and interpreted data using descriptive statistics. Results: One hundred seven of 133 (80. 4 %) emergency medicine clerkship directors completed the survey. Clerkship <b>Director’s</b> <b>mean</b> age was 39. 7 years (SD- 7. 2), they were more commonly male 68. 2 %, of Caucasian racial backgrounds and at the instructor or assistant professor (71. 3 %) level. The mean number of years of experience as clerkship director was 5. 5 (SD- 4. 5). The mean amount of protected time for clerkship administration reported by respondents was 7. 3 hours weekly (SD- 5. 1), with the majority (53. 8 %) reporting 6 or more hours of protected time per week. However, 32. 7 % of emergency medicine clerkship directors reported not having any protected time for clerkship administration. Most clerkship directors (91. 6 %) held additional teaching responsibilities beyond their clerkship and many were involved in educational research (49. 5 %). The majority (79. 8 %), reported being somewhat or very satisfied with their job as clerkship director.  Conclusion: Most clerkship directors were junior faculty at the instructor or assistant professor rank and were involved with a variety of educational endeavors beyond the clerkship.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} environmental factors on emergency medicine (EM) resident career choice. Methods: Program directors of all U. S. EM residencies were surveyed in November 1997. A 22 -item questionnaire assessed resources allocated to research, fellowship availability, academic productivity of faculty and residents, and career choices of residency graduates. Results: The response rate was 83 %. The program <b>director</b> (<b>mean</b> ± SD) estimates of resident career choice were as follows: 27. 8 ± 19. 1 % pursued academic positions with emphasis on teaching, 5. 4 ± 9. 8 % pursued academic positions with emphasis on research, and 66. 8 ± 23. 1 %, pursued private practice positions. In addition, 5. 70 ± 6. 13 % of the residency graduates were estimated to seek felloship training. Univariate analyses demonstrated that increasing departmental funding for research, having substantial resource availability (defined as having {{at least two of}} the following: dedicated laboratory space; support for a laboratory research technician/assistant, a clinical research nurse or study coordinator, a statistician, or an assistant with a PhD degree), a greater number of peer-reviewed publications by residents (r = 0. 22; p = 0. 08), and a greater number of peer-reviewed publications by faculty (r = 0. 26; p = 0. 04) positively correlated with the percentage of graduates who pursue academic research careers. Using multiple regression, however, increasing intramural funding and the presence of substantial resource availability were the only variables predictive of resident pursuit of an academic research career. Conclusion: Modification of the EM training environment may influence the career choices of graduates. Specifically, greater commitment of departmental funds and support of resources for research may enhance the likelihood of a trainee's choosing an academic research career...|$|R
40|$|One of the puzzles {{regarding}} IPO’s is {{that the}} issuers rarely get upset about leaving substantial amounts of {{money on the table}} due to underpricing. The cost of underpricing is the number of shares sold multiplied by the difference between the first-day closing price and the offer price. The research sample of IPOs and JSE databases comprised, respectively, 160 and 321 new applicants for the years 1995 - 1999. New applicants comprising the research sample raised R 12. 55 billion with an underpricing cost exceeding R 2. 85 billion i. e., 22. 71 percent of the IPO capital raised. This cost was found to be nearly 10 times greater than the R 295 million paid in fees to the corporate advisors by the issuing companies. The prime beneficiaries of this discount were a select grouping of private placement investors at the discretion of the corporate advisors and <b>directors.</b> <b>Mean</b> unadjusted initial first day returns amounted to 55. 04 percent.

40|$|Good {{corporate}} governance requires {{high standards of}} directors’ responsibilities. Directorial behaviour is often measured against conventional notions of fiduciary duties of directors. But fiduciary law {{is in a state}} of flux: although the core obligation of a fiduciary is an obligation of loyalty, what “fiduciary loyalty” encompasses is less clear. Conaglen recently suggests that the function of fiduciary loyalty is to protect nonfiduciary duties, and its nature is prophylactic and subsidiary. To <b>directors,</b> this <b>means</b> that a fiduciary duty of loyalty is imposed to protect performance of their other (non-fiduciary) duties such as the duty to act in the company’s best interests.
