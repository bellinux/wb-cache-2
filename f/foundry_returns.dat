50|$|Birch {{was one of}} 11 {{children}} and eldest son of a Foleshill ribbon manufacturer. He completed an engineering apprenticeship with a Coventry engineering firm which produced steam engines. About 1884 he joined bicycle manufacturers Starley Brothers of Coventry. The following year he moved to Sheffield and worked in a railway carriage factory. From there he worked in a steel <b>foundry</b> before <b>returning</b> to Nuneaton in 1888.|$|R
5000|$|In 1851, Wombourne was {{described}} by William White as a large village, [...] "occupied chiefly by nailors, {{who work for the}} neighbouring manufacturers". Nail-making remained important into the 20th century. As White implies, it was mainly the preserve of outworkers, who operated small-scale machinery in, or attached to, their own homes, fetching iron sheet or rod from the <b>foundries</b> and <b>returning</b> the finished product.|$|R
50|$|He {{studied at}} the Braunschweig University of Technology from 1888 to 1891, later {{attending}} the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He then went to Berlin, where he studied under Otto Lessing, Fritz Schaper and, until 1905, worked with Adolf Brütt. He maintained a private studio during most of these years. In 1910, he became Brütt's successor as Director of the Weimar Sculpture School and their <b>foundry.</b> He <b>returned</b> to Braunschweig in 1913 and remained there until his death.|$|R
25|$|In July 1906 metalworkers went to {{a general}} strike which lasted until November, when a {{collective}} agreement was reached. Another strike followed in January 1909 and lasted until March, apart from <b>foundry</b> workers who <b>returned</b> to work in April, and steel plate workers who came back in May.|$|R
5|$|Born in La Ceiba, Honduras to an American {{father and}} a mother of Spanish heritage, Stephen Wood Van Buren was {{orphaned}} at age ten and was sent to live with relatives in New Orleans, Louisiana. There he attended Warren Easton High School, and tried out for the football team originally as a sophomore, but {{did not make the}} team. Later that year he {{dropped out of high school}} and went to work in an iron <b>foundry.</b> He <b>returned</b> to high school two years later and made the team as an end his senior year. He played well enough that season to earn an athletic scholarship to Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlements}} evolved {{independently of}} each other and, until {{the arrival of the}} railway {{at the end of the}} 19th century, they were only connected by a gravel road. In addition to mining and ironworking, locals made a living from agriculture and stockbreeding. Different iron foundries belonged to different owners - the Zois, Ruard and Bucelleni families. Compared to other foundries around the world at the time, the Jesenice ironworks were out of date because modernization required a lot of investment money, which neither the Zoises, the Ruards, or the Bucellenis could afford. Help was offered by the Luckmann family of bankers from Ljubljana, who agreed to modernize the iron <b>foundries</b> in <b>return</b> for the foundation of a new shareholder company.|$|R
5000|$|The band's {{third album}} was {{released}} on 2 June 2014 on Navigator Records. Hannah, Oliver, Jim and Ruth began pre-production at their home studios and at Metway Studios with Al Scott (the Levellers) and re-located to Lewes Old <b>Foundry</b> studios.Joe Gibb, <b>returned</b> to co-produce the album with band member Oliver Austin. The album session saw many Brighton and Sussex players getting involved {{as well as some}} from further afield from a variety of music disciplines. Special guests include: ...|$|R
5000|$|The church's tower {{features}} the oldest ring of church bells {{remaining in the}} world. The five bells, hung in a modern steel frame for change ringing, are known as [...] "Wolsey's bells", after Cardinal Wolsey {{who was raised in}} the area. It is believed that Wolsey's uncle may have commissioned one of the bells. Four of them were cast circa 1450 and a fifth added circa 1480. The bells remain undamaged and unmodified, and still include their original clappers. In 1985 the bells were removed when the tower was declared unsafe. After reconstruction of the tower and the installation of a new bell frame, the bells, having been overhauled by the Whitechapel Bell <b>Foundry,</b> were <b>returned</b> to working use in September 2009. According to the IHCT, the next oldest set of five are located in St Bartholomew the Great and date from 1500.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} {{on the different}} practices applied in non-ferrous foundries. Kind and quantities of wastes and methods of waste prevention and waste processing are reviewed in special consideration of regeneration/recycling of <b>returned</b> <b>foundry</b> sands {{and the use of}} such sands as additives in building materials. For four enterprises, analyzed as examples, conceptions of improved prevention and processing of shake-out sands are presented. By sand regeneration and by application of cold box processes the yield of shake-out sand can be reduced to 20 - 35 % of the former level.
