The millimeter wave signal is generated by beating the output of two Nd:YVO 4 / MgO:LiNb 03 electro-optically tunable single mode microchip lasers realized monolithically in a single composite crystal. By applying a digital voltage signal to the electro-optic section, MSK modulation is impressed onto the millimeter wave subcarrier.

Lidar systems have been widely used for measuring range, velocity, vibration, and air turbulence [1 – 3]. Coherent detection has become a major detection mechanism in lidar systems because of the much improved receiver sensitivity compared with direct detection.

The MMIC receiver consists of a modified square-slot antenna, a three-stage low-noise amplifier, and a sub-harmonically pumped resistive mixer with on-chip local oscillator frequency multiplication chain. The transmitter chip is the dual of the receiver chip by inverting {{the direction of the}} RF amplifier. The chips are mounted on 5 -mm silicon lenses in order to interface the antenna to the free space and are packaged into two separate modules. The double-sideband noise figure (NF) and conversion gain of the receiver module are measured with the -factor method. The total noise temperature of 1310 ± 100 K(corresponding to an NFof 7. 4 dB), including the losses in the lens and antenna, is measured at 2 20 GHz with a respective conversion gain of 3. 5 dB. The radiated continuous-wave power from the transmitter module is measured to be up to - 6 dBm from 212 to 226 GHz. The transmitter and receiver are linked in a quasi-optical setup and the IF to IF response is measured to be flat up to 10 GHz. This is verified to be usable for transmission of a 12. 5 -Gb/s data stream between the transmit and receive modules over a 0. 5 -m wireless link.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new predistortion lineariza-tion scheme for single sideband mixers {{to be used}} for removing unwanted harmonics and intermodulation products of the digital intermediate frequency (IF) in an <b>heterodyne</b> <b>transmitter.</b> The proposed algorithm called poly-harmonic predistortion lineariza-tion relies on an orthogonal expansion in the frequency domain of the nonlinearities for the mixer modeling. It takes into account memory effects which are piece-wise quasi-memoryless and enables the independent cancellation of unwanted spurious sidebands of the digital IF harmonics. The poly-harmonic pre-distortion linearization scheme for the weak-nonlinear regime was implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and experimentally investigated for the linearization of a 4 -path polyphase single sideband upconverter. The ability of the poly-harmonic predistortion algorithm to linearize the 4 -path polyphase mixer for input signals with high envelope fluctuation is demonstrated. - 70 dBc/- 62 dBc/- 60 dBc spurious rejection and 18 dB/ 10 dB/ 8 dB linearization improvement of the 3 rd order distortions are achieved for a two-tone RF signal, a 64 -tone 10 MHz bandwidth multisine signal and OFDM signal respectively. The combination of the polyphase multipath technique and the poly-harmonic predistortion linearization technique offers an attractive filterless approach for the development of multi-mode broadband software defined radio.

40|$|Integration of mm-wave multiple-antenna {{systems on}} silicon-based {{processes}} enables complex, low-cost systems for high-frequency communication and sensing applications. While individual silicon devices struggle {{to achieve the}} same performance as III-V semiconductor-based transistors at mm-wave frequencies, the benefits of integration, such as good component matching and near-zero incremental device cost, can be leveraged to achieve good system performance. This dissertation presents different techniques and architectures for integrating mm-wave phased arrays on commercial silicon process technologies by demonstrating phased-array transmitters and receivers at 24 GHz, 60 GHz, and 77 GHz, in CMOS and SiGe BiCMOS processes. Initially, the tradeoffs of high-frequency systems are discussed in the context of Shannon capacity and the benefits of integrating phased arrays at such high frequencies are discussed in detail. An analysis of the output noise in a phased-array receiver in the presence of antenna coupling and input noise correlation is carried out and measurements on a discrete two-element array demonstrate the dependence of output noise on the phase-shift setting. The design of the first fully-integrated 24 GHz phased-array transmitter using mainly 0. 18 [mu]m CMOS transistors is described. The four-element array adopts a centralized LO-path phase-shifting approach using a multi-phase VCO. The on-chip 19. 2 GHz VCO generates 16 equally spaced LO phases leading to 7 degree beam resolution for radiation normal to the array. The transmitter includes four on-chip CMOS power amplifiers, with outputs matched to 50 Ohms, that are each capable of generating up to 14. 5 dBm of output power at 24 GHz. The array achieves a peak-to-null ratio of 23 dB with four elements active and can support data rates of 500 Mb/s on each channel (with BPSK modulation) while occupying 6. 8 mm x 2. 1 mm of die area. A high-resolution local LO-path phase-shifting architecture is presented as part of the first fully-integrated 77 GHz phased-array transceiver in a SiGe BiCMOS process. The SiGe transceiver includes four transmit and four receive elements (including 77 GHz LNA and PA), along with the LO frequency generation and distribution circuitry. The local LO-path phase-shifting scheme enables a robust distribution network that scales well with increasing frequency and/or number of elements, while providing high-resolution phase shifts. Each transmit element of the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>transmitter</b> generates + 12. 5 dBm of output power at 77 GHz, with a bandwidth of 2. 5 GHz leading to a four-element EIRP of 24. 5 dBm. Each on-chip PA has a maximum saturated power of + 17. 5 dBm at 77 GHz while the on-chip VCO achieves a phase noise of - 95 dBc/Hz@ 1 MHz offset at 54 GHz. The phased-array performance is measured using an internal test option and achieves 12 dB peak-to-null ratio with two transmit and receive elements active. While the 24 GHz and 77 GHz array are multiple-input single-output systems, higher-order phase-shifting and combining techniques can be used to achieve arrays with multiple outputs, with beams focused on different directions concurrently. Toward this end, a 60 GHz bidirectional RF-combined phased array front-end is implemented in SiGe BiCMOS, using a hybrid parallel/series phase-shift approach that reduces the requirements of the on-chip phase shifters, enabling RF signal combining. The four-element array enables simultaneous illumination of two angles of incidence and includes amplitude control, as well as continuous phase adjustment. The front-end has a noise figure lower than 6. 9 dB at 60 GHz and the array achieves full spatial coverage with peak-to-null ratio higher than 25 dB. The four-element front-end consumes 265 mW and occupies 4. 6 mm 2 of die area...|$|E
