40|$|The {{dairy sector}} is mostly {{concerned}} with market volatility {{and with the}} transformations of European regulations. In September, 2009, more than 60, 000 European dairy farmers halted or reduced milk deliveries to protest falling prices and the European Commission’s plans to scrap production quotas. The strike was initiated by the <b>European</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>Board</b> (EMB), a new European association of milk producers’ associations and unions, promoting an alternative discourse on the European and national regulations of the dairy sector. In France, among {{the highest rates of}} strikers were {{to be found in the}} Basque Country. This paper argues that the 2009 milk strike testifies the emergence of a new kind of protest, being simultaneously transnational and local. In the Basque case, the milk strike sheds light on two dimensions. First, the strike informs on the local perception of the Common agricultural policy and of European integration. Second, the strike challenged the traditional equilibrium between the two local farmers’ unions (FDSEA and ELB-Confédération paysanne) by the birth of a new specialised association, the APLI (Association de producteurs de lait indépendants), related to the EMB. The protest gave birth to a public controversy where European and territorial issues appeared to be intrinsically interdependent...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis] In {{light of}} the expiry of the EU milk quota in April 2015, the German Federal Association of Dairy Farmers (Bundesverband Deutscher Milchviehhalter e. V. (BDM)) and the <b>European</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>Board</b> (EMB) have put forward a {{proposal}} for the future management of the dairy market. The central element of this proposal is a Monitoring Agency which will not only monitor the milk market on a permanent basis and analyse developments but also implement a Market Responsibility Programme {{in the event of}} a crisis. Both the number and amount of market adjustments should be carried out in a flexible manner, depending on the market situation. Based on the calculated milk production costs, a target price range is defined in which the average European milk producer price should move. This system requires the introduction of both a basic volume and supply rights. Depending on the market situation, supply rights amounting to 3 - 5 percent of the existing (basic) supply rights will be granted to or withdrawn from dairy farmers. As an additional intervention measure, a remunerated scheme for the voluntary suspension of production in the tendering or bidding process should be implemented, together with strategic storage. The costs of the instruments are to be covered from a market regulation fund Furthermore, in order for this system to function, the existing regulation on protection at the EU 2 ̆ 019 s external borders on the basis of the Uruguay Round must be maintained (Fink-Ke A 2013).

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the case study of the Belgian fair-trade milk “Fairebel”, which was created by dairy farmers {{a few months after}} the 2009 European milk crisis. This innovation is overseen by the “Fair Milk” programme set up by the <b>European</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>Board</b> (EMB), a European organization of dairy farmers, which has established five fair-trade milk labels in European countries (Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France). At the Belgian level, the case study of the “Fairebel” project shows how the dairy system is institutionally, politically, and technically locked in. In such an irreversible system, the developers of “Fairebel” have had to use cunning and espouse some contradictions (even inconsistencies) in order to build their idea of fair-trade milk and to achieve its commercialization in the real world of commodities. Also, the “Fairebel” project is trying to increase the market power of dairy farmers and by-passes entirely the dairy industry in Belgium, which refused to support the project. For example, the developers of “Fairebel” stock up on the spot market and the Fairebel” milk cartons are produced and filled by the Luxembourg co-operative dairy Luxlait. On this level, the “Fairebel” project is more a “reorientation of trajectories” than a radical transition of the system: It uses internal resources of the main system to try to change some of its detrimental consequences, such as the prices paid to dairy farmers, without forcing through associated structural transitions. On the European level of the EMB, in which “Fairebel” participates, the transition of the system is radicalized by changing the character and the structure of the regime itself (e. g. CAP) : reversal of the balance of power between dairy farmers and dairy processors, re-appropriation of the means of production by the farmers, and modification of the economic and trade rules of the dairy products (e. g., monitoring agency). Taken together, these two levels of this fair-milk innovation strengthen each other, so that the transition that “Fairebel” has inspired is more radical than it would seem when the Belgian level is considered alone.

40|$|Canadian <b>milk</b> {{marketing}} <b>boards</b> are agricultural institutions tightly {{linked to}} the administration of dairy programs and supply management. Using insights from the New Institutional Economics (NIE) literature this paper investigates the factors influencing the emergence of these self-regulated, "hybrid" institutions that are managed by producers but necessitate governmental intervention to be operational. Our analysis focuses {{on the case of}} the Québec <b>milk</b> marketing <b>board.</b> It shows that the Québec <b>milk</b> <b>board</b> ensured transactional security among trading partners, where neither pure private ordering contract enforcement institutions, nor pure public ordering institutions would have succeeded to do so. The empirical case of the Québec <b>milk</b> <b>board</b> thus suggests that marketing boards in Canada may have historically assumed a broader function than merely increasing producers' rents.

40|$|The New Zealand town milk industry, as it {{has become}} known, was {{established}} as an entity in 1944. Prior to that time, milk supply to the urban areas was of variable quality and dependability. In order {{to improve the quality}} of supply, legislation was enacted which established the New Zealand <b>Milk</b> <b>Board.</b> The Board had the responsibility to control and regulate the industry with the objectives of improving milk quality and ensuring an adequate supply of milk to consumers on a year round basis. In order to do this, a quota system was established under which farmers guaranteed to supply high quality milk on a year round basis in return for a guaranteed price. If the supply was not maintained, penalties were imposed. The quotas for each area were set by the <b>Milk</b> <b>Board.</b> In addition, the <b>Milk</b> <b>Board</b> licensed <b>milk</b> processors in each area to receive the milk and arrange the supply to consumers. Milk vendors were appointed by the processors but were under the quality control of the <b>Milk</b> <b>Board.</b> <b>Milk</b> processors were responsible to the Board for the supply in their areas. Decisions on processing and other than normal day to day management matters were made by the <b>Milk</b> <b>Board.</b> During 1985, this system came under review by the Industries Development Commission. As a result of the report of the Commission and consequent discussions with the industry, the Government introduced legislation which came into effect on 1 April 1988 which partially deregulated the town milk industry. The <b>Milk</b> <b>Board</b> was discontinued and replaced by the New Zealand Milk Authority. The purpose of the Act (Milk Act 1988) was to provide for the continued home delivery of milk; and to reduce in other respects the regulation of the processing, supply, and distribution of milk for human consumption. Milk processors are now free to acquire milk in what ever way is most suitable to them. The quotas are now the responsibility of the milk processors. However, Milk Authority functions are (inter alia) to license milk processors, to allocate home delivery districts and to influence retail price competition. This means that the town milk industry is only partially deregulated. Obtaining milk from farmers has been completely deregulated but the processing and marketing of that milk is still subject to controls. As a result of the changes in the legislation, and in the case of packaging, prior to the legislation changes, there have been some significant developments in the town milk industry. Cartons and plastic bottles are now available as well as the traditional 600 ml glass bottle. There is some evidence that milk sales have increased since the introduction of alternative packaging. In the upper part of the North Island, the New Zealand Cooperative Dairy Company (NZCDC) has become the major force in the town milk industry through takeovers of smaller town milk processing companies. Some of the smaller processing plants have been closed and some town milk farmers are in the process of having their quota removed. Other are opting to move into factory supply rather than town supply. There is an increasing move towards the introduction of winter milk supply contracts with quotas being discontinued. This will lead to some herds being calved in Spring and others in Autumn. It has been suggested that this may lead to increased variation in milk quality as the town milk is drawn from different parts of the lactation time. Combining of milk powder and UHT milk with fresh winter milk has also been suggested as a possible option for winter supply. To date, the partial deregulation of the town milk industry has resulted in significant company ownership changes in the northern part of the North Island, some changes in the supply arrangements in that area, some consolidation of processing plant ownership in the southern North Island and very little change in the South Island. Continuing the industry monitoring process in order to identify the impact of deregulation should be a priority for future research...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the history}} of the <b>Milk</b> <b>Board</b> is {{documented}} in this report from its conception as the Central Milk Council in 1944 until its dissolution in 1988, there has been no attempt at a definitive historical narrative. The primary concern of this report has been to examine {{the nature of the relationship}} between the government and the town milk industry that has structured the administration of the milk service. The theory of corporatism which has been utilised in the study of interest groups' political interaction with the government, has been of value in many case histories of milk industries. Thus corporatist theory has also informed this examination of the political context of the regulatory <b>Milk</b> <b>Board</b> regime's path through regulation and deregulation. The history of the Town Milk Service is presented in this manner to increase understanding of both the nature of regulatory board structures and of government involvement in agricultural management. Further, it will be of value to administrators of emerging milk industries who may be exploring different organisational options that best serve the development of their liquid milk service...|$|R
