25|$|Unburned {{hydrocarbon}} (UHC) {{and carbon}} monoxide (CO) emissions are highly related. UHCs are essentially fuel {{that was not}} completely combusted, and UHCs are mostly produced at low power levels (where the engine is not burning all the fuel). Much of the UHC content reacts and forms CO within the combustor, {{which is why the}} two types of emissions are heavily related. As a result of this close relation, a combustor that is well optimized <b>for</b> <b>CO</b> emissions is inherently well optimized for UHC emissions, so most design work focuses on CO emissions.|$|E

25|$|Pregnancy {{is not a}} {{relative}} contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatments, {{although it may be}} for underwater diving. In cases where a pregnant woman has carbon monoxide poisoning there is evidence that lower pressure (2.0 ATA) HBOT treatments are not harmful to the fetus, and that the risk involved is outweighed by the greater risk of the untreated effects of CO on the fetus (neurologic abnormalities or death.) In pregnant patients, HBO therapy {{has been shown to be}} safe for the fetus when given at appropriate levels and “doses” (durations). In fact, pregnancy lowers the threshold for HBO treatment of carbon monoxide-exposed patients. This is due to the high affinity of fetal hemoglobin <b>for</b> <b>CO.</b>|$|E
25|$|The binding {{of oxygen}} is {{affected}} by molecules such as carbon monoxide (for example, from tobacco smoking, exhaust gas, and incomplete combustion in furnaces). CO competes with oxygen at the heme binding site. Hemoglobin's binding affinity <b>for</b> <b>CO</b> is 250 times greater than its affinity for oxygen, meaning that small amounts of CO dramatically reduce hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen. Since carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas, and poses a potentially fatal threat, carbon monoxide detectors have become commercially available to warn of dangerous levels in residences. When hemoglobin combines with CO, it forms a very bright red compound called carboxyhemoglobin, which may cause the skin of CO poisoning victims to appear pink in death, instead of white or blue. When inspired air contains CO levels as low as 0.02%, headache and nausea occur; if the CO concentration is increased to 0.1%, unconsciousness will follow. In heavy smokers, up to 20% of the oxygen-active sites can be blocked by CO.|$|E

40|$|Injecting {{and storing}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) in deep {{geologic}} formations is considered {{as one of the}} promising approaches for geologic carbon storage. Microbial wettability alteration of injected CO 2 is expected to occur naturally by microorganisms indigenous to the geologic formation or microorganisms intentionally introduced to increase CO 2 storage capacity in the target reservoirs. The question as to the extent of microbial CO 2 wettability alteration under reservoir conditions still warrants further investigation. This study investigated the effect of a lipopeptide biosurfactant—surfactin, on interfacial tension (IFT) reduction and contact angle alteration in CO 2 /water/quartz systems under a laboratory setup simulating in situ reservoir conditions. The temporal shifts in the IFT and the contact angle among CO 2, brine, and quartz were monitored <b>for</b> different <b>CO</b> 2 phases (3 MPa, 30 °C <b>for</b> gaseous <b>CO</b> 2; 10 MPa, 28 °C <b>for</b> liquid <b>CO</b> 2; 10 MPa, 37 °C <b>for</b> supercritical <b>CO</b> 2) upon cultivation of Bacillus subtilis strain ATCC 6633 with induced surfactin secretion activity. Due to the secreted surfactin, the IFT between CO 2 and brine decreased: from 49. 5 to 30 mN/m, by ~ 39 % <b>for</b> gaseous <b>CO</b> 2; from 28. 5 to 13 mN/m, by 54 % <b>for</b> liquid <b>CO</b> 2; and from 32. 5 to 18. 5 mN/m, by ~ 43 % <b>for</b> supercritical <b>CO</b> 2, respectively. The contact angle of a CO 2 droplet on a quartz disk in brine increased: from 20. 5 ° to 23. 2 °, by 1. 16 times <b>for</b> gaseous <b>CO</b> 2; from 18. 4 ° to 61. 8 °, by 3. 36 times <b>for</b> liquid <b>CO</b> 2; and from 35. 5 ° to 47. 7 °, by 1. 34 times <b>for</b> supercritical <b>CO</b> 2, respectively. With the microbially altered CO 2 wettability, improvement in sweep efficiency of injected and displaced CO 2 was evaluated using 2 -D pore network model simulations; again the increment in sweep efficiency was the greatest in liquid CO 2 phase due to the largest reduction in capillary factor. This result provides novel insights as to the role of naturally occurring biosurfactants in CO 2 storage and suggests that biostimulation of biosurfactant production may be a feasible technique <b>for</b> enhancement of <b>CO</b> 2 storage capacity...|$|R
