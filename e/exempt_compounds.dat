40|$|This {{rule sets}} {{requirements}} {{to control the}} emission of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) from excavating, grading, handling and treating VOCcontaminated soil {{as a result of}} leakage from storage or transfer operations, accidental spillage, or other deposition. Definitions (1) EXCAVATION is the process of digging out and removing materials, including any material necessary to that process such as the digging out and removal of asphalt or concrete necessary to expose, dig out and remove known VOC contaminated soil. (2) GRADING is the process of leveling off to produce a smooth surface including the removal of any material necessary to that process such as asphalt and concrete necessary to expose known VOC contaminated soil. (3) SOIL DECONTAMINATION MEASURE is any process approved by the Executive Officer to remediate, destroy, remove, or encapsulate VOC and VOC-contaminated soil. (4) UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK means any one or combination of tanks, including pipes connected thereto, which is used for the storage of organic liquid which is more than 50 % {{beneath the surface of the}} ground. (5) VOC CONTAMINATED SOIL is a soil which registers a concentration of 50 ppm or greater of Volatile Organic Compounds as measured before suppression materials have been applied and at a distance of no more than three inches from the surface of the excavated soil with an organic vapor analyzer calibrated with hexane. (6) VOC CONTAMINATED SOIL MITIGATION PLAN is a plan to minimize VOC emissions to the atmosphere during excavation and any subsequent handling of VOC-contaminated soil. 1166 - 1 Rule 1166 (Cont.) (Amended May 11, 2001) (7) VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) is any volatile compound of carbon, excluding methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, ammonium carbonate, and <b>exempt</b> <b>compounds.</b> <b>Exempt</b> <b>compounds</b> are defined in Rule 102...|$|E
40|$|Ground-level ozone {{can cause}} a variety of adverse health effects as well as {{agricultural}} and ecological damage. Controlling emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is important to reducing ground-level ozone; however, not all VOCs are photochemically reactive and several have been exempted from control regulations. Currently, there is no standard method for measuring the exempt VOC content of consumer products. This report describes the development of such a method. The new method involves heating a sample in an oven at 110 o C for 1 hour while purging the sample container with nitrogen gas. The resultant mixture of nitrogen and volatile compounds from the sample is then collected in a Tedlar ™ bag and analyzed by gas chromatography with mass selective detection (GC/MSD). An internal standard {{is added to the}} sample container to permit quantitation without measurement of the purge gas volume. The method was evaluated by analyzing samples that were spiked with known amounts of the <b>exempt</b> <b>compounds.</b> Recoveries of spiked compounds were excellent, ranging from 86 % to 107 % for the compounds and products tested. This method should be applicable to other volatile compounds that might be present in consumer products and could be useful in evaluating the risk that these products pose to the environment...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{cleaning}} of garments is primarily done by dry cleaning methods that use a non-aqueous solvent. Two cleaning solvents {{have dominated the}} dry cleaning industry [...] perchloroethylene and hydrocarbon solvent. However, several alternative cleaning processes and solvents have emerged that include, but not limited to: high flash point petroleum solvent, carbon dioxide (CO 2), volatile methyl siloxane (D 5), propylene glycol ether, n-propyl bromide, and water-based cleaning system such as professional wet cleaning. Perchloroethylene (perc) is {{the most widely used}} cleaning solvent in commercial dry cleaning because of its physical and chemical properties. In 1991, however, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) identified perc as a toxic air contaminant (TAC) associated with environmental and human health risks. In the same year, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) added perc in the Section 112 Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) list. Then in 1996, the U. S. EPA removed perchloroethylene from the definition of volatile organic compound (VOC), thus classifying perc as an <b>exempt</b> <b>compound.</b> Notwithstanding its status as an exempt solvent, perc dry cleaning facilities are stil...|$|R
5000|$|The NECC was {{classified}} as a compounding pharmacy. Such pharmacies are authorized to combine, mix, or alter ingredients to create specific formulations of drugs to meet {{the specific needs of}} individual patients, and only in response to individual prescriptions. Since 1938, the FDA had sole authority to regulate drug manufacturing which is subject to strict FDA regulations, but in 1998 Congress <b>exempted</b> <b>compounding</b> pharmacies from FDA oversight despite strong objections of then-FDA Commissioner David Kessler, making oversight the shared responsibility of state and federal agencies. Compounding pharmacies must register with the FDA, but are not registered as drug manufacturers, and the agency does not approve their prescriptions before marketing, nor automatically receive adverse events reports. State law generally controls record keeping, certifications, and licensing for compounding pharmacies. In 2003, an official from the Food and Drug Administration told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that in 2001 the agency had done a [...] "limited" [...] survey of drugs from 12 compounding pharmacies, including hormones, antibiotics, steroids, and drugs to treat glaucoma, asthma, and erectile dysfunction, and 10 of the 29 drugs failed one or more quality tests. However, grassroots mobilization of compounding pharmacists and actions of congressional lobbyists prevented an attempt to establish an FDA oversight committee on pharmacy compounding.|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of tryptamine derivatives and urea in Panaeolus cyanescens, {{also known as}} Copelandia cyanescens, from Australia, Hawaii and Thailand was investigated. All 70 collections contained psilocin, serotonin and urea. Those from Hawaii were also relatively rich in psilocybin, whereas the species from Australia and Thailand were virtually <b>exempt</b> of this <b>compound.</b> Many collections also contained detectable amounts of precursors as tryptophan, tryptamine and baeocystin, but 5 -hydroxytryptophan — widely encountered in many other Panaeoloideae — {{was found to be}} absent in all samples. The role of these 4 - and 5 -hydroxylated tryptamine derivatives in the metabolism of the fungus and their possible chemotaxonomic significance is briefly discussed.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{environmental}} chamber experiments and computer model calculations {{were carried out}} to assess the atmospheric ozone formation potentials of dimethyl carbonate and methyl isopropyl carbonate. The experiments consisted of determining {{the effects of these}} compounds on NO oxidation, ozone formation, OH radical levels, and other measures of reactivity when added to three types of simulated model photochemical smog systems. Both compounds were found to enhance NO oxidation and O 3 formation rates under all conditions, though relatively large amounts of dimethyl carbonate had to be added to have measurable effects. The addition of methyl isopropyl carbonate caused increased formation of formaldehyde and acetone, while dimethyl carbonate had no effects on formaldehyde or other organic products that could be monitored. The rate constant for the reaction of OH radicals with dimethyl carbonate was measured to be 2. 550. 64 x 10 - 12 cm 3 molec - 1 s - 1, using a relative rate method with propane as the reference compound. Atmospheric reaction mechanisms for these compounds were developed using the measured OH radical rate constants and estimates for the subsequent reactions. These mechanisms were found to give good predictions of the effects of these compounds on O 3 formation, NO oxidation, and product formation observed in the chamber experiments. These mechanisms were then incorporated in the overall SAPRC- 99 mechanism and used to predict the atmospheric ozone impacts of these compounds under various atmospheric conditions. The ozone impacts of dimethyl carbonate were found to be no more than ~ 30 % that of ethane on a mass basis, suggesting that it may be appropriate to <b>exempt</b> this <b>compound</b> from regulation as a VOC ozone precursor under the current standards used [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} for the U. S. EPA is to consider <b>exempting</b> volatile organic <b>compounds</b> (VOCs) from regulation as tropospheric ozone precursors {{if they can be}} shown to have lower or similar ozone impacts as does ethane. This paper discusses a procedure to estimate upper limit ozone impacts of compounds relative to ethane (or any other compound chosen to define the low-reactivity standard), if only the atmospheric reaction rate constants are known. This is based on deriving upper limits for the two factors which determine the ozone impact of a compound in a pollution episode: its kinetic reactivity, or the fraction of emitted VOC which reacts during the episode, and its mechanistic reactivity, the amount of ozone formed per molecule of VOC which reacts. Upper limit relative kinetic reactivities are derived from the ratio of the OH radical rate constants, with corrections being made if the VOC reacts with 03, NO 3 radicals, or by photolysis. Upper limit relative mechanistic reactivities are obtained from calculated relative mechanistic reactivities for a variety of VOCs for various one day ozone episodes. The minimum information needed for making such estimates is discussed, and examples are given for several representative low reactivity compounds...|$|R
40|$|Cette étude est basée sur la compréhension des problèmes liés à l'oxydation à haute température des huiles de base utilisées dans la {{formulation}} des lubrifiants pour moteurs automobiles. Les huiles étudiées sont d'origines différentes : huile Moyen-Orient et huile mer du Nord, respectivement à fortes et faibles teneurs en composés aromatiques et en soufre, huile hydroisomérisée et polyalphaoléfine, exemptes de ces composés, et huile hydrocraquée de composition intermédiaire. L'influence de la teneur et de la composition en produits aromatiques et en soufre des huiles sur la dégradation thermo-oxydante est montrée. Ces composés protègent naturellement les huiles de base contre l'oxydation, mais deviennent des précurseurs de dépôts dans des conditions d'oxydation sévères, en présence d'un catalyseur, tel le fer, qui est toujours présent dans un moteur. L'action des additifs antioxydants, inhibiteurs radicalaires et décomposeurs d'hydroperoxydes, est étudiée à l'aide d'essais d'oxydation en couche mince et en volume. Les produits d'oxydation sont identifiés, ce qui a permis d'améliorer la connaissance des processus de dégradation des composés en cours d'oxydation, et de montrer l'influence de ces processus sur {{la formation}} d'espèces oxydées volatiles, l'augmentation de la viscosité de l'huile et la formation d'espèces oxydées de haute masse molaire qui, en se condensant, participent à la formation de composés insolubles et de dépôts. This survey {{is based on}} an understanding of problems linked to the high-temperature oxidation of base stocks used for the formulation of lubricants for automotive engines. The oils investigated are of different origins : Middle East (MO) and the North Sea (MDN), which respectively have high and low aromatics and sulfur contents, hydroisomerized oil (HYDI) and polyalphaolefins (PA 06), which are <b>exempt</b> from these <b>compounds,</b> and hydrocracked oil (HYDC), which has an intermediate composition (Table 1). By tests during which the amount of oxygen consumed is controled continuously (IFP OXYTEST, modified TFOUT) and by differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC), we have investigated the behavior of these different base stocks with regard to oxidation. Mineral base stocks with high contents of aromatics compounds and sulfur are partially and naturally protected against oxidation. The same is not true for hydroisomerized base stocks, which contain no natural inhibitor and so are very easily oxidized (Fig. 2). However, all such oils become oxidized quickly as soon as they are subjected to high temperatures in the presence of air or oxygen and an oxidation catalyzing metal (Fig. 3). In the presence of soluble iron salts used as catalysts, we havefound that, to be partially selfprotected against oxidation, a base stock must contain a minimum of aromatic carbons (CA > ou = 5 %) and sulfur (S > ou = 0. 5 %), with this sulfur generally being linked to aromatic compounds in the thiophenic form (Fig. 4). We will also show that, whereas the oxidation of a base stock issuing from refining products causes an increase in the viscosity of this base stock, this increase is linked directly to the amount of oxygen consumed and depends solely on this amount, no matter what the antioxidant additive may be or the amount of catalyst present. For a given amount of oxygen consumed, the variation in viscosity is independent of the temperature and duration of oxidation {{as well as of the}} concentration and choice of the antioxidant (Table 3, Figs. 5 and 6). The antioxidant properties of natural sulfur-containing aromatic compounds have been demonstrated by incorporating them in polyalphaolefin PA 06 after they have been extracted from MO and MDN oils and by studying the oxidation stability of the mixtures thus obtained by thin-layer oxidation by DSC (Table 5). Whereas PA 06 has no natural resistance to oxidation, the addition of aromatic compounds coming from MO and MDN oils give this base stock an oxidation stability directly linked with the amount and composition of the sulfur-containing aromatic compounds added (Tables 6 and 7, Figs. 7 to 11). Paradoxically, such natural inhibitors present in base stocks become precursors of deposits when these oils are subjected to severe oxidation conditions. These sulfur-containing aromatic inhibitors react themselves according to a process involving the association of sulfur-containing molecules. This process leads to an increase in viscosity and the formation of insoluble compounds (Table 10 and Fig. 20). These insoluble compounds are not detected with saturated base stocks such as PA 06 or HYDI. The antioxydant effect of the radical-inhibitor and hydroperoxide-decomposer types has also been investigated, for each type of additive (Table 9 and Figs. 12 to 17) then together with synergism phenomena among such products (Figs. 18 and 19). By using high-performance analytical techniques (GC/MS, GC, 13 C NMR, IR spectroscopy, SEM, etc.), we have step by step, characterized the degradation products formed during oxidation, i. e. volatile products, liquid products and insoluble products (Table 17). All compounds polar products contained in these three components of oxidized oil are made up of hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl species :- The volatile products that we condensed when cooled (- 80 °C) are made up of a main aqueous phase and a supernatent organic phase (Table 12). These two phases contain nonsulfur-containing linear oxygenated constituents, alkanes as well as cyclical oxygenated components (lactones) and aromatics. The aromatic components are found solely in volatile products issuing from MO and MDN mineral base stocks (Tables 13 to 16). These products have a lower molar mass than that of base stocks and stem from the oxidation of hydrocarbons, from the oxidation and reactions of the recombination of oxidized products themselved and from termination reactions. Heavy soluble products are composed of species that may be divided into two categories (Tables 18 and 19) :- Nondialyzable products with oxygen contents of about 10 to 12 % and, for MO oil, 1. 3 % sulfur. They have a average molar mass of around 1, 000 g/mol and stem mainly from the oxidation of aromatic compounds contained in mineral oils. - Dialyzable products with molar masses always greater than those of the base stocks (400 to 500 g/mol) and oxygen contents of between 1. 8 and 3. 9 % mass. The increase in the average molecular mass of oxidized compounds and their aromatics content is determined by steric exclusion chromatography with both ultraviolet and differential refractometric detections (Figs. 23 and 24). The insoluble products, whether in suspension inside the oil or deposited on the walls of the oxidation reactor, have been identified by scanning electron microscopy and by 13 C NMR. - They appear in the form of spherical clusters, with a size between 0. 1 and 8 µm depending on the oxidation conditions. They are rich in oxygen (20 %) and concentrate the aromatic compounds and sulfur comingfromthe basestock. For example,the insolubles coming from MO oil contain 17. 5 % CA compared to 9 % in the initial oil. Their average molecular masses also depend on the initial CA and sulfur contents of the base stock and are between 1600 and 2300 g/mol (Table 20 and Figs. 25 and 26). This undeniably demonstrates that the presence of these sulfur-bearing aromatic compounds contributes in the formation of insoluble products during oxidation. Therefore, with regard to problems linked to oxidation and the formation of insoluble products, it seems desirable to formulate motor oil from base stocks that have undergone severe processing to remove sulfur-oontaining aromatic compounds such as the ones they naturally contain, and to reinforce their oxidation resistance by choosing a suitable combination of additives...|$|R
