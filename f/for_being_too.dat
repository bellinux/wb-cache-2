5|$|MediEvil 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. The game was mostly praised for its rich, detailed graphics but was criticised by many reviewers for its bad camera angles, easy difficulty and <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> {{similar to the}} first game.

50|$|In November 2000, Wells Fargo and Golden State Bancorp had {{expressed}} initial in purchasing Bay View Bank. However, Bay View Capital rejected their bids of approximately $325 million <b>for</b> <b>being</b> far <b>too</b> low.|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} when the Sparrow Guardian first sprays Willy with her magic spray he turns into an alligator which frightens her then she changes {{him into a}} mouse, in the English version this was cut <b>for</b> possibly <b>being</b> <b>too</b> frightening.|$|R
50|$|The show, {{along with}} other {{automotive}} reality programs such as Fantomworks, Garage Squad, Graveyard Carz, and West Coast Customs, has drawn criticism <b>for</b> both <b>being</b> <b>too</b> predictable in terms of plot and making automotive restoration look much easier than it actually is.|$|R
5|$|Schubert's piano sonatas seem to {{have been}} mostly {{neglected}} during the entire nineteenth century, often dismissed <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> long, lacking in formal coherence, being un-pianistic, etc. However, references to the last sonatas can be found among two nineteenth-century Romantic composers who took serious interest in Schubert's music and were influenced by it: Schumann and Brahms.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, {{the animals are}} both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> easy to hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.|$|E
5|$|The {{reviewer}} for Arcade Express {{magazine was}} positive about Space Cavern. The review praised the graphics of the player's death, while criticizing {{the design of}} the enemies, and finished the review by opining the game would be more suited for skilled players. TV Gamer review criticized it <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> simple and not requiring much brainpower.|$|E
50|$|Born in Barberà del Vallès, Barcelona, Catalonia, Rodríguez played {{four years}} with FC Barcelona as a youth, sharing teams with future Valencia CF, Barcelona and Spain player Jordi Alba. Both were {{released}} <b>for</b> <b>being</b> deemed <b>too</b> small.|$|R
50|$|Alba {{started his}} career at Barcelona, but was {{released}} <b>for</b> <b>being</b> deemed <b>too</b> small. After joining neighbouring Cornellà, he finished his development at Valencia, rising to prominence in La Liga with the club. In 2012, Alba returned to Barcelona.|$|R

5|$|The social {{impacts of}} American popular music have been felt {{both within the}} United States and abroad. Beginning {{as early as the}} extravaganzas of the late 19th century, American popular music has been criticized <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> sexually titillating and for {{encouraging}} violence, drug abuse and generally immoral behavior.|$|E
5|$|A mutant with {{a nearly}} indestructible layer of skin. In the film's early sequences, he is a {{formidable}} fighting man, but years later, due to a poor diet, has gained {{an enormous amount of}} weight. A fan of the X-Men movies, Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon as news of a new film came out. The suit went through six months of modifications, and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with ice water. David Harbour auditioned for the role, but was turned down <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> fat at the time.|$|E
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> little, too late.|$|E
5000|$|This {{dichotomy}} of [...] "victim" [...] vs [...] "power" [...] {{was criticized}} <b>for</b> <b>being</b> defined <b>too</b> broadly so that Wolf's argument became lost. In addition it lumps together diverse and radically different feminist schools, and this confusion aids antifeminists in their rhetoric.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{has been}} criticised <b>for</b> both wobblingand <b>being</b> <b>too</b> narrow to {{accommodate}} cyclists who {{are required to}} dismount and are barred from entering the Castlegate Centre in any case.|$|R
2500|$|Reviewers from USA Today and About.com {{criticized the}} band <b>for</b> <b>being</b> {{generally}} <b>too</b> [...] "cutesy", [...] "lacking of substance", [...] "not impressive to todays generation" [...] and [...] "soulless". A Yahoo! Music commentator {{has stated that}} it [...] "sounds like a soundtrack to a WB show".|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
5|$|Conker the Squirrel {{also had}} its own game. Originally named Conker's Quest, the title was renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64. However, the new title was criticised <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E
50|$|Spanky's Quest {{received}} extremely positive {{reviews for}} the Game Boy version, but {{was criticized for}} the fact that the player had to put a password in every time they want to continue their last save, the SNES title received mixed reviews with the criticism <b>for</b> it <b>being</b> <b>too</b> similar to the Game Boy version.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the series}} was popular and successful, there were some criticisms that it had received. The series was criticized <b>for</b> <b>being</b> far <b>too</b> preachy and moralistic. A Sawt Al-Umma article called it an [...] "educational channel show that had gotten lost along the way and ended up on Channel 1." ...|$|R
50|$|At an Impressionists's club, {{painters}} {{are arguing}} over {{the seriousness of}} art, prompting Dunlap to leave the room. Later in Paris, he meets Mr Gilbert and starts making a portrait of his daughter Virginia. They soon {{get married and have}} a child, Eleanor. However, Virginia shows no feeling of affection <b>for</b> her, <b>being</b> <b>too</b> busy with the vagaries of fashion and throwing parties.|$|R
5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} United States citizen in 1946 after {{serving in the}} United States Army and {{achieving}} the rank of sergeant. In so doing, he lost his Canadian citizenship, as Canadian law prior to 1977 limited dual citizenship. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 he attempted {{to sign up for}} active duty with the army's flying service (the United States Air Force was not formed until 1947), but was turned down <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> old. He therefore spent World War II in the United States Army and among his duty stations was Fort Lewis, located in Tacoma, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Kilmer is {{considered}} among {{the last of the}} Romantic era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional in style and does not break any of the formal rules of poetics—a style often criticized today <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> sentimental to be taken seriously. The entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root—especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse.|$|E
50|$|Once in {{the judging}} room, Tiziana, Lorena, and Alessandra {{received}} praises {{for making the}} most of their outfits and improving their runway walks, but Francesca B. is criticized for her manly walk, and Gilda <b>for</b> still <b>being</b> <b>too</b> sexy. Elena gets scolded for hiding her outfit and misusing her jacket while Francesca L. is reprimanded for walking hastily thus not showing her dress.|$|R
5000|$|The Galaxy Alpha {{received}} mixed reviews; although {{praised for}} its higher quality build and design {{in comparison to}} earlier products, the device was panned for its modest specifications in comparison to its flagship counterpart, the Galaxy S5, and <b>for</b> <b>being</b> priced <b>too</b> high <b>for</b> what they {{considered to be a}} [...] "mid-range" [...] smartphone.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Nayara Justino {{was voted}} as the Globeleza the samba dancing {{representative}} for the carnival season, only to be removed shortly after <b>for</b> allegedly <b>being</b> <b>too</b> dark. Justino {{was replaced by a}} much lighter skinned black women with mixed descent. Justino faced racist harassment via social media, and was given no concrete reason by Globo, the company behind the Globeleza as to why she was replaced.|$|R
