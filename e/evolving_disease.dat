Phytopathogens utilize specific determinants {{that help to}} breach reinforced cell walls and manipulate plant physiology to facilitate the disease process, while human pathogens use determinants for exploiting mammalian physiology and overcoming highly developed adaptive immune responses.

The FLS 2 -AvrPto interaction and Pto-AvrPto interaction appear to share similar sequence requirements, and Pto competes with FLS 2 for AvrPto binding.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Drawing on {{evolutionary}} psychological logic, {{we describe}} {{a model that}} links evolved mechanisms of disease-avoidance to contemporary prejudices against individuals with physical disabilities. Because contagious diseases were often ac-companied by anomalous physical features, humans plausibly evolved psychologi-cal mechanisms that respond heuristically to the perception of these features, trig-gering specific emotions (disgust, anxiety), cognitions (negative attitudes), and behaviors (avoidance). This disease-avoidance system is over-inclusive: Anomalous features that are not due to disease (e. g., limb amputation due to accident) may also activate it, contributing to prejudicial attitudes and behaviors directed toward peo-ple with disabilities. This model implies novel hypotheses about contemporary vari-ables that may amplify or reduce disability-based prejudice. We discuss past re-search within this context. We also present new evidence linking chronic and temporary concerns about disease to implicit negative attitudes toward and behav-ioral avoidance of disabled others. Discussion focuses on the conceptual and prac-tical implications of this evolutionary approach. KEY WORDS: disability; disgust; <b>evolved</b> <b>disease</b> avoidance; prejudice; stigmatiza-tion.
