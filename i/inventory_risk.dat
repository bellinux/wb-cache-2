5000|$|When {{publishing}} {{for game}} consoles, game publishers {{take on the}} burden of {{a great deal of}} <b>inventory</b> <b>risk.</b> All significant console manufacturers since Nintendo with its NES (1985) have monopolized the manufacture of every game made for their console, and have required all publishers to pay a royalty for every game so manufactured. This royalty must be paid at the time of manufacturing, as opposed to royalty payments in almost all other industries, where royalties are paid upon actual sales of the product—and, importantly, are payable for games that did not sell to a consumer. So, if a game publisher orders one million copies of its game, but half of them do not sell, the publisher has already paid the full console manufacturer royalty on one million copies of the game, and has to absorb that cost.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{complete}} and extend our previous work on stochastic control applied to high frequency market-making with inventory constraints and directional bets. Our new model admits several state variables (e. g. market spread, stochastic volatility and intensities of market orders) provided the full system is Markov. The {{solution of the}} corresponding HJB equation is exact {{in the case of}} zero <b>inventory</b> <b>risk.</b> The <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> enters into play in two ways: a path-dependent penalty based on the volatility and a penalty at expiry based on the market spread. We perform perturbation methods on the <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> parameter and obtain explicitly the solution and its controls up to first order. We also include transaction costs; we show that the spread of the market-maker is widened to compensate the transaction costs, but the expected gain per traded spread remains constant. We perform several numerical simulations to assess the effect of the parameters on the PNL, showing in particular how the directional bet and the <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> change the shape of the PNL density. Finally, we extend our results to the case of multi-aset market-making strategies; we show that the correct notion of <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> is the L 2 -norm of the (multi-dimensional) inventory with respect to the inventory penalties...|$|E
40|$|A {{supply chain}} may operate under either {{preorder}} mode, consignment mode or {{the combination of}} these two modes. Under preorder, the retailer procures before the sale and takes full <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> during the sale, while under consignment, the retailer sells the product for the supplier with the supplier taking the <b>inventory</b> <b>risk.</b> The combination mode shares the risk in the supply chain. The existing research has examined the supply chain modes from various operational aspects. However, the impact of financial constraint is neglected. This paper examines the impact of financial constraint and investigates the supply chain efficiency under each mode. Based on a Stackelberg game with the supplier being the leader, we show that without financial constraint the supplier always prefers the consignment mode, taking full <b>inventory</b> <b>risk.</b> Whereas, in the presence of financial constraint, the supplier will sell part of the inventory to the retailer through preorder, which shares the <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> in the supply chain. We show that with financial constraint, the combination mode is the most efficient mode even if the retailer earns zero internal capital.

40|$|While every firm in {{a supply}} chain bears supply risk (the cost of {{insufficient}} supply), some firms may, even with wholesale price contracts, completely avoid <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> (the cost of unsold inventory). With a push contract {{there is a single}} wholesale price and the retailer, by ordering his entire supply before the selling season, bears all of the supply chain’s <b>inventory</b> <b>risk.</b> A pull contract also has a single wholesale price, but the supplier bears the supply chain’s <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> because only the supplier holds inventory while the retailer replenishes as needed during the season. (Examples include Vendor Managed Inventory with consignment and drop shipping.) An advance-purchase discount has two wholesale prices: a discounted price for inventory purchased before the season, and a regular price for replenishments during the selling season. Advance-purchase discounts allow for intermediate allocations of inventory risk: The retailer bears the risk on inventory ordered before the season while the supplier bears the risk on any production in excess of that amount. This research studies how the allocation of <b>inventory</b> <b>risk</b> (via these three types of wholesale price contracts) impacts supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the supply chain’s profit to its maximum profit). It is found that the efficiency of a single wholesale price contract is considerably higher than previously thought as long as firms consider both push and pull contracts. In other words, the literature has exaggerated the value of implementing coordinating contracts (i. e., contracts that achieve 100 % efficiency, such as buy-backs or revenue sharing) because coordinatin...|$|E

WP 1212 This paper examines whether NASDAQ dealers' preopening quotes {{might be}} related to non-fundamental information, that is, information about transient trading pressure unrelated to fundamentals. Preopening quotes posted by wholesalers (dealers specialized in market-making and thus presumably more exposed to <b>inventory</b> <b>risks)</b> are strongly related to opening price reversals, a measure of transitory price pressure. Wholesalers are more likely to post preopening quotes on days characterized by large liquidity shocks or days following larger order imbalances, but not on days of strong informational asymmetry about fundamentals (days of analyst recommendation releases, earnings announcements or merger announcements). These patterns do not hold for other intermediaries, namely institutional brokers providing sell-side coverage. I also nd that daily order imbalances (another trading pressure measure) are strongly related to the preopening activity of wholesalers but not to any other groups of market-makers with more diversi ed banking activities. Overall, I interpret this as evidence that non-fundamental information matters during the preopening session and impacts intermediaries' preopening behavior...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the CDS market may be a threat to {{financial}} stability. Such concern may stem from the counterparty risk assumed by market participants and the high sensitivity of these instruments to the business cycle. The open interest of the CDS market mirrors investors’ maximum exposure and captures aggregate <b>inventory</b> <b>risk,</b> liquidity risk, and trading activity. In this paper, we aim to identify the main determinants of the dynamics of two alternative measures of open interest, the gross and net notional amounts. Our results suggest that both asymmetry of information and divergence of opinions on firms’ future performance help explain the growth of the net notional amount of single-reference contracts, but systematic factors have a much greater influence. Net notional amount growth of different obligors co-varies in time and the dynamics of open interest is pro-cyclical. The CDS market expands following a positive stock market performance and contracts when large negative (positive) jumps in stock (CDS) prices are perceived by investors. In line with the market microstructure theory, funding costs and counterparty risk reduce CDS market players’ willingness to incur <b>inventory</b> <b>risk,</b> thus contracting gross notional amounts. undação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia and FEDER/COMPETE (grant UID/ECO/ 04007 / 2013...|$|E

30|$|The broad {{empirical}} analysis {{supports the}} identification of contextual and industry-specific factors affecting design choices, and challenges in implementing the different distribution concepts. Our empirical findings show that most retailers still rely on distribution concepts via a central DC as a standard solution for achieving scale and pooling effects. For this reason, deliveries are rarely made from stores or suppliers. EY (2015) show that only 40 % of retailers think that their current execution of goods distribution is effective. Every third retailer states that, “having a responsive, combined omni and traditional supply chain infrastructure is a key success factor” (EY 2015). The integration of the channels from a customer point of view, and the implied insight into inventory, is a starting point, but not enough. Successful OC retailers {{need to be able}} to fulfill demand from any channel and from any inventory location (Baird and Kilcourse 2011). In the context of multi-channel network design, Alptekinoğlu and Tang (2005) and Liu et al.
