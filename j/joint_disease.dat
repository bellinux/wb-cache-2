5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or <b>joint</b> <b>disease,</b> and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E

25|$|Osteoarthritis (the endstage of {{degenerative}} <b>joint</b> <b>disease)</b> of the pastern or coffin joint is a {{very common}} cause of articular ringbone. Bone is then produced to try to immobilize the joint and to relieve the chronic inflammation of the joint capsule. This process may take years, and lameness will continue until the joint is completely immobilized.|$|E
40|$|Etiology of {{degenerative}} <b>joint</b> <b>diseases</b> Etiology of degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>diseases</b> {{is still}} not clearly understood {{and there is no}} specific management for this group of diseases. Various pathological conditions cause damage of the articular cartilage and lead to clinically and radiographically recognized impairment. Biomechanical, metabolic, genetic factors inflammation and other risk factors contribute to development of osteoarthrosis. Pathophysiology of degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>diseases</b> Osteoarthrosis is characterized by progressive erosion of articular cartilage and bone overgrowth at the joint margins. Cartilage integrity requires balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix components. Chondrocytes react to various mechanical and chemical stresses in order to stabilize and restore the tissue. Failures in stabilizing and restoring the tissue lead to cartilage degeneration that may be irreversibile. For better understanding of conservative management of degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>diseases</b> {{it is important to know}} the impact of pathophysiology mechanisms on development of degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>diseases.</b> There is great variability in the rate of progression of erosive processes in articular cartilage in clinical radiographic signs and course of the disease. This is in relation with many factors, as well as with management and response to therapy. Treatment of degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>diseases</b> Treatment should vary depending on the severity of disease and patient's expectations and level of activity. Besides analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, conventional and not conventional treatment and techniques can be used for management of osteoarthrosis. Physical therapy and exercises are very important for maintaining muscle strength, joint stability and mobility, but should be closely monitored for optimal efficacy...|$|R

25|$|Metabolic diseases, such as renal osteodystrophy, produce widening, while {{ochronosis}} {{results in}} calcific deposits in the symphysis. Inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, result in bony fusion of the symphysis. Osteitis pubis, {{the most common}} inflammatory disease in this area, is treated with anti-inflammatory medication and rest. Degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>disease</b> of the symphysis, which can cause groin pain, results from instability or from abnormal pelvic mechanics.|$|E
25|$|While {{osteoarthritis}} is a degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>disease</b> {{that may}} cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes {{occur in the}} earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by compressive force driving water out and hydrostatic and osmotic pressure drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the compressive force, whereas the Gibbs–Donnan effect and cartilage proteoglycans create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in.|$|E
25|$|Bone spavin is osteoarthritis, or {{the final}} phase of {{degenerative}} <b>joint</b> <b>disease</b> (DJD), in the lower three hock joints. It usually affects the two lowest joints of the hock (the tarsometatarsal and the distal intertarsal joints), with the third joint, the proximal intertarsal, being the least likely to develop bone spavin. This condition has various types: jack spavin when lesion on the tarsal and carpal bones is large, and high spavin when the pathology occurs higher in the joint than is typical. Conversely, occult spavin does not produce any significant exostoses on the small tarsals, whilst bog spavin and blood spavin do not involve bony changes.|$|E

25|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is a type}} of <b>joint</b> <b>disease</b> {{that results}} from {{breakdown}} of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, {{at the base of the}} thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the fine basketry {{for which they were}} named, Basketmaker II people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. They also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. Basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than [...] tall. Their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative <b>joint</b> <b>disease,</b> healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. They buried their dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. Basketmaker II people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout Mesa Verde. They depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. A common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the Hopi call Kokopelli.|$|E
