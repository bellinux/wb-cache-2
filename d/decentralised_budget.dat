40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} {{that for the}} green economy to develop successfully, new educational curricula {{will be required to}} help professionals develop appropriate knowledge and skills. Relatively few university courses have been developed to date that explicitly focus on the green economy, reflecting its recent origins. Here we present the lessons learned from developing and implementing a new Masters course in the green economy, at Bournemouth University in the UK. The most significant challenges were institutional barriers, such as different departmental policies and procedures and <b>decentralised</b> <b>budget</b> strategies, which inhibited the cross-departmental collaboration desired for interdisciplinarity. Uncertainty about the future development of the green economy and its value as a concept, among both teaching staff and prospective students, presented a further challenge. In addition, the development of an appropriate curriculum for green economy courses has received little attention previously. Here, we present an overview of the curriculum developed for this Masters-level course, and, based on our experience, we demonstrate how the challenges in developing such a course can successfully be overcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{personal}} {{social services}} in Sweden have undergone major changes during recent decades, {{partly due to the}} reforms caused by the influence of New Public Management (NPM) and partly due to the trend towards greater specialisation. These changes have had consequences for both social work management and for social work practice. The consequences for practice have gained attention both from research and from the field, but the consequences for managers have rarely been discussed. In this thesis therefore, the attention is directed towards the managers. Inspired by a mixed methods approach, this thesis aims to explore the personal social service managers’ perceptions of their organisational conditions and the content of their everyday work, as well as to interpret the managers’ experiences against the background of NPM influence, increasing specialisation and the specific circumstances that come with managing politically governed organisations. The results show that the personal social service managers in general were former professionals with extensive social work experience. The managerial work was to a great extent perceived as reactive, entailing constant interruptions and acute situations. The managers experienced a heavy workload that appeared to prevent them from engaging in strategic work and leadership {{to the extent that they}} would have liked. Substantial proportions of managers were dissatisfied with their own levels of influence compared to that of politicians and, in general, the managers perceived themselves to have more influence regarding aspects that were operational (such as methods and working procedures) compared to aspects related to organisational structure. Through the managers’ descriptions of their relations with politicians, it was revealed that the roles could be muddled, and that both managers and politicians could have difficulties in distinguishing between politics and administration, or politics and profession. Several changes that could be attributed to the influence of NPM were described by the managers. Some changes had consequences for the more technical side of management, e. g. <b>decentralised</b> <b>budget</b> responsibility, increased focus on cost effectiveness and downsizing of support functions. Other changes were more related to the overarching concept of management, which had consequences for the choice of managerial training, the expectations placed on the managers, and to some extent the managers’ own views on what good management should be. Despite the many indications of changes that may be attributed to NPM, an important result in this thesis is that NPM does not appear to have permeated social work to the degree that might have been expected. Rather, there are clear indications of a remaining professional identity among managers on all managerial levels, as well a continuing bureau-professional regime within the {{personal social services}}...|$|E
40|$|Despite the Dutch {{government}} {{pledging to}} reduce homelessness among youngsters, {{there are now}} about {{twice as many as}} in 2005. With (youth) care programmes <b>decentralised</b> and <b>budgets</b> cut back, the number of vulnerable youngsters - at risk of becoming homeless - is rapidly growing. Most homeless youngsters struggle with a variety of problems and have been in repeated contact with youth care programmes and workers. Resilience is considered a key factor that can help both survive homelessness and escape it, but although the topic has been extensively researched, results find only limited implementation. The experiences of stakeholders (youngsters, social workers, politicians) with resilience and the factors contributing to it are {{beyond the scope of this}} exploratory, qualitative research. According to the literature, though, they all confirm that resilience is a key issue for the population in question and agreed on most of the factors shaping it. Projects like U- 2 B-Heard!, Back-Up and MTT Spirit! strive to build up the resilience of vulnerable youngsters. All those involved - including the youngsters - underline the importance of a relationship of trust between client and social worker in creating resilience. Client participation and experiential expertise also appear to play an important role...|$|R
40|$|The {{break-up}} of {{the former}} Soviet Union has created a greater realisation of the health and health care deficiencies of what are now independent states {{and the need for}} reform. The purpose of these two papers is to describe these deficiencies and set the scene for the establishment of some form of national health insurance in Russia and the other states in the near future. The level of infant mortality across the former Soviet Union in 1990 was 21. 8 per thousand. This average disguised wide regional variations, from 32 to 55 per thousand in the rural areas of Middle Asia to 11 to 18 per thousand in the more economically developed areas of the Baltic Republics, Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine. Average life expectancy in 1989 was 69. 5 years, 64. 6 years for men and 74 years for woman, and there were significant regional variations. The major cause of death is cardio-vascular disease and there is evidence not only of late diagnosis of disease but also of a large proportion of chronic diseases being undetected. During the 1980 s the health service expanded: more doctors were employed, the hospital bed stock increased and outpatient clinic capacity rose. The rate of hospitalisation is high and the utilisation of facilities us poor e. g. average length of stay exceeds 15 days. Any reforms will need to change the funding of health care and im prove the efficiency of the delivery system. Thus reformers are discussing the decentralisation of management functions away from the centre to the regions, improvements in management training, and improved coordination between the primary and secondary parts of the health care system. Experiments involving <b>decentralising</b> <b>budgets</b> being related to activity and outcome goals have been carried out in various parts of Russia. In Russian, legislation has been passed to introduce health insurance from January 1 st 1993. The fine detail of this scheme, even at this late stage, is still undecided. Furthermore the infrastructure to collect and distribute funds has not been created. Further legislation has been introduced which separates consumers, purchasers and providers. The health and health care problems in Russia and other parts {{of the former}} Soviet Union are great and the ambitions for reform are well articulated at the level of principle. However, the translation of these principles into practice, when the economy is facing high levels of inflation and decreasing output, and when the administrative structures to facilitate the finance and management of the proposed decentralisation system are absent, is a mammoth task. These papers demonstrate that Russian academics and policy makers recognise these problems and are rising to the challenge of resolving them. Russia, Soviet Union...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the scope}} and limitations of gender responsive budgeting in Mexico within the overall framework of fiscal decentralisation. However, <b>decentralised</b> gender responsive <b>budgeting</b> can be meaningful only when the local governments have significant assignment of functions and finance. Therefore, although {{the focus of the}} paper is gender responsiveness in decentralised budgetary policies, the initiatives to incorporate gender concerns in federal budgets are also analysed to capture the effectiveness of top-down approach in conducting gender budgeting. Specifically, the paper attempts to: (1) Analyse the fiscal decentralisation in terms of revenue and expenditure assignments and intergovernmental transfers in Mexico with a gender perspective. (2) Examine the federal government initiative in gender sensitive public service delivery in health sector. (3) Evaluate the role of provincial government and civil society organisations in the process of institutionalising gender responsive budgeting in the State of Oaxaca; through legislations, public policies, and budgetary process.

40|$|As {{developing}} countries move from policy to implementing adaptation to climate change, formal operational structures are emerging that exceed {{the expertise of}} any one actor. We refer to these arrangements as ‘meta-organisations’ that comprise many autonomous component organisations tackling adaptation. The meta-organisations set standards, define purposes, and specify appropriate means-ends criteria for delivering adaptation. Using empirical data from the three cases, Nepal, Pakistan and Ghana, the study identifies and analyses six attributes of the meta and component organisational structures. We argue that organisational structures are crucial to understanding adaptation, specifying policy and implementation. Our analysis demonstrates that while each country promotes similar objectives, the emerging structures are quite distinct, shaped by country-specific attributes and issues that lead to different outcomes. Nepal’s priority for a formal process has come {{at the cost of}} delayed implementation. Pakistan’s devolved approach lacks legitimacy to scale up the process nationally. Ghana’s use of existing <b>decentralised</b> structures and <b>budgets</b> relegates adaptation below other development priorities. These divergent structures arise from the different needs for legitimacy and accountability, and the relative priority attached to adaptation against other needs...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Differences in the {{clinical}} care of patients have been explained through the concept of practice variation, that is, the occurrence of established local medical procedures that varies between geographic areas. The primary measures introduced to eliminate undesirable differences in medical care are the introduction of medical guidelines and economical incentives that rewards the desired behaviour. Practice variation in primary care {{can be seen on}} different hierarchically organised levels (e. g. patient, physician, health care center (HCC)) and Multilevel Regression analysis techniques (MLRA) offer a suitable tool to analyse these kinds of data. Data extracted from computerised medical records are ideal for studying practice variation as they often comprise information from several levels. In the region of Skaraborg in Sweden a new database, the Skaraborg Primary care database (SPCD), comprising information extracted form the computerised medical records of all public health care centres has recently been established. The overall aims of this thesis were to examine the usefulness and quality of the SPCD database for research and to study practice variation in some important areas such as diagnosis registration, laboratory analysis ordering and prescriptions. Furthermore, the influence of changes in the economic incentives on physician’s clinical behaviour was investigated. Material and Methods: In all studies data from the SPCD comprising data on individual patients from all public health care centres was used. The registration of diagnoses in the SPCD was validated by comparing the occurrence of recorded diagnosis in the diagnosis register of the database with the free text part of the patient medical records for a randomly selected sample of patients. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to investigate practice variation in prescribing and laboratory test ordering, focusing on measures of both frequency and variance. The effects of changes in economic incentives for diagnosis coding and prescribing were examined by comparing multilevel analysis results before and after implementation of the economic incentives. Results and Conclusions: The frequency of registration of ICD codes varied between diagnoses but also between physicians and HCCs. Different diagnoses need to be validated separately. The occurrence of practice variation was demonstrated both in laboratory test ordering where the physician level was the most important level and in prescribing where physician and HCC levels were equally important in explaining the observed variation. A positive effect in adherence to prescribing guidelines was demonstrated after the introduction of a <b>decentralised</b> drug <b>budget.</b> The introduction of a strong economic incentive for ICD coding showed the expected rise in coding rates and decline in variation, directly affecting the diagnoses register of the research database. Changes in the healthcare process will have a direct impact on the research database. Knowledge about the local health care processes is essential when interpreting database data. The SPCD seems as a good complement to previously established databases and quality registers, offering new possibilities when studying primary care...|$|R
