[...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E

[...] demanded the traveller, [...] "I can't keep it, you know, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down <b>here</b> and spend half-an-hour in {{returning}} the money. If you don't take it John, I must fling it under the engine or into the furnace." ...|$|R

See for yourself: 'Smoke observed.--Captain Kirkup and five hands of the {{schooner}} Currency Lass.' Ah! this is better," [...] he added, turning to the other log, [...] "The old man ain't written anything for a clear fortnight. We'll dispose of your log altogether, Mr. Goddedaal, and stick to the old man's--to mine, I mean; only I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write it up for reasons of my own. You are. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down right <b>here</b> and fill {{it in the way}} I tell you." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the songwriting process, [...] "I'm Not Alright" [...] was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} titled [...] "I'll Be Fine" [...] {{when it was a}} demo. Sanctus Real lead vocalist Matt Hammit said in an interview: [...] "This song definitely led the way for the honesty that was expressed on this record Face of Love ... We went into the studio with this [...] "I'll Be Fine" [...] song, and we just weren't having it. We were lying to ourselves even trying to write a song like that." [...] In April 2005, during a studio recording session, producer Christopher Stevens was playing chords they had planned for the track. The band decided to rework the lyrics to portray a different theme: [...] "You know what? I'm not all right. ... We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lie. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and try <b>to</b> sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good", Hammit said. [...] "We went over it and ended up with 'I'm Not Alright', which was a true confession of how we were feeling and gave us a little of the freedom and emotional release to be honest and vulnerable." ...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lie. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and try <b>to</b> sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What is {{the matter}} with you, Sydney?" [...] he asked. [...] "You are duller than ever. I am {{positively}} not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and mumble about the weather. How are the Carooms? Have you heard from them lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don’t you say ’there, there,’ to me, Captain Barber, because I won’t have it," [...] {{said the}} old lady, {{speaking}} with great rapidity; [...] "if you think that I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and be insulted by—by that woman, you’re mistaken." ...|$|E
3000|$|... “It’s a {{lot easier}} to show someone what we’re trying to say. We could just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and {{verbally}} speak about it but if you put your verbal words into a video, people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> back and go ‘now I know what he’s actually trying to say.’” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{time will}} come as {{it comes to the}} rest of us," [...] she declared, cheerfully. [...] "You won't want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and bury your talents in the sands all your days. Have you heard what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen to me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "As a rule, {{that leads}} to your having to fall back upon the other one; and a frontal attack on a difficulty's often quicker than {{considering}} how you can work round its flank.

6000|$|... "Thank God!" [...] said John, his {{nostrils}} sniffing wide, surprised by joy into the unwonted formality of grace. [...] "Now I'm {{going to take}} this chair with my back to the fire--there's been a strong frost these two last nights, and I can't get it out of my bones; the celery will be just the ticket--I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> {{and you are going to}} stand there, Morris Finsbury, and play butler." ...|$|E
