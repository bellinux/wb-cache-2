5|$|Desperate {{to recover}} the money, Le Chiffre kidnaps Lynd and tortures Bond, {{threatening}} to kill them both {{if he does not}} get the money back. During the torture, a SMERSH assassin enters and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for losing the money. The agent does not kill Bond, saying that he has no orders to do so, but cuts a Cyrillic 'Ш' (sh) to signify the SHpion (Russian for spy) into Bond's <b>hand</b> <b>so</b> that future SMERSH agents will be able to identify him as such.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} final match, City were level on points with {{neighbours}} Manchester United, with City holding the advantage in goal average – the first decider if teams finished level on points – but needing to win {{to be sure of}} staying above their cross-city rivals. Liverpool were three points behind, but had a game in <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> could still win the title if both City and United faltered. City faced tenth-placed Newcastle United at St James' Park; United were at home to bottom-half Sunderland. Bookmakers made United slight favourites for the title.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar {{near the end of the}} film, Gina Gershon hit her <b>hand</b> <b>so</b> hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.|$|E

But you know, Linda, that {{is very different from}} being in love; and it was very ill-natured of you to say so, very.' ...|$|R

5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his <b>hand</b> <b>so</b> he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were {{proportionally}} {{shorter than}} in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. The forearm was only a quarter the size of the upper arm. There were no carpalia in the <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> that the metacarpals articulated directly with the forearm. The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like metacarpal that may have represented an external 'spur'. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. Carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today's emus and kiwis, which also have vestigial forelimbs.|$|E
25|$|Typically, a {{modifier}} key is {{held down}} while another key is struck. To facilitate this, modifier keys usually come in pairs, one functionally identical key for each <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> holding a modifier key {{with one hand}} leaves the other hand free to strike another key.|$|E

25|$|After all tricks are taken, {{counters}} are tallied {{for each}} player. The three discards by {{the highest bidder}} count toward their counter score for the <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> {{there is always a}} total of 250 points for the trick score among the three players. If the highest bidder fails to make their contract by adding meld points and trick points from the play, then their score is negative the amount of the bid for that hand.|$|E
25|$|Then {{last night}} {{something}} happened which I can neither explain nor understand. In {{the middle of}} the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, {{about the size of a}} penny, accompanied by acute pain in {{the middle of the}} red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.|$|E
25|$|It was {{apparent}} that Brown could just string together a Test Eleven, and that was all. Nothing had been more disappointing that the continued poor showings by the young men of the side.

25|$|The St. Francis {{became the}} hotel where Republican presidents stayed when in San Francisco, while Democratic presidents usually stayed at the Fairmont. President Gerald Ford was almost shot while leaving the hotel in September 1975 by a woman named Sara Jane Moore. A former Marine named Oliver Sipple moved her <b>hand</b> <b>so</b> that Ford was not hit. President Ronald Reagan was a {{frequent}} guest of the hotel. The St. Francis also hosted many world leaders, including Queen Elizabeth II and Emperor Hirohito of Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Vandals {{did provide}} {{functional}} security and governed {{with a light}} <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> that the former Roman province prospered at first. Roman officials and Roman law continued, and Latin was used for government business. Agriculture provided {{more than enough to}} feed the region and trade flourished in the towns. Yet because of their desire to maintain a superiority in status, the Vandals refused to intermarry or agreeably assimilate to the advanced culture of the Romans. Consequently, finer points were overlooked; they failed to sustain in its entirety the workable society. The Berbers confederacies beyond the frontier grew increasingly powerful and troublesome.|$|E
25|$|As Perak {{continued}} to increase its mining operations, it suffered a shortage of labour. Looking to solve the problem, Malay administrator Long Jaafar invited the Chinese in Penang to work in Perak, particularly at Larut. By the 1840s, Perak's Chinese population exploded. The new immigrants {{more often than not}} were members of Chinese secret societies. Two of the largest were Ghee Hin and Hai San. These two groups regularly tried to increase their influence in Perak and this resulted in frequent skirmishes. These skirmishes were getting out of <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> that even Ngah Ibrahim, the Menteri Besar, or chief minister, was unable to enforce the rule of law.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{was quickly}} {{sworn in as}} President on Air Force One in Dallas on November 22, 1963, just 2 hours and 8 minutes after John F. Kennedy was assassinated, amid suspicions of a {{conspiracy}} against the government. He was sworn in by U.S. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a family friend. In the rush, a Bible was not at <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> Johnson took {{the oath of office}} using a Roman Catholic missal from President Kennedy's desk. Cecil Stoughton's iconic photograph of Johnson taking the presidential oath of office as Mrs. Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Vandals {{did provide}} {{functional}} security and governed {{with a light}} <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> that the former Roman province prospered at first. Large estates were confiscated, but with former owners as managers. Roman officials administered public affairs and Roman law courts continued, Latin being used for government business. Yet Romans would wear Vandal dress at the royal court in Carthage. Agriculture provided {{more than enough to}} feed the region and trade flourished in the towns. Yet because of their desire to maintain a superiority in status, the Vandals refused to intermarry or agreeably assimilate to the advanced culture of the Romans. Consequently, finer points were overlooked; the Vandals failed to sustain in its entirety the workable civil society situated subtly, uniquely. Berbers confederacies beyond the frontier grew increasingly powerful, dangerous to the prevailing regime.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{industrial}} innovations were {{not limited to}} weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a textile industry {{in an effort to}} compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians. Additionally, by hiring European managers, he was able to introduce industrial training to the Egyptian population. To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a corvée labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as Syria. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> as to be unable to fire a rifle.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the studio}} {{was set up}} to allow people {{in front of the camera}} to see {{themselves}} on monitors, and the videotapes were available to be watched by anyone, the two used the video to critique their own performance. They would deliberately fail on their first attempt at any given demonstration, and then use the video to find out what was visible to the researchers and what was not. They would then develop a technique that would not appear on video. Edwards found that one particular camera operator was on guard to capture any attempts at sleight of <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> he picked the man to assist him in one experiment, and he was replaced by a less competent cameraman. This was also a clear violation of one of Randi's caveats; the test run should have been stopped at this point and recorded as a failure.|$|E
25|$|Klitschko {{defeated}} WBO Heavyweight Champion Sultan Ibragimov at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 23 February 2008 {{to unify}} the IBF, IBO and WBO Heavyweight titles. The Klitschko-Ibragimov fight was the first heavyweight unification since Holyfield-Lewis in 1999. The unification clash with Ibragimov {{proved to be a}} huge disappointment for fans. Klitschko was very dominant from the first bell. He backed Ibragimov into a corner and proceeded to push down Ibragimov's glove with his left <b>hand</b> <b>so</b> he could not throw a punch. Though Klitschko won every single round, the crowd in New York City began booing after the second round. The boos and jeers increased as the fight progressed in the same fashion. Ibragimov's corner was almost silent from the sixth round onwards, unable to give their man any meaningful advice. Klitschko did not fight again in the United States until 2015 where he defeated Bryant Jennings.|$|E
25|$|The Indian violin, while {{essentially}} the same instrument as that used in Western music, is different in some senses. The instrument is tuned so that the IV and III strings (G and D on a western-tuned violin) and the II and I (A and E) strings are sa–pa (do–sol) pairs and sound the same but are offset by an octave, resembling common scordatura or fiddle cross-tunings such as C–G–C–G or A–E–A–E. The tonic sa (do) is not fixed, but variably tuned to accommodate the vocalist or lead player. The way the musician holds the instrument varies from Western to Indian music. In Indian music the musician sits on the floor cross-legged with the right foot {{out in front of}} them. The scroll of the instrument rests on the foot. This position is essential to playing well {{due to the nature of}} Indian music. The hand can move all over the fingerboard and there is no set position for the left <b>hand,</b> <b>so</b> it is important for the violin to be in a steady, unmoving position.|$|E
