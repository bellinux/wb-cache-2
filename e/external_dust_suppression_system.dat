Ever increasing pressure is placed on contractors to improve their environmental performance, especially dust emissions. Current methods of <b>dust</b> <b>suppression</b> have been investigated {{and each of the}} methods has also been critically analysed to determine their advantages and disadvantages. The investigation also examined the requirements of such a system and a concept system proposal was produced. A working prototype has been constructed for a mini excavator complete with a hydraulic breaker. The proposed system was rigorously tested in various configurations to determine its efficiency and effectiveness in comparison with current suppression techniques. The resulting benefits such as the reduction of water usage and cost are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The bulk {{materials}} handling industry faces significant {{challenges in the}} control of dust to ensure continued sustainable operation and to meet emissions regulations and goals. With Australia 2 ̆ 7 s industry emissions of particulate matter below 10 ¿m increasing from 530 million kilograms in 2009 / 2010 to 920 million kilograms in 2013 / 2014 [1] the problem is clear {{and the need for}} improved technology and methods for the control of dust is essential. This paper outlines some of the different techniques {{that can be used for}} the control of dust focusing on the use of water spraying <b>systems</b> for airborne <b>dust</b> <b>suppression.</b> The mechanisms contributing to efficient airborne dust capture are briefly described and some improved techniques for the design of airborne <b>dust</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> utilising new technology is outlined. New high pressure atomising technology presents the possibility of higher efficiency dust control systems when designed in combination with more readily available CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), DEM (Discrete Element Method) and CAD (Computer Aided Design) packages. The implementation of these technologies are presented with the aim of improved dust control system design...|$|R
40|$|The {{improved}} {{technology is}} a water-based <b>dust</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> for controlling concrete dust generated by demolition equipment, {{in this case a}} demolition ram. This demonstration was performed to assess the effectiveness of this system to (1) minimize the amount of water used to suppress potentially contaminated dust, (2) focus the water spray on the dust-generating source and (3) minimize the dust cloud generated by the demolition activity. The technology successfully reduced the water required by a factor of eight compared to the traditional (baseline) method, controlled the dust generated, and permitted a reduction in the work force. The water spray can be focused at the ram point, but it is affected by wind. Prior to the use of this dust control system, dust generated by the demolition ram was controlled manually by spraying with fire hoses (the baseline technology). The improved technology is 18 % less expensive than the baseline technology for the conditions and parameters of this demonstration, however, the automated system can save up to 80 % versus the baseline whenever waste water treatment costs are considered. For demolishing one high-walled room and a long slab with a total of 413 m{sup 3 } (14, 580 ft{sup 3 }) of concrete, the savings are $ 105, 000 (waste water treatment included). The improved technology reduced the need for water consumption and treatment by about 88 % which results in most of the savings...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} ten years, {{longwall}} mining systems have undergone many changes. Panel widths and lengths have increased. Longwall faces have become more automated. Average production from individual longwall panels has increased from 1, 000 to 3, 600 tons per shift. To control the dust generation resulting from the higher production, longwall dust control systems have integrated various dust control techniques. Systems designed to control dust generated at the crusherjstageloader, shearer, and supports are common to most longwall faces. A survey {{was made of the}} dust controls that are currently in place on all the longwalls in the U. S. This survey addressed the types of controls used to reduce dust generated at the crusherjstageloader, shearer and roof support movement. Additionally, information on face ventilation rates, cutting cycle and level of automation was obtained. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the dust control practices that have been implemented throughout the United States and to identify those controls that are being used on high production longwall faces. Additionally, a model is used to demonstrate how ventilation and automation affect occupational exposure. Automation of roof support movement can offer some of the greatest reductions in occupational dust exposures. While technically feasible, its f ull benefi t has not been fully realized by the industry. Until technology to fully automate longwall mining systems becomes more reliable, future dust control systems must rely on increased ventilation, application of headgate dust collectors, improved s hearer dust controls and improved shield <b>dust</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} {{the distribution and}} composition of dust produced at Pomona Stone Quarry mine in Harare, Zimbabwe. The source contribution to ambient PM 2. 5 and PM 10 dust levels were quantified and their spatial distribution from the quarry to the receptor (community). The study also analysed the pH of soils around the mine, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 levels in quarry dust. Data was collected through direct observations, personal communications, experiments, soil and dust sampling and analyses. Dust sampling was done in January, April and August, to assess the effect of meteorological conditions on dust concentrations in two phases. Phase 1 was conducted during plant shut down (baseline measurements) while phase 2 was carried out during full plant operations (normal operating conditions), to assess the effect of quarry operations on the surrounding areas. Within the quarry production processes, crushing stage was the most dust emitting stage. Phase 1 dust results showed that both respirable (PM 2. 5 ) and inhalable (PM 10 ) dust at all stages were below the legal limit, thus below 35 mg/m 3 (respirable) and 180 mg/m 3 (inhalable). Highest dust levels (209. 9 mg/m 3 inhalable and 69. 01 mg/m 3 respirable) were recorded in August, followed by April (206. 9 mg/m 3 inhalable and 67. 52 mg/m 3 respirable) then January (206. 82 mg/m 3 inhalable and 65. 27 mg/m 3 respirable). At all stages, highest dust concentrations for both parameters were recorded near the plant and decreased with increasing distance from the plant (ranging from 209. 9 mg/m 3 - 19. 41 mg/m 3 inhalable and 69. 01 mg/m 3 - 14. 23 mg/m 3 respirable). This was attributed {{to the effect of}} particle size. August recorded the biggest area for both parameters falling within the non-permissible category, followed by April then January. The findings also revealed that the quarry dust contained higher levels of SiO 2 (0. 752 mg/cm 3 ) which were 7 times higher than the recommended 0. 1 mg/cm 3 (NSSA). Low Al 2 O 3 levels of 0. 102 mg/cm 3 were recorded and this was considered as environmentally safe. Soils were slightly acidic-alkaline and the t-test results at 95 % confidence interval showed {{no significant difference between the}} results from site A and B (p = 0. 526). It was concluded that quarry dust from Pomona had no significant effects on soil pH but possible health impacts on the receiving community. The study recommended that <b>dust</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> such as water sprays, vegetation, air nets and enclosed production process must be implemented to curb dust emissions...|$|R
