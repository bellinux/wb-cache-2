5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All My Children due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let <b>go</b> <b>again</b> by the soap opera, with an official statement saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues.

25|$|Not until 1972 {{were younger}} East Germans {{permitted}} {{to travel to}} the West, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They were rarely permitted to take their own car but had to go by train or bus instead. A lengthy process had to be endured to register with the police for a passport and exit visa and to undergo close questioning about their reasons for wanting to travel. An application to travel had to be submitted well in advance of the planned departure. They also had to submit an application and undergo a personal evaluation at their workplace. Their employer would then submit a statement and various forms to the police. Applicants were left in the dark about the success of their application until the day before their departure. They were required to <b>go</b> <b>again</b> to the police and present various items of paperwork before obtaining a passport and visa, for which a 60DM fee was charged– a substantial fraction of an East German's monthly salary.|$|E
