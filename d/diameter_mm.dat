The struts are inverted to deliver higher bending rigidity (thanks to larger damping tube diameter) and less damping fade {{as a result}} of increased piston size. Springs are mounted offset so their centreline coincides with the pivot axis. This reduces road shock and - by minimising bump and rebound friction - provides less vibration.|$|E
5000|$|Crotalaria juncea {{has many}} {{practical}} {{applications in the}} modern world. First, it {{is a source of}} natural fibre. It is used for cordage, fishing nets, ropes, and more. It is particularly beneficial because of its resistance to root-knot nematodes and is also a soil improving crop via nitrogen fixation. The Sunnhemp Research Station of Uttar Pradesh further researched Crotalaria juncea’s genotypic impact on fibre yield. Four different genotypes of Crotalaria juncea were observed for three years to determine which genotype would yield in a high fibre yield. Important data that was collected across the plant genotypes include height (cm), basal <b>diameter</b> (<b>mm),</b> green biomass weight (q/ha), fibre weight (q/ha), and stick weight (q/ha). Out of the four genotypes, namely SUIN-029, SUIN-080, SUIN-037, and SUIN-043, SUIN-029 was superior in resulting in a high fibre yield. [...] This genotype can even be used as a template for future breeding.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cymbopogon flexuosus {{popularly known}} as {{lemongrass}} provides a lemon scented essential oil which is widely used in flavour and fragrance, perfumery, food and pharmaceuticals. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess antimicrobial activities of essential oils of three lemongrass cultivars viz., Pragati, Praman and Suvarna. Methods: Essential oils were isolated from one month old plants by hydro-distillation in mini Clevenger apparatus for 2 h. Antimicrobial activities were determined by agar well diffusion method Results: Lemongrass oils exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all the microbes except E coli. Mean inhibition zone <b>diameter</b> (<b>mm)</b> against bacteria was ranged 27 - 38 mm. B. Subtilis was the most sensitive bacterium to all essential oils. Essential oils also showed strong antifungal effects against both A. niger and C. albicans with mean inhibition zone <b>diameter</b> (<b>mm)</b> values 20 - 26 and 27 - 29 mm, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed that antimicrobial activity shown by essential oils were significant (p > 0. 05).
