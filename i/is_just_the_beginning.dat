5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later that night, Victoria {{returns to}} Roni's with a {{contract}} to have Roni sign over the place. Unfortunately, Roni changes her mind and tells Victoria {{that she is not}} selling out. Having been inspired by Jacinda's decision, she tells Victoria that she won't be ordered around by her, and this <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b> At the same time, Rogers examines a picture of Emma Swan in Lucy's book, and learns that his new partner is Detective Weaver. Henry begins work on a new story, and Jacinda returns to her job at Cluck's Chicken. On her way home, Jacinda finds a quarter and uses it to make a wish at the well, causing a hyacinth flower to sprout out of the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Elgin Military Museum {{may well}} be the only such museum on the {{continent}} that has space dedicated to an elephant. However, Jumbo, the largest elephant ever held in captivity, met his demise here in St. Thomas, Ontario on September 15, 1885. In 1985, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of his death, a life-size monument of this gentle animal was installed on the brow of the hill a hundred yards up the street from the museum. Finding a home for the monument had proved to be a significant problem until several members of the museum board (who just happened to serve on the Jumbo Monument Committee) convinced other members of the museum board to permit the statue of Jumbo to be placed in the parking lot the museum had just built on Talbot Street. However, that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the 'menagerie' which also includes the kangaroo and dolphins.|$|E

500|$|Rare {{unveiled}} {{their work}} on Xbox Live avatars, [...] (the next instalment in the Viva Pi√±ata [...] series), and [...] in 2008. Made by the core team that developed the first Banjo-Kazooie, [...] Nuts & Bolts received significant criticism from players due to its focus on vehicle construction rather than traditional platforming. Despite generally positive reviews, the company's titles for Microsoft sold poorly and Microsoft decided to restructure the studio {{at the end of}} the decade. In March 2010 Rare opened a new facility at Fazeley Studios in Digbeth, Birmingham. Later that year Microsoft confirmed that Scott Henson, a developer who had worked on the hardware and software designs of the Xbox 360 console and Kinect for Xbox 360, replaced Mark Betteridge as studio manager and announced a focus on Xbox Live avatars. Rare also shifted their focus to Kinect. According to Henson, [...] "Kinect will be the main focus for Rare going forwards as it's a very rich canvas. This <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of an experience that will touch millions of people". Rare's first Kinect project, Kinect Sports, was released in November 2010. Originally titled Sports Star, a more-complex sports simulation games, the game was streamlined into what Microsoft executive Don Mattrick hoped would be the Kinect equivalent of Wii Sports. According to a former Rare employee, the team was worried about the game during its development because of Kinect's limitations. Despite average reviews it was a commercial success, selling three million units by May 2011. Many non-Kinect teams at Rare and BigPark, another Microsoft studio, collaborated on the development of sequel [...] Combining with the sales of the first Kinect Sports, the game sold more than 8 million copies.|$|E

In February 2008, under the pseudonym Longnecks, the group trialled the new tracks. In July The Living End issued another top20 single, [...] "White Noise". The related album of the same name followed later that month. On 22 July 2011 they released their sixth studio album, The Ending <b>Is</b> <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beginning</b> Repeating, which reached No.3.|$|E

[...] The new construction will be a mixed-use development, with space for retail and restaurants, along with student residence halls and a new student recreation center. The university's expansion into the West Lee Street Corridor was triggered by UNCG's strategic housing plan, which calls for the university to increase the percentage of undergraduates living in university housing from 30 percent to more than 40 percent over the next decade.|$|E

Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described the group which [...] "emerged {{as one of the}} country's premier rock acts. By blending a range of styles (punk, rockabilly and flat out rock) with great success, The Living End has managed to produce anthemic choruses and memorable songs in abundance".

Fellow Allmusic reviewer Adam Greenberg found that on White Noise the group [...] "experiments a bit with new sounds but also seems to hang {{right on the edge}} of what they had been doing previously". Dave Donnelly opined that the band [...] "have been mining the territory between pop-punk and rockabilly for well over a decade now, and their experience shines through in the slick musicianship" [...] of The Ending <b>Is</b> <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beginning</b> Repeating.|$|E
2500|$|Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had {{achieved}} closer relations during Reagan's second term, but Bush was initially skeptical of Soviet intentions.

The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be [...] "premature" [...] due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, [...] "expectations [...] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [...] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." [...] But European leaders, including Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev, something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989. Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, [...] "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America.

2500|$|Crenshaw was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Louis Johnson of The Badger Herald gave the mixtape a very positive review: [...] "He's a diamond in the rough. For fans of West Coast hip hop, his music is infectious. Nipsey is proof that an independent artist can become {{a major force in}} today's world of Clear Channel sameness and major label monopolies. This <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> though. In a Tuesday tweet Nipsey said, '...I made a hunnit k today off my album throw away's.' If this is true, it's scary to think of how good his album will be." [...] Bruce Smith of HipHopDX deemed the project a [...] "free album" [...] (their highest praise for mixtapes). He said, [...] "The Bullets Ain't Got No Name series was music straight off Slauson Avenue; it was Hip Hop from a South Central state of mind. With his Marathon series, Nipsey offered himself as a Slauson boy, matured, and free of label politics. Crenshaw is where the two sets of projects meet up. While he may have never strayed far from the streets of Los Angeles, Crenshaw is like a homecoming for the artist that dropped the last two Marathon mixtapes, bringing the growth and maturity shown on the Marathon series back to a project that bares a close resemblance to the Bullets Ain‚Äôt Got No Name tapes. While not without its flaws, at its high points (of which there are many) Crenshaw is on par, or above what a lot of artists have put on shelves as of late." ...|$|E
