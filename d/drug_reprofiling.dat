40|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>reprofiling</b> is {{emerging}} as an effective paradigm for discovery of cancer treatments. Herein, an antipsychotic drug is immobilised using the Magic Tag chemical genomics tool and screened against a T 7 bacteriophage displayed library of polypeptides from Drosophila melanogaster, as a whole genome model, to uncover an interaction with a section of 17 -β-HSD 10, a proposed prostate cancer target. A computational study and enzyme inhibition assay with full length human 17 -β-HSD 10 identifies risperidone as a <b>drug</b> <b>reprofiling</b> candidate. When formulated with rumenic acid, risperidone slows proliferation of PC 3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and retards PC 3 prostate cancer tumour growth in vivo in xenografts in mice, presenting an opportunity to reprofile risperidone as a cancer treatment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of unresponsive tumors {{and the appearance}} of resistant tumors during the course of treatments both justify that we increase urgently the panel of pharmacological molecules able to fight cancer. An interesting strategy is <b>drug</b> <b>reprofiling</b> (also known as drug repositioning, drug repurposing or drug retasking) that consists of identifying and developing new uses for existing drugs. This review illustrates <b>drug</b> <b>reprofiling</b> with troglitazone (TGZ), a synthetic PPARγ agonist initially used for the treatment of type II diabetes. The fact that TGZ also displays anticancer effects is known {{since the end of the}} nineties but its development as an anticancer agent was slowed down due to hepatotoxic side effects. Part of the knowledge available for TGZ, mainly the molecular basis for PPARγ activation, its metabolization pathways and the side effects on hepatocytes, were taken into account to elaborate new molecules. Key findings were that unsaturated TGZ derivatives, when compared to TGZ, do not activate PPARγ, exhibit a higher efficiency on cancer cells and a lower toxicity towards hepatocytes. However, a weakness is that the mechanisms involved in the anticancer effects are still not completely understood and that the efficiency of such derivatives has not yet been completely studied in vivo. Data about this point should become available very soon from animal models and this will be a prerequisite to initiate clinical trials with these potential new anticancer drugs developed from a drug repurposing strategy...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Drug {{repositioning}} or <b>drug</b> <b>reprofiling</b> (DR) {{has recently}} been growing in importance. DR has a significant advantage over traditional drug development because the repositioned drug has already passed toxicity tests; its safety is known, {{and the risk of}} adverse toxicology is reduced. In the current study, we investigated the role of rebamipide, a mucosa-protecting agent, with recently reported anti-inflammatory function, in human osteoclastogenesis. Methods. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured in the presence of M-CSF and sRANKL. Osteoclast formation was evaluated by immunohistological staining for CD 51 / 61 (vitronectin receptors). Osteoclast formation, in {{the presence or absence of}} rebamipide (0, 1, and 3 [*]mM), was observed by time-lapse photography and actin ring formation. The number of absorption sites and area of absorption were calculated using Osteologic™ plates. Pit formation was studied by 3 D-SEM. Results. Rebamipide inhibited human osteoclast formation at 3 [*]mM, a pharmacological concentration, and inhibited resorbing activity dose-dependently. Rebamipide induced the degradation of actin rings in mature osteoclasts. This mechanism may involve inhibiting the osteoclast fusion pathway through reducing the expression of DC-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP). Conclusions. The present study suggests that rebamipide would be useful as a novel agent for osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
