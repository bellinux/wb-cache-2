5000|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air in February 1974 as WNIT-TV (the [...] "-TV" [...] suffix was dropped from the call letters in 1989). Prior to the station's launch, PBS {{programs}} had been offered to the market's commercial stations on a per-program basis, or via cable <b>from</b> Chicago <b>member</b> <b>station</b> WTTW.|$|R
50|$|INN {{also used}} reports <b>from</b> its <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> the Associated Press, United Press International, Visnews, and later CNN to {{supplement}} its own coverage. WPIX transmitted the national show's live feed at 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time. In the New York City area, WPIX paired {{a replay of}} the national INN broadcast at 10 p.m., with its own local newscast at 10:30, called the Action News Metropolitan Report.|$|R
50|$|The Minnesota Public Television Association (MPTA), also {{commonly}} known as Minnesota Public Television, is a not-for-profit trade organization of public television stations {{in the state of}} Minnesota that operates an interconnecting statewide educational television network serving residents of Minnesota. The MPTA network is two-way; distributing programming to and <b>from</b> each <b>member</b> <b>station.</b> It also tries to keep state funding for public television in the Minnesota budget.|$|R
50|$|The channel {{consists}} of content drawn exclusively <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> both older and current {{for which it}} is able to secure the rights. It doesn't make its own programmes in the UK, but a few of them are British productions which have been shown on PBS in the United States before being recycled back to the UK by PBS America, e.g. What the Ancients Did for Us.|$|R

50|$|Day to Day (D2D) was {{a one-hour}} weekday American radio newsmagazine {{distributed}} by National Public Radio (NPR), and produced by NPR {{in collaboration with}} Slate. Madeleine Brand served as host since 2006. Topics regularly covered by D2D included news, entertainment, politics and the arts; contributors included familiar NPR personalities, reporters <b>from</b> NPR <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> writers for Slate, and reporters from Marketplace, a show produced by American Public Media. D2D premiered on Monday, July 28, 2003, and fed to stations from noon ET with updates through 4:00 p.m. ET. It was the fastest growing program in NPR's history.|$|R
50|$|The channel {{originally}} {{aired on}} Channel 12 of Charter Communications Madison cable system (where it was commonly known by City Channel 12 or CitiCable 12). On September 30, 2008, the channel moved to Channel 98 on Charter's basic analog tier and Channel 994 on the digital tier. An aborted relocation plan in August 2008 {{would have seen}} the channel move to the digital-only tier, a move allowed by a provision in the Video Competition Act that was passed by Wisconsin's legislature in 2007; the move faced objections <b>from</b> the <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> of the Wisconsin Association of Public, educational, and government access (PEG) channels.|$|R
5000|$|Some or all {{of these}} {{services}} are available on the digital cable tiers of many cable providers, on free-to-air (FTA) television via C-band satellite, as well as via direct broadcast satellite. With the exception of Sprout, some of these services, including those <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> and networks, have not made contracts with Internet-distributed over-the-top MVPD services such as PlayStation Vue and Sling TV. With the transition to over-the-air digital television broadcasts, many of the services are also often now available as standard-definition multicast channels on the digital signals of some <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> while PBS-DT2 serves as a secondary HD feed. With the absence of advertising, network identification on these PBS networks was limited to utilization {{at the end of the}} program, which includes the standard series of bumpers from the [...] "Be More" [...] campaign.|$|R
50|$|Many PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> and {{networks}} - including Mississippi Public Broadcasting (MHSAA), Georgia Public Broadcasting (GHSA), Maine Public Broadcasting Network (MPA), Iowa Public Television (IGHSAU), Nebraska Educational Telecommunications (NSAA), and WKYU-TV (Western Kentucky Hilltoppers) - locally broadcast {{high school and}} college sports. From the 1980s onward, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe, especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential; in addition, starting with the respective launches of the MountainWest Sports Network (now defunct) and Big Ten Network in 2006 and 2007 and the later launches of the Pac-12 Network and ESPN's SEC Network, athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member university's sports programs for their cable channels, restricting their use <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> even those associated with their own universities.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} web portal {{environment}} {{for analysis of}} GPS displacement data that supports interactive scientific exploration at both a network-wide (macro view) and individual station (micro view) level. Underlying this environment is a hidden Markov model based analysis method that allows segmentation of the GPS time series into statistically meaningful classes, {{as well as a}} web services infrastructure that connects the data to the method and user interface. This user interface is primarily map-based, enabling regional understanding of surface displacement, but also supports other modes of interaction to facilitate understanding of the data. We demonstrate this environment using data <b>from</b> GPS <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> of the Plate Boundary Observatory located in California, and present some sample analysis results...|$|R
50|$|Speedvision's initial lineup {{featured}} various automotive programs, including various documentary-style series {{focusing on}} prolific vehicles, manufacturers, and racing teams (such as Victory by Design and Legends of Motorsport), series focusing on classic automobiles (such as Dream Car Garage, coverage of Barrett-Jackson's auctions, and My Classic Car, which {{moved to the}} network from TNN), an AutoWeek-branded television series, along with MotorWeek and Autoline Detroit - two programs respectively syndicated <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> in Maryland and Detroit. Speedvision also carried coverage of various minor and professional auto racing series, including the Sports Car Club of America's World Challenge series (of which it also acquired title sponsorship of in 1999, becoming the Speedvision World Challenge).|$|R
5000|$|Wisconsin was a {{relative}} latecomer to educational television, despite its earlier {{leading role in}} educational radio. Channel 21's radio sister, WHA-AM, {{is one of the}} oldest educational radio stations in the world. By the time channel 21 signed on, UW had already launched a radio network that evolved into today's Wisconsin Public Radio. However, until the late 1960s, the only other areas of the state outside of Milwaukee and Madison that had a clear signal <b>from</b> an NET/PBS <b>member</b> <b>station</b> were the northwest (from Duluth, Minnesota's WDSE-TV) and the southwest (from the Twin Cities's KTCA-TV).|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} SAFER Act, WCWF {{kept its}} analog signal on the air until March 4 to inform viewers of the digital {{television}} transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters. On May 6, 2009, due to the station's {{close proximity to the}} Canada-U.S. border, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) issued a conditional approval of WIWB's construction permit to expand its coverage area by increasing power. The approval was needed in order to work with interference problems resulting <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>station</b> WCMW across Lake Michigan in Manistee, Michigan sharing channel 21 and to address the concerns of interference in local health care facilities' radiological equipment. The increase in power was applied on September 8, 2009 and station officials asked viewers to rescan for the signal.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of the Franciscan Third Order Secular upon the society of medieval Europe was significant. The prohibition against carrying arms a dealt {{a blow to the}} feudal system and to the ever-fighting factions of Italian municipalities. The admission to the Order of <b>members</b> <b>from</b> all <b>stations</b> in life on an equal basis helped to promote social change and equality of opportunity in a period of rigid social stratification.|$|R
50|$|Despite Allbritton's {{best efforts}} to improve the station, WJXX failed to gain {{significant}} ratings traction in the market; in addition to lingering confusion from the early announcement that WBSG would be the ABC affiliate for Jacksonville and the subsequent early launch of channel 25, the combined signal of WJXX and WBSG was somewhat inferior to that of their two VHF competitors, CBS affiliate WJXT (channel 4, now an independent station) and NBC affiliate WTLV (channel 12). Not helping matters was the fact that WJXX was initially placed on channel 7 by local cable provider MediaOne (which later sold its Jacksonville system franchise to Comcast), which suffered from co-channel interference <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>station</b> WJCT, which transmitted its broadcast signal on VHF channel 7. Additionally, until the station's studios opened in December, WJXX relayed its signal to MediaOne directly from its transmitter, resulting in a lower-quality signal as it did not yet have a fiber optic relay to transmit the station feed to the provider.|$|R
5000|$|The American Revolution, a {{documentary}} {{film about the}} cultural, social and political impact of WBCN from 1968 through 1974, has been in production for four years. [...] The film is gathering historical material and accounts <b>from</b> <b>station</b> <b>members,</b> listeners and others, and is sharing the material online while the film is being produced to facilitate the archival research. The open research and production process that the film is utilizing has led to it being called the [...] "first open source/crowdsourced documentary." ...|$|R
50|$|KBOO is {{supported}} financially by donations <b>from</b> <b>members</b> {{and a small}} endowment. As of February 2006, the station had about 6,800 <b>members.</b> The <b>station</b> runs pledge drives twice each year. The annual KBOO budget in 2006 was about $900,000.|$|R
50|$|Leadership of the {{association}} is mainly rotated between representatives of the affiliated media houses. On 9 June 2000 the commercial operations of the CBU and the Caribbean News Agency were merged into the Caribbean Media Corporation, also based in Barbados, which has carried on the business of television production begun by the CBU. The CBU's current mandate includes the facilitation of some broadcast services, representation, and training of the staff of <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> {{in support of a}} unified Caribbean community.

50|$|In 2011, the {{association}} {{wrote a letter}} {{in support of the}} Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. In it, {{the association}} said it boycott was in line with the front-line community access broadcasting model of its <b>member</b> <b>stations.</b> The letter said the International Middle East Media Center, a <b>member</b> <b>station</b> in Palestinian territory, was reporting on the daily life for Palestinians for many of its <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> around the world. However, the association did not claim to speak on behalf of any <b>member</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

50|$|WCNY was {{initially}} a <b>member</b> <b>station</b> of National Educational Television (NET). When NET {{was replaced by}} the Public Broadcasting Service in 1970, WCNY became a <b>member</b> <b>station</b> of PBS. Over the years, WCNY has been responsible for producing programs and specials of local interest, some of which were distributed nationally by PBS and/or other outlets. Among the programs produced by WCNY and seen nationally include Old Enough To Care, a six-part drama that was picked up by PBS and distributed to their <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> in 1982, and Pappyland, a children's television program co-produced with Craftsmen and Scribes' Creative Workshop and telecast for three years on TLC's Ready Set Learn block, in addition to various PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
