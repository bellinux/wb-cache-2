A New York Times article cited Thompson's aides as saying on July 18 that he planned to enter the race just after Labor Day, followed by a national announcement tour.|$|E
25|$|The show parodies {{many things}} about popular culture, {{primarily}} being a spoof of {{shows such as}} Jackass; whereas they perform stunts designed to injure and/or humiliate an individual, the Fist team <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would obviously kill them. Such as jumping off cliffs, being hit by trucks, getting shot in the head, etc. These dangerous stunts and outlandish actions are usually achieved {{with the use of}} computer generated imagery. Indeed, one of the most innovative and noteworthy features of Double the Fist is its extensive and imaginative use of CGI, especially considering that the programme was produced for a very low budget, even by Australian standards ($250,000 for all 8 episodes).|$|E

In addition, Rock Kills Kid, The Pink Spiders, The Receiving End of Sirens, Envy on the Coast, Men, Women & Children, and Street Drum Corps joined the tour for select dates. Leto stated, [...] "We {{want to create}} a festival atmosphere. We plan on bringing an element of excitement and chaos and escape.

500|$|The {{film was}} given a budget of $4.5 million ($ in [...] dollars), modest by Hollywood {{standards}} at the time. Philip Hobel said it took about a year to secure the financing from EMI Films, whose major 1981 release, Honky Tonk Freeway, had been a box office failure. For the primary location, Rosa Lee's home and motel/gas station business, Beresford imposed one requirement: that no other buildings or large manmade structures be visible from it. The filmmakers eventually decided on a property that had been sitting abandoned by a Waxahachie highway. Mary Ann Hobel said the owner, when approached about its availability, immediately handed over the keys: [...] "We said, 'Don't you want a contract, something in writing?' And he said, 'We don't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> way here.|$|E

500|$|Tsakalotos {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "Marxist", and Ovenden has written that [...] "While Keynes is the main economic reference point for Varoufakis, who opposed the Brussels deal, for Tsakalotos, who signed it, Marx is more that guide to economic and political analysis." [...] Paul Mason described Tsakalotos as a [...] "classic Marxist of the New Left," [...] continuing that [...] "Tsakalotos comes from that school of Marxism which learned from the 1970s onwards to make compromises with capitalist reality." [...] In an interview with the Financial Times in September 2015, following his re-appointment, he said: [...] "I’m one of the government’s most left-wing ministers, politically speaking. However, I want to do things like the recapitalisation of the banks. I can <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> aren’t particularly left-wing." ...|$|E
500|$|Manson has {{referred}} to Born Villain as the band's [...] "grandest concept record". He has said its title {{was inspired by the}} controversy which surrounded the band after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, when elements of the mainstream media falsely accused the band of influencing its perpetrators. The title also references the nature versus nurture argument, with Manson elaborating to CNN: [...] "In any story, the villain is the catalyst. The hero's not a person who will bend the rules or show the cracks in his armor. He's one-dimensional intentionally, but the villain is the person who owns up to what he is and stands by it. He'll <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are sometimes morally questionable, but he does it because it's his nature to do it, and it never fluctuates." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2014, it was {{announced}} that Dutch music producer Afrojack and Thirty Seconds to Mars had collaborated on a remixed version of the song. It became commercially available for download in March 2014 and was later included on the deluxe edition of Afrojack's debut studio album Forget the World. Leto described the collaboration by saying, [...] "It was a lot of fun, and it's kind of our little summer song. I think it's good to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are unexpected. It keeps it exciting and collaboration is always an interesting thing." [...] The remixed version of [...] "Do or Die" [...] entered the Dutch Top 40 at number 53 on April 19, 2014.

500|$|Explaining why {{he chose}} {{to make a film}} about Scientology, Gibney told Reuters that he {{considered}} it [...] "an important topic. Not only about this church of Scientology, which everybody's fascinated with partially because of the celebrities, but partially because of the way that the church seems to turn people to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I think they would normally never do if had they not entered the church." [...] Gibney, Wright, and the former Scientologists who appeared in the film told a post-screening question-and-answer session that they hoped the film would raise public awareness about the alleged abuses committed by the Church of Scientology, and would prompt the media and law enforcement agencies to investigate further. Gibney later called in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece for Scientology's tax exemption to be revoked {{in the light of the}} allegations of abuse documented in the film.|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} the same year by House of Sand and Fog, a drama {{based on the novel}} by Andre Dubus III. She portrayed Kathy Nicolo, an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani (Ben Kingsley). After reading the script, Connelly said: [...] "(the story is) moving and beautifully written. I liked {{the fact that there is}} no good guy and bad guy. I found it really compelling that both sides <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are morally questionable, because life is often like that." [...] Producer Michael London said about Connelly's portrayal: [...] "I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had. I don't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace." ...|$|E

"Batgirl: A Matter of Family", {{which was}} {{developed}} by WB Games Montréal, is an [...] "Arkham Episode" [...] featuring Barbara Gordon as Batgirl set before the events of Arkham Asylum. Set in the Seagate Amusement Park, a nautical theme park built atop an oil rig, Batgirl and Robin team up to save her father, Commissioner Gordon, from the Joker and Harley. The content carries over the Dual Play function and hacking ability, which allows Batgirl to take down enemies, control objects, and solve puzzles. Design producer Justin Vazquez said, [...] "Hacking is really what separates her from the other characters... Our intention was that Batgirl should be less powerful than Batman, but that Batgirl plus hacking could give her opportunities to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> not even Batman can pull off." [...] The content was released on July 14, 2015, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with the Windows release on October 28, 2015.|$|E

500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve gave you the opportunities to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would really be memorable, if you could sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 2011, {{the actor}} {{took part in}} [...] "An Evening with James Franco", a Washington D.C. dinner benefit for 826DC, a {{non-profit}} foundation created to help neighborhood students reach their goals, {{as well as provide}} after-school literature programs and workshops that encourage them to improve their writing skills. Franco became involved with Dave Eggers' 826 National after Eggers asked him to do a conceptual idea for the program, and he directed a documentary for them and has since been a supporter of them. At the event, he spoke about how he thought schools needed to be more original with their literature programs. [...] "Writing can <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> video cannot", he added. In April 2011, Franco autographed a T-shirt that would be auctioned off through the Yoshiki Foundation, with the proceeds being donated for Japanese tsunami relief. On June 14, he was honored by amfAR, the foundation for AIDS research, at the Museum of Modern Art. Franco received the Piaget Award of Inspiration for his humanitarian work and contributions to men's style.|$|E
500|$|Retro {{decided to}} make the game more {{challenging}} than Metroid Prime—which was supposed to familiarize players with the control scheme—and felt that [...] "with the second Prime, we had the ability or the freedom" [...] to do so. They wanted Echoes to be focused towards a hardcore audience by making the player [...] "always worried about his health", so more mini-bosses were added to provide unique boss fights. After the game's release, the developers admitted that it was more difficult to develop than they first imagined, and Michael Kelbaugh, Retro Studios' president, commented: [...] "We wanted to expand and add to the title, and not just slam out a sequel. Nintendo doesn't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] Retro tried to include some extras, such as a hidden version of Super Metroid, but were halted by the short development time. Producer Kensuke Tanabe later revealed that the game was just about thirty percent complete three months before the strict deadline Nintendo had set for a release in the 2004 holiday season.|$|E
