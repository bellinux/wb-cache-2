5|$|The {{police found}} five {{passports}} on Martin {{in addition to}} his own—two British passports issued to Simon Davis, two Canadian passports issued to Sheila and Darin Damude, and a South African passport issued to Gerard Lowe—each with Martin's photograph affixed. They also found credit cards belonging to Sheila Damude and Gerard Lowe. In addition, police found Simon Davis' birth certificate, and items that Martin had used to immobilise and kill: a hammer weighing 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb), a battery-operated Z-Force III electroshock weapon, a can of mace, two pairs of handcuffs, a pair of thumbcuffs, two Police brand <b>foldable</b> knives, an oilstone and two Swiss army knives. Importation of some of these into Singapore is illegal.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, <b>foldable</b> and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a <b>foldable</b> shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom FG.1 and FGR.2 {{as built}} were similar, being fitted with broadly the same engines and avionics, {{although}} there were minor differences. The FGR.2 was fitted with the Mark 202 version of the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, while the FG.1 had the Mark 203; this was fundamentally the same, but the 203 had a modified control system for the afterburner, allowing it to light faster and enable power to be applied quickly {{in the event of}} a bolter on the small decks of the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. Both variants were fitted with a licence built version of the Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 avionics package; the FG.1 was fitted with the AN/AWG-11, which differed primarily in having a nose radome that was hinged and able to fold backwards against the aircraft's fuselage to allow for storage in the hangar of an aircraft carrier; the system was designed to be integrated with both the AGM-12 Bullpup missile and WE.177 as required. The AN/AWG-12 fitted to the FGR.2 was not <b>foldable,</b> and featured a better ground mapping mode, to take into account the strike role for which the type was originally procured; allied to this was a Ferranti inertial navigation/attack system (removed when the type converted to the air defence role). It was also configured to be able to control the SUU-23A gun pod, which the Royal Navy's FG.1s lacked.|$|E

The CMCR is designed to fire NATO SS109 5.56mm ammunition and ST Kinetics’ Extended Range 5.56mm ammunition, and come standard with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rails at the three, six, nine and 12 o’clock positions.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{experimented with}} the {{flexible}} Rogallo wing, which they renamed the Parawing, {{in order to}} evaluate it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules and recovery of used Saturn rocket stages. Under a directive by Paul Bikle, NASA engineer Charles Richard in 1961–1962 designed the collapsible four-tube Rogallo wing used in the Paresev. The Paresev series included wing configurations that were tightly <b>foldable</b> from the nose plate for easy transport, using initially a cloth sail and later one of Dacron.|$|E
25|$|The slim {{fuselage}} of the Nautilus did {{not have}} its keel aligned with the lower wing, as on most biplanes; rather, the centreline was at mid-gap. Blackburn used the gap between keel and wing to insert a faired radiator with a shutter-controlled front intake. This rather enhanced the Nautilus' pointed appearance. The wings were of two-bay construction with parallel struts, staggered and swept. Only the lower wing had dihedral. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The wings were <b>foldable</b> for carrier storage.|$|E
25|$|On April 27, 2017, Nintendo {{unveiled}} the New Nintendo 2DS XL (known as New Nintendo 2DS LL in Japan), which {{was released in}} North America and Europe on July 28, 2017 and Japan on July 29, 2017. The system is {{a variation of the}} New Nintendo 3DS line, featuring the additional hardware features and software compatibility of the New Nintendo 3DS, albeit without the stereoscopic 3D functionality, and a newly designed <b>foldable</b> screen. No announcements have been made on a non-XL variant of the system.|$|E
25|$|The SA 330 Puma is a {{twin-engine}} helicopter {{intended for}} personnel transport and logistic support duties. As a troop carrier, up to 16 soldiers can be seated on <b>foldable</b> seats; in a casualty evacuation configuration, the cabin can hold six litters and four additional personnel; the Puma can also perform cargo transport duties, using alternatively an external sling or the internal cabin, {{with a maximum}} weight of 2500kg. Civilian Pumas feature a variety of passenger cabin layouts, including those intended for VIP services. In a search and rescue capacity, a hoist is commonly installed, often mounted on the starboard fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} eight {{prototype}} Seirans {{was completed in}} October 1943, commencing flight testing in November that year. A problem with overbalance of the auxiliary wings was eventually solved by raising {{the height of the}} tail fin. Further testing was sufficiently successful for production to start in early 1944. In order to aid pilot conversion to the Seiran, two examples of a land based trainer version fitted with a retractable undercarriage were built. These were given the designation M6A1-K Nanzan ("Southern Mountain"). Besides the difference in landing gear, the vertical stabilizer's top portion, which was <b>foldable</b> on the Seiran, was removed.|$|E
25|$|Most phylogenetically {{advanced}} insects {{have two}} pairs of wings located on {{the second and third}} thoracic segments. Insects are the only invertebrates to have developed flight capability, and this has played an important part in their success. Insect flight is not very well understood, relying heavily on turbulent aerodynamic effects. The primitive insect groups use muscles that act directly on the wing structure. The more advanced groups making up the Neoptera have <b>foldable</b> wings, and their muscles act on the thorax wall and power the wings indirectly. These muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy <b>foldable</b> seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{panels are}} {{organised}} in two vertical registers, each with {{two sets of}} <b>foldable</b> wings with inner and outer panel paintings. The upper register of the inner panels contains form the central Deësis of Christ the King, Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. They are immediarly flanked, in the next panels by music playing angels, and, on the far outermost panels, the naked figures of Adam and Eve. The four lower-register panels are divided into two pairs; sculptural grisaille paintings of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, and on the two outer panels, donor portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints, sinners, clergy and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the Lamb of God. There are several groupings of figures, overseen by the dove of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
25|$|When players {{purchase}} the retail {{version of the}} main game, they receive one of three different cover arts; distributed randomly, players will receive a cover featuring either Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, or James Harden of the Houston Rockets. Although, a <b>foldable</b> insert featuring the other cover athletes is also included, effectively allowing the player to choose their preferred cover. If players {{purchase the}} special edition of the game, they will receive the Michael Jordan cover. Copies of NBA 2K16 in France feature Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs as the lone cover athlete, while Germany's copies feature Dennis Schröder of the Atlanta Hawks, and Spain's version features Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies, and Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls. This {{is the first time}} multiple covers of an NBA 2K game have been available since NBA 2K12 when Hall of Fame players Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and Larry Bird were one of the three cover athletes.|$|E
25|$|The Max-Littmann-Saal was {{originally}} called Großer Saal (Great Hall). After {{the end of}} renovation in 2005 it was officially renamed after the architect Max Littmann. The hall of about 455 square meters is 36 meters long, 16 meters high and {{is surrounded by a}} large U-shaped gallery. In the case of row seating, the hall accommodates a maximum of 1,160 guests, in the parquet about 660 and on the gallery about 500 seats. It is used for concerts, but also for conferences. Experts count it to the best concert halls of the world. The paneling of cherry-wood gives the hall, which is of the “shoebox type”, a much acclaimed acoustics. Behind the panelling a gap of five to ten centimeters to the wall acts as resonance space. Measurements during the renovation of 2005 brought reverberation times of 1.1 to 1.8 seconds. These acoustics are similar to the Boston Symphony Hall or the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. So the Max-Littmann-Saal often was used for recordings of classical music. In the recent past the Philharmonie Festiva and the conductor Gerd Schaller produced CD recordings of symphonic works of Anton Bruckner, Johannes Brahms, and Franz Schubert, as well as the first recordings of the opera Merlin by Carl Goldmark and the Great Mass by Johann Ritter von Herbeck. Many concerts of the Kissinger Sommer are recorded in the Max-Littmann-Saal by the public broadcasting company Bayerischer Rundfunk. The hall is connected to the neighbouring halls Grüner Saal and Weißer Saal by big <b>foldable</b> doors, which make it possible to enlarge the capacity of the Max-Littmann-Saal.|$|E
