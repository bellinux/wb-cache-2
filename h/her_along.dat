5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{suffrage}} and publishing work, Gordon was well-known in California political circles, and even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871. This positioned <b>her,</b> <b>along</b> with fellow suffragette Clara Shortridge Foltz, to manage the lobbying campaign for the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which granted women the right to practice law in California in January 1878. Gordon used her position as a journalist covering the debate {{to stay in touch with}} lawmakers and lobby the governor for the final signature.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not {{be taken to the}} Philippines, but Sutherland had brought <b>her</b> <b>along</b> anyway.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1895, Enrico Dandolo was {{extensively}} modernized, {{receiving an}} entirely new armament and new engines, {{as well as a}} second military mast. Caio Duilio received a much more limited refit in 1900, primarily receiving a large number of secondary guns. The Navy decided against rebuilding <b>her</b> <b>along</b> the same lines as Enrico Dandolo due to the prohibitive cost of the project. In 1902, Caio Diulio was removed from front-line service and thereafter employed as a training ship. Enrico Dandolo followed her in 1905 for service as a gunnery training vessel. In 1909, Caio Duilio was stricken from the naval register, disarmed, and converted into a floating oil tank. Her ultimate fate is unknown. Enrico Dandolo continued on in service for a few more years, first becoming a guard ship at Tobruk, Libya in 1913. After Italy entered World War I in May 1915, she was transferred to Brindisi and later Venice, where she continued guard ship duties. She was stricken in January 1920 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

Afterward, he is able to properly recollect his memories and thus return to the present with Rinoa's help. Seifer, no longer a Garden member, is once again reunited with Raijin and Fujin; Laguna visits Raine's grave (and remembers his proposal to <b>her)</b> <b>along</b> with Ellone, Ward, and Kiros; and a celebration takes place in the Garden, with Squall and Rinoa sharing a kiss under the moonlight.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived on}} the 8 Mile, in Royal Oak, in Rochester, and in the suburb Sterling Heights, Black grew up in {{and spent most of}} her life in various parts of Detroit, Michigan. Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. He owned a hair salon and brought <b>her</b> <b>along</b> to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents {{separated}} when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also expelled, shortly after, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to dropout, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen. Black had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, tap, and ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer. After being expelled from her last school, Black ran away from home. She started begging, doing drugs, and drinking while crashing at friends' houses at night. After going on tour with Armor for Sleep, she returned to Detroit and stopped taking drugs.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill, ready to marry her. Those who help <b>her</b> <b>along</b> her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.|$|E
5|$|Wheelbarrow: The {{earliest}} wheelbarrows with {{archaeological evidence}} {{in the form of}} a one-wheel cart come from 2nd century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 CE. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 CE. And then there is the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 CE). However, there are even earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BCE. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 CE) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCE23 CE), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing <b>her</b> <b>along</b> in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife was terribly ill.|$|E
