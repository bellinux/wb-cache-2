5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend {{unemployment}} insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, popular {{incumbent}} Democratic Governor Lynch was reelected {{to a third}} term in a landslide over Republican Joe Keeney and Libertarian Susan Newell. Lynch received 70.12% while Keeney took in 27.70% and Newell with 2.18%. Former Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen ousted incumbent Republican U.S. Senator <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> by a 6.34-percent margin of victory, giving the Democrats an additional seat in the U.S. Senate. However, Republicans also picked up 14 seats in the New Hampshire House of Representatives.|$|E

25|$|Senator <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> {{represented}} the swing state of New Hampshire. The state traditionally leaned Republican, but John Kerry from neighboring Massachusetts narrowly {{won the state}} in the 2004 Presidential election. New Hampshire also saw major Democratic gains in the 2006 elections, when Democrats took both of the previously Republican-held House seats, the gubernatorial race with a record vote share of 74%, and majorities in the State House and Senate, giving them concurrent control of both bodies {{for the first time since}} 1874. However, New Hampshire had not elected a Democratic United States Senator since 1975.|$|E
500|$|On February 16, 2005, Specter {{announced}} that he had been diagnosed with an advanced form of Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of cancer. Despite this, Specter continued working during chemotherapy. He ended treatment on July 22. Senator <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> (R-NH) shaved his head to show solidarity with Specter, who was temporarily bald while undergoing chemotherapy. On April 15, 2008, Specter announced his cancer had returned, at a stage [...] "significantly less advanced than his Hodgkin's disease when it was originally diagnosed in 2005". He underwent a second round of chemotherapy, which ended on July 14, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Although Kemp coaxed Bush {{to support}} a $4billion housing program that {{encouraged}} public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as {{did most of the}} Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force. [...] However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the bill}} was up for renewal in late December 2005, Feingold led a {{bipartisan}} coalition of senators – including Lisa Murkowski, Ken Salazar, Larry Craig, Dick Durbin, and <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> [...] – to {{remove some of the}} act's more controversial provisions. Feingold led a filibuster against renewal of the act. In February 2006, the Senate voted 96-3 to break the filibuster and to extend the Patriot Act.|$|E
2500|$|Within a {{few days}} of his conviction, Stevens faced {{bipartisan}} calls for his resignation. [...] Both parties' presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, were quick to call for Stevens to stand down. Obama said that Stevens needed to resign to help [...] "put an end to the corruption and influence-peddling in Washington." [...] McCain said that Stevens [...] "has broken his trust with the people" [...] and needed to step down—a call echoed by his running mate, Sarah Palin, governor of Stevens's home state. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as fellow Republican Senators Norm Coleman, <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> and Gordon Smith also called for Stevens to resign. McConnell said there would be [...] "zero tolerance" [...] for a convicted felon serving in the Senate—strongly hinting that he would support Stevens's expulsion from the Senate unless Stevens resigned first. Late on November 1, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid confirmed that he would schedule a vote on Stevens's expulsion, saying that [...] "a convicted felon {{is not going to be}} able to serve in the United States Senate." [...] Had Stevens been expelled after winning election, a special election would have been held to fill the seat through the remainder of the term, until 2014. Some speculated Palin would have tried to run for the Senate via this special election. No sitting Senator has been expelled since the Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|The House responded on September 11 {{that they}} {{unanimously}} {{disagreed with the}} Senate amendment, and agreed to a conference. They then attempted to make a number of changes to the bill however {{it was not enough}} for Republican Senators Larry Craig, <b>John</b> <b>Sununu</b> and Lisa Murkowski, and Democratic Senators Dick Durbin, Russ Feingold and Ken Salazar, who wrote a letter threatening to block the bill if further changes were not made. The House duly proposed a House report, which was incorporated into a Conference report, which was then presented to the Senate. However, the Senate rejected the report, and on December 16 refused to end debate on legislation to renew the Act. A cloture motion was then ordered, but it failed, having fallen seven votes short of invoking closure on the matter, leaving the future of the Act in doubt. The vote went as follows: Fifty Republicans as well as two Democrats voted unsuccessfully to end debate; Five Republicans, 41 Democrats and one independent voted to block. With the sunsets threatening to expire, on December 21 the U.S. Senate came to a bipartisan agreement (S.2167) to extend by six months the expiring provisions of the Act. Under House rules, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner had the authority to block enactment of the six-month extension. On the following day, the House rejected the six-month extension and voted for a one-month extension, which the Senate subsequently approved later that night. However, on February 1, the House voted to again extend the sunsets to March 10. The reauthorization Act was finally passed on March 2 by the Senate with a vote of 95-4, though this was opposed by Senator Feingold who unsuccessfully attempted to extend the sunsets. The House voted 280-138 in favour of authorizing the Act. Finally, on March 8, President Bush signed the reauthorization Act, declaring that [...] "The Patriot Act has served America well, yet we cannot let the fact that America has not been attacked since September the 11th lull us into the illusion that the terrorist threat has disappeared" [...] and that the White House would [...] "continue to give [...] the tools to get the job done." [...] However, after the ceremony, he issued a signing statement that [...] "The executive branch shall construe the provisions of H.R. 3199 that call for furnishing information to entities outside the executive branch, such as sections 106A and 119, {{in a manner consistent with}} the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties" [...] in other words, he would not feel bound to comply with some of the provisions of the law if they conflicted with other Constitutional laws. This immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Senator Leahy, who condemned the statement as [...] "nothing short of a radical effort to re-shape the constitutional separation of powers and evade accountability and responsibility for following the law ... The President’s signing statements are not the law, and we should not allow them to be the last word. The President’s constitutional duty is to faithfully execute the laws as written by the Congress. It is our duty to ensure, by means of congressional oversight, that he does so." ...|$|E
