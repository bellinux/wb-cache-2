5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has {{all the time in the}} world to read them without interruption.|$|E

Omar's adviser Butchie asks {{how much of the}} {{shipment}} is left. Omar tells him that there is more than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> sell on his own. Butchie suggests selling it back to Proposition Joe for a profit; it is initially taken as a joke but Renaldo and Omar begin to see the idea's potential.|$|E
25|$|Duke Valdemar {{realised}} {{the threat}} Prince-Archbishop Valdemar presented. In 1192 he invited the Prince-Archbishop {{to meet him}} in Åbenrå. Then the bishop fled to Swedish Norway to avoid an arrest. The following year he organised - supported by the Hohenstaufens - a fleet of 35 ships manned with Norwegian or Swedish mercenaries and harried the coasts of Denmark {{with an eye to}} overthrowing King CanuteVI, claiming the Danish throne for himself, while AdolphusIII crossed the Eider invading the duchy of Schleswig. On 8 July 1192 CanuteVI captured Bishop Valdemar, before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> enter the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen.|$|E

500|$|Cillian Murphy as Robert Michael Fischer, {{the heir}} to a {{business}} empire and the team's target. [...] Murphy said Fischer was portrayed as [...] "a petulant child who's {{in need of a}} lot of attention from his father, he has everything <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> want materially, but he's deeply lacking emotionally". The actor also researched the sons of Rupert Murdoch, [...] "to add to that the idea of living in the shadow of someone so immensely powerful".|$|E
500|$|According to Steinman, [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] was {{inspired}} by Wuthering Heights, and {{was an attempt to}} write [...] "the most passionate, romantic song" [...] <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> create. In interviews, Meat Loaf has said that, in his mind, the song was always meant to be a duet. Norwegian artist Marion Raven, who had been working on her solo album with Child, was chosen because the timbre of her voice starkly contrasts to Meat Loaf's.|$|E
500|$|As {{the summer}} progresses, Nick {{eventually}} receives {{an invitation to}} one of Gatsby's parties. Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War. Through Jordan, Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917, when Daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services' work with young Officers headed to Europe. [...] From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time, Gatsby became (and still is) deeply in love with Daisy. Even more, he became obsessed {{with the idea of}} her, and the ideal of living in the world he saw her living in, as the fulfillment of all the possible dreams <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of The Simpsons, Homer Simpson {{generally}} loathed Ned, because Ned's family, job, health and self-discipline are of higher quality than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> hope to attain himself. Homer is often shown [...] "borrowing" [...] (stealing) items from Flanders, such as a weather vane, a camcorder, a diploma, a toothbrush and an air conditioning unit. Even the Simpsons' couch came from [...] "the curb outside Flanders' house". Homer has since come to have a love-hate relationship with Ned, sometimes being his best friend, partly due to Ned's selfless tolerance of him, and other times treating Ned with complete disregard. Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing. Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance. An early running joke was that Marge considers Flanders to be a perfect neighbor and usually sides with him instead of her husband, which always enrages Homer. Flanders is normally oblivious to Homer's disdain for him.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Grant's son Ulysses Jr. had opened a Wall Street {{brokerage}} house with Ferdinand Ward. Ward {{was regarded as}} a rising star and the firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful. In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money. To encourage investment, Ward paid investors abnormally high interest, by pledging the company's securities on multiple loans in a process called rehypothecation. Ward, in collusion with banker James D. Fish, kept secret from bank examiners, retrieved the firm's securities from the company's bank vault. When the trades went bad, multiple loans came due, all backed up by the same collateral. Historians agree that Grant was likely unaware of Ward's intentions, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew. In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward told Grant of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall. Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt, who gave him a personal loan of $150,000. Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it from failure. Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor, he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets. Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full. Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> [...] "trust any human being again." [...] In March 1885, as his health was failing, he testified against both Ward and Fish. Ward was convicted of fraud in October 1885, months after Grant's death, and served {{six and a half years}} in prison.|$|E

2500|$|The {{couple was}} {{occasionally}} compared to Tad and Dixie. Before her [...] "death" [...] in 2002, Dixie {{is said to}} have given JR a necklace Tad gave her. Once committed to Babe, JR gives Babe the necklace, saying Dixie believed it was filled with more love than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> imagine and that this is what he wants for he and Babe and their family. Several months later, when JR is recovering from his jump out of a window, enraged at Babe for her one-night stand with Josh Madden, Tad tells JR that JR loves Babe the same way that he himself loves Dixie.|$|E
2500|$|... … {{he thought}} it {{a matter of the}} most vital {{importance}} to bring Illyria into a state of good order, with a view to the success of all his projects, and above all of his passage into Italy. For Demetrius was so assiduous in keeping hot these hopes and projects in the king's mind, that Philip even dreamed of them in his sleep, and thought of nothing else but this Italian expedition. The motive of Demetrius in so acting was not a consideration for Philip, for he certainly did not rank higher than third in the calculations of Demetrius. A stronger motive than that was his hatred of Rome: but the strongest of all was the consideration of his own prospects. For he had made up his mind that it was only in this way that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> recover his principality in Pharos.|$|E
2500|$|In the pre-colonial era, Moors from Mauritania {{who came}} to settle in the Serer kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Sine, etc., were ill treated by their Serer masters. If a Moor dies in a Serer kingdom, his body was dragged {{out of the country}} and left for the {{vultures}} to feast on if there is no family or friend to claim the body and bury it elsewhere. [...] They were also never accompanied by grave goods. [...] No matter how long a Mauritanian Moor has lived in the area as a migrant, he could never achieve high status within the Serer aristocracy. [...] The best position <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> wish for within Serer high society was to work as a Bissit (Bissik). Apart from spying for the Serer Kings, the Bissit's [...] main job was to be a clown - for the sole entertainment of the Serer King, the Serer aristocracy and the common people. [...] He was expected to dance in ceremonies before the king and liven up the king's mood and the king's subjects. [...] This position was always given to the Moors. [...] It was a humiliating job and not a title of honour. According to some, the history of this position goes back to an early Moor in Serer country who had a child by his own daughter.|$|E
