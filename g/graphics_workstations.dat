5|$|When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was conceived, the Rare {{studio was}} not yet ready for the change. Rare limited their {{releases}} to some Battletoads games and decided to invest their significant NES profit in purchasing expensive Silicon <b>Graphics</b> <b>workstations</b> to make three-dimensional models. This move made Rare the most technologically advanced developer in the UK, and situated them high in the international market. Their priority also changed at that time, as the team decided to focus on quality instead of quantity.|$|E
25|$|While HSL, HSV, {{and related}} spaces serve well enough to, for instance, choose a single color, they ignore {{much of the}} {{complexity}} of color appearance. Essentially, they trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, from a time in computing history (high-end 1970s <b>graphics</b> <b>workstations,</b> or mid-1990s consumer desktops) when more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive.|$|E

25|$|The 1990s' {{overwhelming}} {{note was}} {{the emergence of}} 3D modeling on a mass scale and an impressive rise {{in the quality of}} CGI generally. Home computers became able to take on rendering tasks that previously had been limited to workstations costing thousands of dollars; as 3D modelers became available for home systems, the popularity of Silicon <b>Graphics</b> <b>workstations</b> declined and powerful Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh machines running Autodesk products like 3D Studio or other home rendering software ascended in importance. By the end of the decade, the GPU would begin its rise to the prominence it still enjoys today.|$|E
500|$|Bug! was conceptualised as one {{of three}} {{candidates}} for [...] "would-be" [...] mascots for Sega's upcoming Sega Saturn console in 1994, {{due to the lack}} of a Sonic the Hedgehog game upon the console's launch. The other potential candidates were 2.5D platformers Clockwork Knight (which came out shortly before Bug!, at the Saturn's North American launch) and Astal, which was released later in 1995. The titular character Bug was thought to have imitated Sonic the Hedgehog's appearance and attitude in order to make it an effective mascot. At the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in 1995, Steven Spielberg declared that Bug was the character [...] "that is going to do it" [...] for the Saturn. Realtime Associates developed the game using Silicon <b>Graphics</b> <b>workstations,</b> which were then used to pre-render the game's characters and then convert them into sprites – in similar vein to the process used in Donkey Kong Country.|$|E
500|$|Pilotwings 64 was co-developed by the Texas-based {{graphics}} company Paradigm Simulation and Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD) and Integrated Research and Development (IRD) divisions. Due to Paradigm's experience with Silicon <b>Graphics</b> <b>workstations,</b> Nintendo contacted the American company in 1994 concerning it {{becoming one of}} the Nintendo 64's [...] "Dream Team" [...] of first developers. Paradigm worked directly with a team at Silicon Graphics and spent nine months developing a technology base for Pilotwings 64 and Paradigm's other Nintendo 64 releases. Development on Pilotwings 64 began in earnest during June 1995, with Nintendo working on the game design and Paradigm working on the technical production. Nintendo's Genyo Takeda and Makoto Wada acted as Paradigm's primary technical and design contacts individually. Wada, the game's director, was also involved in design aspects such as modeling and animation. Shigeru Miyamoto, the producer of Pilotwings for the SNES, reprised his role for Pilotwings 64 and oversaw the project from Japan. Miyamoto's involvement was more removed than with the SNES game due to his simultaneous work on the platformer Super Mario 64.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} using Silicon <b>Graphics</b> <b>workstations</b> for graphical designs and Sega Saturn emulators running on Hewlett-Packard machines for programming. Izuka {{said that there}} were problems during early stages of development {{because of a lack of}} games to use as reference; the team consequently had to redesign the Spring Valley level numerous times and build [...] "everything from scratch". The team used the Sega Graphics Library operating system (said by many developers to make programming for the Saturn dramatically easier) only sparingly, instead creating the game almost entirely with custom libraries. Because the Sonic Team offices did not include any sound-proof studios, team members were forced to record vocal sound effects for the game at night. Naka revealed that every phrase in the game has a meaning; for example [...] "abayo" [...] is Japanese slang for [...] "goodbye". Regarding the design of the 3D cutscenes, the team felt that the global market would be less resistant to a game featuring full 3D CGI in comparison to 2D anime. Norihiro Nishiyama, the designer of the in-game movies, stated that the use of 3D cutscenes in the game was necessary as he felt the movies were a good method to show the different concepts of dreaming and waking up into reality. Naka said that the in-game movies incorporate realism in order to make it more difficult for the player to disambiguate the boundary between dreams and reality.|$|E
500|$|To {{obtain the}} graphic details {{seen in the}} game, Rubin, Gavin, and Baggett {{researched}} visibility calculation in video games that followed Doom and concluded that extensive pre-calculation of visibility would allow the game to render {{a larger number of}} polygons. Following experimentation in free-roaming camera control, the team settled with a branching rail camera that would follow along next to, behind, or in front of the character, generally looking at him, moving on a [...] "track" [...] through the world. Because only 800 polygons could be visible on the screen at a time, parts of the game's landscape would be hidden from view using trees, cliffs, walls, and twists and turns in the environment. Because the production used an entirely Silicon Graphics and IRIX-based tool pipeline, the programmers used $100,000 Silicon <b>Graphics</b> <b>workstations</b> instead of the $3,000 personal computers that were the standard at the time. Gavin created an algorithmic texture packer that would {{deal with the fact that}} the 512 × 240 video mode left too little texture memory. Meanwhile, Baggett created bidirectional 10x compressors that would reduce the 128-megabyte levels down to 12 megabytes and allow them to be compatible with the PlayStation's 2-megabyte random access memory. The levels proved to be so large that the first test level created could not be loaded into Alias PowerAnimator and had to be cut up into 16 chunks. Each chunk took about 10 minutes to load even on a 256-megabyte machine. To remedy the situation, Baggett created the DLE, a level design tool where component parts of a level were entered into a text file, with a series of Adobe Photoshop layers indicating how the parts were combined. To code the characters and gameplay of the game, Andy Gavin and Dave Baggett created the programming language [...] "Game-Oriented Object LISP" [...] (GOOL) using LISP syntax.|$|E
2500|$|During 1995, Nintendo {{announced}} that it had sold one billion game cartridges worldwide, ten percent of those being from the Mario franchise. Nintendo deemed 1994 the [...] "Year of the Cartridge". To further their support for cartridges, Nintendo {{announced that}} Project Reality, which had now been renamed the Ultra 64, would not use a CD format as expected, but would rather use cartridges as its primary media format. Nintendo IRD general manager Genyo Takeda was impressed by video game development company Rare's progress with real-time 3D graphics technology, using {{state of the art}} Silicon <b>Graphics</b> <b>workstations.</b> As a result, Nintendo bought a 25% stake in the company, eventually expanding to 49%, and offered their catalogue of characters to create a CGI game around, making Rare Nintendo's first western-based second-party developer. Their first game as partners with Nintendo was Donkey Kong Country. The game was a critical success and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling game in the SNES library. In September 1994, Nintendo, along with six other video game giants including Sega, Electronic Arts, Atari, Acclaim, Philips, and 3DO approached the United States Senate and demanded a ratings system for video games to be enforced, which prompted the decision to create the Entertainment Software Rating Board.|$|E
