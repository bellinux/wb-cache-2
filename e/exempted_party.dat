5000|$|The BVB/Free Voters {{entered the}} Landtag despite {{their failure to}} surmount the 5% {{threshold}} because of the so-called [...] "basic mandate clause" [...] (Grundmandatsklausel). This rule <b>exempts</b> <b>parties</b> and lists that win the direct mandate {{of at least one}} constituency from the requirement to gather more than 5% of the votes statewide. BVB/Free Voters' leader Christoph Schulze won his constituency Teltow-Fläming III, that is situated just south of Berlin with 27% of preference votes. His success was attributed to the discontent with the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport [...] "BER" [...] in this constituency which lies in the designated approach corridor. Schulze's advocacy of a ban on night flights had been the reason for his defection from the ruling SPD (which he had represented in parliament since 1990) to the BVB/Free Voters.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Software patents {{have been}} a concern in the Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) {{community}} for many years. Some F/OSS supporters have been very vocal in their opposition to software patents, yet software patents have a solid foothold in United States patent law. Patent law continues to evolve, but F/OSS interests are not being addressed directly. The focus of some F/OSS advocates on the abolition of software patents has been to extreme a position to move United States policymakers to act. Thus, F/OSS interests are only advanced {{to the extent that}} they coincide with the interests of the broader software industry. This is problematic; F/OSS interests do not strictly coincide with the interests of the broader software industry. F/OSS advocates can create a new balance of power by focusing on F/OSS community interests rather than holding out for an end to software patents. Focusing on the interests opens up potential, modest patent reforms. One set of modest reforms are safe habor protections, laws establishing rules that, if followed, <b>exempt</b> <b>parties</b> from key legal consequences. Introducing a series of safe harbors to allow F/OSS contributors to act without fear of taking on unmanageable patent infringement risks could be as effective as eliminating software patents when it comes to protecting F/OSS community interests. With policymakers struggling to adapt the patent system to the competing needs of the pharmaceutical and software industries, F/OSS advocates could obtain safe habors as concessions from policymakers seeking support for other patent reforms. Acting quickly to secure safe harbor protections could neutralize the most significant threats that the patent system could pose for F/OSS. ...|$|R

50|$|Reserved {{seats are}} used in many {{countries}} to ensure representation for ethnic minorities, women, young people or the disabled. These seats are separate from general seats, and may be elected separately (such as in Morocco where a separate ballot is used to elect the 60 seats reserved for women and 30 seats reserved for {{young people in the}} House of Representatives), or be allocated to parties {{based on the results of}} the election; in Jordan the reserved seats for women are given to the female candidates who failed to win constituency seats but with the highest number of votes, whilst in Kenya the Senate seats reserved for women, young people and the disabled are allocated to parties based on how many seats they won in the general vote. Some countries achieve minority representation by other means, including requirements for a certain proportion of candidates to be women, or by <b>exempting</b> minority <b>parties</b> from the electoral threshold, as is done in Poland, Romania and Serbia.|$|R

40|$|As governments {{increasingly}} delegate traditional public {{functions to}} private, for-profit entities, the {{federal civil rights}} statute, 42 USC § 1983, {{has the potential to}} play an important role in encouraging private entities to respect constitutional rights when they take on public duties. That potential is undermined, however, by the prevailing view that private entities subject to § 1983 should be exempt from the traditional tort principle of respondeat superior liability simply because the Supreme Court already has held that municipal entities are exempt. Exempting private entities carries significant implications, not only because of the growing privatization of government functions, but also because respondeat superior liability often is critical for fulfilling tort law objectives of deterrence and compensation. This Article examines differences regarding how private entities and governmental entities behave and contends that those differences justify imposing respondeat superior liability on private § 1983 defendants even if public § 1983 defendants remain exempt. Initially, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for exempting municipalities from respondeat superior liability was particular to public entities and does not justify <b>exempting</b> private <b>parties</b> from respondeat superior liability. Additionally, as a policy matter, the fact that profit-motivated, private entities may be both more responsive than electorally accountable public entities to tort liability incentives and less responsive to other nonfinancial constraints on behavior suggests that respondeat superior may be better suited for deterring private misconduct than public misconduct. Imposing respondeat superior liability on private parties therefore can help ensure that when private parties agree to perform important public functions, they will not diminish important constitutional values...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the situation of unexpected events which render the performance under the contract much more difficult than originally planned or totally impossible to perform. The research includes the comparative study of different international instruments dealing with the unexpected change of circumstances, also the English and U. S. common law and the relevant case law. The study of the case law showed that though the preference by courts and arbitral tribunals is given to the principle that contracts should be kept, there have been numerous cases where the <b>party</b> has been <b>exempted</b> from contractual obligations under the change of circumstances and this should be regarded as a way to assure the fairness principle in contractual relations. The paper also examines the requirements which are necessary for exclusion of the performance under unexpected change of the circumstances. As a general principle, the occurrence of the unexpected event itself will not be sufficient for <b>exempting</b> a <b>party</b> from contractual obligations. Number of things need to be determined and taken into account when assessing whether the party can be excused for non-performance. Furthermore, as regards to the effects of such events the balance of interests is followed by giving the affected party the right to choose the relevant remedy. Taking into account the complexity of modern contractual relationships, it is preferable that parties follow the principles of good faith and cooperation which lies in the centre of renegotiations. However, in the case of failure to negotiate the parties can “pass” to courts the right to determine whether adjustment or termination will conclude the contractual relationships...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the EU {{has started to}} liberalize {{national}} gas markets and regulatory reform has followed in member countries. We analyse the basic issues concerning network and storage regulation and the implementation of regulatory reforms in Italy. We then try to explain why, in gas importing countries, such reforms are not sufficient to foster competition. Even regulation ex-post by the Competition Commission {{has proved to be}} a formidable task, to the extent that entry barriers in the market for imports depend on congestion of transit pipelines still controlled by the incumbent. Moreover, when gas supply is characterized by long-term importing contracts with take-or-pay clauses, liberalization policies lead to entry and market segmentation without benefits for consumers. In order to foster gas-to-gas competition, the development of wholesale exchanges at market hubs is then necessary. However, new investments in essential facilities are required to reach this aim. At present, new investments are both subsidized and <b>exempted</b> from third <b>party</b> access regulation for financial reasons, but we claim that the incentive to invest is negatively affected by a lack of ownership unbundling...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the outcome of}} the Kampala process with an eye toward the rarely-considered gender aspects of the crime of aggression, whether or not the provisions adopted represent an advancement for women, and how aspects of feminist theory might interpret the new regime. The Article concludes that any impact of the provisions will inevitably be limited by gaps and ambiguities in the definition of the crime and the jurisdictional regime, which is premised on state consent and <b>exempts</b> non-states <b>parties</b> altogether. At the same time, the insertion of the crime of aggression in the Rome Statute enables the prosecution of a wider range of acts, and actors, that cause harm to women and makes actionable harm to women that may not {{rise to the level of}} war crimes or crimes against humanity and that has historically been rendered juridically invisible by the collateral damage euphemism. Extending the reach of international criminal law may generate indirect negative effects from the interaction of the Court’s potential to prosecute the crime of aggression and the long-standing jus in bello, that body of rules governing how war is waged rather than why war is waged, which is the purview of the jus ad bellum. By penalizing the resort to armed force, the threat of prosecution of the crime of aggression may undermine incentives to comply with key doctrines within international humanitarian law that serve to protect civilians and other vulnerable groups. It also remains to be seen whether the codification of the crime of aggression will serve any deterrent purpose whatsoever when governmental leaders contemplate using force – offensively or defensively – in their international relations, especially in situations that do not implicate exigent sovereign threats. To the extent that the new provisions do exert a restraining effect, the expansive way in which the crime has been defined may end up chilling those uses of force that are protective and thus more discretionary, such as uses of force employed pursuant to the nascent doctrine of responsibility to protect. The crime may thus result in more ex post prosecutions at the expense of ex ante efforts at preventing and repressing violence. Whether this over-deterrence argument should be raised on behalf of women, however, requires an acceptance of the legitimacy, if not lawfulness, of humanitarian intervention with or without Security Council approval and a coming to terms with a certain valorization of militarism and its inherent masculinities – a perspective that is alien to much feminist thinking. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has yet to demonstrate that it can fulfill its current mandate. Operationalizing the crime of aggression without allocating additional resources to enable the Court to prosecute this controversial, largely unprecedented, and qualitatively different crime may distract the Court from responding more effectively to the “atrocity crimes” that now finally address gender-based violence more directly. The crime may also encourage the Court to focus on leaders in capital cities rather than the warlords next door, whom victims more directly associate with atrocities and without whose prosecution it may be impossible to achieve complete justice for women. Given the potential to reach top political leaders, the crime may be also subject to abuse. The amendments approved in Kampala will eventually permit states parties to refer each other to the ICC as alleged violators of the prohibition against aggression. Misuse of this referral authority could render the Court little more than just another forum for states to manipulate and exploit in order to advance their interests. Such an outcome would politicize and de-legitimate the Court. At this early stage in the life of the Court and in the absence of any concrete experience investigating or prosecuting the new crime of aggression, these bases for criticism and praise are inherently speculative. Applying a feminist perspective to the codification of the crime of aggression yields no easy conclusions. Rather, reasoning through the central question of whether the codification of the crime in the ICC Statute will be good for women produces a dizzying spiral of dialectical reasoning. And so, as a feminist, I approach the crime with a profound ambivalence...|$|R
