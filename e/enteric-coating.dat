Both preparations of the drug caused mucosal lesions, but the extent of damage was significantly less in the stomach and duodenum after enteric-coated as compared to plain naproxen tablets. The subjects however were asymptomatic and did therefore not have preference for either preparation. The morning plasma naproxen concentration was significantly higher after treatment with enteric-coated naproxen than after treatment with plain tablets. The {{results of the study}} indicate that NSAIDs damage the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum partly through a local effect which can be partially prevented by <b>enteric-coating</b> of the tablets.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{verify the}} {{possibility}} of an experimental infection with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and to confirm by PCR that the symptoms manifested after infection were due to the virulence factors of the studied bacteria. METHODS: Experimental units were 14 healthy pups of Boxer breed, aged 60 days. The animals were divided into three groups. One animal from each litter was included in a control group and the remaining animals were divided into two groups: one inoculated with strain 4083, and another one inoculated with strain SPA 14. Gelatinous capsules coated with <b>enteric-coating</b> solution were used for the inoculation of strains. E. coli isolation from feces was performed for all tested animals, and the extracted DNA was subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). RESULTS: All infected animals presented diarrhea and had the gene eae amplified by PCR. CONCLUSION: The efficiency of PCR for the studied strains indicates that this technique can be recommended for the diagnosis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli as a differential from other pathogens causing diarrhea. It may also be used in the future to verify whether other virulence factors (bfpA gene and EAF plasmid) persist after infection and to assess the pathogenicity of these bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Rabeprazole sodium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used in antiulcer therapy. Like most other PPIs, owing to its acid-labile nature, the drug is formulated as enteric-coated dosage form. Conventional means of producing delayed release multiparticulate dosage forms of PPIs require large quantities of enteric polymer coatings. In the present study, in order to better evaluate the effect of polymeric coating on product performance, the pellet core structure and composition was kept constant. Four different <b>enteric-coating</b> formulations and designs were evaluated. Enteric-coated drug multiparticulates prepared with single polymeric coatings (acrylic or cellulosic) were compared with two different polymeric layer coatings to evaluate the effectiveness of latter coatings in more effectively producing a better rabeprazole sodium delayed-release pellet product. The pH-dependent, enteric acrylic, and cellulosic polymers were used either alone, in combination, or applied one over the other to impart delayed-release properties to the core drug pellets. It was demonstrated that dual delayed-release coating with two different enteric polymers-an inner acrylic coating followed by an outer cellulosic coating-yields the best product that provides all the desired physicochemical and drug dissolution characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{challenges}} {{in the treatment of}} patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are investigated, safety and efficacy of treatment. Topical corticosteroids {{have been one of the}} cornerstones of treatment of AD for more than 40 years. Possible systemic side effects due to absorption of topical corticosteroids are decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) and development of glaucoma and cataract. We found that one third of 125 patients with moderate to severe AD were found to have low BMD. Surprisingly it was predominately males that had a low BMD. In our cross-sectional study there was no difference in the cumulative use of topical corticosteroids in the 5 years prior to investigation, between patients with a low BMD and normal BMD. We did find a trend towards an increased risk of low BMD with higher use of topical and oral corticosteroids. Additionally, the effect of inflammation on BMD was difficult to study but cannot be eliminated as one of the causes of low BMD. In the follow-up study we did not find a significant difference in change of BMD between patients who had used ‘low’ or ‘high’ amounts of topical corticosteroids during two year follow-up. We found only a small decrease in BMD over time. In the study evaluating glaucoma and cataract we found that the use of topical corticosteroids on the eyelids with a mean frequency of 4 days per week for several months was safe and that the use of predominantly class III (European and US classifications) topical corticosteroids with use up to 2400 grams/year did not result in glaucoma or cataract development. In patients with severe AD potent topical corticosteroids may not be sufficient, demanding additional systemic immunosuppressive drugs. The results of a randomised controlled trial comparing <b>Enteric-Coated</b> Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS) to Cyclosporine A (CsA) as maintenance therapy in adult patients with AD show that EC-MPS is clinically effective, has a mild side effect profile and is a good alternative to CsA. At the start of therapy with EC-MPS the clinical effect is delayed, however the clinical remission after stopping EC-MPS lasts longer compared to CsA. Other factors besides disease activity probably influence quality of life (QoL) in AD is a conclusion drawn from the findings that: disease activity correlated better with QoL when disease activity was less severe, that disease extent (‘rule of nines’ score) correlated better with QoL than disease severity, and that an individual’s improvement of 10 points in disease activity was accompanied by only a small improvement in QoL. We assessed soluble CD 30 and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) as disease activity markers for AD during the use of EC-MPS and CsA. We found a positive correlation between sCD 30 and disease activity (objective SCORAD) during maintenance therapy with CsA. However, during EC-MPS maintenance therapy there was no correlation between sCD 30 and disease activity. We found that serum TARC levels and objective SCORAD correlated during both maintenance-therapy regimens...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) have commonly {{been associated}} with upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract side effects including {{a high incidence of}} gastric and duodenal ulceration. Recent reports implicate NSAID use and mucosal injury in the small and large intestine. A trend in NSAID development has been an attempt to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce the severity of upper GI side effects through modified release dosage forms of NSAIDs such as <b>enteric-coating</b> (EC) or sustained release (SR) formulations. It is possible that modified release formulations may increase the exposure of active drug to the mucosa distally to the duodenal bulb, and thereby increase toxicity to distal GI regions where the effects are difficult to monitor. A systematic literature review through Medline, Embase, and Index Medicus was made to identify toxicological effects induced by modified release formulations of NSAIDs in the small and large intestine. An analysis of the identified toxicological effects of these formulations was made. SR and EC NSAID use has {{been associated with}} both small and large intestinal bleeding, anaemia, strictures, ulcerations, perforations, and death. Modified release NSAIDs may cause significant morbidity in some patients. NSAID modified release delivery systems are not guarantors of GI safety. Since SR and EC NSAIDs are widely prescribed and some EC products are available without a prescription, heightened awareness of these toxicological manifestations in more distal sites of the GI tact may reduce morbidity...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Verificar a possibilidade de uma infecção experimental com Escherichia coli enteropatogênicas e confirmar por PCR que os sintomas manifestados após a infecção foram decorrentes dos fatores de virulência da bactéria estudada. MÉTODOS: As unidades experimentais foram 14 filhotes saudáveis com idade de 60 dias da raça Boxer. Os animais foram divididos em três grupos, sendo um controle de cada ninhada e o restante dividido em dois grupos, um de animais inoculados com a cepa 4083 e o outro de animais inoculados com a cepa SPA 14. Para inoculação das cepas, utilizaram-se cápsulas gelatinosas revestidas com solução de revestimento entérico. O isolamento de E. coli das fezes foi realizado em todos os animais testados, e o DNA extraído foi submetido à técnica de PCR. RESULTADOS: Todos os animais infectados apresentaram diarréia e tiveram a gene eae amplificado por meio de PCR. CONCLUSÃO: Através da eficiência da PCR das amostras, a técnica seria recomendada para diagnóstico da Escherichia coli enteropatogênicas como diferencial de outros patógenos que causam diarréia, e, no futuro, verificar se outros fatores de virulência (gene bfpA e plasmídeo EAF) permaneceriam após a infecção, podendo avaliar a patogenicidade das EPEC...|$|E
40|$|Erythromycin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic {{isolated from}} Streptomyces erythreus, {{was first introduced}} into clinical medicine in 1952. It is active against most gram-positive bacteria, some gram-negative bacteria and is currently the agent of choice for Legionella pneumophila. Erythromycin is an acid-labile compound rapidly degrading in acidic solutions such as the acid environment of the stomach. As such, erythromycin absorption following oral administration of solid dosage forms is relatively poor. Accordingly there have been various approaches used to protect the drug against gastric inactivation. These precautions include <b>enteric-coating</b> of tablets, capsules or pellets of erythromycin base, the synthesis of acid stable 2 ' esters of erythromycin (ethylsuccinate and propionate) and salts of these esters (erythromycin estolate), and more recently, the synthesis {{of a range of}} new acid-stable, semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics. The 2 ' esters are antimicrobially inactive or much less active than the parent compound and must be converted to the free erythromycin base in vivo in order to exhibit antibacterial activity. Intrinsic dissolution rates determined on raw material can provide extremely useful information relating to the gastrointestinal absorption of drugs from solid dosage forms. The large inter- and intrasubject variability associated with erythromycin base has, to date, mainly been attributed to gastric acid inactivation of the drug. However, changes in duodenal pH resulting in altered solubility and intrinsic dissolution rates may account for the observed variability. Thus, the intrinsic dissolution rates of erythromycin base at pH 6. 0, 6. 5, 7. 0, 7. 5 and 8. 0 were compared in order to investigate the possible effects of pH changes which may occur in the duodenal contents, on the in vivo dissolution and subsequent absorption of this compound. The standard intrinsic dissolution rate test procedure employing a rotating disc of pure erythromycin base powder which only allows for dissolution from a constant surface area, was adapted and the drug quantitatively determined by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet detection. Results of intrinsic dissolution studies at both 22 °C and 37 °C indicate that the solubility, and therefore the rate of dissolution of erythromycin base is pH dependent, being more soluble at pH 6. 0 than pH 8. 0 (an approximate 800 times and 1000 times reduction in the amount dissolved after 30 minutes, at 22 °C and 37 °C respectively, when the pH of the medium was increased from 6 to 8). Although the stability of erythromycin and its ester derivatives in aqueous acidic solutions has been well documented, very little has been reported on the compound's stability in organic solvents. Methanol is recommended by official drug compendia (U. S. P. and B. P.) for use in erythromycin identification tests {{as well as in the}} sample preparation steps during assay procedures. Thus, the effect of methanol and acetonitrile, organic solvents of similar polarities and densities, on the stability of erythromycin base, erythromycin ethylsuccinate, propionyl erythromycin and erythromycin estolate at room temperature (22 °C ± 0. 5 °C), using HPLC with electrochemical detection, was investigated. Erythromycin base is relatively stable in both methanol and acetonitrile, remaining intact for over 168 hours in acetonitrile and showing less than 5 % degradation in methanol over the same period. Erythromycin ethylsuccinate in acetonitrile shows less than 5 % degradation over 168 hours whereas in methanol, rapid hydrolysis occurs resulting in almost total conversion to base within 40 hours. Approximately 87 % of erythromycin propionyl ester remained intact after 168 hours in acetonitrile whilst methanol caused rapid hydrolysis to erythromycin base (35 % remaining after 28 hours). Erythromycin estolate appeared to be unstable in both acetonitrile and methanol. In acetonitrile, only 13 % of the estolate remained intact after 168 hours, whereas in methanol, the reaction was much more rapid with 35 % of the estolate remaining after 28 hours. The use of methanol as a solvent for erythromycin estolate reference standards is thus contraindicated. A number of conflicting reports on the half- life as well as the body compartment model that best describes erythromycin base serum concentration-time profiles (lBCM generally used to describe orally administered erythromycin, whilst a 2 BCM has been used to describe erythromycin administered intravenously), appear in the literature. These differences may be largely attributed to the sampling period (between 6 and 12 hours) used in the repective studies. The objective of this study was to determine the body compartment model that best describes erythromycin base serum concentration-time curves by increasing the sampling time to 24 hours. In addition, the effect of chronic dosing of erythromycin on erythromycin pharmacokinetics, in the same group of subjects, was investigated. The single and multiple oral dose pharmacokinetics of erythromycin enteric coated base pellets within a gelatin capsule (250 mg), were studied in 6 healthy, normal volunteers (19. 5 ± 0. 76 years, 71. 5 ± 8. 18 kg, 180. 33 ± 5. 99 cm). Furthermore, steady state concentrations were predicted using the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the single dose study, and compared with those obtained in the multiple dose study. Plasma concentrations were determined using a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection. For the single dose study, after a tlag of 2. 5 ± 0. 71 hr, Cmax (1. 12 ± 0. 47 μ/ml) was reached at a tmax of 4. 08 ± 0. 93 hr post dose, with serum concentrations ranging from 0. 31 - 1. 62 μ/ml. The half-life was found to be 5. 42 ± 1. 31 hr. On multiple dosing (250 mg six hourly), serum concentrations for the fifth, ninth and thirteenth dosing intervals ranged from 0. 67 - 2. 92 μ/ml, 1. 69 - 3. 65 μ/ml and 0. 61 - 3. 01 μ/ml, occurring at 3. 75 ± 0. 69 hr, 3. 17 ± 1. 03 hr and 3. 17 ± 1. 03 hr post dose with a Cmax of 1. 89 ± 0. 68 μ/ml, 2. 35 ± 0. 70 μ/ml and 1. 94 ± 0. 74 μ/ml, respectively. The area under the serum concentration- time curve for the single dose study (AUC₀₋∞) was 4. 67 ± 0. 88 hr. μ/ml, whilst the AUC₀₋τ. for the fifth, ninth and thirteenth dosing intervals of the multiple dose study were 5. 77 ± 1. 76 hr. μ/ml, 6. 46 ± 1. 33 hr. μ/ml and 5. 97 ± 2. 36 hr. μ/ml respectively, indicating an approximately 33 % increase in AUC on chronic dosing of erythromycin. The observed increase in AUC may be a result of increased bioavailability or a decrease in clearance on chronic dosing. ...|$|E
