5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E

Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
