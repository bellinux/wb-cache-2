5|$|The rails are a {{large and}} very {{widespread}} family, with nearly 150 species. They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. Island species readily become flightless; of 53 extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands, 32 <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> ability to fly.|$|E
5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they are thought to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix {{on more than one}} lineage.|$|E
5|$|In these engagements it {{is claimed}} that a whole Ottoman {{battalion}} was captured or killed. Over 100 Ottoman soldiers were killed. Among the 172 prisoners were many wounded, while the British losses were under 60. It {{had been a}} crucial battle; if El Burj had been captured the British would <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> use of the road leading up from Berfilya, and the Beit Nuba–Beit Sira valley would have become untenable. The left flank of the infantry's main advance on Jerusalem would have been exposed, which would have also weakened the pressure being exerted towards the Nablus road.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{hold the}} record for the most EFL Cup titles, having won the {{competition}} eight times, including four consecutive titles from 1981 to 1984. Nottingham Forest and Manchester United are the only other clubs to have won consecutive titles; Forest won in 1978 and 1979, and 1989 and 1990, while United won in 2009 and 2010. Arsenal have been runners-up more than any other club; they <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> final five times. Manchester United are the current champions, having beaten Southampton 3–2 in the 2017 final.|$|E
5|$|Shepseskare's {{relations}} to his predecessor and successor {{are not known}} for certain. Verner has proposed {{that he was a}} son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> cribellum.|$|E

5|$|The Grammy Awards {{are awarded}} {{annually}} by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States for outstanding achievements {{in the music}} industry. Often considered the highest music honor, the awards were established in 1958. Lady Gaga has won six awards out of seventeen nominations. She, Beyoncé and Mariah Carey are the only female artists to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, and they all hold the record for second-most Album of the Year nominations (three) for a female artist after Barbra Streisand.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month at Saturday Night's Main Event, a title match was scheduled between Edge and Cena. Cena won the match by disqualification, after Lita interfered {{on behalf of}} Edge. A singles match was booked between Edge and Cena for the WWE title at Summerslam, with the stipulation that if Edge disqualified himself, he would <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> WWE title. At SummerSlam, Edge retained the title after he hit Cena {{with a pair of}} brass knuckles, this occurred when the referee was not looking.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebees of the {{subgenus}} Psithyrus (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly {{considered a}} separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, {{in the colonies}} of other bumblebees, and <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> ability to collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a Psithyrus female, {{such as that of}} the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris, feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as B. bohemicus, actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive.|$|E
5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> tale's original meaning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, the skull has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a temporal fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull. This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> temporal openings rather than never having had them.|$|E

Peñarol are third with five wins, their most recent of which was in 1987. Peñarol <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> most finals; each team has lost the final on five separate occasions. Overall, 24 different clubs have won the competition since its inception in 1960. Clubs from Argentina have won the most Copas Libertadores, with 24 wins among them. Brazilian teams are second with 17 victories, and Uruguayan clubs are third with 8 victories.|$|E

5|$|Sevilla {{holds the}} record for the most victories, having won the {{competition}} five times since its inception. Real Madrid (winners in 1985 and 1986) and Sevilla (winners in 2006 and 2007; and in 2014, 2015, and 2016) are the only teams to have retained their title. Teams from Spain have won the competition the most times, with ten winners coming from the country.
