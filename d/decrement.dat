The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a <b>decrement</b> in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. Xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it has been successfully used for surgical operations, and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between long-term <b>decrements</b> of the acoustic startle response in rats {{and the development}} of freezing behavior during habituation training was examined. Freezing behavior developed over the initial trials of habituation training, and the rate of long-term response <b>decrements</b> was found to be inversely related to the development of freezing. Manipulations (neurological or behavioral) that either educed the level of freezing or retarded its development promoted startle response <b>decrements.</b> In Experiment 1, rats receiving dectrolytic lesions of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray demonstrated both accelerated long-term startle response <b>decrements</b> and retarded evelopment offreezing behavior. In Experiment 2, preexposure tothe startle apparatus (i. e., latent inhibition) accelerated long-term startle <b>decrements</b> and inhibited development of freezing. In Experiment 3, exposure to the startle apparatus following initial habituation training (i. e., extinction) reduced both freezing behavior and startle response ampli-tudes. The results are discussed in terms of the influence of Pavlovian fear conditioning on long-term habituation of the acoustic startle response. Pavlovian fear conditioning has long been known to influ-ence the amplitude of the acoustic startle response in rats...|$|R

25|$|While {{considering}} {{the issue of}} reliability of the primary data provided by corrective labor institutions, {{it is necessary to}} take into account the following two circumstances. On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The <b>decrement</b> in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of forests}} in the {{national}} economy and in ecology was further emphasized in the 1988 National Forest Policy, which focused on ensuring environmental stability, restoring the ecological balance, and preserving the remaining forests. Other objectives of the policy were meeting the need for fuelwood, fodder, and small timber for rural and tribal people while recognising the need to actively involve local people {{in the management of}} forest resources. Also in 1988, the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was amended to facilitate stricter conservation measures. A new target was to increase the forest cover to 33% of India's land area from the then-official estimate of 23%. In June 1990, the central government adopted resolutions that combined forest science with social forestry, that is, taking the sociocultural traditions of the local people into. The cumulative area afforested during the 1951-91 period was nearly 179,000 square kilometres. However, despite large-scale tree planting programmes, forestry is one arena in which India has actually regressed since independence. Annual fellings at about four times the growth rate are a major cause. Widespread pilfering by villagers for firewood and fodder also represents a major <b>decrement.</b> In addition, the 1988 National Forest Policy noted, the forested area has been shrinking as a result of land cleared for farming and development programmes.|$|E

The study aimed to investigate the effects of performing a concurrent cognitive task when walking in MS and determine the effects of task demand on dual-task performance. Eighteen MS participants and 18 healthy controls took part. Participants completed walking and cognitive tasks under single and dual task conditions. MS participants, compared to healthy controls, had greater <b>decrements</b> in dual-task performance; including <b>decrements</b> in cognitive task performance, walking speed and swing time variability. Dual-task <b>decrements</b> were evident in titrated and fixed demand conditions. Dual-task <b>decrements</b> were related to fatigue, cognitive functioning and self-reported cognitive errors, but not to measures of disease severity or duration. MS participants perform differentially poorly on walking and talking dual-tasks compared to healthy controls. This may lead to difficulties in everyday life and increase the risk of falls in MS. Clinicians should independently assess dual-task walking in MS patients. The role of task demand in dual-tasking <b>decrements</b> remains unclear and needs further investigation. Future studies should replicate the current findings and develop practical clinical tools to assess walking and talking ability...|$|R

Historically, {{there has been a}} tendency to consider conditions that fall below threshold levels as temporary phenomena that do not interfere with daily functioning. However, dismissing subthreshold symptoms may be particularly problematic for older adults. The present study examined the relationship between depression, anxiety, and <b>decrements</b> in functional status among older adults using both continuous and categorical diagnostic approaches. One hundred veterans were recruited from the Veterans Health Study, a longitudinal investigation of male veterans 2 ̆ 7 health. Participants completed screening measures of depression, anxiety, functional status, medical comorbidity, and the SCID anxiety and mood modules. One-quarter of the sample met DSM-IV criteria for one of the targeted mood or anxiety disorders. Continuous and categorical measures of depression were significantly related to <b>decrements</b> in functional status above and beyond comorbid medical conditions. A significant association was found between anxiety symptoms (per continuous measure) and <b>decrements</b> in functional status. This finding suggests that anxious symptoms are related to <b>decrements</b> in work, self-care, and leisure activities. Moreover, the results indicate that continuous measures of anxiety that focus on severity of symptoms rather than {{the presence or absence of}} a disorder, may be a more appropriate for assessing late-life anxiety. Health care professionals who treat older adults should not dismiss anxious or depressive symptoms among frail older adults as merely a natural outcome of aging or disease. Efforts to reduce <b>decrements</b> in functional status experienced by older adults with anxious and depressive symptoms should focus on educating health care providers to recognize and treat the full spectrum of anxiety and depressive syndromes. ...|$|R
