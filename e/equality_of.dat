5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity were promoted over the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

A notion of symmetrical sets {{for a set of}} random variables is given and <b>equalities</b> <b>of</b> joint entropies for certain subsets of random variables in a symmetrical set is established. Concatenation coding scheme for exact repair distributed storage systems is proposed and it is shown that concatenation coding scheme is sufficient to achieve any admissible rate for any exact repair distributed storage system. <b>Equalities</b> <b>of</b> certain joint entropies of random variables induced by concatenation scheme is shown. These <b>equalities</b> <b>of</b> joint entropies are new tools to simplify the linear programming bound and to obtain stronger converse results for exact repair distributed storage systems. I...|$|R

5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment.

5|$|The craft guilds {{required}} {{relatively stable}} markets and a relative <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> income and opportunity amongst their members to function effectively. By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon. The first strains {{were seen in}} London, where the old guild system began to collapse – more trade was being conducted at a national level, making it hard for craftsmen to both manufacture goods and trade in them, and there were growing disparities in incomes between the richer and poorer craftsmen. As a result, under EdwardIII many guilds became companies or livery companies, chartered companies focusing on trade and finance, leaving the guild structures to represent {{the interests of the}} smaller, poorer manufacturers.|$|E
