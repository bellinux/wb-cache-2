5|$|The classic {{symptom of}} malaria is paroxysm—a {{cyclical}} occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then <b>fever</b> and sweating, occurring every two days (tertian <b>fever)</b> in P.vivax and P.ovale infections, and every three days (quartan <b>fever)</b> for P.malariae. P.falciparum infection can cause recurrent <b>fever</b> every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous <b>fever.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a <b>fever</b> within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue <b>fever</b> and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic <b>fever,</b> typhoid <b>fever,</b> meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika <b>fever</b> also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E
5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse <b>fever,</b> African tick bite <b>fever,</b> Rocky Mountain spotted <b>fever,</b> Flinders Island spotted <b>fever</b> and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q <b>fever,</b> Colorado tick <b>fever,</b> Crimean Congo hemorrhagic <b>fever,</b> tularemia, tick-borne relapsing <b>fever,</b> babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the <b>fever</b> and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic <b>fever.</b> The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After <b>fever</b> and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Between 1904 and 1906, the Malta <b>Fever</b> Commission (MFC) {{worked in}} the Castallania, and on 14 June 1905 the {{physician}} Sir Themistocles Zammit discovered the cause behind the Mediterranean <b>fever</b> (known also by various names) while working there. The <b>fever</b> was first traced in Malta among British soldiers during the French occupation of Malta.|$|E
5|$|Dengue <b>fever</b> is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high <b>fever,</b> headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic <b>fever,</b> resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Medications {{that lower}} <b>fevers</b> are called {{antipyretic}}s. [...] The antipyretic ibuprofen {{is effective in}} reducing <b>fevers</b> in children. [...] It {{is more effective than}} acetaminophen (paracetamol) in children. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in children with <b>fevers.</b> [...] The efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in children with <b>fevers</b> has been questioned. [...] Ibuprofen is also superior to aspirin in children with <b>fevers.</b> Additionally, aspirin is not recommended in children and young adults (those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country) due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.|$|R

5|$|Dengue <b>fever</b> virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus.

5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow <b>fever</b> outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow <b>fever</b> epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow <b>fever</b> patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow <b>fever</b> is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} paradigmatic {{shifts in}} the conceptualisation of <b>fevers</b> in British Ceylon, from agues and <b>fevers</b> in the early 1800 s and <b>fevers</b> of particular regions in the mid- 1800 s to a powerful notion of malaria in the early 1900 s. In the early colonial records, agues and <b>fevers</b> were seen primarily {{as a threat to}} European visitors to the tropics, including the colonisers. In contrast, the <b>fevers</b> of specific regions were identified as localised ailments endemic among the local population and somehow connected to the specifics of local ecology and the indolent nature of the natives. With the triumph of tropical medicine between 1880 and 1905, localised <b>fevers</b> rapidly gave way to malaria and the identification of malaria parasites and vectors between 1880 and 1905, which came to be seen as embodyin...|$|R

NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters lasted only three months.|$|E

The aim is to {{evaluate}} the up-to-date epidemiological situation with the phlebotomus <b>fevers</b> in Tadjikistan. The revision of the Phlebotomus fauna in Tadjikistan has been performed firstly; four species being new for republic have been discoverd. The boundaries of the territories which are the potential foci of phlebotomus <b>fevers</b> have been revealed. The circulation of three viruses of the phlebotomus <b>fevers</b> (Neapolitan, Sicilian and Karimabad ones) has been proved. The map on the possible spreading of phlebotomus <b>fevers</b> in Tadjikistan has been developed. The Phlebotomus index has been drawn up; the recommendations on the prophylaxis of phlebotomus <b>fevers</b> have been developed.

5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, <b>fever,</b> or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic <b>fever.</b> Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or <b>fever,</b> effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
