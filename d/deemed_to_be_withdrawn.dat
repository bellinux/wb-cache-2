2500|$|On Monday 30 October 2006 (the first {{business}} day following the handing {{down of the}} Court of Appeal's judgment on Friday 27 October 2006), the Search Division of the EPO in charge of establishing a search report for the European patent application issued a declaration under [...] (now [...] ) that a search could not be established. The declaration indicates that the EPO search examiner is {{of the opinion that}} Macrossan's application contains nothing of technical merit, but only commonplace technical features (i.e. a computer) for implementing a business method. As a consequence, no meaningful search was considered to be possible. Before a substantive examination report was issued, the application was <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in October 2009 after Macrossan failed to pay a maintenance fee.|$|E
5000|$|Under [...] and , an {{examination}} request {{must also be}} made within six months from the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions {{the publication of the}} European search report. The examination fee is also due at that time. If no examination request is made, the application is <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "An {{application}} {{which has}} been <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> for non-payment of a renewal fee is not pending {{within the meaning of}} Rule 25(1) EPC 1973 in the period for filing a request for re-establishment of rights under Article 122 EPC 1973 in respect of such non-payment or in the period after which such an application is filed in the event of such request being refused." ...|$|E
50|$|If a {{committee}} fails {{to return a}} budget, or {{a bill that would}} appropriate funds to the House with its report of recommendations by a deadline defined in the Standing Orders of the House in question, then any recommendations of the committee would <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>withdrawn</b> and the bill will <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> reported back <b>to</b> the House, without any amendments. This convention is in place in order to prevent {{a committee}} from attempting to withhold supply from the Government of Canada.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{its more}} notable foreign orders was for the Class 56 {{locomotives}} for British Rail. The 30 locomotives <b>were</b> outsourced <b>to</b> Electroputere because Brush Traction could not build them at its own plant; however, upon their arrival in the UK, the machines <b>were</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsuitable for use, as they suffered from poor construction standards, and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> and extensively rebuilt. (However, they were seen as being perfectly reasonable for use in Romania by the Romanian crews who tested them) ...|$|R
50|$|Locomotive ESL103 was {{scrapped}} in 1954 as {{the result}} of collision damage sustained in 1948. It <b>was</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beyond economical repair. Gradually, de-icing gear <b>was</b> fitted <b>to</b> service trains, beginning with the A stock on the Metropolitan line, and the need for separate sleet locomotives decreased. ESL100 and ESL112 were modified in 1972, so that they could <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> remove leaves from the running rails. Experiments <b>were</b> made <b>to</b> find a suitable fluid which would assist adhesion, but none was found. The two locomotives continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for brushing leaves from the rails. All of the vehicles had ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by August 1985. ESL107 <b>was</b> the last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn,</b> and <b>was</b> preserved by the London Transport Museum.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} search report, a search opinion is also established. The search opinion {{and the search}} report form {{together}} the so-called extended European search report. Before April 1, 2010, {{a response to the}} search opinion was optional. Currently however, under new Rule 70a EPC, a reply to the search opinion is mandatory, within six months [...] "after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report" [...] (which is also the time limit for requesting examination). If no reply is filed to the search opinion, the application is <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> The search opinion is therefore a conventional office action with a given time period to respond.|$|E

5000|$|If the Examining Division {{reaches the}} {{conviction}} that the European patent application satisfies all the requirements of the EPC so that a European patent may be granted, it issues a communication under [...] By issuing such a communication, the Examining Division informs the applicant of the intention to grant a patent based on the prosecuted application. The claims must then be translated in the other two official languages of the European Patent Office, and fees for grant and publishing must be paid. If the applicant pays the fees for grant and publishing and files the translation of the claims in due time, he is deemed to have been approved the text intended for grant. If not, the European patent application is <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> The time limit for paying the fees for grant and publishing, and for filing the translation of the claims is four months. This time limit is non-extendable.|$|E

The last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> <b>was</b> Clun Castle in December 1965, which worked the last steam train out of Paddington on 27 November 1965.|$|R
40|$|Freedom {{to operate}} (FTO) {{is a central}} {{precondition}} for appropriating profits from own-used inventions. One way to secure FTO is defensive publishing, that is, the publication of inventions {{with the purpose of}} creating prior art. Prior research has shown that firms use also the patent system for defensive publishing, but a quanti-tative analysis of this practice is lacking. We address this gap by identifying de-fensive publications among applications at the German patent office. Based on an analysis of all direct first filings between 1986 and 2000, we find that more than 5 % of them could turn out to have defensive publishing as their sole purpose. This finding gives an indication that, for all other applications, the share of their value attributable to creating FTO might be considerable. We further find that 20 % of all applications are left pending for the maximum of seven years before examination is requested or the application is <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn,</b> revealing the value of even a pending application...|$|E
50|$|In 1939, No. 6111 <b>was</b> {{the first}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn,</b> but <b>was</b> quickly {{returned}} <b>to</b> service after {{the outbreak of}} World War II. After the war, withdrawals began again in 1947, and the last locomotive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn,</b> ironically that very same No. 6111, <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in May 1949. No examples survived into preservation.|$|R
50|$|The rebuilt units began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in {{the late}} 1950s and all had <b>been</b> <b>withdrawn</b> {{by the end of}} the 1960s.

Those units surviving in the early 1970s were designated as British Rail Class 405 under the TOPS computer system.|$|R
