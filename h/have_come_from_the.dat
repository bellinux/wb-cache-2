5|$|After the Coast Guard Act 1978 {{came into}} force on 19 August 1978, the first Director General was {{appointed}} {{on the same}} day. Vice Admiral V. A. Kamath, deputed from the Indian Navy, served as the first DG ICG. Appointed on 19 August 1978, {{he served in the}} capacity until 31 March 1980. Traditionally, appointees to the DG position <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indian Navy, although the current office holder, Rajendra Singh, is a direct entry Coast Guard officer. While several previous Directors General <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Coast Guard stream – such as Rameshwar Singh and P. Paleri – they have all initially been commissioned into the Indian Navy before later being permanently deputed to the Coast Guard service. As such, Singh has the distinction of being the first regular direct entry officer of the Indian Coast Guard to be promoted to the position of ADG and to achieve three-star rank, doing so on 11 January 2013. He was later appointed as the DG, taking over this position in early 2016. Singh succeeded Vice Admiral H. C. S. Bisht on 1 March 2016. Besides the distinction of being the first three-star rank officer of the Indian Coast Guard, Rajendra Singh is the first Coast Guard officer to become the Director General.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|NIS {{investigators}} {{tried to}} prove, unsuccessfully, that Hartwig and Truitt {{had had a}} homosexual relationship {{with each other and}} that Hartwig had initiated the explosion after the relationship had soured. As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to the media. The leaks were later said to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during its investigation, NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner.|$|E

5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one {{that may have been}} used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Arran.|$|E
5|$|The archaic English {{word for}} walrus—morse—is widely thought to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Slavic languages, {{which in turn}} {{borrowed}} it from Finno-Ugric languages. Compare морж (morž) in Russian, mursu in Finnish, morša in Northern Saami, and morse in French. Olaus Magnus, who depicted the walrus in the Carta Marina in 1539, first referred to the walrus as the ros marus, probably a Latinization of morž, and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his binomial nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for Sycorax's {{character}} may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> classical literature familiar {{to many in}} Shakespeare's day. Sycorax is similar to Medea, a witch in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in that both are powerful, magical female figures. Scholars have {{also pointed out that}} Sycorax resembles the magical Circe from Greek mythology as well as perhaps a version of Circe found in the mythology of the Coraxi tribe in modern-day Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The {{occupation}} of Group D dates {{as far back}} as the Middle Preclassic period. Group D was occupied as late as the Terminal Classic, when a termination ritual was apparently performed, after which the northern building of the group was abandoned. The ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of the south entrance to the building and then possibly burning the building itself. The rubbish is presumed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area of Group D itself and included some items associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{only source}} from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone {{inscription}} tablet that may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> funerary chapel of the dog's owner. The tablet was apparently among spolia {{used to build}} another grave in approximately 2280 BC, a sixth-Dynasty mastaba, after the chapel's demolition. It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries. This is because most international relations scholars <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

Dayton is also known for its many patents, inventions, and inventors that <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area, most notably the Wright brothers' invention of powered flight. In 2008, 2009, and 2010, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 mid-sized metropolitan area in the nation for economic development.

5|$|Records of the {{bramble shark}} are fairly rare and {{originate}} from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, {{save for the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. Most <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, where its range extends from the North Sea and the British Isles to southern Mozambique, including the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Atlantic, this species is represented {{by a handful of}} specimens from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tobago, Brazil, and Argentina. In the Indo-Pacific, it is known from Oman, India, southern Japan, southern Australia, New Zealand, and possibly Kiribati.|$|E

5|$|Since the 16th century, the English word keep has {{commonly}} referred to large towers in castles. The word originates from around 1375 to 1376, coming from the Middle English term kype, meaning basket or cask, and was a term applied to the shell keep at Guînes, said to resemble a barrel. The term came {{to be used for}} other shell keeps by the 15th century. By the 17th century, the word keep lost its original reference to baskets or casks, and was popularly assumed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle English word keep, meaning to hold or to protect.|$|E
5|$|The Campo road {{served as}} a wagon road {{providing}} access to eastern San Diego County as well as Imperial County. The road {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933, and signs for Route94 were posted along local roads later that decade. Efforts to convert the western half of the route to a freeway got underway in the 1950s, and the freeway was complete by 1962 west of the road that became SR125. Construction continued east to Avocado Road over the next few years. Various proposals for widening the highway <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but local opposition resulted in the delay or cancellation of many of these proposals.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that there was}} a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to one corner of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Though {{extremely}} rare, the {{bigeye sand tiger}} {{has been}} reported from scattered locations around the world, suggesting a wide and possibly disjunct global distribution in tropical and warm-temperate oceanic waters. Most known specimens <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, {{where it has been}} found off Madeira, southern Brazil, Texas, eastern Florida, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The only evidence for its presence in the Indian Ocean is a set of jaws that may have originated from the Seychelles, though the South China Sea is another possibility. The existence of this species in the Pacific Ocean was first suspected in 1970 from teeth recovered from bottom sediments, which was confirmed over a decade later by captures from the Marshall Islands and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Walter de Coventre (died 1371 or 1372) was a 14th-century Scottish ecclesiastic. There is {{no direct}} {{evidence}} of his birthdate, his family, or his family's origin, although he may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> region around Abernethy (in modern-day Perth and Kinross), where a family with the name de Coventre {{is known to have}} lived. Walter appeared in the records {{for the first time in}} the 1330s, as a student at the University of Paris. From there he went on to the University of Orléans, initially as a student before becoming a lecturer there. He studied the arts, civil law and canon law, and was awarded many university degrees, including two doctorates. His studies were paid for, at least partially, by his benefices in Scotland. Despite holding perhaps more than five benefices at one stage, he did not return to Scotland until the late 1350s.|$|E
