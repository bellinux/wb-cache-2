5|$|Alien Rage {{takes place}} on an {{asteroid}} which humans and an alien species known as Vorus were jointly mining for Promethium, a highly efficient source of energy. After the Vorus turn on the humans and wipe the miners out, Jack, the player character, <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mining facility to kill the aliens and destroy the facility.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|At {{school the}} next day, Elliott begins to {{experience}} a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes {{in the same manner}} and he <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> principal's office.|$|E
50|$|Mother Maria <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ravensbrück {{concentration}} camp. On Holy Saturday, 1945, {{she failed}} a selection and <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gas Chamber.|$|R
25|$|Cobra Mark III {{production}} {{began on}} 1 January 1965; two prototypes had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States in October 1964. Cars <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US as unpainted rolling chassis, {{and they were}} finished in Shelby's workshop.|$|R
50|$|As a yearling, Elusive Kate <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Keeneland {{sales in}} September, {{where she was}} bought for $70,000 by Blandford Bloodstock. <b>The</b> filly <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom <b>to</b> be trained by John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk.|$|R
5|$|For most penalties, the {{offending}} player <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> penalty box {{and his team}} has to play without him and with one less player for {{a short amount of}} time. Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed. The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, sending messages {{to the president of}} the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E
5|$|Once {{passed by}} the Senate, a bill <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with {{amendments}} or ask {{for the establishment of}} a conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a new term, since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it.|$|E
50|$|The gallows {{trapdoor}} and lever <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prison Service Museum in Rugby, Warwickshire. After {{this museum}} permanently closed in 2004, they <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Galleries of Justice in Nottingham, where those and an execution box may be seen.|$|R
50|$|Round robin DNS {{is often}} used to load balance {{requests}} between a number of Web servers. For example, a company has one domain name and three identical copies of the same web site residing on three servers with three different IP addresses. When one user accesses the home page it will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first IP address. The second user who accesses the home page will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next IP address, and the third user will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third IP address. In each case, once the IP address is given out, it goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the list. The fourth user, therefore, will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first IP address, and so forth.|$|R
5000|$|The Claws {{players were}} put into a {{dispersal}} draft. Dave Robisch and Paul Ruffner ended up going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spirits of St. Louis. Stew Johnson <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> San Diego Sails (who also folded, {{just a few weeks}} later). Claude Terry <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Denver Nuggets. Chuck Williams <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Squires. Scott English <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indiana Pacers. Joe Hamilton <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Utah Stars. George Carter also ended up with the Stars despite not being picked in the dispersal draft; Utah would become the ABA's third casualty of the season, suspending operations in early December. The Claws' best known player, Mel Daniels, was disappointed at the Claws' fate and retired rather than play for another team. In Terry Pluto's book on the ABA, [...] "Loose Balls", Daniels recalled that the Claws' players were allowed to take equipment and furniture from the team office in lieu of payment.|$|R
5|$|Submitters {{can give}} stories several {{different}} tags, such as stupid, interesting, obvious, or dumbass. Tags that say photoshop, audioedit or videoedit {{are used for}} threads where digital content is edited for a humorous or artistic effect. In addition, the newsflash tag is used for news which {{is a matter of}} important breaking news, and an email <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> administrators notifying them that someone has submitted a newsflash.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens in}} Dr. Connors's laboratory, where Connors {{demonstrates}} to his interns Peter and Gwen a new {{potential source of}} clean energy: genetically modified eels. After Gwen and Peter leave, an electrician, Max Dillon, attempts to upgrade the lab's electrical filters, but gets electrocuted and <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital. There, he {{is found to be}} emitting strong electrical fields and is placed in quarantine. Max is further angered when a doctor explains that, although he is stable, he must wear a special suit to contain this emitted bioelectricity.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> loudspeaker.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Ebbo. [...] "Almost all our {{retainers}} had perished, {{and when}} a friar <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hostel <b>to</b> bring home <b>the</b> remains, {{it appeared that the}} treacherous foe had borne them off--nay, my grandfather's head <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Diet!" ...|$|R
50|$|Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, and emigrants <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Dachau after <b>the</b> 1935 {{passage of}} the Nuremberg Laws which {{institutionalized}} racial discrimination. In early 1937, the SS, using prisoner labor, initiated construction of a large complex capable of holding 6,000 prisoners. The construction was officially completed in mid-August 1938. More political opponents, and over 11,000 German and Austrian Jews <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp after the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland in 1938. Sinti and Roma in <b>the</b> hundreds <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp in 1939, and over 13,000 prisoners <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp from Poland in 1940.|$|R
25|$|Unlike touch-position {{information}}, however, pain-temperature information <b>is</b> also <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> other thalamic nuclei {{and projected}} onto additional {{areas of the}} cerebral cortex. Some pain-temperature fibers <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medial dorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), which projects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> anterior cingulate cortex. Other fibers <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ventromedial (VM) nucleus of the thalamus, which projects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> insular cortex. Finally, some fibers <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intralaminar nucleus (IL) of the thalamus via the reticular formation. The IL projects diffusely to {{all parts of the}} cerebral cortex.|$|R
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
5|$|During these missions, {{objectives}} and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects and environments in the game. The tutorial system used to demonstrate routine gameplay {{elements such as}} object interaction and movement is disguised as the first level of Gravity Bone. Here, the player is tasked with the delivery of a contaminated drink to an unspecified non-player character. After the first level is completed, the player <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second level of the game, which follows {{the pattern of the}} first; the player is assigned a set of actions and goals involving platforming sequences.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
50|$|Following her trial, Gould <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ravensbrück {{concentration}} camp. Her brother Harold Le Druillenec <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, {{and would}} be one of only two British survivors. Louisa Gould was gassed to death in February 1945 in the camp at Ravensbrück.|$|R
50|$|Mixing desk: {{would permit}} several sources to be mixed {{together}} with an independent control of the gain or volume of the sound. The result of <b>the</b> mixing <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recorder and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monitoring loudspeakers. Signals could <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> filters or the reverberation unit.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{parallel}} broadcast channels {{have focused on}} scenarios in which independent messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers (parallel unicast channels) [7 – 10]. The optimal power allocation {{can be achieved by}} a multilevel water-filling over the parallel channels, which is an extension of Gallager's 1968 water-filling strategy for single-user parallel Gaussian channels [11]. Some other studies have considered parallel broadcast channels in which simultaneous common and independent messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [5, 12, 13], or simultaneous common and confidential messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [14].|$|R
5|$|For {{their next}} mission, the party <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Bafsk {{to prevent the}} {{construction}} of a large airship known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which can blow up the Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{takes an}} {{interest}} in the Reading Digest magazine after a copy <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Simpson family's residence. In the magazine, he notices an ad for a children's contest in which an essay must be written about what makes America great. Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has a near-death {{experience}} and <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Klingon version of Hell known as Gre'thor. There she encounters her Klingon mother Miral (Karen Austin), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her own {{identity as a}} Klingon. After being resuscitated by the Voyager crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre'thor to save her mother. The episode also guest stars Eric Pierpoint as Kortar, who ferries {{the souls of the}} dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.|$|E

5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} {{the disappearance of the}} Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|Once woven, the {{material}} <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, {{the material}}, if approved, {{is returned to}} the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto {{each side of the}} white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.|$|E
