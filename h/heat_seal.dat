40|$|ABSTRACT: Acrylic latex {{polymers}} {{which are}} widely used as backcoatings for fabrics dielectrically <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> in automotive interior trim constructions can cause arcing on nylon-containing fabrics during <b>heat</b> <b>sealing.</b> Arcing causes fabric charring. Most nylon fabrics, because of their polar and hydroscopic nature, are prone to arcing. A latex backcoating can aggravage this problem further. This talk discusses several new acrylic latexes developed for arc resistant backcoatings for nylon fabric, presenting comparative dielec-tric <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> data on several nylon-containing fabrics. The role of the nonwoven plumper pad adhesive (usually a preplasticized PVC latex) used in the interior trim construc-tions is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concentrated}} on studying <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> paper with polymer film by hot-bar sealing. The objectives included {{learning more about}} the relationship of the materials and how they behave in different <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> conditions. Also some methods were tested out for <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> samples to find out if they would provide useful information because one interest was to find new methods for testing. Theory part introduces flexible paper-polymer films packages that are opened by peeling. Also the <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> process and the method to measure seal strength have been presented. Adhesion theories that are the most applicable considering <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> have been introduced. It was found that sealing temperature affects seal properties greatly. When certain level of pressure is applied, it doesn’t affect seal strength notably anymore if it’s increased. Correlation between seal strength and fibre amount index was found not to be straight forward. Results suggested that pressure effects on the peel characteristics so that high pressure possibly makes the paper surface more compact and molten polymer doesn’t flow into valleys and voids of paper’s surface thus giving smaller fibre amount index. With profilometer it was possible to obtain differences to the surface roughness for samples <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> with different parameter and the images showed clearly the fibres that were pointing out of paper surface and attached to polymer film. When comparing manual peeling to using an instrument it was found that with the instrument fibre amount index levels were higher but standard deviations were not smaller...|$|R

50|$|In-mould {{labelling}} (IML) {{was initially}} designed for blow molding, though developments using injection molding or thermoforming with reel-fed systems {{have increased the}} efficiency of the labelling process. The original concept involves coating the reverse side of the label with a <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> layer, followed by a substrate material in which heat resistant ink is applied to. A heat resistant coating of lacquer is then applied. This process eliminates the need to flame treat the bottles prior to labelling in order to achieve adequate adhesion. Initially, paper was used as the label substrate to which the heat reactive adhesive was applied. In more recent times plastic substrates have been employed, such as Polyart from Arjobex Synthetic Papers. This creates the advantage that scrap bottles produced in the molding process can be recycled, without the need for label removal prior to recycling.|$|E
5000|$|For thicker plastic strap, usually 0.73 mm and thicker, {{friction}} is used {{to create}} heat within the joint. The process starts with the strap compressed between the platen and the anvil. There is a vibrator built into either the platen or the anvil, which has teeth; there are also teeth on the opposite component that does not move. The vibrator is quickly vibrated, which creates enough heat to melt the interface between the two strap, because of friction. To complete the weld the vibrator is stopped and the pressure held until the joint has solidified. Polypropylene and Polyester strapping can also be sealed {{in a similar manner}} with the heat being produced by sound in the form of Ultrasonic waves passing through the materials and exiting the molecular structure. They are then compressed as in a <b>heat</b> <b>seal.</b> In ultrasonic welding of plastics, high frequency (15 kHz to 40 kHz [...] ) low amplitude vibration {{is used to}} create heat by way of friction between the materials to be joined.

40|$|In this study, polyamide-aluminum foil-polypropylene (PA-Al-PP) {{composite}} {{films with}} different orientation {{status of the}} PP layer were prepared, and their morphology, tensile, peeling and <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior were studied. The comparative study of tensile and fracture behaviors of single-layer film of PA, Al and PP, {{as well as the}} composite films of PA-Al, PP-Al and PA-Al-PP revealed that in PA-Al-PP composite film, the PA layer with the highest tensile strength can share the tensile stress from the Al layer during stretching, while the PP layer with the lowest tensile strength can prevent further development of the small cracks on boundary of the Al layer during stretching. Moreover, the study of <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior suggested that both the orientation status and the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> conditions were important factors in determining the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> strength (HSS) and failure behavior of the sample. Four failure types were observed, and a clear correspondence between HSS and failure types was found. The results also elucidated that for the composite film, only in the cases where the tensile stress was efficiently released by each layer during HSS measurement could the composite film exhibit desired high HSS that was even higher than its tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|Sequences of {{operations}} on packaging machines {{can be described}} as a series of basic operations. Such basic operations are, for instance, the transport of the packaging material through the machine, the moulding of the packaging material to the package, by folding for example, the dosing and filling up of the products to be packed and the closing of the filled package, for instance by <b>heat</b> <b>sealing.</b> There are several characteristic basic operations for every type of packaging machine.
