500|$|Prison {{officials}} said that Noreen [...] "wept inconsolably" [...] on learning of Taseer's assassination while repeatedly saying, [...] "That man came <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> sacrificed his life for me." [...] Father Andrew Nisari, a senior Catholic Spokesperson in Lahore, described the situation as [...] "utter chaos". Seven months later, Taseer's 28-year-old son, Shahbaz, was kidnapped. Shahbahz was later found or released in March 2016, and he returned to Lahore on 9 March after five years in captivity.|$|E
500|$|In {{his senior}} year (2009–10), Lin {{averaged}} 16.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 2.4 steals, and 1.1 blocks, and was again a unanimous selection for the All-Ivy League First Team. He was one of 30 midseason candidates for the John R. Wooden Award and one of 11 finalists for the Bob Cousy Award. He was also invited to the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament. Fran Fraschilla of ESPN named Lin {{as one of the}} 12 most versatile players in college basketball. Lin gained national attention for his performance against the 12th-ranked Connecticut Huskies, against whom he scored a career-high 30 points and grabbed 9 rebounds on the road. After the game, Hall of Fame Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said of Lin: [...] "I've seen a lot of teams come through <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> could play for any of them. He's got great, great composure on the court. He knows how to play." ...|$|E
500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> struggled early. On the second question, host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] with the answer being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E

2500|$|... "If {{he finds}} the crowd harsh here then he must {{remember}} he asked for it." [...] said Jeremy Coney. [...] "But crowds just can't be neutral about him", he said. Some applaud his behaviour and others didn't. His behaviour polarises the crowds <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> must expect some sort of reaction from those who don't like it. I just feel neutral about him – when he is batting I {{want to get rid}} of him, when he is bowling I want to hit him around the park." ...|$|E
2500|$|In autumn 1984, the Portuguese {{authorities}} declared Trifa an undesirable, {{and indicated}} that {{he had failed to}} reveal his fascist sympathies when requesting and obtaining a temporary visa. According to Reuters, Portuguese officials indicated that [...] "it was against Portugal's interests for Archbishop Trifa to live <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> must leave as soon as possible." [...] Initially, they allowed the prelate three months to leave the country's territory. Trifa contested the decision with the Supreme Administrative Court, which put off his actual deportation for several years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defeated}} Parliamentarians were pursued into Lostwithiel where over 1,200 {{were captured}}. In all 1,500 Parliamentarians were captured and a further 200 killed with few losses on the Royalist side. Hopton drove another band of survivors out of Saltash, {{where they had}} fled after the battle. The battle cost the Royalists little but had severe consequences for the Parliamentarians, who lost the prospect of controlling of Cornwall. Hopton's reputation as a commander was bolstered by his victory <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was also commended for the mercy shown to his surrendered foe.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I poke him up now <b>and</b> then, but <b>he</b> gets peppery, so I let him alone. May be he is {{longing for}} his old circus again. Shouldn't blame him much if he was; it isn't very lively <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> used to excitement, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By all accounts, Mr. McGinty, you {{may have}} to answer for your own conduct some of these days," [...] the captain answered.

2500|$|On 28 September, Reina {{declared}} that his Liverpool career was over: [...] "At the moment it's difficult {{to think about}} being a Liverpool player next year. They have a young goalkeeper in Simon Mignolet and the manager prefers him to me. That's the reason why I'm <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{will be at the}} club next year as well. There's no reason to think I'll be a Liverpool player from now on but we'll see where the future takes us. It's been a good move so far and I don't regret what happened. I would have preferred to say goodbye in a different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|School Library Journal praised it as a [...] "rich and poignant novel." [...] The San Jose Mercury News said, [...] "Haddon does {{something}} audacious <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> does it superbly. He shows {{us the way}} consciousness orders the world, even when the world doesn't want to be ordered," [...] adding that [...] "the great achievement of this novel is that it transcends its obvious cleverness. It's more than an exercise in narrative ingenuity. Filled with humor and pain, it verges on profundity in its examination of those things—customs, habits, language, symbols, daily routines, etc.—that simultaneously unite and separate human beings." [...] A reviewer for The Christian Century described it as [...] "an absorbing, plausible book": [...] "The reader becomes absorbed {{not only in the}} mystery of a murdered dog and a missing mom, but also in the mysterious world of an autistic child." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “I'm making {{great friends}} with two Jews, brothers—one rather famous, {{as a member}} of the Committee of Union and Progress and a deputy for Baghdad. His name is Sasun Eff. The other Sha'al, (which is Saul) is the leading Jew {{merchant}} here. They have recently come back from C'ple —they were at the first tea party I gave for you, here. I've known Sha'al's wife and family a long time—they are very interesting and able men. Sasun, with his reputation and his intelligence, ought to be a great help.”Bell also wrote of Sassoon on 17 October 1920:“That night Mr Philby dined with me and we had a long and profitable talk. He had been to tea with me also and I had Sasun Eff. to meet him which was most valuable, for Sasun is one of the sanest people <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> reviewed the whole position with his usual wisdom and moderation.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Billy Joel said, via a live video link-up at {{the press}} launch at Ronnie Scott's jazz club, [...] "I'm {{particularly}} pleased that the incredibly talented James Fox will be returning to home turf; he has been wowing audiences <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> {{going to continue to}} do so there." ...|$|R

2500|$|Wanting {{to return}} to their sound from that {{particular}} era, after narrowing down the selection from twelve finished songs to ten that they wanted to record, the band sought to work with James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, who had mixed and engineered the band's hit albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and whom they had last worked with in the mid-90s, when he produced their album Promised Land. Deciding to work with Barton was [...] "a no-brainer", according to La Torre, and Rockenfield has said that Barton was really the only choice. Barton had stayed in contact with Wilton, who would often fill him in on {{what was going on in}} the band. Queensrÿche invited him to see them perform at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on November 24, 2012, where he reportedly said that the band [...] "had something really special <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> wanted to be a part of it." [...] In the studio in Seattle, he told the band: [...] "Look guys, let's just start where we left off, back in 1995". Rockenfield looks back on the collaboration, saying: [...] "Working with Jimbo [...] and the addition of Todd has revitalized the band in ways we never knew until we heard the final results" [...] and: [...] "We had the best time, and he was such a great, perfect match to make this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the winter}} of 256, Zhuge Dan found an excuse to entrench himself further in Shouchun and build up his defences. He wrote to the Wei {{imperial}} court, claiming that he heard that Eastern Wu forces were planning to attack the Huai River region. He asked for 100,000 troops and permission to build more defensive structures in the area. At the time, as Sima Shi had died in 255, his younger brother Sima Zhao {{had taken over the}} reins of power as the regent of Wei. Jia Chong suggested to Sima Zhao to keep a close watch on the generals who were guarding strategic locations throughout the Wei Empire and assess whether they were loyal to him. Sima Zhao heeded his words and sent him to Shouchun to meet Zhuge Dan. Jia Chong told Zhuge Dan, [...] "Many wise men in Luoyang hope to see the Emperor abdicate in favour of a better ruler. You already know this. What do you think?" [...] Zhuge Dan replied sternly, [...] "Aren't you Inspector Jia's son? The State has treated your family generously for generations. How can you betray the State and let it {{fall into the hands of}} others? I can't stand this. If there is trouble in Luoyang, I'll die for the State." [...] Jia Chong remained silent. After returning to Luoyang, Jia Chong told Sima Zhao, [...] "Zhuge Dan has high prestige and popularity in Yang Province. If you summon him <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> doesn't obey, it's a small problem. But if you don't summon him, it'll become a big problem." [...] Around the early summer of 257, Sima Zhao issued an order in the imperial court's name, ordering Zhuge Dan to return to Luoyang to serve as Minister of Works (司空) in the central government. While the order ostensibly promoted Zhuge Dan to a prestigious ministerial office (one of the Three Ducal Ministers, in fact), it was actually a move to remove him from power in Shouchun and put him under Sima Zhao's control in Luoyang.|$|E
