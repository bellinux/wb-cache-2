This study predicts the terminal velocity of U 3 O 8 by using the terminal velocity of SiO 2, which would determine the optimum air flux. We obtained a theory terminal velocity of SiO 2 and conducted an experiment for verification. In a relative form of density ratio vs. particle size, and a theory slop ratio of SiO 2, U 3 O 8, we predict the terminal velocity and flux of U 3 O 8. And through an oxidation experiment, we verify the theory form to detect the existence of U 3 O 8 powder in a <b>discharge</b> <b>filter.</b> We have conducted a scattering experimentation of U 3 O 8 powder using an existing experimental oxidizer in a mock-up. The optimum flow and experimental results of U 3 O 8 for scatter prevention have been applied {{for the design of}} the demonstration oxidizer, and the operation conditions of the oxidizer were produced...|$|E
40|$|Hall {{thrusters}} exhibit characteristic {{discharge voltage}} and current oscillations during steady-state operation. The lower frequency breathing-mode current oscillations are inherent to each thruster and could impact thruster operation and power processing unit (PPU) design. The design of the discharge output filter, in particular, the output capacitor {{is important because it}} supplies the high peak current oscillations that the thruster demands. However, space-rated, high-voltage capacitors are not readily available and can have significant mass and volume. So, it is important for a PPU designer to know what is the minimum amount of capacitance required to operate a thruster. Through Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis modeling and electrical measurements on the Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding thruster, it was shown that the harness impedance between the power supply and the thruster is the main contributor towards generating voltage ripple at the thruster. Also, increasing the size of the <b>discharge</b> <b>filter</b> capacitor, as previously implemented during thruster tests, does not reduce the voltage oscillations. The electrical characteristics of the electrical harness between the discharge supply and the thruster is crucial to system performance and could {{have a negative impact on}} performance, life and operation...|$|E

Increased nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3) concentrations in drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia, sometimes called blue baby syndrome. Groundwater transport and discharge of ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4) and NO 3 to surface waters can lead to algal blooms, eutrophic conditions and fish kills. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the nitrogen treatment efficiency of OWTS installed in the piedmont region of North Carolina. Five (volunteered) sites with OWTS in the piedmont counties of Wake (n = 1) and Durham (n = 4) were instrumented with piezometers (34 total) near and down-gradient from the OWTS. Two OWS were conventional style, two were surface <b>discharge</b> sand <b>filter</b> systems and one was a low-pressure pipe system.

Studies conducted in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina have indicated that onsite wastewater systems (OWS) may be a major contributor of nutrients to groundwater and surface water. However, {{there is a lack}} of published research regarding OWS nutrient contributions to water resources in Piedmont settings, where the soils are much different than in coastal plain regions. Most of North Carolina's population lives in the piedmont region, and a high percentage of piedmont residents utilize OWS, therefore it is important we have an understanding of how OWS function with regards to nutrient treatment. East Carolina University in cooperation with the NC Department of Health and Human Services, and Durham County Department of Public Health was engaged in a study to gather that information. The study included 5 sites in the central piedmont region of North Carolina where over 30 piezometers were installed to monitor groundwater adjacent to and downgradient from OWS. Data indicated that ground water phosphate (PO 4 -P) concentrations were low (typically [less than] 0. 01 mg/L) adjacent to the conventional style drainfields that have greater than 1 m depth to groundwater.

However, a conventional filter press is a batch system and the process must be stopped to <b>discharge</b> the <b>filter</b> cake and reassemble the press, which is time consuming. Practically, maximum {{filtration rate}} is obtained when the filtration time is greater than the time taken to discharge the cake and reassemble the press to allow for cloth's resistance.Properties of the filter cake affect the filtration rate, and it is desirable for the particle's size to be as large as possible to prevent pore blockage by using a coagulant. From experimental work, flow rate of liquid through the filter medium is proportional to the pressure difference. As the cake layer forms, pressure applies to the system increases and the flow rate of filtrate decreases. If the solid is desired, the purity of the solid can be increased by cake washing and air drying.Sample of filter cake can be taken from different locations and weighed to determine the moisture content by using overall material balance.|$|R

Two band-stop filters have been designed for 13. 5 - 29. 5 GHz and 16 - 37 GHz frequency range resulting in rejection levels of - 15 dB/- 20 dB for the whole tuning range and band-pass insertion loss of - 0. 19 dB/- 0. 25 dB at 10 GHz, respectively. Temperature measurements have been performed from - 100 °C to 100 °C demonstrating highly stable filter performances and tuning range, which recommends these devices for communications and airborne applications. For low temperatures (- 100 °C), the pull-in voltage increases by 17 % and the tuning range is slightly reduced.

30|$|Since a fault created wave attenuates when {{travelling}} {{through a}} boundary inductor [12], {{the side of}} the fault with respect to boundary inductor can be easily and reliably identified if the magnitudes of disturbance at two sides are compared. A number of advantages are apparent in this method when compared with aforementioned methods of fault direction identification. As the rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) based fault detection methods [9, 11] applied for detection of transmission line and bus faults demands both line side voltage and bus side voltages, no additional sensors are necessary. Fault directions can be readily identified without using costly high bandwidth CTs that needed to measure fast current transients. Furthermore, the rate of dropping of voltages during DC side faults is much faster than the rate of rising of fault currents: this is because the rate of rising of current is approximately equals to the time integral of voltage variation. Therefore, a voltage based directional element can detect the direction of a fault promptly when a travelling wave reaches the terminal. Rapid <b>discharge</b> of <b>filter</b> and cable capacitance are dominant during the early phase rising fault current [20]. Since the maximum/steady state fault currents for short circuit faults are likely to be much higher than the circuit breaker capabilities [21], a fault must be detected and the DC circuit breakers (DCCBs) must be opened before the fault current rises above the breaker’s maximum interruption current. This aspect has not been tested in the fault detection schemes such as the one presented in [12]. The rate of change of voltage based HVDC grid protection scheme presented in [9] can face difficulties during high resistance faults.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 106 - 121) Ground-water contamination by sewage {{waste is}} a major problem in the United States. A known technology for reducing this contamination is spray irrigation of wastewater instead of the more typical sand-bed filtration. This study involves the application of a ground-water flow and contaminant transport model to compare the ground-water contamination from spray irrigation versus sand bed filtration at the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod. To develop the ground-water flow model, site- specific parameters were input and the model was calibrated to observed water-level elevations. The transport model was developed by simulating known concentrations and loading rates and estimating values of dispersivity. In addition, data from the existing wastewater plume were used in the model calibration. The contaminant transport model predicts that, for the Cape Cod site, the spray irrigation method results in lower concentrations of contaminants over a smaller area. Even tertiary treatment of the wastewater <b>discharged</b> to a <b>filter</b> bed will result in greater contamination than spray irrigation of secondarily treated wastewater. M. S.
