Nowadays the newcomers from Bulgaria aim for these areas in particular, where they can join an already established community. Many of these economic immigrants have dual citizenship of both the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. However most of the recent immigrants still only have Bulgarian citizenship.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, coal mining, {{alkaline}} {{production and}} glass making {{led to a}} boom in the town. The population increased from 12,000 in 1801 to 75,000 by the 1860s, bolstered by <b>economic</b> <b>migration</b> from Ireland, Scotland {{and other parts of}} England. These industries played a fundamental part in creating wealth both regionally and nationally. In 1832, with the Great Reform Act, South Shields and Gateshead were each given their own Member of Parliament and became boroughs, resulting in taxes being paid to the Government instead of the Bishops of Durham. However, the rapid growth in population brought on by the expansion of industry made sanitation a problem, as evident by Cholera outbreaks and the building of the now-listed Cleadon Water Tower to combat the problem. In the 1850s 'The Tyne Improvement Commission' began to develop the river, dredging it to make it deeper and building the large, impressive North and South Piers to help prevent silt build up within the channel. Shipbuilding (along with coal mining), previously a monopoly of the Freemen of Newcastle, became another prominent industry in the town, with John Readhead & Sons Shipyard the largest.|$|E

Income and wealth were massively redistributed toward {{a small number}} of people at the top at the price of impoverishment of a large number at the bottom. The unemployment had reached an all-time high of 20% by the end of 2003, just before the European Union membership came to the rescue. As a result of high unemployment, it took at least a decade for the average real pay to reach the level from before 1989 and joining the Union triggered the greatest peacetime wave of permanent <b>economic</b> <b>migration</b> out of the country. The reforms undertaken by the Polish elites were of an overwhelmingly economic character. Their socially detrimental consequences included the lasting political polarization over the practically limited range of choices: economic liberalism lacking any communal concerns on the one hand, and the conservative, patriarchal and parochial backwaters of Polish nationalism on the other.|$|E

Cherokees constitute over 2% of population of three largely rural communities in California-Covelo, Hayfork and San Miguel, one town in Oregon and one town in Arizona. Destinations for Cherokee diaspora included multi-ethnic/racial urban centers of California (i.e. the Greater Los Angeles and SF Bay areas), and they usually live in farming communities, by military bases and other Indian reservations.|$|R

The estimation process {{is to use a}} gravity model. Since longitudinal data is not available, regressions are run on a cross section of data drawn from the survey of 2000. In addition to ordinary least squares estimates, various models of spatial dependency are employed to improve estimation of coefficients and hypothesis results. It is determined that greater economic freedom positively impacts migration between states. Further, it is discovered that a general autoregressive spatial model (GSAR) performs the best out of the selected models and augments the impact of <b>economic</b> freedom on <b>migration.</b> <b>Economic</b> Freedom, <b>Migration...</b>|$|R
