25|$|The {{composition}} of Lutetia has puzzled astronomers for some time. While classified among the M-type asteroids, {{most of which}} are metallic, Lutetia is one of the anomalous members that do not display much evidence of metal on their surface. Indeed, there were various indications of a non-metallic surface: a <b>flat,</b> <b>low</b> frequency spectrum similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites and C-type asteroids and not at all like that of metallic meteorites, a low radar albedo unlike the high albedos of strongly metallic asteroids like 16 Psyche, evidence of hydrated materials on its surface, abundant silicates, and a thicker regolith than most asteroids.|$|E
25|$|The {{landscape}} of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a <b>flat,</b> <b>low</b> area {{with an average of}} two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond less to the nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of floating rice, a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855.|$|E
