5|$|Technical {{analysis}} shows extensive underdrawing, typical for Memling. They were completed {{in a dry}} medium except for the dove and the <b>flask</b> and candles on the sideboard. Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip <b>flask</b> in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos <b>flask).</b>|$|E
50|$|The round bottoms {{on these}} types of <b>flasks</b> allow more uniform heating and/or boiling of liquid. Thus, round-bottom <b>flasks</b> are used {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} where the contents are heated or boiled. Round-bottom <b>flasks</b> are used in distillation by chemists as distilling <b>flasks</b> and receiving <b>flasks</b> for the distillate (see distillation diagram). One-neck round-bottom <b>flasks</b> are used as the distilling <b>flasks</b> in rotary evaporators.|$|R

5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) <b>flask.</b>|$|E

He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Python {{can serve}} as a {{scripting}} language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, <b>Flask,</b> Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.|$|E

50|$|At the opening(s) at top of {{the neck}} of some glass <b>flasks</b> such as round-bottom <b>flasks,</b> retorts, or {{sometimes}} volumetric <b>flasks,</b> there are outer (or female) tapered (conical) ground glass joints. Some <b>flasks,</b> especially volumetric <b>flasks,</b> come with a stopper or cap for capping the opening at the {{top of the}} neck. Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic. Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner (or male) ground glass joint surface, but often only of stopper quality. <b>Flasks</b> which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper.|$|R
5|$|The sticky {{bomb was}} a glass <b>flask</b> filled with {{nitroglycerin}} and given an adhesive coating {{allowing it to}} be glued to a passing vehicle. In theory, it could be thrown, but in practice it would most likely need to be placed—thumped against the target with sufficient force to stick—requiring courage and good fortune to be used effectively. An order for one million sticky bombs was placed in June 1940, but various problems delayed their distribution in large numbers until early 1941, {{and it is likely}} that fewer than 250,000 were produced.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum <b>flask.</b> He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are 10.5–13.5 by 6.5–8µm with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–55 by 10–15µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are 70–110 by 25–45µm, fusiform (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (<b>flask</b> shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60–75 by 15–27µm, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae {{embedded in a}} gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100–360 by 10–20µm and mostly cylindrical.|$|E
50|$|Hip <b>flasks</b> were {{traditionally}} made of pewter, silver, or even glass, {{though most}} modern <b>flasks</b> {{are made from}} stainless steel. Some modern <b>flasks</b> are made of plastic {{so as to avoid}} detection by metal detectors.|$|R
50|$|These liquids may {{be stored}} in Dewar <b>flasks,</b> which are double-walled {{containers}} with a high vacuum between the walls to reduce heat transfer into the liquid. Typical laboratory Dewar <b>flasks</b> are spherical, made of glass and protected in a metal outer container. Dewar <b>flasks</b> for extremely cold liquids such as liquid helium have another double-walled container filled with liquid nitrogen. Dewar <b>flasks</b> are named after their inventor, James Dewar, the man who first liquefied hydrogen. Thermos bottles are smaller vacuum <b>flasks</b> fitted in a protective casing.|$|R
50|$|Cells {{are grown}} in T-25 <b>flasks</b> at 37 degree and 5% CO2 in {{appropriate}} medium. Depending {{on the design}} of the study, after cells are confluent they could be treated with drugs, growth factors or they could be irradiated before lysis step. For time course studies, a stimulant is added to a set of <b>flasks</b> concurrently and the <b>flasks</b> are then processed at different time points. For drug dose studies, a set of <b>flasks</b> are treated with different doses of the drug and all the <b>flasks</b> are collected at the same time.|$|R
5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass <b>flask</b> with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale, a <b>flask</b> of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's alcohol intake {{does not seem to}} affect his performance.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water <b>flask</b> from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flasks</b> are {{designed}} with an alignment or registration feature so that the two <b>flasks</b> can be aligned to one another to ensure a casting can be more dimensionally accurate and also in small <b>flasks,</b> so that they cannot be fitted together the wrong way.|$|R

5|$|Gossip, {{with his}} long, flowing beard, {{looks like one}} of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald at the top, and is a little above the medium height.... He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a <b>flask</b> of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1902 the {{air chamber}} of another torpedo exploded, killing one sailor and {{wounding}} three. In September she transported the Minister of the Navy to Bizerte. Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to}} the Northern Squadron in 1904 and arrived at Brest on 25 March. She was lightly damaged when she touched a rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July and in another incident her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air <b>flask</b> burst between her screws during a torpedo-launching exercise on 18 May 1905. While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August Jauréguiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbour. She returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division, and the following year was reassigned to the Third Division. In 1909 the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910. Beginning on 29 September 1910 her boiler tubes were renewed at Cherbourg. In October 1912 the Squadron was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and a year later, in October 1913, Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to the}} Training Division of which she became the flagship in April 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains a labyrinth design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the Madonna and Child. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked {{the door to the}} garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and <b>flask</b> of wine.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} common pieces of glassware, Erlenmeyer <b>flasks</b> could {{potentially}} {{be used in the}} production of drugs.

5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass <b>flask</b> inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted <b>flask</b> of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaetí Blödhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.|$|E
