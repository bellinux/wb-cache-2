Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.|$|E

5|$|Later on May 11, {{convection}} re-fired {{over the}} center {{as the system}} drifted south-southeastward, though it lacked sufficient organization to qualify as a tropical cyclone. By May 12, shower activity <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> greatly {{to the east of}} the center, and the National Hurricane Center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in the formation of a tropical depression. It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters, the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} 60-mile (97-km) march, only 52,000prisoners (approximately 9,200American and 42,800Filipino) reached Camp O'Donnell, with an estimated 20,000 having died from illness, hunger, torture, or murder. Later with the closure of Camp O'Donnell most of the imprisoned soldiers were transferred to the Cabanatuan prison camp to join the POWs from the Battle of Corregidor.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E
5|$|Alpha's origins {{were from}} a {{tropical}} wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October20. Satellite images indicated that a low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity. In an area of light wind shear, the convection increased and Doppler weather radar data from Puerto Rico detected a well-defined cyclonic circulation. On October22, the {{area of low pressure}} organized into Tropical Depression 25, southeast of Hispaniola. Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding. Later that same day, the depression <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha; {{this was the first time}} the National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later.

Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party {{had no interest in}} removing De la Rúa from power, because he was so unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

5|$|Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked {{being under}} Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes {{in order to}} defeat them and to show his courage. This {{took place in the}} last quarter of the 4th century, {{possibly}} around 380. Boz, the king of the Antes (rex Antorum), <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> an alliance to defend the Antes, and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed to capture and crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (primates). Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of the World Trade Center site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to the World Trade Center site at that time.|$|E
5|$|In early July2007, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist in the South China Sea roughly 155mi (250km) southeast of Hainan. The Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0000UTC on July3 after the storm <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> sufficiently, however, other tracking agencies did not indicate that tropical cyclogenesis had occurred at the time. However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the disturbance for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis at 0100UTC later that day, At the time, the storm system was situated in an area of weak to moderate wind shear, exposing the disturbance's low-level circulation center. Despite the prevailing conditions and proximity to land, the storm continued to organize, and as such the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 0130UTC the following day.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> {{an assault}} on the new Paraguayan {{defenses}} which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side of}} the Paraguayan River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The Allied forces outflanked the Paraguayan lines and attacked from the rear. The combined allied forces annihilated the Paraguayan army and on 1 January 1869 Asunción was occupied.|$|E
5|$|On June16, {{satellite}} imagery revealed {{an area of}} increased convection east of the Bahamas, which was {{believed to have been}} associated with a tropical wave. On June17, the convection increased in organization at the lower levels of the atmosphere. By 1800UTC, the system <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> sufficiently to be designated as a tropical depression, making it the first of the season. Initially, the depression tracked north-northwest under the steering currents of the low-level flow around the western periphery of the Atlantic subtropical ridge. Strong wind shear due to fast upper-level winds associated with a cold-core low over the eastern Gulf of Mexico hindered further intensification for a time, but on June18, an area of deep convection developed north of the center of circulation. Based on analysis of reconnaissance data, the tropical depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur at 1900UTC on June19.|$|E
5|$|Pope Clement VIII {{wanted to}} persuade Sigismund {{to join the}} Holy League that the pope <b>had</b> <b>organized</b> against the Ottoman Empire.

However, the delegates of the Three Nations refused to declare war against the Ottoman Empire at three consecutive Diets between May and July. Sigismund abdicated, tasking Balthasar Báthory with the government in late July. Balthasar wanted to seize the throne, but Kovacsóczy, Kendi, and the other leading officials decided to set up an aristocratic council to administer Transylvania.|$|E
