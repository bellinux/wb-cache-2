5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E

30|$|With further {{increasing}} in running speed of newer high-speed EMUs (electric multiple units), higher demand for wheelset dynamic balance is required. In order {{to study the}} influence <b>of</b> the <b>dynamic</b> unbalance <b>of</b> wheelset on the stability, ride quality, and curving performance for a high-speed car, a detailed <b>dynamic</b> model <b>of</b> a high-speed EMU car is established using the software SIMPACK. The analysis {{results indicate that the}} <b>dynamic</b> unbalance <b>of</b> the wheelset significantly influences the <b>dynamic</b> performance <b>of</b> the high-speed car. The increase in <b>dynamic</b> unbalance <b>of</b> the wheelset will decrease the hunting critical speed, worsen the vertical ride quality, and increase the wheelset lateral force, derailment coefficient, and wheel unloading ratio. Therefore, in order to improve the stability, ride quality, and running safety of high-speed car, the values <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> unbalance <b>of</b> wheelset should be strictly controlled in manufacturing, and periodically monitored in operation.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E
