40|$|URL] audienceSpiral 2 {{accelerator}} {{is designed}} to accelerate protons, deuterons, ions with a power from hundreds of Watts to 200 kW. Therefore, {{it is important to}} monitor and anticipate beam losses to maintain equipment integrities by triggering beam cuts when beam losses or equipment malfunctions are detected; the MPS (Machine Protection System) is in charge of this function. The MPS has also to monitor and limit activations but this part is not addressed here. Linked to the MPS, five <b>human</b> <b>machine</b> <b>interfaces</b> will be provided. The first, "MPS" lets operators and accelerator engineers monitor MPS states, alarms and tune some beam losses thresholds. The second "beam power rise" defines successive steps to reach the desired beam power. Then, "interlock" is a synoptic to control beam stops state and defaults; the "beam losses" one displays beam losses, currents and efficiencies along the accelerator. Finally, "beam structure" lets users interact with the timing system by controlling the temporal structure to obtain a specific duty cycle according to the beam power constraints. In this paper, we introduce these <b>human</b> <b>machine</b> <b>interfaces,</b> their interactions and the method used for software development...|$|R
