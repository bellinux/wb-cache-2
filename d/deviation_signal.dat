The aggregation is thus able to follow the frequency deviation, as shown in Fig. 15 a, which in turn results in faster-decaying power oscillations. Moreover, due to the controllability margin, the aggregation is able to respond to additional frequency deviations, which is not the case when CSC is not applied.|$|E
40|$|For {{application}} {{of a large number}} of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to system frequency regulation, a distributed acquisition approach based on consensus filtering is proposed, where frequency-measuring function is performed only at distribution substations. Limited communication between neighboring PEVs/distribution substations can facilitate consistent and accurate acquisition of frequency <b>deviation</b> <b>signals</b> for all PEVs. Considering the battery charging/discharging characteristics, a dynamic PEV model with feedback control is further proposed and integrated with frequency regulation based on distributed acquisition. Asymptotical stabilities of distributed acquisition and system frequency regulation are analyzed.

Sensor circuitry generates an output signal {{in proportion to}} the capacitance between the electrodes and the shaft; the capacitance between an electrode and the shaft increases as the shaft approaches the electrode and decreases as the shaft recedes from the electrode. The sensor circuitry applies an alternating voltage to one electrode of a pair and a 180 degree out of phase alternating voltage to the other electrode of the pair.

40|$|In Sender-Receiver {{games with}} costly signaling, some equilibria are {{vulnerable}} to deviations which could be "unambiguously" interpreted by the Receiver as coming from {{a unique set of}} possible Sender-types. The vulnerability occurs when the types in this set are the ones who gain from the deviation, regardless of the posterior beliefs the Receiver forms over that set. We formalize this idea and use it to characterize a unique equilibrium outcome in two classes of games. First, in mono- tonic signaling games, only the Riley outcome is immune to this sort of deviation. Our result therefore provides a plausible story behind the selection made by Cho and Kreps' (1987) D 1 criterion on this class of games. Second, we examine a version of Crawford and Sobel's (1982) model but with costly signaling and finite type sets, where standard refinements have no effect.

The computational requirement to process the data during the online training, local convergence, and online global convergence properties are investigated by time-domain simulations. The performances of the identifiers as a global model, which are trained at different stable operating conditions, are compared using the actual signals {{as well as the}} <b>deviation</b> <b>signals</b> for the inputs of the identifiers. Such an online-trained identifier with fixed optimal weights after the global convergence test is needed to provide information about the plant to a neurocontroller.
