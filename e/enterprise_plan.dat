In this step is also include the principles that will guide the enterprise. The second step is environmental assessment. It is divided in external, determining threats and opportunities, and internal, determining strengths and weaknesses. The third step is objective setting where you create specific goals to the enterprise that can be measurable, achievable, time specific and documented. Finally the fourth step is strategy setting is when the managers create a strategy plan based on the steps before that creates the balance in the company.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} carried out to model an optimal arable crop plan that {{minimizes}} child farm labour use in Ogun State, Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 400 rural households from the State. The household survey involves an interview of 594 children, 400 household heads and a focus group discussion section in four locations. The data collected were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics {{in line with the}} study objectives. The linear programming model was used to develop an optimal arable crop farm that maximizes economic returns to the farmers while simultaneously allowing for maximum school attendance and involvement. The optimal farm model revealed that a restructuring of the crop <b>enterprise</b> <b>plan</b> could increase the annual farm income by about 15. 3 percent, {{while at the same time}} minimizing the child farm labour involvement in the State. The study recommends that reducing child labour, will require facilitating access to credit to the resources-poor rural households. Also, that government should provide assistance to arable crop farmers in the areas of subsidizing the costs of production inputs (seeds, tractor hiring, fertilizers and other agrochemicals), and that research efforts should be geared towards developing simple, affordable, and adaptable machines/implements, and other farm labour-saving devises...|$|E

40|$|The article {{attempts}} at defining position and planner {{functions of the}} State enterprise director which have to be better developed in {{the effect of the}} economic reform and in particular through the realization of its in-coming model postulates. The discussion is preceeded by the short characterization of new planistic conditioning of an enterprise formed by the radically changed — in relation to the traditional systematic solutions — shaping of the substance and structure of the plan, mode and procedure of its elaboration, integration of the <b>enterprise</b> <b>plan</b> with the central and local ones. Creating a wide ranging planistic independence (in both current and the long-run aspect) and a parametric mechanism of planistic activities, the economic reform calls for a replacement of a administrational and executive model of a director with the one of political and manager, i. e. the profound change in the role and the situation of the planner function of the director. Generally speaking, all mental processes and planner acts of the director concerning the short and the long-run activities of the enterprise can be reduced to the tree principal functions: namely inspiring, coordinating and supervising ones. The inspiring function is to occupy the central position among the other, while the remaining functions are the necessary supplement to the first one, yet they gain in their weight as the inspiring function becomes more exposed and autonomous. The planner position of the director should also be increased by granting the director the status of autonomous and strongly situated planning organ, which growing role is imposed on the system of relations: director — managing collective, workers' self-government and founding organs.

40|$|The {{mainstay}} {{of economic activity}} in Cat Que Commune, Hoai Duc District of Ha Tay Province in Vietnam is got raising, which is the production of piglets between 8 to 30 kg, filling {{a gap between the}} sow/piglet and meat pig productions. A cluster of associated enterprises have developed around this got-based enterprise which include the got raisers, piglet suppliers, feed and medicine suppliers, veterinarian services, got collectors, and manure collectors. The relationships with these associated enterprises form the basis of the complex enterprise strategies of the got raisers, which strive to balance a complex set of issues of feed, growth, season, disease control, labour, credit, and marketing in order to ensure the profitability and sustainability of the enterprise. The got are fed a rice-based diet, with occasional protein concentrate to speed up growth for seasons when got prices are high; while inferior feed is given when there is a glut in the market. Disease control is as much related to management as it is to marketing strategy and labour requirements. To sell the whole lot of got yields lower profit and leads to uneven labour requirements, but it provides the opportunity for thorough cleaning of the pig pens and a break in disease; both contribute to better health condition. Selling got on credit fosters relationships with the collectors, but also creates a cash flow problem which in turn is passed on to the feed suppliers who then must sell feed to got raisers on credit. The in-depth analysis of this complex set of interrelated issues provides the basis for elaborating an <b>enterprise</b> <b>plan</b> to improve the system. One research activity that has been completed is a trial on maize substitution for rice and the results showed significant improvement in growth rate (372 vs. 332 g/day of daily weight gain), reduced feed cost (6, 013 vs. 7, 654 vnd/kg weight gain - USD 1 = 15, 400 vnd -), and higher profit (78, 611 vs. 51, 032 vnd per got).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to develop a}} portable, eye-safe, ground-based ozone lidar instrument specialized for ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measurements in the troposphere. This research project directly supports the goal of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise to understand the distribution and budget of tropospheric ozone (objective 1. 5 of the Earth Science Strategic <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Plan,</b> 1998 - 2002). It can participate in ground validation experiments for TES, a tropospheric ozone satellite mission due to be launched in 2002. It can also be utilized for correlative ground measurements in future GTE (Global Tropospheric Experiment) and space-based ozone lidar missions, such as ORACLE. Multiple ground-based ozone lidar systems would improve the data obtained through current ozone-sonde networks. This prototype instrument could to serve as the basic unit for these and other future monitoring projects requiring multi-instrument networks, such as that proposed for the Global Tropospheric Ozone Project (GTOP). GTOP is currently being formulated by a scientific panel of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project to meet its goal to better understand the processes that control the global distribution of tropospheric ozone. In order for the lidar to be widely deployed in networks, it must be fairly easy to use and maintain as well as being cost-competitive with a ground station launching ozonesondes several times a day. A second 2 -year grant to continue this effort with students participating in ground tests and system improvements has been awarded by the Office of Equal Employment Opportunities (OEOP). This project also supports existing NASA lidar missions through its development of advanced, compact lidar technology. Innovations in both transmitters and receivers have been made in this project. Finally, this system could be modified in the future to probe more deeply into the stratosphere. This could be accomplished by increasing the emitted energy or optimizing the wavelengths for this purpose. In addition to NASA, this system has applications to the EPA, NOAA, and the DOD. An AFOSR grant has been awarded {{based on the results of}} this effort to fund advanced transmitter development at medium (20 - 40 mJ) energies. A second proposal to the DOD with a letter of support from Air Force Research Laboratory, has been submitted to extend this uv laser technology to 100 mJ levels. Thus, this project has enabled students and faculty at Hampton University to begin to develop research efforts in support of the mission of the DOD. This instrument will be based at Hampton University (HU) to meet our educational goal to train students in lidar technology as well as atmospheric ozone data analysis and interpretation. It will be also available for off-site measurement campaigns and will serve as a test bed for further instrument development. Later development beyond this grant to extend the scientific usefulness of the instrument may include incorporation of an aerosol channel and upgrading the laser to make stratospheric ozone measurements.
