Based on plans committed to by DOE in the Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site in 1992, ground water cleanup was predicted to take 61 years. What began as conventional pump and treat has evolved into an effective Engineered Plume Collapse strategy that employs a well-stocked tool box of remediation technologies, processes, and methodologies. This �tool box� approach has proven effective in solving the vexing problem of restoring the chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) contaminated aquifers beneath the site. The Engineered Plume Collapse strategy {{has been used to}} hydraulically control the plumes on the western and southern boundaries of the site, doubled the pounds of CVOC removed from the subsurface compared to predictions in the ROD plans, and �collapsed� offsite plumes. The three major components of the Engineered Plume Collapse strategy are: (1) collection and use of historical and current chemical and hydrogeologic data to accurately identify areas of contamination in the subsurface and guide decisions about on-going remediation needs, (2) design, construction and operation of small, portable, and inexpensive ground water treatment units to <b>implement</b> <b>pump</b> and treat and collapse contaminant plumes back to their source areas, and (3) effective use of more energetic contaminant mass removal technologies in source areas, such as chemical oxidation, reductive dehalogenation, steam stripping, and electro-osmosis...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2002 Hot {{water used}} in the South African {{domestic}} sector is mostly heated by in-tank electrical resistance heaters. These so-called "geysers" are the major contributors to the undesirable high morning and afternoon peaks imposed on the national electricity supply grid. These peak demands continue to be of concern to Eskom. The "reduced capacity in-line water heating system design methodology" was developed to address this problem. A parallel inline heat pump water heater further reduces the electrical energy required. This paper employs a detailed statistical thermo-fluid simulation model to investigate the potential impact on the national peak electrical demand if this methodology is extensively applied in the domestic sector. The results will show that in certain areas of South Africa employing a micro heat pump for domestic hot water is a viable economic proposition. The coastal regions with the higher wet bulb temperatures and mild winter temperature fall in this category. The inland regions with their prolonged subzero temperatures requires {{a different approach to}} the standard way of using heat <b>pumps.</b> <b>Implementing</b> heat <b>pumps</b> for domestic use will also reduce the peak demand on the supply grid.

Excited state wavepackets were prepared in the spectroscopically complex, electronically mixed (B 3 ̆ 03) 1 B 1 /(3) 1 A 2, Clements manifold following broadband excitation at a range of photon energies between 4. 03 eV and 4. 28 eV (308 nm and 290 nm, respectively). The resulting wavepacket dynamics were monitored using a multiphoton ionisation probe. The extensive literature associated with the Clements bands has been summarised and a detailed time domain description of the ultrafast relaxation pathways occurring from the optically bright (B 3 ̆ 03) 1 B 1 diabatic state is presented. Signatures of the oscillatory motion on the (B 3 ̆ 03) 1 B 1 /(3) 1 A 2 lower adiabatic surface responsible for the Clements band structure were observed. The recorded spectra also indicate that {{a component of the}} excited state wavepacket undergoes intersystem crossing from the Clements manifold to the underlying triplet states on a sub-picosecond time scale. Photoelectron signal growth time constants have been predominantly associated with intersystem crossing to the (c 3 ̆ 03) 3 B 2 state and were measured to vary between 750 and 150 fs over the <b>implemented</b> <b>pump</b> photon energy range.

The influence of the pump on systemic hemodynamics, LV energetic parameters, and wall stress was evaluated in continuous and synchronous pulsatile modes of operation. For the continuous mode simulations, the influence of heart rate, LV contractility, and pump speed was assessed in a parametric study. For the pulsatile mode, different onsets of a synchronous time-varying pump speed pattern were tested. Our data indicate that the effectiveness of unloading in continuous mode depends on the contractility of the native ventricle. Hypocontractile ventricles are most easily unloaded, while ventricles with moderate contractility require high continuous pump speeds to achieve notable unloading. In pulsatile mode, the pump timing is an important determinant of pump/cardiovascular system interaction, with a counterpulsation setting yielding the best unloading. status: publishe...|$|R

The SESAM plays two key roles: it starts and stabilizes the mode-locking operation and is simultaneously used as an actuator to control the CEO frequency.
