50|$|Acourtia microcephala is a bushy {{perennial}} herb producing several erect {{stems from}} a woody caudex up to about 1.5 meters in maximum height. The stems branch toward the ends and are densely foliated in toothed, wavy-edged, glandular leaves 2 to 15 centimeters long. The stems and leaves are sticky with exudate. The inflorescences contain clusters of many flower heads, each cylindrical head wrapped in long, flat glandular phyllaries. The flower heads are discoid, containing only disc florets and no ray florets. Each <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> has two lips, the outer of which is long, flat, and usually bright pink, and easily mistaken for a ligule. The fruit is a glandular achene a few millimeters long which has a pappus of bristles up to a centimeter in length.|$|E
30|$|At harvesting, {{the numbers}} of undeveloped ovules, {{immature}} and mature achenes were counted.

In its capitulum, the hermaphroditic disc florets {{opened in}} centripetal sequence, and the duration from the blooming {{of the first}} <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> to the last <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> is about 3 – 4  days (Huang et al. 2012). Therefore, hand pollination was conducted once a day consecutively for 3 or 4  days {{during the period of}} anthesis. To prevent the deposition of non-target pollen grains, the capitula assigned as pollen receivers were wrapped in fine nylon-mesh netting bags (7  ×  9  cm) as soon as their first disc florets opened until all disc florets on each capitulum withered. The capitula assigned as pollen donors were also wrapped into the netting bags to prevent contamination of pollen grains from other species.|$|E
40|$|Aster tianmenshanensis G. J. Zhang & T. G. Gao, a {{new species}} of Asteraceae from {{southern}} China is described and illustrated based on evidence from morphology, micromorphology and molecular phylogeny. The new species is superficially similar to Aster salwinensis Onno in having rosettes of spatulate leaves and a solitary, terminal capitulum, but it differs by its glabrous leaf margins, unequal <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> lobes and 1 -seriate pappus. The molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on nuclear sequences ITS, ETS and chloroplast sequence trnL-F, showed that the new species was nested within the genus Aster and formed a well supported clade with Aster verticillatus (Reinw.) Brouillet et al. The new species differs from the latter in having unbranched stems, much larger capitula, unequal <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> lobes, beakless achenes and persistent pappus. In particular, A. tianmenshanensis has very short stigmatic lines, only ca. 0. 18 mm long and less than 1 / 3 {{of the length of}} sterile style tip appendages, remarkably different from its congeners. This type of stigmatic line, as far as we know, has not been found in any other species of Aster. The very short stigmatic lines plus the unequal <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> lobes imply that the new species may have a very specialized pollination system, which may be a consequence of habitat specialization. The new species grows only on the limestone cliffs of Mt. Tianmen, Hunan Province, at the elevation of 1400 m. It could only be accessed when a plank walkway was built across the cliffs for tourists. As it is known only from an area estimated at less than 10 km 2 and a walkway passes through this location, its habitat could be easily disturbed. This species should best be treated as Critically Endangered based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Categories and Criteria B 2 a...|$|E

40|$|The pseudanthium of {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) {{consists of}} two floret types: zygomorphic sterile ray florets and actinomorphic hermaphrodite disc florets. In the tubular ray flower (turf) mutant, the loss-of-function of a CYCLOIDEA (CYC) gene generates hermaphrodite tubular-like ray florets that replace the normal sterile ray florets. We evaluated whether tubular-like ray florets have a multifaceted set of floral traits {{and the presence of}} heteromorphic seeds in the turf inflorescence. During early stages of floral ontogeny, primordia of both tubular-like ray florets and typical ray florets displayed a comparable shape. In contrast, during later stages of development, the form of tubular-like ray floret primordia was most similar to <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> primordia. In mature tubular-like ray florets, corolla and ovary had both ray and <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> characteristics but also displayed distinct identity traits. In open-pollinated tubular-like ray florets, the seed set was low, but a noteworthy increase of filled achenes was obtained by hand pollination. Wild type ray achenes were always empty. Embryos of tubular-like ray florets were shorter and lighter than the embryos of disc florets but able to produce fertile plants. In conclusion, the different identity characteristics combined in tubular-like ray florets of the mutant evolved a capitulum type not described in the genus Helianthus...|$|E

Significant variations in pollen/ovule ratio and <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> numbers per capitulum were only found in var. radiata but not in var. minor and var. pilosa (Huang and Kao 2014).

40|$|AbstractArctotis sect. Anomalae was {{originally}} circumscribed to include three annual species (A. dregei, A. setosa and A. sulcocarpa) endemic to South Africa. Subsequently, discrimination of A. dregei and A. sulcocarpa became confused {{and application of}} the names has varied. In this paper, the circumscription of the two species is clarified and lectotypes designated for both names. The identity of A. setosa is less certain. The type of A. setosa, {{likely to have been}} lodged in the Berlin-Dahlem herbarium, has not been traced and no duplicates have been located. However, from the description and illustration of an achene in the original publication, A. setosa was almost certainly based on an element of the Arctotheca calendula species complex and is excluded from Arctotis sect. Anomalae. During examination of herbarium specimens {{in the course of this}} study, it became clear that an additional, previously unnamed species belonging to A. sect. Anomalae should be recognized, which is formally described here. The new species, Arctotis dimorphocarpa, differs from A. dregei and A. sulcocarpa in possessing pistillate ray florets, but is placed in sect.

40|$|A {{synopsis}} {{of the southern}} African members of the genera Dicoma Cass. and Macledium Cass. (family Asteraceae, subfamily Cichorioidiae, tribe Mutiseae, subtribe Gochnatiinae) is presented. The most recent monograph of Dicoma was done by Wilson (1923). It included 34 species, of which 17 are southern African, The southern African species were last treated by Harvey (1865). Traditionally Dicoma included 50 to 65 species, of which 23 occur in southern Africa. Ortiz (2001) reinstated the genus Macledium Cass., which was first described by Cassini (1825), following a phylogenetic study of Dicoma and related genera (Ortiz, 2000). The species previously belonging to sections Macledium and Pterocoma of the genus Dicoma have been transferred to the genus Macledium by Ortiz (2001). In this study, characters relating to morphology of the involucral bracts, <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> cuticle ornamentation, type of pappus {{and the type of}} achenes are used to distinguish the two genera. Differences were found between the grassland species and Cape species of Macledium. Type of florets in the capitulum and pappus morphology are used to distinguish sections within Dicoma sensu stricto. Characters such as habit, leaf morphology, shape and size of the capitulum, involucral bracts vestiture and details of the pappus could be reliably used to distinguish species. The genus Dicoma now consists of about 35 species, of which 16 species and two subspecies occur in southern Africa. Four informal groups of D. anomala subsp. anomala, two of D. anomala subsp. gerrardii as well as two of D. montana are recognized to accommodate infraspecific variation. Macledium comprises about 20 species, of which seven species, three subspecies and three varieties occurr in this region. M. spinosum is divided into two informal forms and a new combination, Macledium zeyheri subsp. zeyheri var. thyrsiflorum, is made. In view of the above, a comprehensive taxonomic revision of all the southern African taxa was done. Morphological and anatomical data were used to investigate relationships among the species of Dicoma sensu stricto, using the genus Macledium as the sister group. A phylogenetic analysis of Macledium was also done to investigate relationships between the grassland species and the Cape species. The taxonomic treatment includes the nomenclature, synonymy, diagnostic characters, uses, common names (where possible) and geographical distribution for all southern African taxa belonging to the two genera. Keys to the genera, sections, species and subspecies are provided and the diagnostic characters of the two genera are illustrated. Prof. B. E. van Wy...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{research}} project were to identify the various insects observed to visit inflorescences of Echinacea angustifolia DC, and to rank these visitors according to their importance as pollinators of E. angustifolia in Saskatchewan. Studying nectar and the nectary is essential to understanding the interaction of disc florets with pollinators. Nectar-sugar production by disc florets of E. angustifolia and E. purpurea (L. Moench) was quantified from anthesis to cessation with production per <b>disc</b> <b>floret</b> peaking in {{the afternoon of the}} staminate phase (191. 7 µg) and at midday of {{the first day of the}} pistillate phase (156. 6 µg), respectively. Morphology of the disc-like floral nectaries of both Echinacea species was studied, as well as the ultrastructure of the nectary of E. purpurea. Modified stomata on the nectary rim are the most likely exits for nectar, but creases in the epidermis may also participate. The nectary of E. purpurea is vascularized by phloem alone, which occurred adjacent to the epidermis. Companion cells possessed wall ingrowths, and these cells may unload arriving sugar destined for either an apoplastic or symplastic pathway. Lobed nuclei were a key feature of secretory parenchyma cells, as was a predominance of mitochondria, suggesting that energy-requiring eccrine secretion predominates in E. purpurea. E. angustifolia exhibited a generalist pollination system, with pollinating insects belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. The pollination efficiency of visitors was determined by single insect visits to bagged, virgin inflorescences followed by quantifying pollen tubes at the bases of receptive styles and/or calculating the percentage of shrivelled styles. It was determined that bumble bees (Bombus spp.) were efficient pollinators, indicating that they would likely contribute much to the pollination of E. angustifolia. Grasshopper bee flies (Systoechus vulgaris Loew) were plentiful but individually were not efficient pollinators, but taken together, they provided much pollination. Golden blister beetles (Epicauta ferruginea Say) were efficient pollinators but where yellow-petalled flowers occurred, their numbers on E. angustifolia decreased. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were efficient pollinators and were present in low numbers without managed introduction. Pierid (2003) butterflies were regular visitors and efficient pollinators, and likely contributed significantly to E. angustifolia pollination. When introduced, the alfalfa leafcutter bee (Megachile rotundata Fabr.) preferred not to forage on E. angustifolia and as such, these solitary bees were not suitable as managed pollinators. In large agricultural plantings of E. angustifolia, however, native insects may not be capable of providing sufficient pollination for seed production when floral competition occurs...|$|E
