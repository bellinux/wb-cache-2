5|$|Goebel died of {{his wounds}} on February 3, 1900. Leaders {{from both parties}} drafted an {{agreement}} whereby Taylor and his Lieutenant Governor, John Marshall, would step down from their respective offices, allowing Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, to assume the governorship; in exchange, Taylor and Marshall would receive immunity from prosecution in any actions they may have taken with regard to Goebel's assassination. The militia would withdraw from Frankfort, and the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law</b> would be repealed and replaced with a fairer <b>election</b> <b>law.</b> Despite his allies' insistence, Taylor refused to sign the agreement.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Johnson was one {{of three}} contenders for the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor. In the primary, he received more votes than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright, but a newly enacted <b>election</b> <b>law</b> required a runoff if no candidate received a majority. On September 7, Johnson defeated Wise in the runoff.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} in Bowling Green on August 26. Because {{of his age}} and ill health, he made {{no more than one}} speech per week. Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning the sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law</b> as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{served on}} the board of {{trustees}} for the University of Kentucky from 1935 to 1946. In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As a result of a mandatory primary <b>election</b> <b>law</b> passed in 1935, the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a nominating convention, as was typical for the party. Cooper garnered only 36% of the vote in the primary, losing the nomination to King Swope, a Lexington circuit court judge and former congressman.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a change}} in <b>election</b> <b>law</b> {{approved}} by Jersey City voters at the end of 2016, mayoral elections will now take place in November, with the next election scheduled for November 2017. Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although current law prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending at the end of 2017. The winner of the November 2017 mayoral election will take office January 1, 2018.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black voters and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also charged that Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law,</b> which Taylor claimed subverted {{the will of the}} people.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W. Beckham, {{challenged}} {{the results of}} the 1899 election in the General Assembly, per the state constitution. All the candidates for the state's minor offices contested as well. Bradley and his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the legal team that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged the legality of the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law</b> and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Taylor secured just 2,383 more votes than Goebel. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly {{challenged}} the election results. Under the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law,</b> a three-man Board of Elections (dominated by Democrats) were {{to review the}} results and certify the winner in the contest. Two {{of the members of}} the board had openly campaigned for Goebel, and all three owed their appointments to him, but in a surprising decision, the board voted 2—1 to certify Taylor as the winner.|$|E
5|$|Representatives from 108 of Kentucky's 120 {{counties}} {{attended the}} convention. Among the attendees were {{the editors of}} the Lexington Herald, Louisville Evening Post, and Louisville Dispatch, former congressman Owens, former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives Harvey Myers, Jr., and political bosses William Mackoy, John Whallen, and Theodore Hallam. The convention nominated an entire slate of candidates for state office, with former governor Brown at the head. They also put forward a platform condemning the Music Hall Convention, the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law,</b> and the presidential administration of William McKinley.|$|E

Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Days later, the Democratic-dominated General Assembly convened in Frankfort. They claimed the power to decide disputed elections, and formed a partisan commission (ten Democrats and one Republican) to examine the election results.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} <b>election</b> <b>law</b> came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
5|$|With Goebel dead, Democrats and Republicans met jointly and {{drafted a}} {{proposal}} to bring peace. Under terms of the proposal, Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall, would step down from their offices and be granted immunity from prosecution in the events surrounding the election and Goebel's assassination. The Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law</b> would be repealed, and the militia would disperse from Frankfort. Prominent leaders on both sides signed the agreement, but on February 10, 1900, Taylor announced he would not. The legislature convened on February 19, 1900 and agreed to put the election {{in the hands of}} the courts.|$|E

As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law,</b> authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} phases of registration, 150 parties were {{registered}} with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission. This reduction from the 48 parties that stood in the 1999 legislative election was largely attributed to new an <b>election</b> <b>law</b> that allowed only parties that had won two percent of seats in the DPR, or three percent of seats in provincial and regental legislatures in half of the provinces {{to stand in the}} 2004 election. Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E

The state militia would withdraw from Frankfort, and the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law</b> would be repealed and replaced with a fairer law. Despite the agreement of his allies, Taylor refused to sign the agreement. He did, however, lift the ban on the General Assembly meeting in Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, Taylor {{was elected}} Attorney General of Kentucky, and served until 1899. During his term, state senator William Goebel {{proposed}} an <b>election</b> <b>law</b> {{that created a}} state Board of Elections which was empowered to appoint all election officers in every county and certify all election results. The board was to be appointed by the General Assembly, {{and there were no}} requirements that its composition be bi-partisan. The law was widely seen as a power play by Goebel, designed to ensure Democratic victories in state elections, including Goebel's own anticipated run for governor. The law passed the General Assembly, but was vetoed by Republican governor William O. Bradley. The General Assembly promptly overrode the veto. As attorney general, Taylor opined that the bill was unconstitutional. The measure was adjudicated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals and found to be constitutional.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Kentucky General Assembly {{enacted a}} law which created a Board of Election Commissioners, {{appointed}} by the General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties. The board was empowered to examine election returns and certify the results. The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with the General Assembly under Section 153 of the state constitution. The law was {{commonly referred to as}} the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law,</b> a reference to its sponsor, President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate William Goebel. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election, the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1898, Senate President Pro Tem William Goebel {{sponsored}} a measure later {{referred to as}} the Goebel <b>Election</b> <b>Law.</b> The bill created a Board of Election Commissioners, appointed by the General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties. The board was empowered to examine election returns and rule on the results. The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with the General Assembly, pursuant to Section 153 of the state constitution. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election, the bill was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving, even by some Democrats. Nevertheless, Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Bradley's veto, making the bill law.|$|E

50|$|The 2005 Basic Law {{amendment}} fixes {{a four-year}} term for both President and Parliament, while the 2005 <b>Elections</b> <b>Law</b> (Art. 2) determines that both are elected simultaneously. But a half {{year before the}} laws were signed, President Arafat had died, and Mahmoud Abbas was elected President, whereas the old parliament remained in function. To synchronize both terms, the lawmakers chose to stick the Presidential elections on the elections of the second Legislative Council (<b>Elections</b> <b>Law</b> Art. 111). Contrary to the <b>Elections</b> <b>Law,</b> no Presidential <b>elections</b> took place but instead Abbas, elected in 2005, remained in function. Nathan Brown argued that it was, in theory, a single election held on two different dates. However, it is debatable whether Abbas' first term started in 2005 or in 2006, while he took the presidential oath in January 2005. Elections for the second Legislative Council were on 25 January 2006. According to the law, the four-year term of both President and Parliament would thus start at that date (2005 <b>Elections</b> <b>Law,</b> Art. 2).|$|R
