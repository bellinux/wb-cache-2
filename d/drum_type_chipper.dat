40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{shear force}} in the {{shearing}} process of the <b>drum</b> <b>type</b> linear blade flying shear is done. Two different approaches were taken to establish the shear force formula, and then the finite element simulation. The comparison results of the calculated values and simulated values {{can be seen that}} as the thickness increases, the maximum shear force calculated by the pure shear force formula increases rapidly, the shear force calculated by the energy release rate formula is relatively small, and the finite element simulation values and calculated values close to each other when the plate thickness is small. The derived formula in this paper not only can be applied to complex engineering problems, but also has provided a theoretical basis for <b>drum</b> <b>type</b> linear blade flying shears on the shear force calculations and equipment design...|$|R

40|$|Developments of {{computer}} technology and image processing have shifted conventional industrial radiography application to industrial digital radiography (IDR) system. In this study, two types of IDR modules for non destructive testing (NDT), namely drum- and laser- type film digitizer with 50 ?m pixel pitch have been evaluated for NDT applications. The modulation transfer function (MTF) and noise power spectrum (NPS) measurement were adapted to evaluate the image quality of IDR images. Results shown the averaged MTF for drum- and laser- type film digitizer at 20 % modulation were 6. 15 cycles/mm and 6. 55 cycles/mm respectively.

40|$|The study {{compared}} {{the effect of}} <b>chipper</b> <b>type</b> on productivity, power demand, fuel consumption and product quality. Tests were conducted on two commercial chipper models, a disc and a drum chipper. Both chippers had the same diameter capacity, were applied to the same tractor and fed with the same feedstock types. Fifteen replications were conducted per machine and for each of four different feedstock types, reaching a total of 120 tests. The disc chipper had a higher energy efficiency and used 19 % less fuel per unit product, possibly due to its simpler design, integrating comminuting and discharge system in one synergic device. In contrast, the drum chipper was 8 % more productive, since it cut with the same energy all {{along the length of}} its knives. The drum chipper produced smaller chips, with a higher incidence of fines. Feedstock type had a strong effect on productivity, energy efficiency and product quality. The effect of feedstock type was mainly related to piece size, and may be stronger than the effect of <b>chipper</b> <b>type.</b> Further studies should determine the effect of blade wear on the relative performance of the two <b>chipper</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility study to improve thermal loading of existing radioactive material packages by using heat pipes. The concept {{could be used}} to channel heat in certain directions and dissipate to the environment. The concept is applied to a <b>drum</b> <b>type</b> package because the <b>drum</b> <b>type</b> packages are stored and transported in an upright position. This orientation is suitable for heat pipe operation that could facilitate the heat pipe implementation in the existing well proven package designs or in new designs where thermal loading is high. In this position, heat pipes utilize gravity very effectively to enhance heat flow in the upward direction Heat pipes have extremely high effective thermal conductivity that is several magnitudes higher than the most heat conducting metals. In addition, heat pipes are highly unidirectional so that the effective conductivity for heat transfer in the reverse direction is greatly reduced. The concept is applied to the 9977 package that is currently going through the DOE certification review. The paper presents computer simulations using typical off-the-shelf heat pipe available configurations and performance data for the 9977 package. A path forward is outlined for implementing the concepts for further study and prototype testing...|$|R
