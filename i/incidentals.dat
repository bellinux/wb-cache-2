Natural history of <b>incidental</b> PE remains unclear. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of <b>incidental</b> PE, to assess potential factors associated with <b>incidental</b> PE, and to evaluated its clinical history. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE databases (up to January 2009). Study Selection: Studies were included if the prevalence of <b>incidental</b> PE was assessed using CT scanning. Data Extraction: The prevalence of <b>incidental</b> PE in these patients was documented. Separate data for inpatients and outpatients and according to the reason for CT scanning were collected. Weighted mean proportion of the prevalence of <b>incidental</b> PE was calculated. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to test the association with potential predictors of <b>incidental</b> PE. Results: Twelve studies for a total of more than 10 thousand patients were included. The weighted mean prevalence of <b>incidental</b> PE was 2. 6 % (95 % CI 1. 9, 3. 4). Hospitalization at the time of CT scanning and the presence of cancer were associated with a significantly increased risk of <b>incidental</b> PE (OR 4. 27 and OR 1. 80 respectively). Conclusions: The prevalence of <b>incidental</b> PE is clinically relevant. Future studies are necessary to properly evaluate the clinical history of these patients. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{examined}} the frequency and nature of <b>incidental</b> findings seen on computed tomography (CT) scans during preoperative and postoperative follow-up in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsBetween January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2006, 176 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients {{were included in the}} study if all preoperative and postoperative surveillance CT scans were performed at our institution. Eighty-two patients, 26 women (32 %) and 56 men (68 %), met this criterion. Their mean age was 76 years (range, 51 - 103 years). Official CT scan reports were reviewed. Findings were considered primary <b>incidental</b> if they were noted on preoperative CT scans and secondary <b>incidental</b> if they appeared on surveillance CT scans but not on the preoperative study. Primary and secondary <b>incidental</b> findings were considered either benign (eg, gallstones, diverticulosis) or clinically significant if they warranted further workup (eg, suspicious masses or changes suggestive of malignancy, internal or diaphragmatic hernias, and diverticulitis). The median follow-up was 29 months (range, 3 - 60 months). Each <b>incidental</b> finding was counted only once, on the first scan in which it appeared. ResultsOf the 82 patients, 73 (89 %) had at least one primary <b>incidental</b> finding, and 14 (19 %) of these were clinically significant. Secondary <b>incidental</b> findings, many of which were clinically significant, continued to appear throughout the follow-up period. The most common clinically significant primary <b>incidental</b> finding was the presence of a lung mass (n = 4). The most common clinically significant secondary <b>incidental</b> findings were lung mass (n = 6), liver mass (n = 6), and pancreas mass (n = 3). There was {{a significant difference in the}} proportion of men to women in the group with clinically significant <b>incidental</b> findings vs the group without clinically significant <b>incidental</b> findings (P =. 03959). Differences between the groups with respect to age or aneurysm size were not significant. ConclusionCT scans yielded surprisingly large numbers of both primary and secondary <b>incidental</b> findings, many of which were clinically significant.

40|$|There are 38. 000 {{multiple}} trauma patients in Germany every year, of whom 71 [*]% undergo whole-body computed tomography {{in the emergency}} room. This examination is fast and has a high diagnostic sensitivity. Additionally to the traumatic injuries, <b>incidental</b> findings are revealed. In this thesis, number, severity, and distribution of the <b>incidental</b> findings were analysed, and tested for age and sex dependency. Furthermore, communication of the radiology reports and the accounting in selected cases were analysed. Methods All patients who were admitted to the surgical emergency room at Charité Campus Virchow Klinikum and underwent a whole-body computed tomography between 2009 and 2013 were included in this study. The radiology reports of the whole-body CTs were reviewed for <b>incidental</b> findings, which then were categorised in four severity degrees. The anatomic regions head, neck, thorax, abdomen/pelvis, and musculoskeletal system were differentiated. To check for age and sex dependency of <b>incidental</b> findings, several statistical methods were applied. The discharge letters were reviewed for inclusion of the radiology report. If not yet considered in the DRG, <b>incidental</b> findings were included in a simulation in selected cases to re-calculate the financial revenue. Results In total, 2. 571 patients with 6. 053 <b>incidental</b> findings were included. Of these <b>incidental</b> findings, 343 were classified as the most severe category 1 and 1. 418 as the second most severe category 2. The most <b>incidental</b> findings were revealed in the abdomen (2. 554), followed by the thorax (1. 276). Patients with a higher count and more severe <b>incidental</b> findings were significantly older than patients with fewer and less severe <b>incidental</b> findings. Overall, there was no sex dependency of the number and severity of the <b>incidental</b> findings. A complete radiology report was included in 11. 6 [*]%, an incomplete report in 10. 2 [*]%, and no report was included in 78. 2 [*]% of the discharge letters. Conclusion <b>Incidental</b> findings are regularly revealed by whole-body computed tomography.

Group A included 26 patients with <b>incidental</b> parathyroidectomy and group B included 181 patients without <b>incidental</b> parathyroidectomy. The parathyroid tissue in the resected specimens was found in intrathyroid (57. 7 %), extrathyroid (23. 1 %) and central node compartment (19. 2 %) sites. On multivariate analysis, two factors sustained their significance independently; reoperation for recurrent goitre (p= 0. 001) and concomitant central neck dissection (p= 0. 001).

60|$|Whereas, {{the larger}} and more {{expansive}} portrait in the great drawing-room, taken {{in the prime of}} life; during the best and rosiest days of their wedded union; at the particular desire of my mother; and by a celebrated artist of her own election, and costumed after her own taste; and on all hands considered to be, by those who know, a singularly happy likeness at the period; a belief spiritually reinforced by my own dim infantile remembrances; for all these reasons, this drawing-room portrait possesses an inestimable charm to her; there, she indeed beholds her husband as he had really appeared to her; she does not vacantly gaze upon an unfamiliar phantom called up from the distant, and, to her, well-nigh fabulous days of my father's bachelor life. But in that other portrait, she sees rehearsed to her fond eyes, the latter tales and legends of his devoted wedded love. Yes, I think now that I plainly see it must be so. And yet, ever new conceits come vaporing up in me, as I look on the strange chair-portrait: which, though so very much more unfamiliar to me, than it can possibly be to my mother, still sometimes seems to say--Pierre, believe not the drawing-room painting; that is not thy father; or, at least, is not all of thy father. Consider in thy mind, Pierre, whether we two paintings may not make only one. Faithful wives are ever over-fond to a certain imaginary image of their husbands; and faithful widows are ever over-reverential to a certain imagined ghost of that same imagined image, Pierre. Look again, I am thy father as he more truly was. In mature life, the world overlays and varnishes us, Pierre; the thousand proprieties and polished finenesses and grimaces intervene, Pierre; then, we, as it were, abdicate ourselves, and take unto us another self, Pierre; in youth we are, Pierre, but in age we seem. Look again. I am thy real father, so much the more truly, as thou thinkest thou recognizest me not, Pierre. To their young children, fathers are not wont to unfold themselves entirely, Pierre. There are a thousand and one odd little youthful peccadilloes, that we think we may as well not divulge to them, Pierre. Consider this strange, ambiguous smile, Pierre; more narrowly regard this mouth. Behold, what is this too ardent and, as it were, unchastened light in these eyes, Pierre? I am thy father, boy. There was once a certain, oh, but too lovely young Frenchwoman, Pierre. Youth is hot, and temptation strong, Pierre; and in the minutest moment momentous things are irrevocably done, Pierre; and Time sweeps on, and the thing is not always carried down by its stream, but may be left stranded on its bank; away beyond, in the young, green countries, Pierre. Look again. Doth thy mother dislike me for naught? Consider. Do not all her spontaneous, loving impressions, ever strive to magnify, and spiritualize, and deify, her husband's memory, Pierre? Then why doth she cast despite upon me; and never speak to thee of me; and why dost thou thyself keep silence before her, Pierre? Consider. Is there no little mystery here? Probe a little, Pierre. Never fear, never fear. No matter for thy father now. Look, do I not smile?--yes, and with an unchangeable smile; and thus have I unchangeably smiled for many long years gone by, Pierre. Oh, it is a permanent smile! Thus I smiled to cousin Ralph; and thus in thy dear old Aunt Dorothea's parlor, Pierre; and just so, I smile here to thee, and even thus in thy father's later life, when his body may have been in grief, still--hidden away in Aunt Dorothea's secretary--I thus smiled as before; and just so I'd smile were I now hung up in the deepest dungeon of the Spanish Inquisition, Pierre; though suspended in outer darkness, still would I smile with this smile, though then not a soul should be near. Consider; for a smile is the chosen vehicle for all ambiguities, Pierre. When we would deceive, we smile; when we are hatching any nice little artifice, Pierre; only just a little gratifying our own sweet little appetites, Pierre; then watch us, and out comes the odd little smile. Once upon a time, there was a lovely young Frenchwoman, Pierre. Have you carefully, and analytically, and psychologically, and metaphysically, considered her belongings and surroundings, and all her <b>incidentals,</b> Pierre? Oh, a strange sort of story, that, thy dear old Aunt Dorothea once told thee, Pierre. I once knew a credulous old soul, Pierre. Probe, probe a little--see--there seems one little crack there, Pierre--a wedge, a wedge. Something ever comes of all persistent inquiry; we are not so continually curious for nothing, Pierre; not for nothing, do we so intrigue and become wily diplomatists, and glozers with our own minds, Pierre; and afraid of following the Indian trail from the open plain into the dark thickets, Pierre; but enough; a word to the wise.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of <b>incidental</b> pulmonary emboli (PE) detected on contrast enhanced CT performed {{for other reasons}} is approximately 2. 5 %. The treatment decisions based upon the discovery of <b>incidental</b> PE have been less well reported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to report the clinician's response to, and consequences of, the finding of <b>incidental</b> PE on contrast enhanced CT. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Patients with <b>incidental</b> PE detected on a contrast enhanced CT were retrospectively identified at a single institution between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009. Case note review was performed to assess clinicians' responses to this finding. Patients with synchronous venous thromboembolism, unrecognised symptoms or factors preventing response assessment were excluded from this analysis. Patient and PE characteristics, treatment, and outcomes related to treatment and non-treatment were recorded. RESULTS: There were 73 patients with <b>incidental</b> PE: 52 were in the proximal pulmonary arteries and 21 were distal. 16 patients were excluded from the treatment analysis. 52 of 57 (91. 2 %) patients were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. There were 2 (3. 8 %) serious adverse events related to treatment. 5 (8. 8 %) patients were not treated; 2 (40 %) developed recurrent venous thromboembolism. Treatment of <b>incidental</b> PE was not significantly associated with patient age, PE risk factors or PE location. A smaller proportion of single <b>incidental</b> PE were treated than multiple <b>incidental</b> PE (p= 0. 047).
