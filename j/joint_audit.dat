40|$|Audit {{markets are}} highly {{concentrated}} {{and such a}} situation might have negative consequences on competition, and thus, on price setting, on audit quality and on the functioning of markets. The European regulator recognized some causes for audit market concentration, identified a systemic risk and suggested <b>joint</b> <b>audits</b> and a mandatory rotation of audit firms to reduce concentration. Prominent concentration measures are concentration ratios, the Lorenz curve, the Gini-coefficient and the Herfindahl-Hirschman-Index. An empirical study on the concentration of German Prime Standard market for the period 2010 – 2013 revealed a high concentration which is quite stable over time and a narrow oligopoly with duopolistic tendencies. Nevertheless, competition could still work, e. g. due {{to the threat of}} market entrants. Moreover, given the fact that Big 4 audit firms provide a higher audit quality, concentration may have positive effects. The mandatory audit firm rotation has a positive effect on auditor independence and a negative effect on auditor competence. This explains why related research output is inconclusive, i. e. the total effect on audit quality remains unclear. Moreover, a positive impact on competition is not ensured. Archival studies reveal that <b>joint</b> <b>audits</b> do not improve audit quality but increase audit costs. On the other hand, <b>joint</b> <b>audits</b> potentially reduce concentration. A combination between audit firm rotation and <b>joint</b> <b>audits</b> might be an optimal solution. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|R
40|$|In {{their joint}} fight against tax {{avoidance}} and tax evasion, international governance organizations have developed different tools. One of these tools is the <b>joint</b> tax <b>audit,</b> {{in which two}} or more countries join {{together to form a}} single audit team to examine an issue(s) /transaction(s) of one or more related taxable persons with cross-border business activities. International governance organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union and the African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF), promote the use of <b>joint</b> tax <b>audits,</b> amongst others, as a tool in fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. The literature on this phenomenon mainly focuses on the advantages and obstacles of using the instrument, and the need to amend legislation. Moreover, in the literature, guidance for companies invited to participate in a <b>joint</b> tax <b>audit</b> can be found, as well as references to the few <b>joint</b> tax <b>audits</b> conducted and the results of a pilot project conducted by the Netherlands and Germany. The authors’ aim is to answer the question, “Which countries may benefit most from <b>joint</b> tax <b>audits</b> if the arguments raised in the tax literature are valid?”. The authors have identified eight arguments for <b>joint</b> tax <b>audits</b> (arguments (a) – (h), see sections 4. 1. and 5.) in the tax literature and have used sixteen different yardsticks (factors 1 – 16, see section 6.) to analyse which countries might benefit most. To make the research project manageable, the research focuses primarily on the situation faced by the European Union’s 28 Member States (hereinafter the “EU- 28 ”) and the 13 associated states. By combining arguments raised in the legal literature about <b>joint</b> <b>audits</b> with what public finance data tell us about, for example, tax compliance costs, the number of active taxpayers per administration employee, the number of mutual agreement procedures, tax compliance and tax moral levels, the authors analyse which of the EU- 28 and its associated states might benefit most from <b>joint</b> <b>audits</b> and for what reasons. The analysis strongly supports the international governance initiatives for a multilateral legislative framework on <b>joint</b> <b>audits.</b> As multinational legislation in this field should be drafted with great care, the authors call for more pilot projects with, as their aim, the sharing of know-how and building capacity. The authors also provide some recommendations {{for the development of the}} multinational legislative framework and urge tax authorities/the OECD/the European Union to publish statistics on the <b>joint</b> <b>audits</b> performed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>audit</b> {{addresses}} two underlying {{principles of}} audit quality: auditors’ competence and independence. It enables a benchmarking of audit approaches and affords audit committees {{the opportunity to}} pick and choose the best local firms from within two global audit networks. Audit committees and investors have additional assurance that the audit opinion with which they are presented is complete. A <b>joint</b> <b>audit</b> allows rotation of audit firms, and retains knowledge and understanding of group operations in a way that minimizes the disruption caused when a single audit firm is changed. The rotation of audit firms is equally likely to mitigate the risk of over familiarity. Two firms can also stand stronger together against aggressive accounting treatments. In this way, <b>joint</b> <b>audit</b> effectively becomes a guardian for audit quality. The benchmarking that takes place between the two firms raises the level of service quality.|$|E

50|$|Some critics {{believe that}} it is {{difficult}} for two firms, who outside of the <b>joint</b> <b>audit</b> are competitors, to easily co-operate with each other during the audit. The degree of co-operation, and its effectiveness, is essentially down to the spirit in which the two audit firms approach the <b>joint</b> <b>audit.</b> If they approach the audit with a willingness to work together to provide a company’s shareholders with what they truly value - namely confidence in the financial position of the company in which they are investing - communication will not be a problem.

50|$|A <b>joint</b> <b>audit</b> has {{a further}} benefit {{in that it}} can {{encourage}} more competition between audit firms. Despite {{the fact that two}} Big Four firms can still be used on a <b>joint</b> <b>audit,</b> there is an opportunity for companies to be more willing to engage other firms in the process. The Big Four then becomes the best seven or eight, as more firms are given the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities, while clients can retain a Big Four signature where they feel it is needed.

50|$|A <b>joint</b> <b>audit</b> is {{an audit}} on a legal entity (the auditee) {{by two or}} more {{auditors}} to produce a single audit report, thereby sharing responsibility for the audit. A typical <b>joint</b> <b>audit</b> has audit planning performed jointly and fieldwork allocated to the auditors. The auditors are typically not individuals, but auditing firms. This work allocation may be rotated after a set number of years to mitigate the risk of over-familiarity. Work performed by each auditor is reviewed by the other, in most cases by exchanging audit summary reports. The critical issues at group level, including group consolidation, are reviewed jointly and there is joint reporting to the legal entity's management, its audit committee, a government entity, or the general public.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidents}} of safety, labor and environmental violations {{in recent years}} have compelled many firms to rethink their approaches to managing suppliers. This paper investigates two cooperative approaches that are used in practice: auditing a common supplier jointly (2 ̆ 2 <b>joint</b> <b>auditing</b> 2 ̆ 2) and sharing independent audit results with other firms (2 ̆ 2 information sharing 2 ̆ 2). We develop a model based on a cooperative game in partition function form that captures both competitive and cooperative interactions among firms. Our analysis shows that, although there has been some concern about cooperation for fear of compromising a competitive advantage, firms have incentives to cooperate in managing their suppliers when the negative externality of one firm 2 ̆ 7 s social responsibility violation on other firms is high. However, when the negative externality is low, firms do not have incentives for <b>joint</b> <b>auditing</b> (unless audits are very costly), nor do they have incentives for information sharing. Our analysis further reveals that, contrary to common belief, neither cooperative approach necessarily improves social responsibility, especially when one firm can benefit from others 2 ̆ 7 social responsibility violations (i. e., the positive externality is high). This is because cooperation reduces competitive intensity among firms, who then underinvest in audits under the high positive externality. Finally, even if agreement is not reached for cooperation before conducting individual audits, social responsibility can still be improved by incentivizing firms with better information to share their private information with others. To facilitate such ex-post cooperation, we propose a profit-allocation scheme among firms, and specify the amount of subsidy a third-party organization should provide...|$|R
