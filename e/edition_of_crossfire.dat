50|$|The film's screenplay, {{written by}} John Paxton, {{was based on}} {{director}} and screenwriter Richard Brooks's 1945 novel The Brick Foxhole. Brooks wrote his novel {{while he was a}} sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps making training films at Quantico, Virginia and Camp Pendleton, California. In the novel, the victim was a homosexual. As told in the film The Celluloid Closet and in the documentary included on the DVD <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Crossfire</b> film, the Hollywood Hays Code prohibited any mention of homosexuality because it was seen as a sexual perversion. Hence, the book's theme of homophobia was changed to one about racism and anti-semitism. The book was published while Brooks was serving in the Marine Corps. A fellow Marine by the name of Robert Ryan met Brooks and told him he was determined to play in a version of the book on screen.|$|R
