In 1921 the locomotive was recorded as returning to Crewe from London as the pilot engine to a regular express. In 1925, Ahrons reports that {{it was still in}} service hauling the Mechanical Engineer's inspection coach.|$|E
60|$|This quickness of {{eyesight}} was altogether exceptional. Standing {{behind a}} gun--and knowing, therefore, the exact course the shot will take--it is comparatively {{easy for a}} quick-sighted man to follow it; but there are few, indeed, who can see a shot coming towards them. In this respect, the ear is a far better index than the eye. A person possessed of {{a fair amount of}} nerve can judge, to within a few yards, the line that a shot coming towards him will take. When first heard, the sound is as a faint murmur; increasing, as it approaches, to a sound resembling the blowing off of steam by an <b>express</b> <b>engine,</b> as it rushes through a station. At first, the keenest ear could not tell the direction in which the shot is travelling but, as it approaches, the difference in the angle becomes perceptible to the ear, and a calm listener will distinguish whether it will pass within twenty or thirty yards, to the right or left. It would require an extraordinary acute ear to determine more closely than this, the angle of flight being so very small, until the shot approaches almost within striking distance.|$|E

6000|$|Having {{finished}} his journey, John Marrot took his iron steed to the stable. Usually his day's work terminated at Clatterby; but, {{owing to the}} horse being in need of extra rest {{he had to stop}} in London that night. And no wonder that the Lightning was sometimes fatigued, for even an ordinary <b>express</b> <b>engine</b> on the Grand National Trunk Railway was wont to run over 270 miles of ground in a day, at the rate of about forty-five miles an hour, and with a dead weight of 120 tons, more or less, at her tail. This she did regularly, with two [...] "shed-days," [...] or days of rest, in the week for cleansing and slight repairs. Such an engine was considered to do good service if it ran 250 days in the year. But the engine of the [...] "Flying Dutchman" [...] was more highly favoured than other engines--probably on the ground of the principle taught by the proverb, [...] "It is the pace that kills." [...] Its regular run was 1,544 miles in the day, and assuredly it stood in need of repose and refreshment quite as much as ordinary horses do. Its joints had become relaxed with severe labour, its bolts had been loosened, its rubbing surfaces, despite the oil poured so liberally on them by Will Garvie, had become heated. Some of them, unequally expanded, strained and twisted; its grate-bars and fire-box had become choked with [...] "clinkers," [...] and its tubes charged with coke.|$|E

50|$|The Deutsche Reichsbahn {{took over}} the {{remaining}} 20 saturate steam engines as Class 17.4 (17 401-420) and had them converted to superheated locomotives in 1925. The remaining 24 superheated engines became Class 17.5 (17 501-524). In the meantime the S 3/5 was mainly used on passenger train duties in the Reichsbahndirektionen of Augsburg and Nuremberg, because enough modern <b>express</b> <b>engines</b> were now available.|$|R

50|$|Caledonian Railway Single No. 123 is a {{preserved}} Scottish steam locomotive. The unique 4-2-2 {{was built}} by Neilson and Company in 1886, works No. 3553, as an exhibition locomotive. In 1914 it {{was placed on the}} Caledonian Railway duplicate list, and renumbered 1123. It entered London, Midland and Scottish Railway service in 1923 and the LMS renumbered it 14010 and gave it the power classification 1P. During the 1920s it was allocated to working the directors' saloon, but it was returned to ordinary service in 1930. The locomotive was withdrawn in 1935, by which time it was the last single-wheeled <b>express</b> <b>engine</b> running in Britain, and set aside for preservation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1930s, high speed trains like the [...] "Flying Hamburger" [...] and {{streamlined}} steam engines with matching cars were developed. The Class 05 streamlined <b>express</b> <b>engine</b> reached a speed of 200.4 km/h. Before the Second World War the most important rail lines ran east and west. The most modern high speed lines were the Prussian Ostbahn which ran through the Polish corridor, the line from Berlin to Hamburg on which high speed diesel trains ran, the line from Hannover to the Ruhr, the line from Frankfurt am Main to southwest Germany, and the line from Berlin to Breslau (WrocÅaw).|$|E
50|$|The {{prototype}} for this class {{was named the}} Great Western and built in 1846. Named after the railway, {{it was designed to}} show how the 2-2-2 <b>express</b> <b>engines</b> could be improved; its 8 ft driving wheels were 1 ft larger than those of the successful Fire Fly class. It broke its leading axle after a short while in service and was subsequently rebuilt as a 4-2-2, becoming part of the Iron Duke class.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the arrival}} {{of large numbers of}} the AB class the As' were country's premier <b>express</b> <b>engines.</b> Starting in 1932 thirty-eight of the North Island engines went south. By this time they were being relegated to {{secondary}} and branch line service. Despite this the last North Island engine was not withdrawn until 1961 and the last in the south until 1969, near the end of steam. The final A class to be withdrawn was A 428.|$|R
2500|$|The longer {{wheelbase}} for {{the longer}} boiler produced problems in cornering. For his six-coupled engines, Stephenson removed the flanges from the centre pair of wheels. For his <b>express</b> <b>engines,</b> he shifted the trailing wheel {{to the front}} in the 4-2-0 formation, as in his [...] "Great A". There were other problems: the firebox was restricted in size or had to be mounted behind the wheels; and for improved stability most engineers believed that the centre of gravity should be kept low.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Dunalastair" [...] class {{marked a}} new era of {{development}} in late-Victorian British steam locomotive design. The average weight of passenger trains had greatly increased in the 1880s and 1890s due to the demand for more comfortable, better-appointed and safer carriages. Combined with continually rising passenger volumes and the competition between railway companies to offer faster services and locomotive engineers were faced with producing engines that could operate longer, heavier trains at faster speeds. The existing pattern of inside-cylinder 4-4-0 <b>express</b> <b>engine</b> was reaching the limits of its development and many railways were resorting to the inefficient practise of double heading to maintain schedules.|$|E
50|$|Around 30 steam {{locomotives}} may be seen, {{including a}} Bavarian S 3/6 <b>express</b> <b>engine,</b> a Bavarian PtL 2/2 (a tiny tank engine {{known as the}} Glaskasten, literally: 'glass box', the only complete surviving member of its class), a Prussian P 8 passenger train engine and a Saxon XIV HT. Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotives represented include Class 01, 03, 44, 50, 64, and 86 engines and there are Deutsche Bundesbahn Class 10 and 23 locomotives, as well as industrial engines. In addition there is a museum-owned narrow-gauge line on the land which is worked by steam and diesel locomotives.

The clown was also named [...] "Rollo" [...] and a sixth engine character, Doc, appeared briefly to recover the broken-down Georgia and thus tie up the hanging story-thread of what happened to the failed engine of the toy train, which all other versions leave unaddressed.|$|E

50|$|When the FS {{were created}} in 1905, Chief Mechanical Engineer Giuseppe Zara {{undertook}} a process to design of a standard range of locomotives; one of these was the Class 630, a light <b>express</b> <b>engine</b> which, together with the other designs, shared the features of being compound locomotives. However, with the diffusion in Germany (then in close ties with Italy because of the Triple Alliance) of the Schmidt superheater, a decision to build there a batch of 24 non-compound and superheated version of the Class 630 (keeping all the other features, including the Italian bogie and the peculiar inside-cylinders/outside valve chests and valve gear) was taken. Results were highly successful, and subsequently almost all steam locomotives in Italy would be built with simple expansion and superheating.|$|E
50|$|Boat trains {{commenced}} {{running to}} Harwich Parkeston Quay in 1882 and were timed at 1 hour 45 minutes from Liverpool Street. By 1895 this {{was down to}} 1 hour 30 minutes. In 1897 the 8:30 pm train was run as two separate trains - 8:30 pm for the Hook of Holland and 8:35 pm for Antwerp. With {{the introduction of the}} corridor restaurant cars in 1904, the time was eased to 87 minutes, but the introduction of the Cl.1500 4-6-0 <b>express</b> <b>engines</b> in 1912 saw a running time of 82 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The R class 4-4-0s {{represented}} {{a radical departure}} from previous WAGR locomotive design. The engines featured the largest diameter wheels of any WAGR locomotive at 1.45m, which allows for higher speeds at reduced power. Given the nature of WA's railways, however, this was not beneficial and the class saw limited service in their intended role as <b>express</b> <b>engines,</b> but continued to serve in country areas (such as around Northam) for many years. The class numbered 24 and were withdrawn in the mid-1920s when replaced by much larger locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Throughout its {{existence}} the London and North Western Railway re-used {{the numbers and}} names of withdrawn locomotives on new ones as {{they came out of}} Crewe Works. This resulted in each class of locomotives being allotted numbers virtually at random, with names that adhered to no discernible theme. By 1911 new locomotives were being produced at a much faster rate than old ones were being scrapped, and it became necessary to introduce a new set of names for Bowen Cookeâs 4-6-0 <b>express</b> <b>engines</b> which were beginning to enter service.|$|R
