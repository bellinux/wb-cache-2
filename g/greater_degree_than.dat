5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species of fig wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge to a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are {{unwilling or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2006, Origins was {{announced}} as in development by Climax Studios, instead of by Konami's Team Silent who had developed previous installments. The first previews {{of the game}} featured {{a departure from the}} third-person view typical of the series to a Resident Evil 4-style camera angle, and an emphasis on action and combat to a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> the previous installments in the series. In the previews, Travis had six weapons, divided equally between melee weapons and firearms. Additional changes included a laser sight for his pistol and an option for the player to barricade areas. At the time, the game was expected to be released in late 2006.|$|E

5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics to a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist {{or one of the}} first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the single-player game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by friendly non-player characters. Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information. However, Opposing Force also features fellow U.S. Marines who will assist the player in combat to a far <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> security guards. Three types of Marines are featured in the game: the soldier will simply provide fire support for the player with a submachine gun, shotgun or machine gun, the combat medic is capable of healing the player and other non-player characters, while the engineer can cut through doors and remove obstacles, allowing the player and their squad to proceed unhindered. A selection of enemies from Half-Life populate the game, including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between river flows and Murray cod recruitment {{are more complex}} than first thought, and in less regulated rivers, Murray cod {{may be able to}} recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E

25|$|Despite its name, the Staffordshire Terrier's {{ancestor}} (Bull and Terrier) {{was first}} bred {{in the nineteenth}} century in Birmingham, West Midlands, rather than in the English county of Staffordshire where it was then later bred.

25|$|The NDU {{book ends}} by {{suggesting}} that HTS {{be turned over to}} the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). There were a number of reasons the team suggested USASOC would be a better fit for HTS: TRADOC had been a prime cause of multiple programmatic problems for HTS throughout its history; the US military has a history of intentionally forgetting and deinstitutionalizing cultural programs; and the future operating environment would be utilizing Special Operations forces to a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> <b>than</b> regular Army/Marines units.|$|E

25|$|Deliberative indeterminism {{asserts that}} the indeterminism is {{confined}} to an earlier stage in the decision process. This is intended to provide an indeterminate set of possibilities to choose from, while not risking the introduction of luck (random decision making). The selection process is deterministic, {{although it may be}} based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by Daniel Dennett and John Martin Fischer.

25|$|Genealogies and archaeological {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} Gowa dynasty was founded around 1300 in a marriage between a local woman and a chieftain of the Bajau, a nomadic maritime people.

Likewise, early Gowa was a largely agrarian polity with no direct access to the coastline. Talloq was founded two centuries later when a Gowa prince fled to the coast after his defeat in a succession dispute.
