5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the parent of that shower.|$|E

25|$|Batsmen {{are allowed}} to wear gloves while batting. The batsman can be also caught out if the ball touches the glove instead of the bat, {{provided}} the hand is {{in contact with the}} bat. This is because the glove is considered to be the extension of the bat. The batsman may also wear protective helmets usually with a visor to protect themselves. Helmets are usually employed when facing fast bowlers. While playing spinners, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> employed.|$|E

Eventually, he arranged events so that Eleanor {{had no choice but}} to sleep with Louis in a bed specially prepared by the Pope.

25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> so in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all.

25|$|One {{immediate}} {{consequence of}} the announcement was that Astor was beset by innumerable requests for money, and Astor decided to change his planned gift from a donation during his lifetime to a bequest in his will. By March 1839, Cogswell was asking Astor for money to purchase books at an auction, and Astor inquired whether <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> possible to put the planning for the library {{into the hands of}} others, thus freeing himself from all care and trouble about it. Cogswell developed such a strategy, and Astor assented to it on the condition that Cogswell be in charge of buying books.|$|E
25|$|After {{identifying}} the applicable threats, impact scenarios {{are considered to}} support {{the development of a}} business recovery plan. Business continuity testing plans may document scenarios for each identified threats and impact scenarios. More localized impact scenarios – for example loss of a specific floor in a building – may also be documented. The BC plans should reflect the requirements to recover the business in the widest possible damage. The risk assessment should cater to developing impact scenarios that are applicable to the business or the premises it operates. For example, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> logical to consider tsunami in the region of Mideast since the likelihood of such a threat is negligible.|$|E

25|$|Wilson privately {{supported}} conscription {{at least}} as early as 1905. He thought Haldane’s scheme to merge Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers into a new Territorial Army of 16 divisions {{would not be enough}} to match German training and efficiency. He was summoned to see Haldane (March 1909) after an article in the Liberal Westminster Gazette (inspired by Repington, Wilson assumed) claimed that he supported conscription. In a lecture to students (November 1909) he did not publicly oppose government policy but hinted that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> enough. His wife Cecil organised a National Service League meeting that month. Wilson successfully (November 1907) lobbied Haldane for an increase {{in the size of the}} Staff College in order to provide trained staff officers for the new Territorial Army. Haldane agreed an expansion after an inspection in March 1908. During Wilson’s tenure the number of instructors rose from 7 to 16 and the number of students from 64 to 100. In total, 224 Army and 22 Royal Navy officers studied under him.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that it was worth it to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|E

40|$|Research to date {{does not}} {{demonstrate}} a causal chain from financial education to welfare-enhancing financial behavior, {{in part due}} to biases, heuristics, and emotional influences on decisions. Yet the search for effective financial education continues. But it is time to ask whether giving every person effective financial education would make us better off. Two reasons <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>are</b> discussed here. First, the time, expense, and invasion of privacy required would be enormous. Second, such a world would entail a decrease in individual autonomy. Alternative tools could potentially increase household financial welfare and security at lower social and individual expense. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
