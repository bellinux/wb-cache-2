25|$|Prior to {{becoming}} famous as an architect, Pietro drew anatomical plates {{that would not}} be engraved and published until a hundred years after his death. The plates in Tabulae anatomicae are now thought to have been started around 1618. The dramatic and highly studied poses effected by the figures are in keeping with the style of other Renaissance Baroque anatomical artists, although nowhere <b>does</b> <b>such</b> an approach find any fuller expression than in these plates.|$|E
500|$|Squidward's {{voice has}} been {{compared}} to that of Jack Benny's. Kenny said, [...] "To me, there's something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass <b>does</b> <b>such</b> a great job of playing [...] Squidward". Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, said that Squidward [...] "sounds a lot like Jack Benny". Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying [...] "Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out." ...|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork Media {{said that}} while Acid Tongue is [...] "immediately pleasurable," [...] the album's {{downfall}} is that [...] "Lewis <b>does</b> <b>such</b> {{a good job of}} nailing choice sounds and styles from pop's past that you can't help getting reeled in right away; only upon later reflection do you realize that much of her success lies in evoking something else great rather than achieving a greatness more uniquely her own." [...] The review continued, [...] "In these straitjacketed settings, Lewis' considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren't given sufficient room to fully emerge." [...] Time noted that Acid Tongue [...] "sprawl with misplaced ambition" [...] and that only the title track sticks. Another review observed, [...] "Lewis seems to be [...] on her way to a more definitive musical existence [...] but she doesn’t quite seem to know yet." [...] Acid Tongue was also slated for its [...] "hip-hop-like roster of unnecessary cameos. Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward of She and Him make sense, but Elvis Costello sounds intrusive during his duet on [...] "Carpetbaggers," [...] while the black Crowes' Chris Robinson is just superfluous." [...] Crawdaddy!s Zimmerman {{said that while}} [...] "these appearances help flavor the record, [...] I miss the Watson Twins." ...|$|E

500|$|Since {{the success}} of Sethu, Vikram's intense {{performances}} and variety of roles has received critical acclaim. His performances as a rogue turned mentally ill patient in Sethu, a gravedigger with autism spectrum disorder in Bala's Pithamagan, a Brahmin lawyer with multiple personality disorder in Anniyan and a mentally challenged adult with the maturity of a six-year-old boy in Deiva Thirumagal are all roles in which he played a mentally affected man, with Vikram mentioning he <b>does</b> <b>such</b> roles to reinvent himself on screen. Furthermore, Vikram has enjoyed a large fan following in Andhra Pradesh {{as a result of}} a series of successful dubbed Telugu films with Aparichitudu, dubbed from his Tamil film Anniyan, being among the most successful Telugu films of 2005. All his films are thus released in Telugu soon after their original release in Tamil, while Anniyan was also dubbed in Hindi as Aparichit. He has also enjoyed success in Kerala, where his films have demanded large box office openings akin to Malayalam film stars. In 2004, Vikram participated in a live stadium stage event organised by producer P. L. Thenappan titled [...] "Vikram Mega Nite". The event, held in Singapore, attracted several hundreds of his South East Asian fans and was held in the form of a stage musical.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the writ of habeas corpus, a Certificate of Appealability (COA) is not {{required}} in order to appeal a district court’s ruling of a coram nobis petition. [...] Neither the 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) statute making the writ of coram nobis available in federal courts in criminal matters nor any Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure requires a certificate of appealability before an appeal may be taken, nor <b>does</b> <b>such</b> a requirement appear in the case law.|$|E
2500|$|A {{conversion}} {{occurs when}} a person <b>does</b> <b>such</b> acts {{in reference to the}} personal property of another as amount, in view of the law, to his appropriating the property for himself. The action probably developed because there was no equivalent form of action in English law to the Roman law rei vindicatio. This was an action in protection of one's property, whereby a claimant could simply allege in court [...] "that's mine!". Early cases of conversion {{are to be found in}} 1479, where reference to an even earlier action on the case is made when the defendant [...] "converted" [...] the goods by changing their character, making clothes out of gold cloth.|$|E

2500|$|Qualitative research, such as case studies, action research, {{discourse}} analysis, {{and clinical}} interviews, depend on small but focused samples {{in an attempt}} to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it <b>does.</b> <b>Such</b> studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood why treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to [...] "lethal mutations" [...] of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences. Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|Mickey {{becomes the}} victim of {{bullying}} from Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) in May 2008, who <b>does</b> <b>such</b> things as assaulting Mickey and vandalising his property. Mickey is too scared to take any action against Sean, and relies on his sister's boyfriend, Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord), for protection. On 18 June 2008 he is knocked out when Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) hits him {{over the head with}} a crowbar, whilst trying to steal Dawn's baby, Summer. When Micky awakes, he manages to stop May from absconding with Summer, but she subsequently causes a gas explosion, and the Millers' house goes up in flames. [...] May is killed in the explosion. Mickey, Dawn and Summer are trapped in a first floor bedroom. When Mickey attempts to pass Summer out the window to the awaiting crowd below, he loses consciousness and drops her, though she is caught by Jase. Dawn pushes an unconscious Mickey out the window, saving his life. Mickey discovers a letter from Rosie, offering Keith a job as a concierge at her home in the Cotswolds. All of the Millers are angry at him for not acknowledging the letter, and Mickey decides to take the job instead as he says there is nothing left for him in Walford. Later, along with Keith and their dog Genghis, Mickey leaves Walford after an emotional farewell at The Queen Victoria pub.|$|E
2500|$|Robertson-Laurent {{finds that}} [...] "Melville indicts slavery without sentimentalizing either the blacks or the whites." [...] Any {{apparently}} kind behavior toward the slaves is deceptive by nature: not only <b>does</b> <b>such</b> conduct {{not change the}} fact that the captain considers the slaves his property, but it also rests on the motif that it is a [...] "purely self-serving" [...] financial interest of the captain to treat his peculiar [...] "cargo" [...] well. The Americans display no better moral when they board the ship {{at the end of the}} story: it is not kindness that refrains them from killing the Africans, but their plan to claim the [...] "cargo" [...] for themselves. In addition to this principal state of affairs, [...] "freedom within the confines of a slave ship did not protect the women against rape and sexual abuse," [...] and in fact allowing the women to walk on the deck [...] "made them more accessible to the lustful crew." [...] Delano's impression of the female slaves is part of his overall misperception: [...] "After Aranda's death, the women, whom Delano imagines to be as docile and sweet as does with their fawns, shave Aranda's bones clean with their hatchets, then hang his skeleton over the carved figurehead of Cristobal Colón as a warning to the surviving Spaniards." ...|$|E
