40|$|The “German Demographic Challenge”—an aging society, {{low birth}} rates, a falling {{population}} size, and a shrinking working-age population—also affects less tangible facets of Germany’s future because these issues may {{have implications for}} how Germans see themselves and how they define themselves as a nation-state. This paper explores the complex relationships between national identity, migration, and other population processes in the German context. One consequence of the <b>demographic</b> <b>challenge,</b> acting in concert with immigration, is that the German population will become more diverse over time. Perhaps the more difficult challenge will be how Germany comes to terms with itself given the population changes it will experience. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.

This paper is timely and provides important recognition {{of the need for}} appropriately considered strategies to ensure Australia’s standard of living is not compromised by structural ageing of the population. However, the paper has a narrow focus and does not recognise the full range of <b>demographic</b> <b>challenges</b> facing the States.

Like the rest of Australia and much of the developed world, Queensland also faces the challenges of an ageing population. Despite its current younger age profile, the Queensland population is expected to age at a similar rate to that of the rest of Australia. The median age of Queenslanders is projected to increase from 35. 3 years in 2002 to 40. 2 years in 2021, and to 47. 3 years in 2051.
