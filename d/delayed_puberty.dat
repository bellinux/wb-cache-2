5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty.</b> Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E

25|$|Induction of male puberty: Androgens {{are given}} to many boys distressed about extreme delay of puberty. Testosterone is now nearly the only {{androgen}} {{used for this purpose}} and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone is or {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty,</b> hypogonadism, cryptorchidism, and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and engorgement, and breast cancer in women.|$|E
25|$|Puberty is {{a period}} of several years in which rapid {{physical}} growth and psychological changes occur, culminating in sexual maturity. The average age of onset of puberty is at 11 for girls and 12 for boys. Every person's individual timetable for puberty is influenced primarily by heredity, although environmental factors, such as diet and exercise, also exert some influences. These factors can also contribute to precocious and <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty.</b>|$|E

50|$|Leuprorelin, {{along with}} {{triptorelin}} and goserelin, {{are often used}} to <b>delay</b> <b>puberty</b> in transgender youth until they {{are old enough to}} begin hormone replacement therapy. They are also sometimes used as superior alternatives to anti-androgens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate for suppressing testosterone production in trans women.|$|R
50|$|Exposure to {{pesticides}} with antiandrogen properties {{has been}} found to negatively affect laboratory animals. Androgens are important in fetal development as well as in pubertal development. Exposure during critical periods of development can cause reproductive malformations in males while exposure after birth and before <b>puberty</b> can <b>delay</b> <b>puberty.</b>|$|R
25|$|Genetic XX females {{affected}} by total 17Î±-hydroxylase deficiency {{are born with}} normal female internal and external anatomy. At the expected time of puberty neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex steroids, so neither breast development nor pubic hair appear. Investigation of <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty</b> yields elevated gonadotropins and normal karyotype, while imaging confirms the presence of ovaries and an infantile uterus. Discovery of hypertension and hypokalemic alkalosis usually suggests the presence {{of one of the}} proximal forms of CAH, and the characteristic mineralocorticoid elevations confirm the specific diagnosis.|$|E
500|$|In a child's {{developing}} brain, lead {{interferes with}} synapse formation [...] in the cerebral cortex, neurochemical development (including that of neurotransmitters), {{and the organization}} of ion channels. Early childhood exposure has been linked with an increased risk of sleep disturbances and excessive daytime sleepiness in later childhood. High blood levels are associated with <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty</b> in girls. The rise and fall in exposure to airborne lead from the combustion of tetraethyl lead in gasoline during the 20th century has been linked with historical increases and decreases in crime levels, a hypothesis which is not universally accepted.|$|E
500|$|Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} adrenal insufficiency, {{a lack of}} production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol by the adrenal gland. If the problem is chronic, symptoms consist of fatigue, weight loss, failure to thrive (in children), <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty</b> (in adolescents), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). If the onset is abrupt, collapse, shock and vomiting may occur. [...] ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison's disease, which is cortisol deficiency {{as the result of}} direct damage to the adrenal glands; the latter form, however, often leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin, which does not occur in ACTH deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{diseases}} can <b>delay</b> <b>puberty</b> in {{both boys}} and girls. Those that involve chronic inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect. In the western world, inflammatory bowel disease and tuberculosis have been notorious for such an effect in the last century, while {{in areas of the}} underdeveloped world, chronic parasite infections are widespread.|$|R
25|$|To prevent younger, {{subordinate}} females {{within the}} group from breeding, the dominant female uses pheromones. This suppresses sexual behavior and <b>delays</b> <b>puberty.</b> Unrelated males that join the group can release the females from this reproductive suppression; this may result {{in more than one}} female of the group becoming pregnant, but only one of the pregnancies will be successful.|$|R

Herein, a 14 -year old boy is presented in whom the diagnosis of HH was made by magnetic resonance imaging. While {{he did not have}} any complain of precocious puberty, he surprisingly suffered from <b>delay</b> in <b>puberty.</b> The definite diagnosis of HH can only be made by appropriate imaging, in a case with atypical feature of <b>delay</b> in <b>puberty</b> {{and in the absence of}} gelastic epilepsy.

2500|$|Genetic females (46,XX karyotype) {{have two}} X chromosomes, thus have two AR genes. [...] A {{mutation}} in one (but not both) {{results in a}} minimally affected, fertile, female carrier. [...] Some carriers have been noted to have slightly reduced body hair, <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty,</b> and/or tall stature, presumably due to skewed X-inactivation. [...] A female carrier will pass the affected AR gene to her children 50% of the time. [...] If the affected child is a genetic female, she, too, will be a carrier. [...] An affected 46,XY child will have AIS.|$|E
2500|$|Puberty {{in young}} adults with {{cerebral}} palsy may be precocious or delayed. [...] <b>Delayed</b> <b>puberty</b> {{is thought to be}} a consequence of nutritional deficiencies. [...] There is currently no evidence that CP affects fertility, although some of the secondary symptoms have been shown to affect sexual desire and performance. [...] Adults with CP were less likely to get routine reproductive health screening as of 2005. [...] Gynecological examinations may have to be performed under anesthesia due to spasticity, and equipment is often not accessible. Breast self-examination may be difficult, so partners or carers may have to perform it. [...] Women with CP reported higher levels of spasticity and urinary incontinence during menstruation in a study. [...] Men with CP have higher levels of cryptorchidism at the age of 21.|$|E
50|$|Physiologically, the {{exposure}} to male urine induces the release of GnRH, which provokes the first estrus. The Vandenbergh effect has also been seen with exposure to adult female mice. When an immature female mouse is exposed to the urine of mature female mouse, estrus is delayed in the prepubertal female. In this situation, GnRH is inhibited and therefore <b>delays</b> <b>puberty</b> in the juvenile female mouse.|$|R
50|$|Vasquez, 2007: four adopted children, {{three of}} whom were kept in cages, fed limited diets, and {{permitted}} only primitive sanitary facilities. The fourth child, the favorite, was given medication to <b>delay</b> <b>puberty.</b> The adoptive mother received a prison sentence of {{less than a year}} and her parental rights were terminated in 2007. There was no therapist in this case but the adoptive mother claimed that three of her four adopted children had reactive attachment disorder.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} for clinicians to identify children whose gender dysphoria will persist into adolescence and those who outgrow their gender identity disorder (GID) or gender dysphoria diagnosis. In instances where the childâs distress and discomfort continues clinicians will sometimes prescribe gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to <b>delay</b> <b>puberty.</b> [...] Identifying stable and persistent cases of GID may {{reduce the number of}} surgeries and hormonal interventions individuals undergo in adolescence and adulthood. Gender identity disorders persist into adolescence in about 27% of children with GID diagnoses.|$|R
2500|$|On average, girls begin puberty around ages 10â11 and end puberty around 15-17; boys begin around ages 11â12 and end around 16-17. The major {{landmark}} {{of puberty}} for females is menarche, {{the onset of}} menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12â13; for males, {{it is the first}} ejaculation, which occurs on average at age 13. [...] In the 21st century, the average age at which children, especially girls, reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century, when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys. This can be due to any number of factors, including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition, or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens, which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors. Puberty which starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty. Puberty which starts later than usual is known as <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Nietzsche criticized Ernest Renan's {{attribution}} {{of the concepts}} genius and hero to Jesus. Nietzsche thought that the word idiot best described Jesus. According to Walter Kaufmann, {{he might have been}} referring to the naÃ¯ve protagonist of Dostoyevsky's book The Idiot. With an antipathy toward the material world, Jesus was [...] "...at home in a world undisturbed by reality of any kind, a merely 'inner' world, a 'real' world, an 'eternal' world.... 'The kingdom of God is within you'...." [...] According to Nietzsche, the redeemer type is determined by a morbid intolerance of pain. Extreme sensitivity results in avoidance of the world. Also, any feeling of resistance to the world is experienced as pain. Even evil is therefore not resisted. [...] "The fear of pain, even of the infinitely small in pain, [...] cannot end otherwise than in a religion of love...." [...] Jesus was a distorted version of the redeemer type. The first disciples, in their Gospels, described him as having Old Testament characteristics such as prophet, Messiah, miracleworker, moral preacher, etc. Dostoyevsky could have revealed his sickliness and childishness. [...] According to Jesus, [...] "...the kingdom of heaven belongs to 'children'...." [...] Everyone has an equal right to become a child of God. His spirituality is infantile, a result of <b>delayed</b> <b>puberty.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Early puberty is {{believed}} to put girls at higher risk of sexual abuse, unrelated to pedophilia because the child has developed secondary sex characteristics; however, a causal relationship is, as yet, inconclusive. Early puberty also puts girls at a higher risk for teasing or bullying, mental health disorders and short stature as adults. Helping children control their weight is suggested to help <b>delay</b> <b>puberty.</b> Early puberty additionally puts girls at a [...] "far greater" [...] risk for breast cancer later in life. Girls as young as 8 are increasingly starting to menstruate, develop breasts and grow pubic and underarm hair; these [...] "biological milestones" [...] typically occurred only at 13 or older in the past. African-American girls are especially prone to early puberty. There are theories debating the trend of early puberty, but the exact causes are not known.|$|R
