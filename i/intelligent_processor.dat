40|$|Abstract—In a {{heterogeneous}} grid environment, {{there are two}} major factors which would severely affect overall system performance: speed heterogeneity and resource fragmentation. Moreover, the relative effect of these two factors changes with different workload and resource conditions. Processor allocation methods have to deal with this issue. However, most existing allocation methods focus on one of these two factors. This paper first analyzes the relative strength of different existing methods. Based on the analysis, we propose an <b>intelligent</b> <b>processor</b> allocation method which considers both the speed heterogeneity and resource fragmentation effects. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to show that the proposed method can effectively deliver better performance under most resource and workload conditions.

The quality of light produced by the light emitting element of traffic light system at remote site is monitored via graphical user interface (GUI).

40|$|Intelligent sensor {{technology}} and systems are increasingly becoming attractive means {{to serve as}} frameworks for intelligent rocket test facilities with embedded intelligent sensor elements, distributed data acquisition elements, and onboard data acquisition elements. Networked intelligent processors enable users and systems integrators to automatically configure their measurement automation systems for analog sensors. NASA and leading sensor vendors are working together to apply the IEEE 1451 standard for adding plug-and-play capabilities for wireless analog transducers {{through the use of}} a Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) in order to simplify sensor setup, use, and maintenance, to automatically obtain calibration data, and to eliminate manual data entry and error. A TEDS contains the critical information needed by an instrument or measurement system to identify, characterize, interface, and properly use the signal from an analog sensor. A TEDS is deployed for a sensor in one of two ways. First, the TEDS can reside in embedded, nonvolatile memory (typically flash memory) within the <b>intelligent</b> <b>processor.</b> Second, a virtual TEDS can exist as a separate file, downloadable from the Internet. This concept of virtual TEDS extends the benefits of the standardized TEDS to legacy sensors and applications where the embedded memory is not available. An HTML-based user interface provides a visual tool to interface with those distributed sensors that a TEDS is associated with, to automate the sensor management process. Implementing and deploying the IEEE 1451. 1 -based Network-Capable Application Process (NCAP) can achieve support for intelligent process in Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) for the purpose of monitoring, detection of anomalies, diagnosis of causes of anomalies, prediction of future anomalies, mitigation to maintain operability, and integrated awareness of system health by the operator. It can also support local data collection and storage. This invention enables wide-area sensing and employs numerous globally distributed sensing devices that observe the physical world through the existing sensor network. This innovation enables distributed storage, distributed processing, distributed intelligence, and the availability of DiaK (Data, Information, and Knowledge) to any element as needed. It also enables the simultaneous execution of multiple processes, and represents models that contribute to the determination of the condition and health of each element in the system. The NCAP (intelligent process) can configure data-collection and filtering processes in reaction to sensed data, allowing it to decide when and how to adapt collection and processing with regard to sophisticated analysis of data derived from multiple sensors. The user will be able to view the sensing device network as a single unit that supports a high-level query language. Each query would be able to operate over data collected from across the global sensor network just as a search query encompasses millions of Web pages. The sensor web can preserve ubiquitous information access between the querier and the queried data. Pervasive monitoring of the physical world raises significant data and privacy concerns. This innovation enables different authorities to control portions of the sensing infrastructure, and sensor service authors may wish to compose services across authority boundaries...|$|E

The still unsolved problem appears when trying to automate a task at all local nodes (in our case, at substation level), i. e., when a distributed solution must be find.

The goal is the support of space operations by giving a tool to the subsystem-experts which enables them to determine automatically state and performance of attitude control systems. This method was realised in an expert-system environment and was tested and verified with the attitude control system of the ROSAT satellite. Up to now such ground system applications were rarely used, the realisation was mostly restricted to some kind of <b>intelligent</b> telemetry <b>processors</b> interpreting basic telemetry. The presented approach however shall not support or help the control room operators, but it shall provide the subsystem experts themselves with a tool to do their work faster and better. The ongoing development in the field of expert system shells with a growing compatibility and user friendliness made it possible to connect these technics with fuzzy logic approaches for analysis and diagnosis of spaceflight attitude control systems. Especially a method was developed wich leads to the formulation of quality criterias by analysing the tasks of the system to be examined. These criterias were transformed into a rule base. Via an external, generally designed interface it is possible to connect the telemetry stream of the satellite with these rules by an object oriented data representation. The evaluation of the quality criterias is realised by fuzzy logic methods. The definition of the fuzzy property tables is there an important tool for the presentation of operational knowledge. The application of this method to the ROSAT spacecraft made a complete analysis of its attitude control system possible without being restricted to the use of small samples. The operations could be supported by the detection of numerous anomalies and the scientific output was augmented. (orig.)
