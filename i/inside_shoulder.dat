At the same time, he or she uses the outside rein to flex the horse's head toward the outside, which frees up the animal's <b>inside</b> <b>shoulder,</b> encouraging it to fall into that lead. If the rider were {{to ask for the}} left lead, for example, he or she would apply the right leg behind the girth and use the right rein to turn the horse's head to the right. To make the rider's intent even clearer, the horse may be angled slightly toward the outside rail of the arena, which will guide it into taking the correct lead as it goes towards the unobstructed inside, and also discourages the horse from simply running onto the forehand.|$|E

50|$|Requirements for {{defensive}} tackles {{are highly}} dependent on the version of the defense being played. For example, the 4-4 of Joe Roman requires quickness, size, and a player no taller than 6' 4". In the 4-4 Split of Roman, the defensive tackles line up heads up on the offensive guard, or perhaps on their outside shoulder. In the 'G front' of Frank Beamer's teams, the weak side tackle lines up on the <b>inside</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the offensive guard, and the strong side tackle lines up on the outside shoulder of the offensive guard.|$|E

Projects include rebuilding and widening the roadway to six lanes between I-39 and Randall Road, and eight lanes between Randall Road and the Kennedy Expressway. The <b>inside</b> <b>shoulders</b> will be widened for future transit opportunities, and active traffic management will {{be incorporated into the}} corridor. In addition, almost all of the crossroad bridges will be rebuilt and several interchanges will be reconfigured/expanded.|$|R

50|$|The bridge would {{consist of}} six through-travel lanes and three {{auxiliary}} lanes (two in the northbound direction {{and one in the}} southbound direction) to handle traffic accelerating onto the bridge or decelerating off of the bridge at the two closely spaced adjoining interchanges. The envisioned bridge also would have shoulders to handle vehicle breakdowns and emergencies, with the two <b>inside</b> <b>shoulders</b> being wide enough to handle proposed regional bus-rapid transit service. The Commission also has expressed interest in adding a bicycle/pedestrian facility to the new bridge, but has a stated that a decision on this will not be made until the final design phase.|$|R
50|$|Shoulder width: Minimum outside paved {{shoulder}} {{width of}} 10 ft and <b>inside</b> <b>shoulder</b> width of 4 ft. With {{three or more}} lanes in each direction, the inside paved shoulder {{should be at least}} 10 ft wide. If truck traffic is over 250 Directional Design Hour Volume, shoulders at least 12 ft wide should be considered. In mountainous terrain, 8 ft outside and 4 ft inside shoulders are acceptable, except when there are at least four lanes in each direction, in which case the inside shoulders should also be 8 ft wide.|$|E

The charley linebacker will line up on {{the line of scrimmage}} and on the <b>inside</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the tight end, to cover the tight end or making it difficult for the tight end to release easily.

5000|$|Tunnel clearance: Tunnels {{should in}} theory be {{equivalent}} to long overcrossings, {{but because of}} cost the standards can be reduced. Vertical clearance {{is the same as}} under bridges, including the provision for alternate routing. Width should be at least 44 ft, which consists of two 12 ft lanes, 10 ft outside and 5 ft <b>inside</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and 2.5 ft safety walkways on each side. If necessary to meet the dimensions of the approach, this can be shifted left or right. A reduced width is acceptable due to high cost. In this case, the minimum width is 30 ft, with at least 2 ft more than the approach for the sum of the shoulder widths, but at least 24 ft total, and at least 1.5 ft on each side for a safety walkway. If there is no safety walkway, a 3 ft offset with a [...] "safety shape" [...] in the wall is acceptable.|$|R

50|$|The $315 million MassDOT Highway Division {{project has}} started {{widening}} {{on the project}} to upgrade the existing 14.3 mi six-lane section of highway to eight lanes from north of Route 9 in Wellesley to Route 24 in Randolph. The project consists of adding a lane {{on the inside of}} each carriageway, complete with a 10-foot <b>inside</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The existing 1950s bridges, 22 in total, will be replaced as well. The project will be constructed in five phases over a twelve-year period. Construction of phase 1 began in 2004. The first phase of the project consisted of replacing the existing three-lane Route 128 bridges over University Avenue/MBTA/Amtrak and the Neponset River with new four-lane bridges in Canton. The project also included construction of a new two-lane ramp from Route 128 to I-95. The $33 million project was awarded to SPS New England of Salisbury.|$|E
50|$|A {{long neck}} {{is one that}} is more than one third the length of the horse. Long necks are common, {{especially}} in Thoroughbreds, Saddlebreds, and Gaited Horses. A long neck may hinder the balancing ability of the horse, and the horse may fatigue more quickly {{as a result of the}} greater weight on its front end. The muscles of a long neck are more difficult to develop in size and strength. A long neck needs broad withers to support its weight. It is easier for a long necked horse to fall into the bend of an S-curve than to come through the bridle, which causes the horse to fall onto its <b>inside</b> <b>shoulder.</b> This makes it difficult for the rider to straighten. A horse with this trait is best used for jumping, speed sports without quick changes of direction, or for straight line riding such as trail riding.|$|E
5000|$|A corner {{route is}} a pattern run by a {{receiver}} in American football, where the receiver runs up the field and then turns at approximately a 45-degree angle, heading away from the quarterback towards the sideline. Usually, the pass is used when the defensive back is playing towards the <b>inside</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the receiver, thus creating a one on one vertical matchup. The corner route {{is less likely to}} be intercepted when compared to the slant route, because it is thrown away {{from the middle of the}} field. The pass is used frequently in the West Coast offensive scheme, where quick, accurate throwing is key. The pass may also be used closer to the goal line in what is called a [...] "fade". The quarterback will lob the ball over a beaten defender to a wide receiver at the back corner of the end zone.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{slated for}} the {{interchange}} with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge {{as there is}} no way to access either of them without driving through a residential area off Route 18. The traffic flow along CR 516 (Old Bridge into Matawan) and 527 (Old Bridge into Englishtown/Manalapan) has increased significantly in the past ten years which called for the exit ramp off Route 18. The Old Bridge improvements include adding <b>inside</b> <b>shoulders</b> and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, County Route 516's intersection with Old Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station in preparing for the project. There is no new date released by NJDOT in when construction will begin.|$|R
