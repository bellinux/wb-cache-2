50|$|Flexographic inks are inks {{transferred}} by {{the process}} of <b>flexography,</b> primarily used in the printing of packing materials (cardboard boxes, corrugated cardboard, paper bags and plastic bags, food packaging, newspapers, catalogues, etc.). The inks and method of printing continues to grow in popularity due to its low cost and environmentally friendly nature. The {{most important part of the}} printing process is the application of the ink.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of <b>flexography,</b> aniline dye ink was used. Because of its toxicity, its use in food {{packaging}} was banned and it brought on complications due to frequent staining and the need for bleeding. Over time, changes and improvements were made, involving the substitution of aniline dye for polyamide resins which speed up the drying process and as such the overall printing process itself.|$|E

An increasing number of posters do not advertise anything at all and instead feature artwork, inspirational or positive messages, and religious messages.|$|E
50|$|Rotogravure (roto or gravure for short) {{is a type}} of {{intaglio}} printing process, which involves engraving the image onto an image carrier. In gravure printing, the image is engraved onto a cylinder because, like offset printing and <b>flexography,</b> it uses a rotary printing press.Once a staple of newspaper photo features, the rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, postcards, and corrugated (cardboard) and other product packaging.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flexography</b> (often {{abbreviated}} to flexo) {{is a form}} of printing process which utilizes a flexible relief plate. It is essentially a modern version of letterpress which can be used for printing on almost any type of substrate, including plastic, metallic films, cellophane, and paper. It is widely used for printing on the non-porous substrates required for various types of food packaging (it is also well suited for printing large areas of solid colour).|$|E

50|$|Most {{packaging}} {{is printed}} using <b>flexography,</b> {{because it is}} more versatile over the range of materials used in packaging. However, the image quality of flexographic prints is often inferior to offset presses, and it is important to simulate the characteristics of the press in the proofs so that customers have realistic expectations for the final packaging. Similarly certain materials, such as corrugated cardboard, add their own characteristics to the image, and these too need to be simulated.|$|E
50|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{is a set}} {{of printing}} methods used to create electrical devices on various substrates. Printing typically uses common printing equipment suitable for defining patterns on material, such as screen printing, <b>flexography,</b> gravure, offset lithography, and inkjet. By electronic industry standards, these are low cost processes. Electrically functional electronic or optical inks are deposited on the substrate, creating active or passive devices, such as thin film transistors; capacitors; coils; resistors. Printed electronics is expected to facilitate widespread, very low-cost, low-performance electronics for applications such as flexible displays, smart labels, decorative and animated posters, and active clothing that do not require high performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{difference between}} digital printing and traditional {{methods such as}} lithography, <b>flexography,</b> gravure, or letterpress {{is that there is}} no need to replace printing plates in digital printing, whereas in analog printing the plates are repeatedly replaced. This results in quicker turnaround time and lower cost when using digital printing, but typically a loss of some fine-image detail by most commercial digital printing processes. The most popular methods include inkjet or laser printers that deposit pigment or toner onto a wide variety of substrates including paper, photo paper, canvas, glass, metal, marble, and other substances.|$|E
50|$|The G7 Method is a {{printing}} procedure used for visually accurate color reproduction by putting emphasis on matching grayscale colorimetric measurements between processes. G7 stands for grayscale plus seven colors: the subtractive colors typically used in printing (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) and the additive colors (Red, Green, and Blue). The method {{is used in}} many applications of printing such as offset lithography, <b>flexography,</b> and gravure since it uses a one-dimensional neutral print density curve (NPDC) to match neutral tonality between two G7 calibrated printing systems. The G7 method is not a completely accurate color management system nor is it officially standardized by the International Color Consortium (ICC).|$|E
50|$|This {{compound}} {{is generally}} applied as a dispersion of gelled particles in water. A conductive layer on glass is obtained by spreading {{a layer of}} the dispersion on the surface usually by spin coating and driving out the water by heat. Special PEDOT:PSS inks and formulations were developed for different coating and printing processes. Water-based PEDOT:PSS inks are mainly used in slot die coating, <b>flexography,</b> rotogravure and inkjet printing. If a high viscous paste and slow drying is required like in screen-printing processes PEDOT:PSS can also be supplied in high boiling solvents like propanediol. Dry PEDOT:PSS pellets can be produced with a freeze drying method which are redispersable in water and different solvents, for example ethanol to increase drying speed during printing. Finally, to overcome degradation to ultraviolet light and high temperature or humidity conditions PEDOT:PSS UV-stabilizers are available.|$|E
50|$|Flexo has an {{advantage}} over lithography in that it can use {{a wider range of}} inks, water based rather than oil based inks, and is good at printing on a variety of different materials like plastic, foil, acetate film, brown paper, and other materials used in packaging. Typical products printed using <b>flexography</b> include brown corrugated boxes, flexible packaging including retail and shopping bags, food and hygiene bags and sacks, milk and beverage cartons, flexible plastics, self-adhesive labels, disposable cups and containers, envelopes and wallpaper. In recent years there has also been a move towards laminates, where two or more materials are bonded together to produce new material with different properties than either of the originals. A number of newspapers now eschew the more common offset lithography process in favour of flexo. Flexographic inks, like those used in gravure and unlike those used in lithography, generally have a low viscosity. This enables faster drying and, as a result, faster production, which results in lower costs.|$|E

These products {{can be used for}} a variety of markets (offset printing, rotogravure, <b>flexography</b> and digital printing).Böttcher America can supply rollers to customers as either “exchange” or “recover”. The “Roller Recover Program” allows customers to send Böttcher America used rollers to be recovered with new rubber. A customer can also order rollers through the “Exchange Roller Program” and a press-ready roller will be shipped. The customer is billed for the rubber only and has 60 days to return the core(s).Böttcher is the OEM roller supplier to the major sheet-fed press manufacturers including Heidelberg, MAN Roland, KBA, Komori and Mitsubishi.Böttcher America has won two awards for its products. In 1993, the company won a GATF award in recognition of the glaze free rollers technology (79 Series Rubber Compounds). In 2005, Böttcher America won a new PIA/GATF award for its Chameleon rubber roller compound which enables printers to switch freely among different inks (conventional, UV or hybrid) without changing printing rollers.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{paper cups}} were printed using rubber blocks mounted on cylinders, with a {{different}} cylinder for each colour. Registration across different colours was very difficult, but later <b>flexography</b> plates became available and {{with the use of}} mounting systems it became easier to register across the colours, allowing for more complex designs. Printing flexographic has become ideal for long runs and manufacturers generally use this method when producing over a million cups. Machines such as Comexi are used for this, which have been adapted to take the extra large reels that are required by paper cup manufacturers. Ink technology has also changed and where solvent-based inks were being used, water-based inks are instead being utilised. One of the side effects of solvent-based inks is that hot drink cups in particular can smell of solvent, whereas water-based inks have eliminated this problem.Other methods of printing have been used for short runs such as offset printing, which can vary from anything from 10,000 to 100,000 cups. Offset printing inks have also been developed and although in the past these were solvent based, the latest soya-based inks have reduced the danger of cups smelling. The latest development is Direct-printing, which allows printing on very small quantities, typically from 1,000 cups, and is used by companies including The Paper Cup Company offering small quantities in short lead times. Rotogravure can also be used, but this is extremely expensive and is normally only utilised for items requiring extremely high quality printing like ice cream containers.|$|E
