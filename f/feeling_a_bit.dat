500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E

[...] Jason Lipshutz of the same publication described it as a [...] "smile-inducing clip with a dream wedding". A writer of Rap-Up praised the video's [...] "fairytale" [...] ending. Gordon Smart of The Sun described the white corset that Beyoncé wore in the video as sexy and wrote that [...] "her ex will be <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a mug watching it when he remembers what he's missing out on." [...] Ashleigh Rainbird of the Daily Mirror found Beyoncé, [...] "looking sexy in white lacy undies and garter – and later in a Big Fat Gypsy Wedding-style frock". Amos Barshad of New York magazine commented, [...] "To just full-on hammer down the whole 'mature and settled down and happy' thing, Mrs. Hova saunters around with the most irrepressible smile you've ever seen, shimmying amazingly (note the moves at 3:30) as home footage of that jerk she threw away like a parking ticket cuts in and out."

On May 27, 2008 MTV News {{reported}} that the Pussycat Dolls were among many set to perform at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards on June 1, 2008. Scherzinger talked about the performance saying: [...] "This {{is a big deal}} for us. We just want to kill it. It's all about the Dolls right now, and we're coming strong." [...] The girls performed wearing spandex-and-leather getups, while a backdrop was displayed in the background with images of flashbulbs, tabloid headlines and diamonds. They were joined by America's Best Dance Crew winners the Jabbawockeez who descended from the ceiling wearing matching red T-shirts with stark-white masks covering their faces, and baseball caps perched at 45-degree angles atop their heads. Of the performance, Geoff Boucher from the Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "the Pussycat Dolls' set climaxed with a powerful pyro display that left celebs in the first few rows <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> roasted". MTV Buzzworthy described the performance as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "sultry". However, Tod Martens, in another review for the Los Angeles Times, criticized their performance. He commented: [...] " [...] onstage looking like they had escaped a taping for a sexed-up Jazzercise video." [...] He also wrote that Scherzinger never commanded the song except on [...] "the cut's final seconds when she turned her vocals up to a growl" [...] and noted JabbaWockeez's appearance as [...] "annoy".|$|E

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Post-match, Atherton was effusive about man-of-the-match DeFreitas: [...] "Daffy {{grabbed the}} game by the scruff of the neck", the England captain acknowledged. The man himself was pleased but less excited. [...] "They bowled it short, I saw it and hit it. That's about it, really," [...] he simplified. Aussie skipper Mark Taylor {{admitted}} that [...] "hey've played better than us since Christmas" [...] and acknowledged his concern about their form, especially that of his key spin weapon.

2500|$|Craig Marks of Billboard {{said that}} along with [...] "California Gurls", the songs [...] "are {{textbook}} summer singles whose ingenious pop hooks and zillion-dollar drum tracks are stamped with Perry's knack for a memorable line and frothy, gum-snapping persona." [...] As of January 2015, Billboard also named [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second best song of 2010s (so far). James Montgomery of MTV commented that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] showed a [...] "definite change of pace for Perry. While it's still as saccharine sweet as her previous hits, there's also a rather, well, mature quality to it (despite the title)." [...] Amos Barshad of New York said, [...] "Right now, it's <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too earnest, and not nearly as catchy as the follow-up single from Perry's first album ('Hot n Cold,' most definitely still a jam). That said, we are now mentally preparing ourselves for its ubiquity." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic dismissed the lyrics as [...] "simply annoying and incoherent" [...] and added that [...] "the hook and chorus aren't nearly compelling enough to pull me back into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On a flat, batsman-friendly pitch, Simpson won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. Having scored more than 40 {{first-class}} centuries, {{he was still}} looking for his first Test ton. Simpson's plan was to bat {{as long as possible}} to ensure that defeat would be avoided and the Ashes retained. Simpson and Lawry gave Australia an ideal start with a solid opening partnership, which yielded 201 runs, before Lawry was run out for 106. Simpson then slowly progressed through the 90s before reaching his first Test century. Speaking of his relief at reaching the milestone, Simpson recalled [...] "I don't know of any player who was on the international scene as long as I without scoring a century. I was <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> silly about it by this stage." [...] Simpson continued on his quest of batting England out of the game. Following the dismissal of Ian Redpath (19), Norm O'Neill (47) and Peter Burge (34), Brian Booth went about building the sixth-wicket partnership on the second day. Simpson combined in another double century stand, 219, before Booth was out for 98. Simpson was 265 at the close of play, and resumed Australia's innings. This time, he was in an aggressive mood, scoring a further 46 runs in 40 minutes before being dismissed for 311. Australia declared at 8/656. Simpson's 13-hour innings was the longest by an Australian at first-class level. He joined Don Bradman as the second Australian to have made a Test triple century in England. Bob Simpson became only the second man in cricket history to score a triple ton as his first Test century, the other being Sir Garfield Sobers. Later in December 2016, an Indian cricketer Karun Nair, joined this elite club when he scored 303 not out, as his maiden century against England at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai ...|$|E
