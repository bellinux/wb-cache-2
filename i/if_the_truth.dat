25|$|T-norms are a {{generalization}} {{of the usual}} two-valued logical conjunction, studied by classical logic, for fuzzy logics. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures {{that the degree of}} truth of conjunction does not decrease <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> values of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as true (and consequently 0 as false). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.|$|E

500|$|The Bookseller {{called the}} book [...] "the first {{comprehensive}} encyclopedia of its kind". In {{a review of}} the encyclopedia for The Guardian, Andrew Mueller called it a [...] "beautifully-produced tome" [...] and commented that the work [...] "succeeds, as was probably intentional, in offering some fascinating tours of the byways of history and providing a tantalising alternative universe in which much of what you know may not be what it seems". John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas." [...] Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, [...] "For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is out there, the authors are damned if they can find it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spartan takeover, the exiled Thebans regrouped in Athens and, at the instigation of Pelopidas, prepared to liberate their city. Meanwhile, in Thebes, Epaminondas began preparing the young men {{of the city to}} fight the Spartans. In the winter of 379BC, a small group of the exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrated the city. They then assassinated the leaders of the pro-Spartan government, and supported by Epaminondas and Gorgidas, who led a group of young men, and a force of Athenian hoplites, they surrounded the Spartans on the Cadmeia. The following day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought Pelopidas and his men before the Theban assembly and exhorted the Thebans to fight for their freedom; the assembly responded by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators. The Cadmeia was surrounded, and the Spartans attacked; Pelopidas realised that they must be expelled before an army came from Sparta to relieve them. The Spartan garrison eventually surrendered on the condition that they were allowed to march away unharmed. The narrow margin of the conspirators' success is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} Spartan garrison met a Spartan force on the way to rescue them as they marched back to Sparta. [...] Plutarch portrays the Theban coup as an immensely significant event: ...the subsequent change in the political situation made this exploit the more glorious.

When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers. I've enjoyed the small-town atmosphere of College Station for my family, and Green Bay offers that same atmosphere. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> be told, {{there is not a}} whole lot of difference between an `Aggie' and a `Cheesehead."

2500|$|Upon {{entering}} the Senate in January 1957, Church {{made the mistake}} of voting on a measure against the wishes of Democratic Majority Leader, Lyndon Johnson, and Johnson punished Church by all but ignoring him for the next six months. Church found solace from Republican Minority Leader, William Knowland. However, Church managed to find his way into Johnson's good graces by providing key assistance in getting the Civil Rights Act of 1957 passed. LBJ was so grateful he made the young Idahoan a veritable protégé, rewarding him with plum assignments, such as a seat on the prestigious Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position which allowed Church to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his idol, William Borah. Recently declassified documents [...] show that the young veteran also challenged his mentor, behind closed doors, after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, making this prescient warning: [...] "In a democracy you cannot expect the people, whose sons are being killed and who will be killed, to exercise their judgment <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is concealed from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "common sense" [...] had already become less {{commonly}} {{used as a}} term for the empathetic moral sentiments {{by the time of}} Adam Smith, debates continue about methodological individualism as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by Milton Friedman and more recently by Gary S. Becker, both members of the so-called Chicago school of economics). As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as Deirdre McCloskey, who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian Richard Rorty and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.|$|E

2500|$|Prime {{responsibility}} for the celebrated spinwheel, which is largely individual and instinctive, rests with the Garrison Sergeant Major. [...] A 'wheel' {{is not an easy}} manoeuvre with even a small body of troops, and with a block of 400 men the normal wheel is impossible. The massed band therefore pivots on its own centre, so that certain outer ranks and files march long distances in a hurry while the centre and inner ranks loiter with extreme intent, or merely mark time. Yet others not only step sideways but backwards as well. This highly complex movement is called a 'spin-wheel', the details of which can be found in no drill book or manual of ceremonial. Its complexity defies description, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> were known, many of the participants know not whither they go or, on arrival, how they got there. The spin-wheel is almost an art form and each performance of it, although similar in essentials, is different in detail. Most of the performers are adjusting their actions to suit the needs of the spin-wheel of the moment, having adjusted their movements quite otherwise on other occasions.|$|E
2500|$|Aloha from Hawaii {{proved to}} be the last great moment in the life of Presley and Parker. In May 1973, in an attempt to deal with Presley's growing {{dependence}} on prescription drugs, Presley's father, Vernon, and Parker attempted to cut off his supply. They hired private detectives to find out where the drugs were coming from and were successful in stopping any more from reaching Presley. However, it wasn't long before Presley was able to find other doctors to meet his demands. In later years, several of Presley's inner circle would tell of how difficult it was to persuade Presley to quit the drugs. As well as being their employer and paying their wages, he was also their main source of access to drugs for themselves. Presley's main doctor, George C. Nichopoulos, would often replace Presley's medication with placebos in an attempt to wean him off the drugs. This would be successful for a short time, but when Presley discovered the trick he simply found himself other doctors. Author Alanna Nash suggests {{that one of the reasons}} Parker didn't do more is because he may have just not known how to handle the situation. In her book, The Colonel, she writes [...] "in the days before the Betty Ford Clinic, the Colonel didn't know where to take him for discreet, effective help and loathed risking the loss of work <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> got out." ...|$|E
