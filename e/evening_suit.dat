25|$|Spending freely, Harry {{bought his}} silk button-hole {{gardenia}} from an exclusive tailor on rue de la Paix. Caresse bought hats from Jean Patou and dresses from Tolstoy's, an exclusive fashion house. On special occasions {{she wore a}} gold cloth <b>evening</b> <b>suit,</b> featuring a short skirt, tailored by Vionnet, {{one of the most}} important Parisian fashion houses. Although chic by Paris standards, it was unacceptable to the cousins and aunts who lived in the aristocratic neighborhood of Faubourg in Paris.|$|E
500|$|As Wood's {{working life}} {{took a turn}} for the better, his {{domestic}} life started to deteriorate. During the early 1930s, he and his wife gradually became estranged, and their relationship ended in bitterness, with Muriel taking most of Wood's money and, for much of the time, living abroad. She refused to divorce him. The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his estrangement from their daughters. In 1934 he began a happy relationship with a widowed former pupil, Jessie Linton, who had sung for him frequently in the past under her professional name of Jessie Goldsack. One of Wood's players recalled, [...] "She changed him. He had been badly dressed, awful clothes. Jessie got him a new <b>evening</b> <b>suit,</b> instead of the mouldy green one, and he flourished yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human." [...] As Wood was not free to remarry, she changed her name by deed poll to [...] "Lady Jessie Wood" [...] and was generally assumed by the public to be Wood's wife. In his memoirs, Wood mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Holmes {{gradually}} becomes {{accustomed to}} the Opera's distinctive culture. [...] He learns that all minor mishaps are attributed to the Ghost, a spectral personage who haunts the Opera's labyrinthine passageways, sometimes appearing to ballet dancers wearing an <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> but without a head.|$|E
5000|$|Card Dance (w:Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Marty Feldman for 'At Last the 1948 Show') {{performed}} by John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. They {{are dressed in}} <b>evening</b> <b>suits</b> but are pretending to be naked - and each perform with two pieces of cardboard discreetly placed (Tim's pieces of paper get progressively smaller during the routine).|$|R
60|$|The system thus entered on, I pursued {{during the}} whole season of probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; {{but on the whole}} I could see he was {{excellently}} entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and <b>even</b> <b>suited</b> his taste less.|$|R
50|$|As a {{high school}} senior at Ball High School, Petteway was signed by Pat Knight, however Knight was fired on March 7, 2011 from his role as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders {{basketball}} team before Petteway <b>even</b> <b>suited</b> up for the Red Raiders. Petteway elected to maintain his commitment to Texas Tech after Billy Gillispie was hired as the Red Raiders new head coach on March 20, 2011.|$|R
2500|$|Minogue re-emerged {{on stage}} in a Cher-esque <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> {{performing}} [...] "No More Rain". Many songs were added and swapped around during this act including [...] "The One", [...] "Love at First Sight", [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] and the acoustic rendition of [...] "All I See".|$|E
6000|$|Howells {{smiled and}} with {{delightful}} humor and that precision of phrase {{which made him}} my joy and my despair, answered, [...] "My dear fellow, why don't you make your proposed visit to England, buy your <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> there and on your return to Chicago plead the inexorability of English social usages?" ...|$|E
60|$|In his <b>evening</b> <b>suit,</b> {{his dark}} ruffled hair uncovered, {{he would have}} made a quaint {{spectacle}} for the owners of that chalet, if they had chanced to see him seated on the hay-strewn boards against their barn, staring before him with such wistful rapture. But they were folk to whom sleep was precious....|$|E
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 2011, as Rogelstad goes for a degree in {{accounting}} at York College of Pennsylvania, he is recruited by the Quick Six (now Falloons) hockey club, which consists of other students from York College. He goes on to help the team to a championship chipping in 9 goals and 15 assists in his 14 games played that season. He <b>even</b> <b>suited</b> up as goalie one game.|$|R

50|$|Designs by Lycett Green are {{included}} in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of London. One of his <b>evening</b> <b>suits</b> in black velvet was selected by Patrick Lichfield to represent 1971 in the Dress of the Year collection at the Fashion Museum, Bath, alongside a woman's outfit by Graziella Fontana. Today, the Burlington Gardens premises are occupied by the tailors Ede & Ravenscroft.|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} to dinner several times in his <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> that had been William's. Each time his mother's heart was firm with pride and joy. He was started now. The studs she and the {{children}} had bought for William were in his shirt-front; he wore one of William's dress shirts. But he had an elegant figure. His face was rough, but warm-looking and rather pleasing. He did not look particularly a gentleman, but she thought he looked quite a man.|$|E
6000|$|So {{he called}} a page, who had thoughtfully {{presented}} himself, and gave directions to have the Remorse Apartments of the palace put in order, and for the court tailor to prepare an <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> of sackcloth-and-ashes. Then summoning the hawk, he seized and dashed him to the ground, killing him very dead. Rejoining his retinue, he dispatched an officer to remove {{the body of the}} serpent from the fountain, lest somebody else should get poisoned. There wasn't any serpent--the water was remarkable for its wholesome purity! ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sydney Barnes came {{slowly into}} view. He {{was wearing an}} <b>evening</b> <b>suit,</b> {{obviously}} too large for him, a made-up white tie had slipped round underneath his ear, a considerable fragment of red silk handkerchief was visible between his waistcoat and much crumpled white shirt. An opera hat, also too large for him, he was wearing {{very much on the}} back of his head, and he was smoking a very black cigar, from which he had failed to remove the band. He frowned when he saw Wrayson, but followed the Baroness into the room with a pronounced swagger.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} usually {{told by a}} small number of people. The most {{standard}} number is 1 or 2, sometimes extending to 4 or higher. Quyi is often accompanied by clappers, drums, or stringed instruments, with the presenter wearing costumes at times. Unlike Chinese operas which has a fixed style for costume, quyi costumes vary depending on the era of the story plot. Costumes range from dynastic period hanfu to the more modern qipao or <b>even</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Terry and Gerry {{took their}} style from {{nineteen}} fifties pop artists - they wore black <b>evening</b> <b>suits</b> and ribbon ties {{in the style}} of the Everly Brothers while sounding more akin to Britain’s Lonnie Donegan. The songs written by Colvin/Lilley were remarkable for their brevity with the three songs on the first side of their debut EP Butter’s On the Bread totalling just four minutes and five seconds. Butter’s on the Bread referred to the miners’ strike of 1984.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Binkley was the gay boy of the boarding-house. He was forty-nine, {{and owned}} a fishstall in a {{downtown}} market. But after six o'clock he wore an <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> and whooped things up connected with the beaux arts. The young men said he was an [...] "Indian." [...] He {{was supposed to be}} an accomplished habitué of the inner circles of Bohemia. It was no secret that he had once loaned $10 to a young man who had had a drawing printed in Puck. Often has one thus obtained his entrée into the charmed circle, while the other obtained both his entrée and roast.|$|E
60|$|Susan Henchard's husband--in law, at least--sat before them, matured in shape, {{stiffened}} in line, exaggerated in traits; disciplined, thought-marked--in a word, older. Elizabeth, encumbered with no recollections as {{her mother}} was, regarded him {{with nothing more than}} the keen curiosity and interest which the discovery of such unexpected social standing in the long-sought relative naturally begot. He was dressed in an old-fashioned <b>evening</b> <b>suit,</b> an expanse of frilled shirt showing on his broad breast; jewelled studs, and a heavy gold chain. Three glasses stood at his right hand; but, to his wife's surprise, the two for wine were empty, while the third, a tumbler, was half full of water.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Towers {{chandler}} was {{pressing his}} <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> in his hall bedroom. One iron was heating {{on a small}} gas stove; the other was being pushed vigorously {{back and forth to}} make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from mr. Chandler's patent leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero's toilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome--in appearance the typical new york young clubman setting out, slightly bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening.|$|E
60|$|After this {{he told me}} that by noon {{all would}} be ready for my journey which I should make with the rank of the King's Envoy, duly {{provisioned}} and escorted by his servants, with liberty to use the royal horses from post to post. Then he ordered the slaves to bring in the gifts which the King sent to me, and these were many, including <b>even</b> <b>suits</b> of flexible armour that would turn any sword-thrust or arrow.|$|R
25|$|While—under Ex parte Young—tribes may obtain some prospective, {{equitable}} relief in suits nominally against state officials (generally, for treaty rights), the Supreme Court in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe (1997) held that state sovereign immunity barred not only quiet title suits but also suits against state officials which would constitute {{the equivalent of}} quiet title. Although Coeur d'Alene involved sovereign title to a lake bed, this precedent {{has been applied to}} bar <b>even</b> <b>suits</b> against states in their capacity as ordinary property owners.|$|R
50|$|Brookens' {{twin brother}} Tim was also drafted in 1975 by the Texas Rangers; {{he was later}} traded to the Tigers organization, but never made the majors. In spring training, Tim and Tom would {{sometimes}} switch identities, <b>even</b> <b>suiting</b> up in each other's uniforms; Tim {{is believed to have}} played at least one exhibition game disguised as Tom. Their cousin, Ike Brookens, pitched for the Tigers in 1975, while Ike's son Casey Brookens also played in the minors in the 1990s before retiring to become a high school coach in Pennsylvania.|$|R
60|$|Sharp {{watched this}} graceless bedside with indomitable patience. Nothing escaped her; and, like a prudent steward, {{she found a}} use for everything. She told many a good story about Miss Crawley's illness in after days--stories which made the lady blush through her {{artificial}} carnations. During the illness she was never out of temper; always alert; she slept light, having a perfectly clear conscience; and could take that refreshment at almost any minute's warning. And so you saw very few traces of fatigue in her appearance. Her face might be a trifle paler, and the circles round her eyes a little blacker than usual; but whenever she came out from the sick-room she was always smiling, fresh, and neat, and looked as trim in her little dressing-gown and cap, as in her smartest <b>evening</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
60|$|Promptly, {{in twenty}} minutes, Absalom {{announced}} dinner, and, a moment later, the guest was ushered {{into the dining}} hall where Grandemont waited, standing, {{at the head of}} the table. The attentions of Louis had transformed the stranger into something resembling the polite animal. Clean linen and an old <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> that had been sent down from town to clothe a waiter had worked a miracle with his exterior. Brush and comb had partially subdued the wild disorder of his hair. Now he might have passed for no more extravagant a thing than one of those poseurs in art and music who affect such oddity of guise. The man's countenance and demeanour, as he approached the table, exhibited nothing of the awkwardness or confusion to be expected from his Arabian Nights change. He allowed Absalom to seat him at Grandemont's right hand with the manner of one thus accustomed to be waited upon.|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{across at}} our host, {{who had come}} down from New York {{specially}} in his magnificent private car, which was now awaiting his return on a siding of the little station. He was a hard-faced, elderly man, with a shrewd mouth and keen eyes, sparely built, yet a man you would be inclined to glance at twice in any assemblage. He wore a most unconventional <b>evening</b> <b>suit,</b> the waistcoat cut very high, and a plain black tie. Two footmen stood behind his chair, and a large florid lady, wearing a crown of diamonds, and with a European reputation for opulence, sat on his right hand. Neither seemed to embarrass him in the least, {{for the simple reason}} that he took no notice of them. He drank water, ate sparingly, and talked Wall Street with a man a few places down the table on the left. His speech was crisp and correct, but his intonation more distinctly American than any of his guests'. On the whole, I think he interested me more than any one else there.|$|E
50|$|Attendants or {{messengers}} in both Houses have, {{since the}} nineteenth century, worn a black <b>evening</b> dress <b>suit,</b> black waistcoat, white tie {{and a silver}} badge suspended from the neck.|$|R
60|$|Left {{to himself}} the plainsman {{looked around the}} hall which seemed a splendid and spacious one to him. It was filled with ladies in {{beautiful}} costumes, and with men in clawhammer coats. He had seen pictures of <b>evening</b> <b>suits</b> in the newspapers but never before had he been privileged to behold live men in them. The men seemed pale and puny for the most part. He had never before seen ladies in low-necked dresses and one just before him seemed shamelessly naked, and he gazed at her in astonishment. He was glad Mary had more modesty.|$|R
50|$|However, Cox {{was a very}} {{hands-on}} owner. He'd {{played baseball}} at Yale, and still {{thought of himself as}} a star athlete; believing the team needed to be better conditioned, he hired his high school track coach, Harold Bruce, as team trainer. Cox <b>even</b> <b>suited</b> up for workouts, and frequently showed up at the clubhouse before and after games. All of this grated on Harris, and when he protested against Cox's interference, Cox fired him on July 27 at a press conference, without bothering to inform Harris. The players threatened to go on strike in protest, but Harris urged them to drop those plans after Cox threatened legal action.|$|R
60|$|Had I {{been a man}} of {{any other}} age, I might have given myself up to my fate as one enchanted. But in these sceptical days miracles do not pass current. Here was some trick of psychology. What a drug and a steady stare could do, a drug and a steady stare, or some similar treatment, could surely undo. Men have lost their {{memories}} before. But to exchange memories as one does umbrellas! I laughed. Alas! not a healthy laugh, but a wheezing, senile titter. I could have fancied old Elvesham laughing at my plight, and a gust of petulant anger, unusual to me, swept across my feelings. I began dressing eagerly in the clothes I found lying about on the floor, and only realised when I was dressed {{that it was an}} <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> I had assumed. I opened the wardrobe and found some more ordinary clothes, a pair of plaid trousers, and an old-fashioned dressing-gown. I put a venerable smoking-cap on my venerable head, and, coughing a little from my exertions, tottered out upon the landing.|$|E
60|$|He {{had spent}} {{three months in}} London now, and except for that one Sunday at Hampstead had never talked to anyone but his fellow-clerks. One evening Watson asked him to dinner at a {{restaurant}} {{and they went to}} a music-hall together; but he felt shy and uncomfortable. Watson talked all the time of things he did not care about, and while he looked upon Watson as a Philistine he could not help admiring him. He was angry because Watson obviously set no store on his culture, and with his way of taking himself at the estimate at which he saw others held him he began to despise the acquirements which till then had seemed to him not unimportant. He felt {{for the first time the}} humiliation of poverty. His uncle sent him fourteen pounds a month and he had had to buy a good many clothes. His <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> cost him five guineas. He had not dared tell Watson that it was bought in the Strand. Watson said there was only one tailor in London.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' said Merton. 'This affair is {{very well}} organised. Your house is {{probably}} being observed. Now what I propose is this. I can go nowhere dressed as I am. You will, if you please, first send a constable, in uniform, to your house with orders to wait till you return. Next, I shall dress, by your permission, in any spare uniform you may have here and in that costume I shall leave this office and accompany you to your house in a closed cab. You will enter it, bring out a hat and cloak, come into the cab, and I shall put them on, leaving my policeman's helmet in the cab, which will wait. Then, minutes later, the constable will come out, take the cab, and drive to any police office you please. Once within your house, I shall exchange my uniform for any old <b>evening</b> <b>suit</b> {{you may be able}} to lend me, and, when your guests have departed, you and I will drive together to Professor Lumley's, where he will identify me. After that, my course is perfectly clear, and I need give you no further trouble.' ...|$|E
