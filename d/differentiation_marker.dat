40|$|The role of Notch {{signaling}} in growth/differentiation {{control of}} mammalian epithelial cells is still poorly defined. We show that keratinocyte-specific deletion of the Notch 1 gene results in marked epidermal hyperplasia and deregulated expression of multiple <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers.</b> In differentiating primary keratinocytes in vitro endogenous Notch 1 {{is required for}} induction of p 21 WAF 1 /Cip 1 expression, and activated Notch 1 causes growth suppression by inducing p 21 WAF 1 /Cip 1 expression. Activated Notch 1 also induces expression of ‘early’ <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers,</b> while suppressing the late markers. Induction of p 21 WAF 1 /Cip 1 expression and early <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> occur through two different mechanisms. The RBP-Jκ protein binds directly to the endogenous p 21 promoter and p 21 expression is induced specifically by activated Notch 1 through RBP-Jκ-dependent transcription.

Gamma-rays induced the expressions of <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> of keratin 1 and 10 (K 1 and 10), filaggrin, loricrin and SPR- 1 in normal keratinocytes when the Ca 2 + concentration was increased, and these phenomena were augmented in H 7 pretreated cells.

However, the factors and mechanisms controlling this process are not fully understood. We recently showed that oxidized phospholipids, including 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -(5 -oxovaleroyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POVPC), which accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions, are potent repressors of expression of SMC <b>differentiation</b> <b>marker</b> genes in cultured SMCs as well as in rat carotid arteries in vivo. Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms whereby POVPC induces suppression of SMC <b>differentiation</b> <b>marker</b> genes in cultured SMCs. Results showed that POVPC induced phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and Elk- 1. The MEK inhibitors U- 0126 and PD- 98059 attenuated POVPC-induced suppression of smooth muscle (SM) α-actin and SM-myosin heavy chain. POVPC also induced expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf 4). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that POVPC caused simultaneous binding of Elk- 1 and Klf 4 to the promoter region of the SM α-actin gene. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed a physical interaction between Elk- 1 and Klf 4.

In a yeast 2 -hybrid screen for proteins that interact with myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A), we identified the histone 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) -specific demethylase, Jmjd 1 a. GST pull-down assays demonstrated that Jmjd 1 a bound all 3 myocardin family members, and further mapping studies showed that the jumonjiC domain of Jmjd 1 a was sufficient to mediate this interaction. Overexpression of Jmjd 1 a in multipotential 10 T 1 / 2 cells decreased global levels of di-methyl H 3 K 9, stimulated the SM -actin and SM 22 promoters, and synergistically enhanced MRTF-A – and myocardin-dependent transactivation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we also demonstrated that TGF-–mediated upregulation of SMC differentia-tion marker gene expression in 10 T 1 / 2 cells was associated with decreased H 3 K 9 dimethylation at the CArG-containing regions of the SMC <b>differentiation</b> <b>marker</b> gene promoters. Importantly, knockdown of Jmjd 1 a in 10 T 1 / 2 cells and primary rat aortic SMCs by retroviral delivery of siRNA attenuated TGF-–induced upregulation of endogenous SM myosin heavy chain expression.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the phenotype of rat MLE with human MLE, in order to gain insight into the nature of MLE and its potential role in the development of BE. Methods Serial sectioning was performed on tissue samples from 32 EGDA rats and 13 patients with established BE. Tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for a variety of transcription factors and <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> of esophageal squamous epithelium and intestinal columnar epithelium. Results We detected MLE in 56. 3 % (18 / 32) of EGDA rats, and in all human samples. As expected, both rat and human squamous epithelium, but not intestinal metaplasia, expressed squamous transcription factors and <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> (p 63, Sox 2, CK 14 and CK 4) in all cases. Both rat and human intestinal metaplasia, but not squamous epithelium, expressed intestinal transcription factors and <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> (Cdx 2, GATA 4, HNF 1 α, villin and Muc 2) in all cases.

In this study, we investigated whether rhodopsin is expressed and plays any physiological roles in the normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs).

In the present study we test the hypothesis that the tumoral prostatic cell line (PC- 3) secretes factors that block the osteoblast differentiation process, resulting in an increase of the relative size of the proliferative cell pool. Our results, using fetal rat calvaria cells in culture, show that conditioned medium from PC- 3 cells (PC- 3 CM) stimulates osteoblast proliferation and inhibits both alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity (an early <b>differentiation</b> <b>marker)</b> and the mineralization process, measured as calcium accumulation (late <b>differentiation</b> <b>marker).</b> The inhibition of the expression of AP and mineralization depends on the presence of PC- 3 CM during the proliferative phase of culture and suggests that both processes occur in a nonsimultaneous fashion. The inhibitory effect of PC- 3 CM was not reverted by dexamethasone, which would indicate that prostatic-derived factors and the glucocorticoid do not share a common site of action. Measurement of the proliferative capacity of subcultures from control and treated cells demonstrates that PC- 3 CM treatment induces the maintenance of the proliferative potential that characterizes undifferentiated precursor cells.

40|$|Background-—Vascular proliferative {{diseases}} such as atherosclerosis are inflammatory disorders involving multiple cell types including macrophages, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Although activation of the nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) pathway in vessels {{has been shown to}} be critical for the progression of vascular diseases, the cell-autonomous role of NF-jB within SMCs has not been fully understood. Methods and Results-—We generated SMC-selective truncated IjB expressing (SM 22 a-Cre/IjBDN) mice, in which NF-jB was inhibited selectively in SMCs, and analyzed their phenotype following carotid injury. Results showed that neointima formation was markedly reduced in SM 22 a-Cre/IjBDN mice after injury. Although vascular injury induced downregulation of expression of SMC <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> and myocardin, a potent activator of SMC <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers,</b> repression of these markers and myocardin was attenuated in SM 22 a-Cre/IjBDN mice. Consistent with these findings, NF-jB activation by interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) decreased expression of SMC <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> as well as myocardin in cultured SMCs. Inhibition of NF-jB signaling by BAY 11 - 7082 attenuated repressive effects of IL- 1 b. Of interest, Kr€uppel-like factor 4 (Klf 4), a transcription factor critical for regulating SMC differentiation and proliferation, was also involved in IL- 1 b-mediated myocardin repression. Promoter analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that NF-jB repressed myocardin by binding to the myocardin promoter region in concert with Klf 4. Conclusions-—These results provide novel evidence that activation of the NF-jB pathway cell-autonomously mediates SM...|$|R
40|$|The {{epithelial}} cells lining the proximal tubules of the kidney mediate complex transport processes and {{are particularly vulnerable}} to drug toxicity. Drug toxicity studies are classically based on two-dimensional cultures of immortalized proximal tubular cells. Such immortalized cells are dedifferentiated, and lose transport properties (including saturable endocytic uptake) encountered in vivo. Generating differentiated, organotypic human microtissues would potentially alleviate these limitations and facilitate drug toxicity studies. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of kidney microtissues from immortalized (HK- 2) and primary (HRPTEpiC) human renal proximal tubular {{epithelial cells}} under well-defined conditions. Microtissue cultures were done in hanging drop GravityPLUS™ culture plates and were characterized for morphology, proliferation and <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers,</b> and by monitoring the endocytic uptake of albumin. Kidney microtissues were successfully obtained by co-culturing HK- 2 or HRPTEpiC cells with fibroblasts. The HK- 2 microtissues formed highly proliferative, but dedifferentiated microtissues within 10  days of culture, while co-culture with fibroblasts yielded spherical structures already after 2  days. Low passage HRPTEpiC microtissues (mono- and co-culture) were less proliferative and expressed tissue-specific <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers.</b> Electron microscopy evidenced epithelial <b>differentiation</b> <b>markers</b> including microvilli, tight junctions, endosomes, and lysosomes in the co-cultured HRPTEpiC microtissues. The co-cultured HRPTEpiC microtissues showed specific uptake of albumin that could be inhibited by cadmium and gentamycin. In conclusion, we established a reliable hanging drop protocol to obtain functional kidney microtissues with proximal tubular epithelial cell lines. These microtissues {{could be used for}} high-throughput drug and toxicology screenings, with endocytosis as a functional readout...|$|R
