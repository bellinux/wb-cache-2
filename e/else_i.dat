25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything <b>else</b> <b>I</b> can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the {{nationalisation}} {{was perceived}} as {{a direct threat to}} British interests. In a letter to the British Ambassador on 10 September 1956, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office wrote: If we sit back while Nasser consolidates his position and gradually acquires control of the oil-bearing countries, he can and is, according to our information, resolved to wreck us. If Middle Eastern oil is denied to us for a year or two, our gold reserves will disappear. If our gold reserves disappear, the sterling area disintegrates. If the sterling area disintegrates and we have no reserves, we shall not be able to maintain a force in Germany, or indeed, anywhere <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> doubt whether we shall be able to pay for the bare minimum necessary for our defence. And a country that cannot provide for its defence is finished.|$|E

25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what <b>else</b> <b>I</b> can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing <b>Else</b> <b>I</b> Can Say)" [...] is {{credited}} as a ballad {{compared to the}} rest of the dance-fuelled tracks from The Fame. It is a 1980s-influenced synthpop and bubblegum pop song, while incorporating the [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] hook from Rihanna's single [...] "Umbrella", according to Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post. Gaga stated that the lyrics of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing <b>Else</b> <b>I</b> Can Say)" [...] are about love and she explained that [...] "'Eh, Eh' is my simple pop song about finding someone new and breaking up with the old boyfriend." [...] Writer James E. Perone mentioned in his book The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations that with the lyrics, Gaga maintained a focus on transitory relationships. Although the lyrics explained her former lover that she had found someone new and did not mean to hurt him with the news, the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "nothing <b>else</b> <b>I</b> can say" [...] solidifies the transient nature of the relationship portrayed. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B3 to C5 with the main key in which the song is set being E major. The song follows in the chord progression of E–B–Fm–E–B–Fm. Synthpop musician Frankmusik remixed the track for Gaga's 2010 album, The Remix, where he manipulated Gaga's vocals and created a dreamy quality with them, as noted by Nicki Escuedo from Phoenix New Times.|$|E

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "the breezy island vibe and soft demeanor of 'Eh, Eh (Nothing <b>Else</b> <b>I</b> Can Say)' is hard to buy when sandwiched between songs like 'Poker Face' and 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.'" [...] In another article analysing about the music videos released by Gaga, Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] as a track [...] "is an intriguing case: rather than the tech-assisted sexy-androgynous dance pop that dominates a good chunk of The Fame, it and its sister tracks 'Brown Eyes' and 'Again Again' are evidence of a stripped-down, simpler, sincere Gaga.|$|E
