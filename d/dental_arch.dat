25|$|Along {{with the}} {{formation}} of the dental lamina, 10 round epithelial structures, each referred to as a bud, develop at the distal aspect of the dental lamina of each arch. These correspond to the 10 primary teeth of each <b>dental</b> <b>arch,</b> and they signify the bud stage of tooth development. Each bud is separated from the ectomesenchyme by a basement membrane. Ectomesenchymal cells congregate deep to the bud, forming a cluster of cells, which is the initiation of the condensation of the ectomesenchyme. The remaining ectomesenchymal cells are arranged in a more or less haphazardly uniform fashion.|$|E
25|$|The Cochrane {{review of}} {{surgical}} removal versus retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth {{suggests that the}} presence of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontal disease affecting adjacent 2nd molar (measured by distal probing depth > 4mm on that tooth) in the long term, however it is of very low quality evidence and high risk of bias. Another study which was at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has an effect on crowding in the <b>dental</b> <b>arch.</b> There is also insufficient evidence to highlight a difference in risk of decay with or without impacted wisdom tooth.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{verify the}} {{presence}} and degree of asymmetry of <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> in Brazilian individuals with natural normal occlusion and Class II, Divisions 1 and 2 malocclusions. METHODS: The study evaluated the symmetry of the maxillary and mandibular <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> of 180 pairs of dental casts, divided into: Group I = 60 pairs of natural normal occlusion individuals; Group II = 60 pairs of Class II, Division 1 malocclusion individuals; and Group III = 60 pairs of Class II, Division 2 malocclusion individuals. A device {{was used to measure}} dental midline deviation and the canine tip in the <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> (in degrees). It was also verified the distance of the upper canines from the palatal suture, intercanine distance, and anteroposterior upper and lower first molar position. RESULTS: <b>Dental</b> <b>arches</b> of individuals from all groups presented asymmetry, regardless of the presence of malocclusion. Group I showed a lower asymmetry degree in relation to Groups II and III. The asymmetry in Groups II and III was similar. CONCLUSION: The <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> of individuals with natural normal occlusion and with Class II, Division 1 and Division 2 malocclusions showed asymmetry. The asymmetry degree was higher in the mandibular <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> than in the maxillary <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> in all 3 evaluated groups...|$|R

2500|$|A 1998 study {{suggested}} that breastfed babies {{have a better}} chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway.

The report {{suggested that}} children with a well rounded, [...] "U-shaped" [...] <b>dental</b> <b>arch,</b> which is found more commonly in breastfed children, may have fewer problems with snoring and sleep apnea in later life.

According to Chris Stringer, Homo heidelbergensis ranks separable between earlier Homo erectus and the more recent Neanderthal and Homo sapiens; it is {{from this point of}} view the last common ancestor of Neanderthal and anatomically modern man.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{assessed}} decayed/missing/filled teeth (DMFT), {{presence of}} occlusal units, and prevalence of shortened <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> in a Tanzanian adult population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dental state of {{samples of the}} Tanzanian population was studied. Oral examinations were conducted on 5, 532 adults from rural and urban cluster samples. DMFT was related to age, gender, and residence. The pattern of tooth loss within <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> was mapped, and the prevalence of shortened <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> was estimated. RESULTS: Mean DMFT scores increased gradually from 1. 8 (20 - to 29 -year-olds) to 3. 8 (50 - to 59 -year-olds). A steep increase was observed in the > or = 60 -year-olds (DMFT 8. 1). "Missing" was the dominant component of DMFT. The mean number of present teeth ranged from 27 in the youngest to 20 in the oldest age group. Under 60 years of age, DMFT was significantly higher for women than for men. No {{differences were found between}} residence categories. Molars were more frequently decayed, missing, and mobile than premolars. Of all subjects, 41 % had complete <b>dental</b> <b>arches,</b> 44 % had interruptions (of these, 73 % were in posterior regions only), and 15 % had shortened dental arches; 0. 5 % were edentulous. Of the subjects with shortened <b>dental</b> <b>arches,</b> about 65 % had at minimum three pairs of occluding premolars. CONCLUSION: An initial low DMFT rate increased after the age of 60 years. Molars had the highest risk of dental decay and were most frequently absent. Shortened <b>dental</b> <b>arches</b> develop {{as a consequence of the}} pattern of tooth decay and tooth loss, although interruptions were frequently seen in the posterior regions...|$|R

2500|$|Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations {{in spite}} of vocal tract anatomy {{differences}} in size and shape due to gender, age and individual anatomical variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: dentists recognize three basic shapes of palate: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of malocclusion between the two jaws; nine ways teeth relate to the <b>dental</b> <b>arch</b> and {{a wide range of}} maxillary and mandible deformities. [...] Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and dental caries. Other factors that do not impede [...] the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation [...] are gross oral deformations such as hare-lips, cleft palates or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in ventriloquism). Paranasal sinuses [...] vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their [...] asymmetry.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases where}} the post space {{is not a good}} match for a {{prefabricated}} post, a cast post and core can be custom fabricated for the tooth. [...] A resin pattern is produced by placing a preformed plastic [...] "burnout" [...] post into the post space [...] and a resin material, such as Duralay resin, is used to build up the tooth to the proper dimensions. [...] When this is completed, the pattern resin/plastic post is removed from the tooth structure and attached to a sprue former, much {{in the same way as}} a is done with the wax pattern of a crown, and a single-unit cast post and core can thus be fabricated out of gold, titanium or another metal using the lost-wax technique. Where a metal post could be difficult to conceal a custom post made of zirconia oxide can be made; its tooth colour leaves less of a shadow under the final restoration. Alternatively, an impression can be taken of the post space and <b>dental</b> <b>arch</b> [...] using a plastic post and a polyvinyl siloxane impression material, and this used to construct a suitable post in the dental laboratory.|$|E

50|$|Chamberland and Profitt in 2011 {{published}} {{a paper in}} AJODO which looked at long-term and short-term effects of SARPE procedure.
