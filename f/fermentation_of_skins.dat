40|$|Cassava tuber skin is a {{by-product}} of cassava chip industry, solid state fermented using mixed inorganic nitrogen and Aspergillus niger. The fermentation process was carried out for 3 - 4 days. The chemical changing during <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> cassava tuber <b>skin</b> and its utilization in broiler chicken ration were studied. After fermentation showed that the crude protein, crude protein digestibility, crude fat, ash, Ca, Ca digestibility, P, and P digestibility improved. The contents of crude protein and its digestibility improved from 4. 80 % and 66. 90 % to 28. 00 % and 72. 00 %, respectively. The crude fat content improved from 1. 32 % to 1. 80 %. The ash content improved from 7. 80 % to 9. 20 %, {{this was followed by}} improving of Ca and P from 0. 97 % and 0. 11 % to 1. 69 % and 0. 68 %, respectively. Also the Ca and P digestibilities improved from 81. 10 % and 14. 10 % to 93. 20 % and 52. 00 %, respectively. The crude fiber content decreased from 21, 20 % to 14, 96 %, cianide acid (HCN) and urea contents also decreased. The result of feeding trial showed that the inclusion of fermented cassava tuber skin up to 10 % in chicken broiler ration for 4 weeks feeding showed that the feed consumption, bodyweight gain and FCR were not different significantly (P> 0. 05). However, 15 % inclusion reduced bodyweight gain and increased significantly FCR (P< 0. 05).

The purpose of study on the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> sugar as a mosquito attractant is to determine whether there is any difference in the number of mosquitoes trapped by the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> sugar concentration variation and long of observation. This research was conducted at the center for Environmental health Engineering field. This study is quasi-experimental, and the method used is Completely Randomized Factorial Design (RAL) The first factor is fermented of sugar concentration which are; 0 %, 5 %, 15 %, 25 %, and 35 %. The second factor is long observation on day- 1, day- 2, day- 3, day- 4, day- 5, and day- 6. This study was conducted from March until June 2015 [...] The sample used in this study is 300 adult mosquitoes for each treatment. Data were analyzed using Kruskal Wallis Statistical test and continued Duncan test. The result showed that there is a difference <b>of</b> five variations <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> sugar concentration on the number of mosquitoes trapped. There is no difference in the number of mosquitoes trapped with long observations. <b>Fermentation</b> <b>of</b> sugar concentration in 35 % indicates as the effective concentration because there is a significant difference from five other variations <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> sugar concentration. The higher sugar material, the stronger the adhesion <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> sugar. Long observation of the number of mosquitoes trapped showed that there is no significant difference from day to day- 2 until day- 5, and start decline at day- 6. <b>Fermentation</b> <b>of</b> sugar can be used as an alternative for vector control especially the mosquito as the safe attractant for the environment and humans.
