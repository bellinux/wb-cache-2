[...] "But {{let me tell you}} the harm that I conceive has been done by all the governors who have had anything to do with the subject; and that <b>includes</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> party to which I am opposed, and two that are not. In the first place, they have all treated the matter as if the tenants had really some cause of complaint; when in truth all their griefs arise from the fact that other men will not let them have their property just as they may want it, and in some respects on their own terms." ...|$|E
5000|$|Moncrieff {{was one of}} five {{founding}} members of the digital art collective called [...] "Unique Editions". These five artists—Helen Golden, Bonny Lhotka, Dorothy Krause, Judith Moncrieff, and Karin Schminke—combined their expertise in traditional studio media and techniques with digital imaging to produce original fine art and editions. The artists met in June, 1994, at [...] "Beyond the Digital Print", a workshop organized by Krause at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. The artists' varied backgrounds are evident in their mixed media approach to using the computer as an art-making tool. Although every image is conceived and executed {{at least in part}} on the computer, the range of work <b>includes</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kind paintings, collages, Polaroid and image transfers, monotypes and prints on such varied substrates as canvas, handmade paper, and embossed metal. Moncrieff used the term [...] "Tradigital media" [...] to describe this merging of traditional and digital tools and [...] "tradigitalism" [...] as a name for this emerging movement. Unique Editions also served as a research and public relations entity for exploring technologies and promoting digital art. The group forged links with hardware and software developers in an effort to provide feedback on their products from the artist's perspective. It served as a demonstration {{to the rest of the}} art world of the role of digital technologies in the artist's studio. Unique Editions became inactive in 1997; however, Golden and Moncrieff continued to work together under the name, [...] "Tradigital Fine Art".|$|E
40|$|Amplifying {{an entire}} {{double-stranded}} plasmid by an inverse {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) using a pair of tail-to-tail primers is a particularly efficient approach for introducing changes into DNA sequences. However, the approach generally works best for plasmids less than 5 Kb {{and it can be}} difficult to amplify the large multicomponent vectors that are used for protein expression in various eukaryotic cells. We have therefore adopted an alternative approach in which two smaller PCR products are generated and then ligated to produce the complete plasmid. A mutagenic primer is used to introduce the desired change and each reaction <b>includes</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pair of tail-to-tail primers from within an antibiotic resistance gene contained on the plasmid so that the two PCR products contain complementing parts of the complete gene. Ligating the two products generates various combinations but only the correctly ligated molecules recreate the antibiotic resistance gene and are able to replicate in Escherichia coli. When combined with methods to minimize the carryover of template plasmid, this can be an efficient way of introducing mutations into large plasmids...|$|E
