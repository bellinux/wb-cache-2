5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of {{nothing more than}} a scouring pad, a rusted spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar. The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E
25|$|The Manchester Phoenix {{was without}} {{any form of}} {{official}} or unofficial supporters group until midway through the 2009–10 season, when the official Manchester Phoenix Supporters Club (MPSC) was launched. Currently, the supporters club is actively engaged in the raising of funds for the team, and has run a number of events designed to do as such. The Supporters Club also helped to pay the wages {{of one of the}} players during the 2009–10 season, and <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> during the 2010–11 season. The Supporters Club is run by an elected board of volunteers, taken from the membership.|$|E
500|$|... "Lunch Time Cypher" [...] {{was meant}} to give {{the feeling of a}} high school cypher, {{complete}} with beatboxing, random, crazy lyrics from Hopsin, and featured artists Passionate MC and G-Mo Skee. The song [...] "What's My Purpose" [...] is, according to Hopsin, [...] "about a human born into this current dark society. How everybody <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. Nobody is really different. And the government has us here to just make money." [...] He also touches on his race-related arrest after a concert in Orlando, Florida. The album's outro [...] "Caught In the Rain" [...] discusses about how Hopsin is soul-searching and needing to find himself.|$|E

500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, {{as well as the}} record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics on {{the release of}} the album. Alex Young of Consequence of Sound gave the song a positive review writing that the song [...] "may be the best of this collection [...] ", adding that [...] "this track is primed for radio; a soft, sincere piano-driven song about a lost love that has now gone belts the vulnerable Mars." [...] Yahoo!'s music critic, Sherri Thornhill, praised the song, calling it a [...] "beauty" [...] and [...] "relatable", since the lyrics show the [...] "heartbroken lover" [...] wish that his former lover <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as he is - talking to the moon. The Seattle Post-Intelligencers reviewer, Tyrone S. Reid, considered the song [...] "beautifully written, waxing poetic about love and longing – a forte that the singer employs with great results in his work." [...] In a similar review, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly felt that the debut studio album [...] "aptly applies Mars’ studio talents...in his own postmillennial way", calling [...] "Talking to the Moon" [...] "woebegone", adding that [...] "a malt-shop heart beats beneath [...] digital skin". Emily Yang of The Signal stated that Mars [...] "focuses on the slow pace of the drums and piano to convey his sorrow. He sings of loneliness which is almost palpable in the chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] was premiered in MSN Spain on January 1, 2011. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News said, [...] "There {{comes a time}} in every pop princess' career when she must throw a sexy dance party and {{proclaim}} her womanhood. Back in 2001 Britney Spears did as much in 'I'm a Slave 4 U,' and this week, Miley Cyrus <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in the video for her club-ready track 'Who Owns My Heart.'" [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly assumed {{the theme of the}} video were the divergent hairstyles, but acclaimed the video for its fun. [...] Stransky said the sultry aspect of the video added to its frothy, [...] "thumpa-thumpa deliciousness". Edith Zimmerman of New York magazine viewed it as [...] "awkward". Megan Vick of Billboard thought the video followed the same steps as the video for [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] — dark lighting, lots of bare Cyrus parts and writhing around on flat surfaces. Vick recalled Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] video when seeing the bathroom scene and viewed the ending as a relief. Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, criticized the video for its suggestiveness and sexual elements. Winter continued, [...] "It is unfortunate that she would participate in such a sexualized video like this one. It sends messages to her fanbase that are diametrically opposed to everything she has done up to this point. Miley built her fame and fortune entirely on the backs of young girls, and it saddens us that she seems so eager to distance herself from that fanbase so rapidly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Springsteen himself remarked {{upon the}} {{distance}} the song had travelled, saying: [...] “You write ‘The Rising’ for this, it gets {{picked up and}} used for that, so you end up here. If someone had told me in 2001 that ‘you’re going to sing this song at the inaugural concert for the first African-American president,’ I’d have said, ‘Huh?’ But eight years go by, and that’s where you find yourself. You’re in there, you’re swimming in the current of history and your music <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing.” ...|$|E

He tells me that every one he knows <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. My servant has been out this morning eight times and has been buying eggs. She has brought a hundred each time, and we are putting them in a cask in salt." ...|$|E
60|$|For myself, I am glad. I am {{glad that}} the era of love and oneness is over: hateful {{homogeneous}} world-oneness. I am glad that Russia flies back into savage Russianism, Scythism, savagely self-pivoting. I am glad that America <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> I shall be glad when men hate their common, world-alike clothes, when they tear them up and clothe themselves fiercely for distinction, savage distinction, savage distinction against {{the rest of the}} creeping world: when America kicks the billy-cock and the collar-and-tie into limbo, and takes to her own national costume: when men fiercely react against looking all alike and being all alike, and betake themselves into vivid clan or nation-distinctions.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Chesterton understands it. Further, {{he gives}} us credit for {{understanding}} it. He has nothing of that paltry meanness or strange density {{of so many of}} his colleagues, who put us down as aimless iconoclasts or moral anarchists. He admits that we are waging a thankless war for what we take to be Truth and Progress. He <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> But why, in the name of all that is reasonable, should we, when we are agreed on the momentousness of the issue either way, forthwith desert serious methods of conducting the controversy? Why, when the vital need of our time is to induce men and women to collect their thoughts occasionally, and be men and women--nay, to remember that they are really gods that hold the destinies of humanity on their knees--why should we think that this kaleidoscopic play of phrases is inopportune? The ballets of the Alhambra, and the fireworks of the Crystal Palace, and Mr. Chesterton's Daily News articles, have their place in life. But how a serious social student can think of curing the thoughtlessness of our generation by strained paradoxes; of giving people a sane grasp of social problems by literary sleight-of-hand; of settling important questions by a reckless shower of rocket-metaphors and inaccurate 'facts,' and the substitution of imagination for judgment, I cannot see." ...|$|E
