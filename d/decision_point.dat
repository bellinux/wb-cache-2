5|$|The {{proposal}} for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups. This proposed barrage would pass two miles (3km) west of Flat Holm. The study is expected to last {{at least two years}} and will be split into two stages with a <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> at the end of each.

500|$|During {{the initial}} {{planning}} stage, the team reviewed how fans and critics {{had responded to}} Awakening. While the gameplay and graphics were positively received, the story had been criticized for its quality by the main fan base, even though new players approved of it. To that end, they decided {{to write a story}} that would appeal to series veterans as well as newcomers. The concept of the story changing depending on which protagonists the main character sided with, originated from Yamagami's memories of the , which allowed for choosing different protagonists but did not change the story. Wanting to play from both sides of a conflict and show both sides as neither good nor evil, the team decided to create multiple versions of the game. Initially, the plan was just for a choice between one kingdom or the other, but Yamagami wanted a neutral path where neither side was chosen, so a third version of the game was planned. The game's Japanese title, [...] "If", came from the sheer number of choices featured for players in the game. The English title [...] "Fates" [...] referred to the concept of the main character shaping and changing their fate by choosing a side. After the creation of the three storylines, the team needed to make the decision to divide Birthright and Conquest into separate physical releases. This was because packaging them as a single release would have necessitated raising the game's price to the equivalent of a two-game bundle, which would not benefit people who wanted to play one single version. Another reason for this decision was how easy it had become to add the other versions on as cheaper downloadable content (DLC). This opened up the option for players to run through the game until the crucial <b>decision</b> <b>point</b> in Chapter 5, then buy the alternate routes as downloadable content so they had different choices. Each route was estimated to have the same amount of gameplay and story content as Awakening.|$|E
500|$|The two kingdoms {{were based}} upon {{different}} cultures: Hoshido was themed after Japan, while Nohr used a Medieval European setting similar to earlier Fire Emblem games. The kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr {{were designed to}} contrast {{each other in a}} variety of ways, with the most obvious being its architecture: Hoshido was themed around light and air, while Nohr was themed around darkness and stone. When development first started, the team unanimously decided to ask Kozaki to return as character designer, as he had been for Awakening. The sheer number of characters this approach entailed made the staff worry about whether Kozaki would be willing to return. The Hoshido characters' clothing were influenced by Japanese culture and character designs drew inspiration from well-known people in Japan: a main instance was Ryoma, whose clothing was based on samurai, including historical figures such as Takeda Shingen, along with incorporating animal motifs such as lions. The colors used in their clothing were varied and mainly bright to emphasize the country's focus on light. For Nohr, a [...] "vampire-like taste" [...] equivalent to dark fantasy was used to highlight it as a kingdom where the sun did not shine. Kozaki used black and purple as key colors in character designs to create a cold and unified image. The nobility of Nohr were given similar design elements to represent their familial connections. The first character Kozaki designed was the Avatar. Kozaki did not put much thought into their general appearance, but took care about their clothing so that it was not overtly styled after either Hoshido or Nohr, keeping the neutrality of the player up to the main story <b>decision</b> <b>point.</b> They were given bare feet due to the animalistic impression Kozaki had after hearing of their strong ties to dragons, along with creating a [...] "hook" [...] for players equivalent to other characters in the game. The main key artwork, showing the two families together, was described by Kozaki as [...] "a pain to draw" [...] due to their clashing designs, and was the point of much discussion by staff before it was finalized. Azura was not included in artwork for the two physical editions, but she was more prominently presented in artwork surrounding Revelation as she played a much larger role in the story.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> is {{introduced}} {{as a tool}} for analyzing computational processes in dendritic trees. Using this concept, a simplified model of a dendritic tree is derived. The various nonlinear processes in dendritic trees are interpreted as "computational decisions" made at "decision points". This simplified model provides insights into the possible role of dendritic geometry and passive biophysical properties such as R m and R i. First, we demonstrate the computational limitations of passive dendritic trees in which the inputs are modeled as current injections. The advantage of adding nonlinearities into dendritic trees is then demonstrated, by analyzing the spatio-temporal integration properties of various nonlinear <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> at the dendritic tree. Distal dendritic <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> are found to be suitable for performing coincidence detection of synaptic events, while proximal and somatic <b>decision</b> <b>points</b> tend to act as integrators of synaptic inputs.
