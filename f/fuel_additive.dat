25|$|Toluene is now {{often used}} as a {{substitute}} for benzene, for instance as a <b>fuel</b> <b>additive.</b> The solvent-properties of the two are similar, but toluene is less toxic and has a wider liquid range. Toluene is also processed into benzene.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for fuel {{has forced the}} world to adapt and seek alternatives. This paper studied the most effective blend of <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> which can reduce fuel consumption and increase engine performance. Firstly, <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> used in the aftermarket were analysed using GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry). The analysis indicated that the <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> chemical compositions consist of combustion improver, antiknock, deposit control, oxygenates and also fuel stabilizer. After that, new formulated blends of <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> were produced based on the result data obtained from the GC-MS. The dynamometer test using 4 cylinders spark ignition (SI) engine {{was carried out in}} order to compare the baseline fuel and the new formulated blends of <b>fuel</b> <b>additives.</b> It was found that the additives blend of 29. 03 % kerosene, 10. 75 % acetone, 38. 71 % methanol and 21. 51 % toluene, was proven to be the most promising. The blend helped increase engine torque performance and also reduced fuel consumption up to 13 %. This finding shows a huge potential to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel...|$|R

25|$|Alternatively, coal-derived syngas can be {{converted}} into transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel through additional treatment via the Fischer-Tropsch process or into methanol which itself {{can be used as}} transportation fuel or <b>fuel</b> <b>additive,</b> or which can {{be converted}} into gasoline by the methanol to gasoline process.

25|$|The European Fuel Oxygenates Association (EFOA) credits methyl Ttertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl ter-butyl ether (ETBE) as {{the most}} {{commonly}} used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound. Although Europeans still use bio-ether additives, the US no longer has an oxygenate requirement therefore bio-ethers are no longer used as the main <b>fuel</b> <b>additive.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>additives</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a potential mitigation option for contrails.

25|$|The report {{acknowledged}} that a redesign {{of the fuel}} system would not be practical in the near-term, and suggested two ways to {{lower the risk of}} recurrence. One was to use a <b>fuel</b> <b>additive</b> (FSII) that prevents water ice from forming down to −40°C. Western air forces have used FSII for decades, and although it is not widely used in commercial aviation, it is nonetheless approved for the 777.|$|E
25|$|However, the MWR {{team had}} a {{disastrous}} season. In February, Waltrip's teams were disallowed from their starting {{spots in the}} Daytona 500 due to an illegal <b>fuel</b> <b>additive.</b> The team members each faced a $100,000 fine and many team members were suspended. Though they backed up their qualifications by using back-up cars they suffered a terrible year. The team was unable to recover, failing to qualify for many events and losing sponsors such as Burger King and Domino's Pizza. Waltrip partnered with British-American billionaire Rob Kauffman as a 50% co-owner in order to fix the problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{largest single}} use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and <b>fuel</b> <b>additive.</b> Brazil in {{particular}} relies heavily upon {{the use of}} ethanol as an engine fuel, {{due in part to}} its role as the globe's leading producer of ethanol. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% anhydrous ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country. Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration. The US and many other countries primarily use E10 (10% ethanol, sometimes known as gasohol) and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures.|$|E

2500|$|MTBE is {{manufactured}} via {{the chemical}} reaction of methanol and isobutylene.

2500|$|After {{successfully}} {{running the}} midget at some hillclimbing events in 1951, Brabham {{became interested in}} road racing. He bought and modified a series of racing cars from the Cooper Car Company, a British constructor, and from 1953 concentrated on this form of racing, in which drivers compete on closed tarmac circuits. He was supported by his father and by the Redex <b>fuel</b> <b>additive</b> company, although his commercially aware approach—including the title RedeX Special painted {{on the side of}} his Cooper-Bristol—did not go down well with the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS), which banned the advertisement. Brabham competed in Australia and New Zealand until early 1955, taking [...] "a long succession of victories", including the 1953 Queensland Road Racing championship. During this time, he picked up the nickname [...] "Black Jack", which has been variously attributed to his dark hair and stubble, to his [...] "ruthless" [...] approach on the track, and to his [...] "propensity for maintaining a shadowy silence". After the 1954 New Zealand Grand Prix, Brabham was persuaded by Dean Delamont, competitions manager of the Royal Automobile Club in the United Kingdom, to try a season of racing in Europe, then the international centre of road racing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>{{additives}}</b> are additives {{that are}} added to fuel in small quantities to give improvement in terms of engine performance and emissions. Aftermarket <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> {{can be divided into}} two, chemical-based and bio-based. In this project, the effect of bio-based <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> on engine performance and exhaust emissions of a petrol and diesel engine is studied. The blending ratio is developed based on the instruction given on the bottle of the additives. The ratio of the <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> used for Vivo Racing (VR) is between 0. 21 % and 0. 25 %, Vivo Flawless (VF) is between 0. 10 % and 0. 14 % and Diesel Energy is between 0. 14 % and 0. 18 %. Constant throttle test had been done on both petrol and diesel engine. The results show that the <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> reduce brake power and brake specific fuel consumption while increasing brake thermal efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions. For brake power, VR 0. 24 is the best. For brake specific fuel consumption, the best are VR 0. 23 and VF 0. 11 for petrol and diesel engine respectively. For brake thermal efficiency, the best are VR 0. 24 and DE 0. 17. For HC composition, the lowest are VR 0. 25 and DE 0. 17. For CO composition, VR 0. 22 and DE 0. 14 are the lowest. As for NOx, the lowest are VR 0. 25 and DE 0. 17...|$|R
