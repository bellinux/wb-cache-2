2500|$|After {{the catastrophic}} 2010–2011 Queensland floods, Nalliah {{declared}} on his website [...] "at once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> Kevin Rudd speaking against Israel in Israel on 14thDecember 2010. It {{is very interesting}} that Kevin Rudd is from QLD. Is God trying to get our attention? Yes, I believe so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{was less}} {{enthusiastic}} in the Chicago Sun-Times, giving the film {{two out of}} four stars and claiming that it was [...] "hard to follow". He felt the film lacked a confident grasp on its characters' roles in a story [...] "awash in elaborate special effects, sensational sets, apocalyptic scenes of destruction and {{a general lack of}} discipline". Ebert wrote positively of certain scenes, especially one in which [...] "Sam moves into half an office and finds himself engaged in a tug-of-war over his desk with the man through the wall. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> a Chaplin film, Modern Times, and reminded, too, that in Chaplin economy and simplicity were virtues, not the enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevenson {{did not use}} {{television}} as effectively as his Republican opponent, war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{and was unable to}} rally the New Deal voting coalition for one last hurrah. On election day, Eisenhower won the national popular vote by 55% to 45%. [...] Stevenson lost heavily outside the Solid South; he carried only nine states and lost the Electoral College vote 442 to 89. In his concession speech on election night, Stevenson said: [...] "Someone asked me...how I felt, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> a story that a fellow townsman of ours used to tell – Abraham Lincoln. He said he felt like the little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark. He said that he was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like the Clinton {{campaign}} in 1996, Obama avoided discussing McCain's age directly, instead preferring to simply call his ideas and message [...] "old" [...] and [...] "old hat". He {{also made a}} strong appeal to youth voters and back during his primary contest with Hillary Clinton, had stated [...] "When I watched the feud between the Clintons and [...] unfold during the 1990s, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> old quarrels started on college campuses long ago. It's {{time for a new}} generation to take over." [...] Obama's active use of a Blackberry and other modern technology also stood in contrast to the Arizona Senator's admission that he did not use a computer or a cell phone. McCain's service in Vietnam, while marketable to baby boomers, was referred to as [...] "unimportant" [...] to younger voters.|$|E

50|$|It is humiliating for any {{author to}} have failed so signally {{in what he}} set out to do. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> Congreve's witticism that bad portraitists are obliged to write the name of their sitters at the bottom.

40|$|It is {{challenging}} {{to lay out}} in 10 – 15 minutes {{what can be done}} to improve the current international financial and monetary system. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the story of the woman who was drafting an obituary after her 80 -year-old husband passed away.

60|$|Next I saw Miriam was the {{following}} day. I {{met her in}} the court of Pilate's palace. She seemed in a dream. Scarce her eyes saw me. Scarce her wits embraced my identity. So strange was she, so in daze and amaze and far-seeing were her eyes, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the lepers I had seen healed in Samaria.|$|E
60|$|Watching the {{struggle}} to capture and subdue the section of bridge, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> Victor Hugo's splendid description of the sailor's battle with a ship's gun gone adrift in a night of storm.

40|$|Thinking about Martin Stokhof as a friend, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> our {{pleasant}} get-togethers {{to discuss}} the meaning of life, {{and the art of}} living it, of our fruitful collaboration in writing a overview of dynamic logic, and of our times together at the Aikido club of Eric Louw. Thinking about Martin Stokhof as a philosopher and colleague, his formal analysis (together with Jeroen Groenendijk) of questions and question answering is the first thing that comes to mind. This work is part of a fruitful tradition that has recently spawned inquisitive semantics, and the focus on question answering in dynamic epistemic logic. The theme is still very much alive at ILLC today. Next, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the dynamic turn in natural language semantics, of the way he and Jeroen Groenendijk criticized Hans Kamp’s ideas about discourse representation, and how this led to the invention of dynamic predicate logic. Later it became clear that dynamic predicate logic can be viewed as the action part of quantified dynamic logic, invented much earlier by David Harel. This led to a connection, a semanti...|$|R
60|$|When, as lately, {{events have}} {{happened}} that seem (to the fancy, at least) to test if not stagger {{the force of}} official government, it is amusing to ask oneself what is the real weakness of civilisation, ours especially, when it contends with the one lawless man. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> one weakness this morning in turning over an old drawerful of pictures.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him with fresh interest, for the mention of that dear lad Mironsac brought back to my mind the night in Paris on which my ill-starred wager had been laid, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> how that high-minded youth had sought--when {{it was too late to}} reason me out of the {{undertaking}} by alluding to the dishonour with which in his honest eyes it must be fraught.|$|E

6000|$|We had not walked {{much further}} before {{we saw the}} two Miss Scotts {{advancing}} along the hillside to meet us. The morning studies being over, they had set off to take a ramble on the hills, and gather heather blossoms, with which to decorate their hair for dinner.

60|$|When I {{think of}} that despoiled hillside, that colossal litter of bricks and mortar, and crude roads and paths, the {{scaffolding}} and sheds, the general quality of unforeseeing outrage upon the peace <b>of</b> nature, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> a chat <b>I</b> had with the vicar one bleak day after he had witnessed a glide.

40|$|If {{only more}} geographers would write up their work like this. Jan Nijman {{has written a}} {{scholarly}} biography of Miami that makes the geographer’s art accessible and demonstrable to a wide audience. There is here no new theory, concept, or methodology, and relatively little by way of primary research, but Nijman shows how the geographical imagination can make for enjoyable as well as informative reading.
