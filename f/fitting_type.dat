6000|$|Poor St. Clare! If {{she could}} look back, with the {{thoughts}} and interests of the days of her mortality, {{to the world that}} she has quitted for ever, how sadly would she now contemplate the Holy Well which was once hallowed in her name and for her sake! But one arched wall, thickly overgrown with ivy, still remains erect in the place that the old Oratory occupied. Fragments of its roof, its cornices, and the mouldings of its windows lie scattered on the ground, half hidden by the grasses and ferns twining prettily around them. A double cross of stone stands, sloping towards the earth, at a little distance off--soon perhaps to share the fate of the prostrate ruins about it. How changed the scene here, since the time when the rural christening procession left the church, to proceed down the quiet pathway to the Holy Well--when children were baptized in the pure spring; and vows were offered up under the roof of the Oratory, and prayers were repeated before the sacred cross! These were the pious usages of a past age; these were the ceremonies of an ancient church, whose innocent and reverent custom it was to connect closer together the beauty of Nature and the beauty of Religion, by such means as the consecration of a spring, or the erection of a roadside cross. There has been something of sacrifice as well as of glory, in the effort by which we, in our time, have freed ourselves from what was superstitious and tyrannical in the faith of the times of old--it has cost us the loss of much of the better part of that faith which was not superstition, and of more which was not tyranny. The spring of St. Clare is nothing to the cottager of our day but a place to draw water from; the village lads now lounge whistling on the fallen stones, once the consecrated arches under which their humble ancestors paused on the pilgrimage, or knelt in prayer. Wherever the eye turns, all around it speaks the melancholy language of desolation and decay--all but the water of the Holy Well. Still the little pool remains the <b>fitting</b> <b>type</b> of its patron saint--pure and tranquil as in the bygone days, when the name of St. Clare was something more than the title to a village legend, and the spring of St. Clare something better than a sight for the passing tourist among the Cornish moors.[1] ...|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the village}} of Barrington {{incorporated}} in 1865, the area {{did not have a}} dedicated permanent high school until 1949. [...] Before that, Barrington had a K-12 school on Hough Street. On February 8, 1947, the village held an election to choose a site for a new high school. Of approximately 1,414 ballots cast, 1,013 were cast in favor of selecting the current location on West Main Street. [...] Voters also granted the village authority to purchase the 70-acre site, issue bonds for the high school's construction, and build the high school. [...] The original purchase price for the site was $37,000.00. At the time, some residents complained that the tract bought had been too large; the opposition countered that unless the tract stretched far to the north, other residents and/or businesses might purchase that land, and the board {{would not be able to}} buy the land as cheaply later. [...] The Consolidated High School Board of Education, now Community Unit School District 220, consulted authorities on location, educational needs and the most <b>fitting</b> <b>type</b> of building allowing for future planning. The board engaged the architectural firm of Perkins and Will to design the original structure. The village issued $940,000.00 in bonds for the site and building; however, due to rising construction prices at the time, the high school as planned could not be completed for that amount. [...] On June 12, 1948, an election increased the authorization for such bonds by an additional $328,000.00 by a decision of 388 to 71. Groundbreaking on the high school took place on July 10, 1948, and engineer George Gilfeather supervised the ensuing construction almost daily. Classes began in the new building on September 12, 1949 under Superintendent F.C. Thomas.|$|E

A sub-group with symmetrical hearing loss was analysed (n = 6027). Regular use was more frequent in bilateral users and in owners of devices with more complex signal processing, but the strongest determinant of regular use was severity of hearing loss. Satisfaction was higher in the group wearing simple devices, while <b>fitting</b> <b>type</b> and degree of hearing loss had no influence on satisfaction rates.

40|$|AbstractExponentially fitted Runge–Kutta–Nyström (EFRKN) {{methods for}} the {{numerical}} integration of second-order IVPs with oscillatory solutions are derived. These methods integrate exactly differential systems whose solutions {{can be expressed}} as linear combinations of the set of functions {exp(λt),exp(−λt) }, λ∈C, or equivalently {sin(ωt),cos(ωt) } when λ=iω, ω∈R. Explicit EFRKN methods with two and three stages and algebraic orders 3 and 4 are constructed. In addition, a 4 (3) embedded pair of explicit EFRKN methods based on the FSAL technique is obtained, which permits to introduce an error and step length control with a small cost added.

40|$|Today’s {{building}} façades are not imaginable {{without the}} building material glass. Modern architects capitalise the transparency and the {{load carrying capacity}} of glass elements {{in the design of}} filigree and light-flooded structures. Priority is thereby given to the maximal transparency and the energy efficiency of the glass façade. In fact, the strategy paper “EU 2020 ” formulated by the European Union has an important impact on the design of glass façade and the energy efficiency will be a focal point in the design of glass façades in future. The optimal combination of transparency and energy efficiency is achieved by using point fitted insulation glass units. Their application in glass façades becomes therefore indispensable in the future. Currently, three different point fitting systems for point fitted insulation glass units exist. They however present several disadvantages concerning their installation procedure and the tightness of the glazing cavity. Additionally, a general design concept for point fitted insulation glass does currently not exist. In consequence, point fitted insulation glass is a non-regulated construction product and requires an approval in individual cases from the national building authorities. A model to proof the structural integrity of a developed point fitted insulation glass unit with a suitable point fitting system and edge seal system is proposed. A state of the art investigation reveals the Fischer undercut anchor to be the most suitable type for the application in insulation glass. A novel design concept for point fitted insulation glass with undercut anchors is developed. The concept considers the determination of the climate loads and proposes a verification procedure for each structural element of the insulation glass unit. For this purpose, an existing climate load model for linearly supported insulation glass is analytically extended to the static system of point fitted insulation glass units with undercut anchors. For the verification of the connection undercut anchor in glass, an existing design method for point fitted single and laminated glazing is extended to point fitted insulation glass. Component tests are conducted on the Fischer anchor and its ultimate load bearing capacity in glass is determined. A calibrated numerical model of the proposed point fitted insulation glass unit with the Fischer anchor is developed for parametric studies. Large scale tests on the proposed new point fitted insulation glass unit are run with the aim to verify the numerical model, the climate load model and the extended design method and to proof the structural integrity of the entire unit. Finally a new point fitted insulation glass unit with a suitable point <b>fitting</b> <b>type</b> and a corresponding novel design concept is developed...|$|E

This fitting has built-in conductive plastics that are used to weld the joint together as a heating element. In order to explain the mechanism of the new machine, 1) the resistance characteristics of the heating element were explained, 2) the method of electric welding that uses the electrofusion fitting was described, and 3) the method of power supply based on controlling the firing angle was explained. A control system for an intelligent electrofusion welding machine was proposed. This system has the ability to recognize the diameter of an electrofusion fitting using a lookup-table based on the difference of resistance curves according to <b>fitting</b> <b>types,</b> and it is able to weld the fittings regardless of the ambient temperature.
