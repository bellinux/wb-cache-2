40|$|Difficulties {{in finding}} {{appropriate}} financing weigh {{heavily on the}} ability to grow of Italy’s small enterprises, due to their narrow equity base and limited access to credit markets. The State Fund for guarantees to SMEs is one of the instruments used to overcome such difficulties. This essay provides the first evaluation of the impact of this Fund in terms of ability to increase the availability of credit, reduction of borrowing costs and financial sustainability. Extensive econometric tests have been carried out by comparing the performance of the SMEs that benefited from this guarantee with a control group made out of a sample of comparable firms. The findings confirm the presence of a causal relationship between the State guarantee and the higher debt leverage of guaranteed firms, as well as their lower debt cost. The guarantee instrument has proved to be an effective instrument, although it has had a limited economic impact because of its narrow capital base and selective approach.

Furthermore, we analyze the geographical distribution within these intermediaries to control for territorial biases. We provide evidence that the impairments of MGCIs are positively related with the intermediaries’ size and negatively with the regulatory capital.

40|$|Purpose - The authors {{examine the}} debt {{maturity}} structure of Chinese listed companies {{during the period}} when bond market was under-developed {{and the majority of}} commercial banks were owned by the state. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to answer why and how the different ownership control types impact the firms 2 ̆ 7 preference and accessibility to either long- or short-term debts. Design/methodology/approach - The univariate analysis was used to test the differences of debt maturity choices for firms grouped by ownership control types, profitability and institutional development. Then, logit regression and ordinary least squares regression were applied to examine the determinants of ownership control types in debt maturity structures. Findings - Compared to privately controlled firms, state-owned enterprises had greater access to long-term debt and used less short-term debt during the sample period. Evidences also indicate that the on-going financial reform has increased the motivation of banks to consider company profitability in their lending decisions. However, state-owned banks still discriminate private firms in allocation of financial resources, particular in less-developed regions.
