5|$|The forest areas {{suffer from}} strong {{demographic}} pressure and intensive agriculture.

5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; Sphagnum balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included English oak (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and <b>European</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of ground vegetation included creeping soft grass (Holcus mollis), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (Typha latifolia).|$|E
25|$|The park boasts many {{varieties}} of indigenous and exotic trees (many {{of which are}} Asian species): in particular, several cedars of Lebanon planted in 1880, Himalayan cedars, Ginkgo Biloba, Byzantine hazelnuts, Siberian elms, <b>European</b> <b>hollies,</b> and bamboo-leafed prickly ashes, among many others.|$|R
50|$|Holly is {{the plant}} most {{associated}} with Christmas in many <b>European</b> countries. <b>Holly</b> wreaths are hung on doors, and sprigs of holly used to trim Christmas puddings.|$|R
50|$|Portuguese oaks can {{be found}} near the humid sectors around the rivers and acquire their maximum splendor in the {{limestone}} areas between the villages of Korres and Bujanda and also around Arlucea. As they are young trees their conservation is precarious. These trees are typical in subhumid climates with a 600 - 900 mm per year precipitation and short summer droughts. As they need to stand in a fresh ground with a good liquid retention capacity, they usually occupy clayey and marly grounds. Under 650 m the Portuguese oak is substituted by the Mediterranean oaks. Groups of downy oaks, field maples and <b>European</b> <b>hollys</b> can also be found. The oaks are the wood's 15.35% occupying an area of 1.12 ha.|$|R
25|$|Predominant {{tree species}} are pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betuloides), silver birch (Betula pendula) and <b>European</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium). Indicator species of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (Sorbus torminalis) butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and drooping sedge (Carex pendula) A {{wide range of}} animals are found, including fallow deer (Dama dama), muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and European adder (Vipera berus).|$|E
500|$|Forest Park {{and other}} areas of the {{watershed}} have an understory of well-developed shrubs including [...] ferns, Oregon-grape, vine maple, salal, red huckleberry, Fendler's waterleaf, Indian plum, salmonberry, and stinging nettle.

Invasive species are English ivy, <b>European</b> <b>holly,</b> clematis, morning glory, and Himalayan blackberry.|$|E
2500|$|The floristic {{diversity}} includes 823 vascular taxa {{that occur}} in 128 types of natural vegetation. The oak forests which are common throughout the park, are specifically concentrated in Ramiscal, Peneda, Gerês and Beredo river valleys. These forested are dominated by an alliance between the Pyrenean (Quercus pyrenaica) and English (Quercus robur) oaks, which themselves are differentiated among the lower altitudes and exposed flanks (the Rusceto-Quercetum roboris) and those oaks with Atlantic characteristics (Myretillo-Quercetum roboris). The first association are commonly found with English oak (Quercus rober), cork oak (Quercus suber), butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), [...] maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), while the second association unites the English and Pyrenean oaks with bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) [...] and <b>European</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium). In upper altitudes there are patches of English oak that enter into their own association (Holco-Quercetum pyrenacia), which is integrated into another group (Quericon robri-patraea). These oaks have been, {{over the course of}} human settlement, the object of intense use, resulting in a general degradation of the spaces into nothing more than shrubbery.|$|E
5000|$|The Native American {{tribes of}} what is now the Southeastern United States brewed a {{ceremonial}} drink containing caffeine, [...] "asi", or the [...] "black drink", from the roasted leaves and stems of Ilex vomitoria (Yaupon <b>holly).</b> <b>European</b> colonists adopted this beverage as a coffee-substitute, which they called [...] "cassina".|$|R
50|$|Τhe {{black pine}} dominates {{on the eastern}} and {{northern}} side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and Bosnian pine. In this zone there is also beech. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there elm, cherry plum, <b>European</b> yew, hazel, <b>holly,</b> cornus mas, manna ash, maple and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants. Gorges and ravines are covered by oriental planes, willows, black alders and riverside greenery.|$|R
2500|$|The {{temperate}} climate and humidity resulting from {{proximity to the}} coast favour {{the growth of a}} rich mat of forest includong Atlantic and Mediterranean species, marking the transition in Portugal from northern to southern vegetation. The Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (Quercus robur) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the Cork oak (Quercus suber) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common hazel (Corylus avellana), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), <b>European</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium), Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), [...] Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Laurestine (Viburnum tinus), Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera), and Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus). In the valleys, near watercourses, grow Narrow-leaf ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), Grey willow (Salix atrocinerea), European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Alder buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) and Black Elderberry (Sambucus nigra).|$|E

50|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, laurel forests were {{widespread}} around the Mediterranean Basin.
