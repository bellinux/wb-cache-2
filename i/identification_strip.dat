50|$|During communism, {{plates of}} trucks would be painted upon {{on the sides}} with {{district}} name initials and a five digit serial number (in 1991 two digits followed with district name initials and three digits). State vehicles bared a white plate with the communist red star, district initials and serial number in black or white. Once private ownership was re-established {{after the fall of}} Communism, a new format with standard size was introduced similar to the post 1993 model but with different font and missing national <b>identification</b> <b>strip.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The old 1993 {{format is}} still valid {{even though the}} new 2011 plates were {{introduced}} in February 2011. The old 1993 format was introduced around 1993 {{with the addition of}} the national <b>identification</b> <b>strip</b> (in 1995) on the left and a new bigger DIN 1451 font. Spacing between characters changed numerous times and a security hologram was added. The format starts with a two-letter abbreviation of an Albanian district name. For instance, the abbreviation for Korçë District is KO. A four-digit number follows with a serial letter indicating the order of allocation of each series of numbers. Thus, a plate ending in [...] "B" [...] will have been more recently released than one ending in [...] "A" [...] in the same district. Since 2002, a smaller font was introduced while plates with the older font are still valid.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{processing}} of ERTS-I MSS data for {{areas around the}} west branch of the Susquehanna River permits <b>identification</b> of <b>stripped</b> areas including ones that are not discernible from visual analysis of ERTS imagery. Underflight data and ground-based observations are used for ground-truth and {{as a basis for}} designing more refined operators to make sub-classifications of stripped areas, particularly with regard to manifestations of acid mine drainage; because of associated diagnostic effects on vegetation, seasonal changes in classifiction criteria are being documented as repeated, cloud-free ERTS-I coverage of the same area becomes available. Preliminary results indicate that ERTS data can be used to moniter not only the total extent of stripping in given areas but also the effectiveness of reclamation and pollution abatement procedures...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study 443 strains of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, a causative agent of {{respiratory}} disease in fowl, were investigated biochemically and serologically. In both ways O. rhinotracheale could be differentiated from other gram-negative rods and, more particularly, from the Pasteurella-like bacteria potentially pathogenic for fowl. For the biochemical characterization of O. rhinotracheale the API 2 ONE <b>identification</b> <b>strip</b> proved to be useful, although O. rhinotracheale {{is not included in}} the API system. Serologically, by using monovalent antisera in agar gel precipitation (AGP) tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), seven serotypes (serotypes A to G) of O. rhinotracheale could be discriminated. The AGP test was chosen as the preferred method to be used for serotyping. Isolates of serotype A were found to be the most prevalent, especially in chickens. Isolates from turkeys were more heterogeneously divided over the serotypes. Some strains showed cross-reactivity between serotypes A, B, and E. Five O. rhinotracheale strains could not be serotyped with the available antisera. Relationships between the geographic origin and the serotypes were found. By the ELISA the presence of antibodies against O. rhinotracheale could be detected in 1 -day-old birds as well as in birds with clinical signs, and therefore, it might be useful for diagnostic purposes...|$|E
40|$|While we were {{isolating}} Bartonella quintana from body lice, 40 Acinetobacter baumannii strains {{were also}} isolated and genotyped. One clone was unique {{and the other}} was ampicillin susceptible. A. baumannii DNA was later detected in 21 % of 622 lice collected worldwide. These findings show an A. baumannii epidemic in human body lice. The body louse has been demonstrated to be the vector of three human pathogens: Rickettsia prowazekii, the agent of epidemic typhus; Bartonella quintana, the agent of trench fever; and Borrelia recurrentis, the agent of louseborne recurrent fever (1). While trying to isolate Bartonella quintana from body lice of homeless persons in Marseille, we isolated six Acinetobacter spp. (2) subsequently identified as A. baumannii. They were susceptibile to ampicillin, whereas Acinetobacter are almost always resistant to ampicillin in France (3). We further isolated other A. baumannii from body lice in Marseille and now have 40 isolates; 21 are susceptible to ampicillin. To investigate the possibility of a clonal diffusion in lice, the recA gene sequence of isolates was determined and compared to that of the collection and strains. To test if the body louse–A. baumannii association is observed worldwide, we investigated the presence of A. baumannii DNA in a large collection of body lice. *Faculté de Médecine de Marseille, Marseille, France The Study The 40 body lice–associated A. baumannii were obtained during studies of homeless shelters in Marseille (4). The procedure for isolation of these strains has been detailed previously (2). Provisional identification of isolates was based on Gram stain and results of oxidase test and API 20 NE <b>identification</b> <b>strip</b> (Biomérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). We also tested the 19 strains of A. baumanni...|$|E

40|$|Brevity {{understood}} both {{as reading}} time {{but also as}} the convergence between the time of action {{and the time of}} narration is certainly one of the peculiarities of the short story. In Saadat Hasan Manto, briefness is a very specific stylistic and expressive trait. He was not only a quick writer, able to complete his stories frequently in just one sitting, he was also a master of conciseness. Manto translated his ethical attitude towards the tragic matter of his narration into a praxis of pursued succinctness. For him: removing reference, denying <b>identification</b> and <b>stripping</b> his texts to the bare bones was not simply his personal way of experimenting with the modernist aesthetics, it was a determined tactic to convey a sense of general moral unease and a sort of frozen discomfort...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Identification and mapping of three major kinds of coal refuse targets based on spectral signatures in channels four through {{seven of the}} ERTS- 1 MSS were conducted. Correlation of {{the placement of the}} coal refuse targets with an existing map of their location was accomplished. Digital processing of ERTS- 1 data permitted <b>identification</b> of <b>stripped</b> areas including ones that are not discernible by visual analysis of ERTS imagery. Combined visual and digital techniques of analyzing ERTS- 1 data for geologic formations have been tried on selected areas of Pennsylvania. Mapping of two major agriculture counties to show land forms, drainage patterns, water, and urban areas were made using positive transparencies of MSS data. Two frames of the same central Pennsylvania area were brought into registration by translation and then merged even though the frames were obtained 71 days apart...|$|R
25|$|As the new {{cards were}} being issued, the {{government}} had asked young people to start coming in for the new cards, {{and a number of}} Bahá'í youth had accordingly been <b>stripped</b> of paper <b>identification</b> cards. Once <b>stripped</b> of ID cards, the Bahá'í youth essentially become prisoners in their own homes, since the authorities often set up evening checkpoints to verify the identity of young men. Individuals without proper ID face detention. Likewise, young people without ID cards are denied entrance and continuing enrollment in colleges and universities, as well as service in the armed forces.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{rights of}} trans people are {{protected}} by a range of international and regional mechanisms. Yet, punitive national laws, policies and practices targeting transgender people, including complex procedures for changing <b>identification</b> documents, <b>strip</b> transgender people of their rights and limit access to justice. This results in gross {{violations of human rights}} on the part of state perpetrators and society at large. Transgender people's experience globally is that of extreme social exclusion that translates into increased vulnerability to HIV, other diseases, including mental health conditions, limited access to education and employment, and loss of opportunities for economic and social advancement. In addition, hatred and aggression towards a group of individuals who do not conform to social norms around gender manifest in frequent episodes of extreme violence towards transgender people. This violence often goes unpunished. Discussion: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) views its work in the area of HIV through the lens of human rights and advances a range of development solutions such as poverty reduction, improved governance, active citizenship, and access to justice. This work directly relates to advancing the rights of transgender people. This manuscript lays out the various aspects of health, human rights, and development that frame transgender people's issues and outlines best practice solutions from transgender communities and governments around the globe on how to address these complex concerns. The examples provided in the manuscript can help guide UN agencies, governments, and transgender activists in achieving better standards of health, access to justice, and social inclusion for transgender communities everywhere. Conclusions: The manuscript provides a call to action for countries to urgently address the violations of human rights of transgender people in order to honour international obligations, stem HIV epidemics, promote gender equality, strengthen social and economic development, and put a stop to untrammelled violence...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{isolation}} of organisms resembling Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) from vaginal specimens {{was not significantly}} affected by anaerobic versus carbon dioxide incubation atmospheres or whether specimens were inoculated on isolation media immediately after collection or after a delay of 6 h. Forty-one clinically isolated strains were provisionally divided into 30 H. vaginalis strains and 11 H. vaginalis-like (HVL) strains based on morphological and growth characteristics. The H. vaginalis strains were less reactive in API- 20 A <b>identification</b> test <b>strips,</b> (Analytab Products, Inc.) using Lombard-Dowell broth, than in a modified basal medium that contained proteose peptone no. 3 (Difco). The numbers and kinds of substrates fermented by 30 clinical and 2 reference strains of H. vaginalis varied among conventional, API, Minitek (Baltimore Biological Laboratory), and rapid buffered substrate fermentation systems. A greater number and variety of carbohydrates were fermented by the 11 HVL strains more consistently in all four test systems. Analysis of volatile and nonvolatile fermentation end products by gas-liquid chromatography did not reveal {{significant differences between the}} H. vaginalis and HVL strains. However, the latter group grew in peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth, whereas the H. vaginalis strains did not grow without the addition of starch to peptone-yeast extract-glucose. All of the reference and clinical strains were similar in their susceptibilities to a variety of antimicrobial compounds except sulfonamides, which inhibited the HVL strains and bifidobacteria but not the H. vaginalis strains. Sulfonamide susceptibility or resistance corresponded in part to the H. vaginalis and HVL-bifidobacteria strain reactions on selected conventional fermentation substrates. Susceptibility or resistance to sulfonamides and metronidazole in conjunction with fermentation tests is described to aid in the separation of H. vaginalis from other possibly unrecognized biotypes of H. vaginalis or other vaginal bacteria that presumptively resemble the organism. A human blood medium known as V agar was also of considerable value in distinguishing H. vaginalis from HVL strains, because only the H. vaginalis strains produced diffuse beta-hemolysis on V agar...|$|R
40|$|One {{water and}} three rock samples {{were taken from}} a mined tunnel system, U 12 n, in Rainier Mesa at the Nevada Test Site. Endolithic {{microorganisms}} were cultured from ashfall tuff, which was crushed and made into slurries with a formulation of artificial pore water, on R 2 A agar plates. Microbial counts ranged from 102 to 104 viable cells per g (dry weight) of rock sampled. The cultured water sample yielded 102 viable cells per ml. Many of the isolates were very small (< 1 μm) when viewed in the rock matrix and remained small even when cultured. Most were gram-negative rods. Individual isolates were profiled by API-NFT strip number, antibiotic and metal resistance patterns, and colony and cellular morphologies. Three <b>identification</b> systems, API-NFT <b>strips,</b> BIOLOG, and MIDI, were compared. Each system identified {{only a small percentage}} of the total isolates, and in only seven cases were the isolates identified the same way by more than one system. The same genus was identified in three of these cases, but different species were indicated. The genus Pseudomonas was the most commonly identified. The isolate profiles and the three identification systems demonstrated that water isolates were considerably different from endolithic isolates...|$|R
40|$|Objective] We {{evaluated}} the localization of motor function using functional MRI for the epilepsy patients with lesions around the motor strip. To evaluate {{the efficacy of}} F-MRI, we compared the localization of motor area between MRI, functional MRI, direct cortical stimulation, and Magnetoencephalography. [Method] Total 16 epilepsy patients were included in this study. Motor strip detection on MRI was performed based on the Iwasaki's method. F-MRI was performed using 1. 5 tesler MRI, task of tapping fingers in each hand. The activated area was visualized over the MRI and compared {{with the results of}} other modalities. [Results] We divided the patients into two groups based on the <b>identification</b> of motor <b>strip</b> on MRI. Ten patients showed clear anatomical motor strip on MRI, in which nine exhibited single gyrus activation, concordant with the anatomical motor strip on MRI. Only one patient showed two gyri activation. Six patients showed unclear motor strip on MRI, in which 3 demonstrated single gyrus activation, concordant with the direct cortical stimulation results. Three patients presented two gyri activation, evolving true motor strip. Four patients underwent MEG examination, which showed concordant results with the cortical stimulation results. [Conclusions] F-MRI is useful for the preoperative motor area estimation, especially for the patients with clear central sulcus on MRI. If more than two gyri would be activated on functional MRI, further evaluations of MEG, as well as intraoperative functional mapping would be recommended to confirm the correct motor strip...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to study the conservability of chilled vacuum-packed meat depending on storage temperature (– 1 °C vs. + 4 °C) during {{the last third of}} their shelf life. Physicochemical parameters (pH and colour) and microbiological growth (total aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp. and Brochothrix thermosphacta) of Longissimus dorsi samples from different origins (United Kingdom and Ireland, Australia and Brazil) were measured at: i) 2 / 3 of their shelf life and ii) the end of their shelf life. Sample bacteria population growing on MRS was identified by API 50 CHL strips. Unlike Irish and British samples, pH of some Australian and Brazilian samples decreased during conservation. The colour of the samples remained stable and it {{did not seem to be}} influenced by temperature. All samples conserved at – 1 °C presented a satisfactory microbiological quality at the end of their shelf life (British and Irish meat = 35 ~ 45 days; Australian meat = 140 days and Brazilian meat = 120 days). On Australian and Brazilian samples, temperature did not influence total aerobic bacteria growth, but conservation at + 4 °C favoured lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae growth. API 50 CHL <b>strip</b> <b>identifications</b> revealed the presence of bacteria like Lactobacillus brevis, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and Lactobacillus fermentum, which occur naturally in fresh meat and are known for their bioprotective effect against other microorganisms. Further analyses are being carried out using molecular methods in order to study the initial bacteria population diversity and it evolution during storage. Peer reviewe...|$|R
