40|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} This paper {{discusses}} a method investigating the reduction of free heavy metal cation contents in soil {{through the use of}} microbe-inducing precipitate (MIP). Materials and methods Bacteria Pasteurella is adopted to induce urea hydrolysis and produce CO 3 2 -. <b>Free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + is then precipitated as CdCO 3 in soil. Bacteria Pasteurella reproduces and the produced urease activity is then determined to evaluate the Cd 2 + effect. Wheat seeds are planted in Cd 2 + contaminated soil after treatment with microbial inducing CdCO 3 precipitate. Wheat-growing status is photographed and wheat stem length data are recorded to evaluate the microbial treatment. Results Bacteria Pasteurella is discovered to consistently reproduce in 10 mg L- 1 Cd 2 + solution for over 120 h. The optimal result is a <b>free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + concentration reduction by 92 % after a 28 -day microbial treatment on Cd 2 + contaminated soil (initial Cd 2 + content 10 μg g- 1 (soil)). Discussion <b>Free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + in soil is immobilized by the microbe-inducing CdCO 3 precipitate. The mechanism goes through the stages of hydrolyzing CO(NH 2) 2 into CO 3 2 - by Pasteurella bacteria's enzymolysis and reducing <b>free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + content in soil by immobilizing <b>free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + in the CdCO 3 precipitate. Based on the Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme dynamics, urease constant Km is 1, 230 mol L- 1 and maximum urease catalytic rate Vmax is 4. 55 g L- 1 h- 1. Urease catalytic rate V is no less than 0. 94 g L- 1 h- 1 in 10 μg g- 1 Cd 2 + contaminated soil in 72 h under repetitious urea supplement (40 mg L- 1 per 24 h). Before the wheat tassel stage, the average wheat stem length cultivated in soil samples T 2, T 3, and T 4 varies from 16 to 22 cm. Part of the stem length of T 3 and T 4 is well over 22 cm. The specific Cd 2 + treatment method used in T 4 is the best for rehabilitating Cd 2 + contaminated soil in the investigation. Conclusions The treatment is based on the mechanism of hydrolyzing CO(NH 2) 2 into CO 3 2 - by Pasteurella bacteria's enzymolysis and reducing <b>free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + content in soil by immobilizing <b>free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + in CdCO 3 precipitate. Based on the Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme dynamics, Cd 2 + is observed to hold back Pasteurella-producing urease activity in solution and in soil. But Pasteurella bacteria are also endurable to Cd 2 + with an appropriate concentration. Cd 2 + treatments significantly reduced the residual contents of <b>free</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 + in soil. Recommendations and perspectives The microbe-inducing carbonate precipitate method used in this investigation is patented by China Patent Bureau in 2007. It is recommended in application for its low-cost, repeatable and environmentally friendly specialties in China...|$|R
