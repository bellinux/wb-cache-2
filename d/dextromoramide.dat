25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as <b>dextromoramide</b> in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dextromoramide</b> {{was much}} favoured by drug users in Australia in the 1970s and the United Kingdom. It has the main {{proprietary}} name of Palfium amongst others, though as of mid-2004 {{the drug was}} discontinued in the UK due to limited supplies of precursor chemicals. Although this is true, it is believed there was an approximate one year shortage of <b>Dextromoramide</b> and the real reason that Palfium was not put back into production for the UK market is because of how addictive and potent it is as an oral painkiller. Dependence liability is similar to morphine, but with a less severe withdrawal syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dextromoramide</b> was {{singled out}} along with {{ketobemidone}} {{and several other}} synthetics by the United Nations and European Union as being [...] "extra-dangerous" [...] in the early 1960s, with <b>dextromoramide</b> being alleged to be three times more euphoric than heroin at equianalgesic doses, though this did little to stem production {{in the first half}} of the decade.

5000|$|The UN {{reported}} {{shortly after}} the beginning of marketing of ketobemidone that it was [...] "nine times more active" [...] than methadone, presumably as a euphoriant, and was thus labelled as extra-dangerous along with <b>dextromoramide</b> ("three times more active than heroin") and several other synthetics about the same time, as expanded upon below.|$|E

5000|$|Phenoperidine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1957 by Paul Janssen, {{of the company}} now known as Janssen Pharmaceutica, who was seeking better opioid pain-killers. [...] His two prototype drugs were methadone and pethidine, each which had been invented in 1930s by Otto Eisleb, who worked for IG Farben. His initial work starting with methadone yielded <b>dextromoramide</b> in 1954. Janssen then turned to making pethidine analogues, {{due in part to}} the less complicated chemistry of the compound. During his explorations, he replaced the methyl group attached to the pethidine nitrogen with a propiophenone group, and this yielded phenoperidine, in 1957. Phenoperidine was determined to have decreased stability and enhanced lipophilicity compared to pethidine. Soon after, studies in mice showed that phenoperidine was over 100 times more potent than pethidine.|$|E
50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947.

5000|$|Morphine is {{the gold}} {{standard}} to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), nicomorphine (Vilan), hydromorphinol and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin, and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, methadone and buprenorphine are used less frequently. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended [...] for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, <b>dextromoramide</b> and dipipanone are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as piritramide and ketobemidone are used for severe pain, and tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{possibility}} of referring Surinam and Netherlands Antillean drug users from a 'low-threshold' municipal methadone programme to general practice for methadone maintenance treatment. (Methadone maintenance treatment for drug users leads to a more regulated life and {{makes it possible to}} implement measures to ameliorate their living conditions.) Fewer Surinam and Netherlands Antillean drug users are referred to general practice than native Dutch drug users. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Municipal Health Service, Department of Mental Health, Unit on Drugs, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. METHOD: 141 Surinam and Netherlands Antillean drug users participating in the 'low-threshold' methadone programme were examined on the following items: psychiatric status, drug and alcohol abuse, judicial problems, relationships, personal care, insurance and housing. With these items the level of regulated drug use was assessed and the possible reference to general practice evaluated. RESULTS: 21 % of the drugs user group was found to be well regulated. They could have been referred to general practice immediately. Another 18 % were also well regulated but they received methadone on a daily basis at the moment of investigation; when they would have proven to manage methadone prescription on a weekly basis, they could also be referred to general practice. 61 % could not be referred because they were addicted to benzodiazepines (22 %) or alcohol (33 %), lived in unsuitable housing (45 %), had judicial problems (53 %), psychiatric problems (30 %) or no insurance (15 %), or were very problematic drug users receiving Palfium (<b>dextromoramide)</b> through the 'low-threshold' municipal methadone programme (15 %).
