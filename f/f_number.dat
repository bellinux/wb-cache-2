50|$|In {{microscopy}} high numerical apertures are {{desirable to}} capture as much light {{as possible from}} a small sample. A high numerical aperture (equivalent to a low <b>f</b> <b>number)</b> gives a very shallow depth of field. Higher magnification objective lenses generally have shallower depth of field; a 100× objective lens with a numerical aperture of around 1.4 has a depth of field of approximately 1 μm. When observing a sample directly {{the limitations of the}} shallow depth of field are easy to circumvent by focusing up and down through the sample; to effectively present microscopy data of a complex 3D structure in 2D, focus stacking is a very useful technique.|$|E

50|$|If {{a sensor}} that is one-fourth the width and {{height of a}} 24 × 36mm frame of film is exposed to an image through a lens that is {{correspondingly}} one-fourth the focal length (so that it sees the same field of view) and one-fourth the aperture diameter (so {{it has the same}} <b>f</b> <b>number),</b> then the depth of field increases 4x.This increase in depth of field may have advantages for taking snapshots; more of the image will be in focus than with a larger sensor, and autofocus system accuracy is less critical for producing an acceptable image. Contrarily, photographers wishing to decrease depth of field to create certain effects, such as isolating subjects from their background, need to increase the aperture diameter, which is easier with a larger format where the resulting f-number will be higher.|$|E
5000|$|The D3 {{features}} a full frame 35 mm equivalent CMOS image sensor measuring 23.9 mm × 36.0 mm. This sensor {{is larger than}} the DX format sensors of all previous Nikon DSLRs, and Nikon has coined the term [...] "FX format" [...] to describe it. The D3's sensor has larger pixels and greater light sensitivity than previous DX sensors. This allows the camera to reach higher equivalent film speeds and produce images with less noise in low light situations. Low light situations include times when the camera is operated at high shutter speed or high <b>f</b> <b>number,</b> where the lens' aperture is reduced to improve depth of field and sharpness. The sensor captures image data at 14 bits per color channel through 12-channel parallel readout, which ensures 9 frame/s continuous shooting with higher bit depth than that on previous 12-bit sensors.|$|E
