40|$|Physical {{control of}} water {{hyacinth}} consists of removing the plants {{from the water}} by hand or machines. It is considered over effetive because it involves removing the whole plants from water. The first attempt on physical control was in 1992 when weed infestation was causing serious problems to the fishing communities in Lake Kyoga. The fishermen had problems of accessing the lake as huge masses of mobile weed blocked landing sites. Furthermore, the fishers lost their nets, which were swept away by mobile water hyacinth. As a result, an integrated control strategy involving physical control (manual and mechanical removal) was put in place. Through this method, the fishers were able to open up access routes to fishing grounds even though weed mats often reblocked the access routes. In the infested lakes, manual removal offered remedial relief to fish Iandings and other access sites. Sites of strategic importance such as hydro-electric power generation dam, water <b>intake</b> <b>points</b> and docking points which had large masses of water hyacinth required heavy machinery and mechanical harvesters were used at these sites...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA revolutionary {{concept in}} the {{elaboration}} of a risk map in municipal sewerage systems is presented, based on a coherent and fully functional model of the sewerage network (Ciutac, 2011). The starting point is a frequent situation, when {{at the entrance of}} the wastewater treatment plant; a sudden increase of a pollutant concentration is recorded. In this case, there was a clear spillover in one of the intakes of the network. The pollutant can damage the wastewater treatment plant or can be out of the plant's processing capacity. Under those circumstances, a “detective” activity has to be performed in order to discover the injection point where the spillover has taken place, as the source of pollution. The paper presents a methodology and an algorithm which will allow the establishment of the most likely area where such <b>intake</b> <b>points</b> can be located, based on the measured values at the intake of the wastewater treatment plant and on the model of the sewerage network.

40|$|Source {{water quality}} plays a {{critical}} role in maintaining the quality and supply of drinking water, yet it can be negatively affected by human activities. In Pennsylvania, coal mining and treatment of conventional oil and gas drilling produced wastewaters have affected source water quality for over 100 years. The recent unconventional natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale formation produces significant volumes of wastewater containing bromide and has the potential to affect source water quality and downstream drinking water quality. Wastewater from coal-fired power plants also contains bromide that may be released into source water. Increasing source water bromide presents a challenge as even small amounts of bromide in source water can lead to carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) in chlorinated finished drinking water. However, bromide is not regulated in source water and is not removed by conventional drinking water treatment processes. The objective of this work is to evaluate the safe bromide concentration in source water to minimize the cancer risk of trihalomethanes - a group of DBPs - in treated drinking water. By evaluating three years of water sampling data from the Monongahela River in Southwestern Pennsylvania, the present analysis reached three conclusions. First, bromide monitoring for source water quality should be taken at drinking water <b>intake</b> <b>points.</b> Water sample types (river water samples vs drinking water intake samples) can lead to different water quality conclusions and thus affect regulatory compliance decision-making. Second, bromide monitoring at drinking water <b>intake</b> <b>points</b> can serve as a predictor for changes in heavily brominated trihalomethanes concentrations in finished water. Increasing bromide in source water can serve as an early warning sign of increasing formation of heavily brominated trihalomethanes and their associated cancer risks in drinking water. Finally, this work developed a statistical simulation model to evaluate the effect of source water bromide on trihalomethane formation and speciation and to analyze the changing cancer risks in water associated with these changing bromide concentrations in the Monongahela River. The statistical simulation method proposed in this work leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bromide concentration in source water must be very low to prevent the adverse health effects associated with brominated trihalomethanes in chlorinated drinking water. This method can be used by water utilities to determine the bromide concentration in their source water that might indicate a need for process changes or by regulatory agencies to evaluate source water bromide issues...|$|R

R 2 To {{assess the}} {{importance}} of the sympathetic nervous system in regulating body weight during prolonged leptin infusion, we evaluated food intake, body weight and physical activity in conscious, unrestrained rats. Initial studies illustrated that prolonged intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of leptin enhanced substrate oxidation so that adipose tissue lipid stores were completely ablated and muscle triglyceride and liver glycogen stores were depleted. Following neonatal chemical sympathectomy, changes in weight and food intake were compared for groups of sympathectomized (SYM) and control (CON) adult animals during ICV infusion of leptin. CON animals lost 60 ± 9 g over 10 days vs. 25 ± 3 g in the SYM when food intake was matched between the two groups. Greater weight loss despite similar energy <b>intake</b> <b>points</b> to an important role of the SNS in stimulating energy expenditure during ICV leptin infusion by increasing the resting metabolic rate since no differences in physical activity were observed between CON and SYM groups.

50|$|During {{the drought}} year 2015, the inflows into the {{reservoir}} were very meagre due to failure of rains in the catchment area. However nearly 18 tmcft dead storage water {{available in the}} reservoir {{could not be used}} for the dire needs. With minor external modifications to the exiting reversible hydro turbine unit, most of the dead storage water can be put to use during the drought years by using the hydro power plant for pumping water into the nearby right canal. Water would be released downstream into the tail pond over the spillway (if needed by siphon pipes). Nearly five km long contour canal at MDDL of the right canal in the reservoir area is constructed to connect the power house area with the right canal <b>intake</b> <b>point.</b> The pen stock of the hydro power unit is extended (less than 100 m long) to connect to the contour canal. The hydro power unit is operated in pumping mode to pump water from the tail pond to the right canal when the reservoir level is below the canal's minimum draw down level (MDDL). The pen stock extension piping is detached when water pumping to the canal is not required to restore its normal power generation when the reservoir level is above the right canal's MDDL When the reservoir level is above the right canal MDDL level, the contour canal located in the reservoir area gets submerged with out suffering any damage as it is not obstructing the flood flow to the dam spillway.|$|E

Water would be released into the down stream tail pond through the hydro power station or the existing diversion tunnel. When water is to be pumped into the left canal, the water released into the downstream tail pond is pumped back into a contour canal which connects the hydro power station and the left canal <b>intake</b> <b>point.</b> This contour canal is nearly 10 km long and located inside the Nagarjunasagar reservoir area situated at 510 ft MSL. Only three units of the reversible turbines are required to feed nearly 12,000 cusecs water to the left canal at its MDDL level and rest of four reversible units {{can be used for}} power generation by releasing water into the tail pond. The pen-stock inlets of the three unit at 125 m MSL are to be connected with the extension piping (4.8 m diameter) to feed the contour canal at 510 ft MSL. The extension piping is disconnected when water pumping to left canal is not required to restore the hydro power units normal working. When reservoir level is at its FRL level, the canal and the extension piping get submerged under water without undergoing any damage as the contour canal is away from the spillway of the dam or flood flow path. Thus both Telangana and AP states can use the reservoir dead storage water fully to ensure water supply for the command area under the left canal even during drought years.|$|E
