5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being a lyric video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself and sticking them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the camera pans away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away from the woman then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E
5|$|When Victoria's first child, Victoria, Princess Royal, {{was born}} on 21 November 1840, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the {{arrangements}} for the nursery staff. Lehzen put the nursery {{in the hands of}} a Mrs. Southey, a Mrs. Roberts, and Sir James Clark, despite Albert's objections that Clark was wholly unsuited to the post, having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously. Eventually, the Princess Royal fell ill, but the incompetent Dr. Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with calomel. In fact, the young Princess Victoria had become seriously ill. Albert, who was devoted to his first-born, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by the Baroness. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and be <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head if the child died. Soon after this argument, Victoria gave in to him and ultimately dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to rise above her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone.|$|E
