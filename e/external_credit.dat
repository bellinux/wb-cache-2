Credit rationing arises from a hold-up problem between wealth-constrained entrepreneurs and ex-ternal investors.

In a symmetric equilibrium outcome all firms face equitable credit-size rationing.

To encourage disaster insurance, the insurance companies should be able to more accurately set their insurance premiums depending on the estimated risk for each property. This risk information should be compiled in Geographical Information System (GIS) maps based on multiple disaster risk evaluation methodology. The priorities targeted by this paper are: a).
