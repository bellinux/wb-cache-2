50|$|Joint defense {{agreements}} are not contracts which create whatever rights that signatories chose, but are written notice of defendants' invocation of privileges {{set forth in}} common law. As a result, joint defense agreements cannot extend greater protections than legal privileges on which they rest. “A joint defense agreement which purports to greater protections than legal privileges on which it rests does not accurately set forth the protections which would be given to defendants who sign. In United States v. Stepney, unless the joint defense privilege recognized in this Circuit imposes a duty of loyalty on attorneys who are parties to a joint defense agreement, the duty of loyalty {{set forth in the}} proposed agreement would have no effect other than misinforming defendants of the actual scope of their rights. Joint defense privilege did not impose general duty of loyalty to all signing defendants, and thus duty of loyalty set forth in proposed joint defense agreement had no effect other than misinforming defendants of actual scope of their rights. “The proposed joint defense agreement explicitly imposes on signing attorneys not only a duty of confidentiality, but a separate general duty of loyalty to all signing defendants. Such a duty has no foundation in law and, if recognized, would offer little chance of a trial unmarred by conflict of interest and disqualification.” When there is a conflict. Under “joint defense” doctrine, <b>joint</b> <b>defendant</b> must consent to waiver of conflict of interest for waiver to be effective.|$|E

It examines the policy reasons behind the Act and traces the legislative development which commenced following the House of Lords ruling in R v Cuthbertson and Others that it had no jurisdiction to make an order for the defendants involved in, at the time, the biggest drug ring in the United Kingdom to forfeit their proceeds. This article considers the defendant’s ‘benefit’ from crime which may be assessed at a much higher amount than that which has passed through his hands. It focuses on three problem areas: cases involving <b>joint</b> <b>defendants,</b> the operation of statutory ‘assumptions’, and the discretion afforded to the court in confiscation proceedings...|$|R

[...] Working on this principle, the Council applied in 1966 for registration to become an official charity under section 4 of the Charities Act 1960. Upon rejection by the Charity Commission the Council appealed under section 5(3) of the 1960 Act, an action granted by Justice Foster in the Chancery Division of the High Court. On appeal by the Inland Revenue to the Court of Appeal, who were <b>joint</b> <b>defendants</b> with the Attorney General, it was held that [...] "the Council was established for exclusively charitable purposes since its purpose was to further the development and administration of the law and to make it known or accessible to all members of the community, which was a purpose beneficial to the community and of general public utility." [...] In 1970, then, the ICLR was successfully registered as a charity in England and Wales.|$|R
40|$|The Act {{provides}} for civil justice reform in Georgia, amending Titles 9, 24, 33, 43, and 51 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. The Act addresses venue for cases involving <b>joint</b> <b>defendants</b> and {{the doctrine of}} forum non conveniens. It also amends procedures relating to affidavits in professional malpractice cases by requiring that plaintiff file, with the complaint, an affidavit of an expert competent to testify. In addition, the Act also requires authorizing {{the release of the}} plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s medical information in medical malpractice cases. The Act further provides guidelines associated with offers of settlement and the reduction of frivolous lawsuits. Moreover, the Act provides that courts shall not admit certain statements of apology or similar statements by health care providers as evidence in civil actions. It also changes the standards of expert testimony and expert witness qualification. The Act requires reporting instances of medical malpractice judgments and settlements and {{provides for}} investigations and remedial actions with respect to physicians 2 ̆ 7 fitness to practice. Further, the Act addresses liability in the emergency room context and liability involving independent contractors. It also eliminates joint and several liability in favor of apportionment of damages according to degree of fault. The Act also provides a cap on noneconomic damages in certain actions relating to health care and allows for periodic payments over time. The Act concludes by providing for severability, designating an effective date, and repealing conflicting laws...|$|R

40|$|When two or {{more people}} are alleged to have {{committed}} a crime together they are automatically tried together in a <b>joint</b> trial. <b>Defendants</b> can apply to have a joint trial severed into separate trials, but they are rarely granted. However, joint trials might be biasing against defendants in {{that they might have}} a greater likelihood of obtaining aguilty verdict than if they had separate trials. A review of the literature indicated that authors have several hypotheses why joint trials might be biasing, though there is no conclusive evidence that this is the case. This study used a mock juror paradigm to investigate whether joint trials are biasing toward defendants. Results indicated that there was not {{a significant difference in the}} proportion of guilty/not-guilty verdicts across one, two, and three defendant trial conditions when all defendants involved were charged with the same offence (assault). It was concluded that having multiple defendants in a trial was not, on its own, biasing against the first or second defendants. However, having a co-defendant with a more serious charge (grievous bodily harm) led to a significant increase in the proportion of guilty verdicts assigned to the defendant in two out of three scenarios. It was concluded that it is possible that paired with a co-defendant who has a more serious charge is biasing, but future research to assess this factor more thoroughly to make firmer conclusions. Therefore, it might be important for judges to consider differences in charge seriousness when deciding whether to grant separate trials to defendants who apply for them. It is suggested that there was little information for participants in this study to remember and organise, compared to the amount of information presented in real trials. Further, damaging inadmissible evidence against defendants was not included in this study. Future research should investigate the effects of length and complexity, and inadmissible evidence to assess for any biases against <b>joint</b> trial <b>defendants...</b>|$|R

In a 158 word opinion the court held that for federal diversity jurisdiction under section 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, no party on one side of a suit may be a citizen of the same state as any party on the other side. Therefore, when there are <b>joint</b> plaintiffs or <b>defendants,</b> jurisdiction must be established as to each party.

5000|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Antonin Scalia held that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require courts in capital cases to instruct juries about the burden of proof for establishing mitigating evidence; therefore, the trial courts in this case were under no obligation to inform jurors that [...] "mitigating circumstances need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt". Because the jury instructions in this case told jurors to [...] "consider any mitigating factor", Justice Scalia concluded that [...] "jurors would not have misunderstood these instructions to prevent their consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence". Justice Scalia also concluded that in light of the evidence presented at trial, the <b>joint</b> trial of <b>defendants</b> [...] "did not render the sentencing proceedings fundamentally unfair". Justice Scalia then ordered the case remanded back to the Kansas state court for reconsideration.|$|R
40|$|Under the Criminal Code Compilation Act 1913 (WA), {{any number}} of {{individuals}} may be joined as co-defendants in a single trial, fanning a situation known as a joint trial. The charge/s against each defendant are considered separately and given a separate verdict by the jury. There is considerable debate in the legal arena as to the utility of joint trials, although to date little empirical research exists to substantiate any of the claims made. The present study aimed {{to contribute to the}} sparse knowledge base on joint trials by examining the impact of evidence strength on juror decision making in joint and single trials of the same defendant. Sixty mock juror university students were required to listen to an audiotaped trial summary about a hypothetical assault case that followed the same procedure as would be followed in Australian criminal courts. Evidence strength was manipulated so that defendant A had relatively weak and circumstantial evidence implicating him in the offence, and defendant B had very strong, substantive evidence implicating him in the offence. Two pilot studies confirmed that this manipulation was successful. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions - the single trial of defendant A, the single trial of defendant B, or the <b>joint</b> trial of <b>defendants</b> A and B. After listening to the trial summary, the participants were then required to give a verdict for the defendant/s, and rate the strength of the prosecution and defence evidence presented for the defendant/s. The hypothesis that the effect of joining their trials will be different for defendants A and B in terms of the proportion of guilty verdicts rendered for each defendant was supported. It was found that defendant A was significantly more likely to be found guilty in the joined condition than in the single condition (p 3 ̆c. 05). There was no such effect observed for defendant B (p 3 ̆e. 05). The second hypothesis that the effect of joining their trials will be different for defendants A and B on the perceived strength of prosecution evidence was also supported. Statistical testing revealed that there was {{a significant increase in the}} perceived strength of the prosecution evidence for defendant A in the joint condition, as c 0 mpared to the single condition (p 3 ̆c. 05). There was no significant difference between the prosecution evidence strength ratings for defendant 8 in the single and joint conditions (p 3 ̆e. 05). There was no support for the hypothesis that the effect of joining their trials will be different for defendants A and B on the perceived strength of defence evidence. For both defendants, there was no significant difference between defence evidence strength ratings in the joined and single conditions (p 3 ̆e. 05). These results are interpreted with reference to impression formation theory. The limitations of the present study, including the sample, trial medium, trial elements, consequentiality of the task, and the trial materials are discussed. Directions for future research, such as improvements in the present study and additional sources of bias that may influence verdicts in joint trials, are also examined...|$|R
