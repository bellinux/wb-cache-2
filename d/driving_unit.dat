2500|$|The IRA unit {{arrived in}} Loughgall from the {{northeast}} shortly after 7PM. All were armed and wearing bulletproof vests, boilersuits, gloves and balaclavas. The digger drove past the police station, turned and drove back again with the Toyota van doing the same, ostensibly to check if the coast was clear. Members of the unit felt that something was amiss, and debated whether to continue, but {{decided to go ahead}} with the attack. Tony Gormley and Gerard O'Callaghan got out of the van and joined Declan Arthurs on the digger, according to journalist Peter Taylor, [...] "literally riding shotgun", with weapons in one hand and a lighter in the other. At about 7:15, Declan Arthurs drove the digger towards the base. In the front bucket was 200–400 lb of semtex inside an oil drum, partially hidden by rubble and wired to two 40-second fuses. The other five members of the unit followed in the van with Eugene Kelly <b>driving,</b> <b>unit</b> commander Patrick Kelly in the passenger seat whilst in the rear were Jim Lynagh, Pádraig McKearney, and Seamus Donnelly. [...] The digger crashed through the fence and the fuses were lit. The van stopped a short distance ahead and—according to the British security forces—three of the team jumped out and fired on the building. Author Raymond Murray, however, disputes this. [...] According to Taylor, Patrick Kelly jumped from the passenger seat and, followed by others, immediately opened fire on the base either to encourage the rest of the unit, to resolve dispute about going ahead with the operation, or possibly because this was the way previous attacks had begun. At the same time, the bomb detonated, destroying the digger along with much of the building, and injuring three members of the security forces.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{robotics}} require actuators with high power-to-weight ratios. For example, robots designed to support human movement must be light {{for safety and}} to enable standing and walking, and machines used for construction must have sufficient force to manipulate large objects. Hydraulic actuators are commonly used in these applications because of their power-to-weight ratios and their remote <b>driving</b> <b>units</b> (i.e., power sources, electric motors, servo units, and oil tanks).|$|R
50|$|Spherical robots {{can operate}} as {{autonomous}} robots, or as remotely controlled (teleoperated) robots. In almost all the spherical robots, communication between the internal <b>driving</b> <b>unit</b> and the external control unit (data logging or navigation system) is wireless because of the mobility and closed nature of the spherical shell. The power source of these robots is mostly a battery located inside the robot but there exist some spherical robots that utilize solar cells. Spherical mobile robots can be categorized either by their application or by their drive mechanism.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new member}} of Epi. q robot family, a series of mobile robots with a wheel-legged locomotion and {{with the ability to}} overcome obstacles and move on uneven terrains. The particular feature of this robot family is the ability to switch from a wheel locomotion to a leg locomotion without any external active control but only depending on the dynamic conditions. In particular this work deals with the design of the latest prototype developed, analyzing the design and construction phases. This prototype is more powerful than the previous thanks to the possibility to have four <b>driving</b> <b>units</b> instead of two. The robot architecture has been studied in order to be modular. Several robot configurations can be obtained with the same structure and this allows to test how each component affect the overall robot behavior. Moreover the mechanical design is more accurate and reliable respect to previous versions. A sensing system has been introduced with the aim to evaluate the performances of each robot architecture. Finally an on-board processor has been added. This allows the definition of more complex control logics such as the cooperation between a speed control with a torque control in the four <b>driving</b> <b>units</b> configuration. Moreover it increases the smart tasks that the robot is able to perform such as the developing of a remote autonomous control rather than a manual drive by an operato...|$|R
50|$|In the earlier, Southern-style 5001-5260 series, most units (all {{of which}} were one class only) {{comprised}} a driving motor open saloon including brake {{at each end of}} the set, sandwiching a trailer open and a high-density (6 per side) trailer ten-compartment vehicle with access from the passenger doors; there was no gangway down the coach. A very small number of these 4-EPBs comprised either two open-trailers or two compartment-trailers. A small number of the trailers had been built as 'composites' - a mixture of First and Third Class - and were later fitted out as 9-compartment one-class vehicles but with the former 1st accommodation still identifiable with extra-wide compartments. In the mid-1960s, a number of compartments were marked as women-only, because of the density of cigarette smoke at rush-hour in the general compartments, but as these were not well-regarded they were withdrawn in the late 1960s in favour of non-smoking cars, marked by inverted red triangles om the windows. At first one car per set was allocated to non-smoking, but soon one <b>driving</b> <b>unit</b> and one trailer in each set were the norm.|$|E
