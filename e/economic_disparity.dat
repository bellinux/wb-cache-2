5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The <b>economic</b> <b>disparity</b> between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{research}} {{results of this}} paper show that: educational inequality would have negative impact to the economic growth. If the education inequality rises by 1 %, the China’s economic growth rate would decline by 0. 066 %. And education inequality also really has important influence to economic divergence and convergence. Education inequality enlarged the regional <b>economic</b> <b>disparities</b> on during 1997 - 2002, however education inequality decreased the regional <b>economic</b> <b>disparities</b> at the period of 2003 - 2008 because China’s educational investment system has been the reconstructed, education equality has been improved greatly and the convergence rate of <b>economic</b> <b>disparities</b> has also been prompted. Therefore, improving education equality is the important measure which would be conducive to develop economy in cooperativeness and promote economic convergence.

His critics and Muslim League leaders observed that with the suspension of NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy tried to give more financial allocations, aids, grants, and opportunity to East-Pakistan than West Pakistan, including West Pakistan's four provinces.

[...] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make [...] "valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression." [...] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.|$|E
