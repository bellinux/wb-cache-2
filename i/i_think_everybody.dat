500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves. So we did two weeks and then we'd take some time off and then when everybody felt ready we'd get back in [...] again. As a result, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E
500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{introduced}} an ongoing storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian {{character in the}} Showtime series The L Word, said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: [...] "A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> {{wanted to be the}} one who got to do it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, [...] "I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?" [...] Delany said she did not know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives.|$|E
500|$|The Pistols {{were soon}} playing other {{important}} venues, debuting at Oxford Street's 100 Club on 30 March. On 3 April, they {{played for the}} first time at the Nashville, supporting the 101ers. The pub rock group's lead singer, Joe Strummer, saw the Pistols {{for the first time}} that night—and recognised punk rock as the future. A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April demonstrated the band's growing musical competence, but by all accounts lacked a spark. Westwood provided that by instigating a fight with another audience member; McLaren and Rotten were soon involved in the melee. Cook later said, [...] "That fight at the Nashville: that's when all the publicity got hold of it and the violence started creeping in.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> was ready to go and we were the catalyst." [...] The Pistols were soon banned from both the Nashville and the Marquee.|$|E

Our {{mother and father}} were really were great parents and they hope to be as good a mother as mine, but Sharon's making her own record and will {{hopefully}} release it at some point. But we (the band) never finished, we'll keep it open.|$|R

500|$|Despite some {{moderate}} critical praise {{including a}} glowing review from AllMusic, {{who called the}} album's [...] "impressively surprising" [...] array of sounds [...] "refreshing coming from a band who {{was assumed to be}} generic retro swing", Soul Caddy failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies' accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance and negative audience reactions towards the band's decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled [...] "we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of Zoot Suit Riot...we felt this tension to be something we weren't". Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour's outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, eventually reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. [...] "A lot of it was just fatigue", Perry explained, [...] "We'd be on the road {{for a long time and}} we had no life outside of Cherry Poppin' Daddies. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> was interested in doing other things". The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked [...] "to the curb" [...] after Soul Caddys poor commercial performance.|$|E

In 2010 he {{dismissed}} the [...] "cruel revolutionary rubbish" [...] he promoted {{as a member}} as [...] "poison", but later commented that [...] "it was a reasonable mistake to have made. I'm glad I made it, because unlike people who've been vaccinated against a disease, I've actually had the disease and therefore I'm totally immune from {{it in a way}} that a mere vaccination couldn't possibly provide. ...

Afterwards he made notable games and a lot of ITM. In an interview talking about his success in the WSOP fields he said: [...] "I think Germans in general have a lot of discipline and they work hard. And now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody’s</b> scared of the Germans, so that helps a lot." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, Smith re-joined Iron Maiden, {{along with}} vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, [...] "When {{he left the}} band in 1990, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> was a bit {{surprised}} at how much we missed him and certainly, I don't think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him – big time. I wouldn't have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn't in the band. I just don't {{think it would have}} been complete without Adrian, and now, it's great having three guitarists." [...] The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up's first album, Brave New World, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Harvick said {{afterwards}} that {{he thought}} his team had [...] "a good plan. I think we have great cars, and we've {{made a lot of}} adjustments. ... Hopefully this win and everything getting ready to start with the Chase is going to put all the pieces together, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> has been working hard to do that." [...] In regards to the double burnout he did with Tony Stewart following the race, he said he [...] "wanted him to go on a victory lap with so he could say goodbye to all the fans here at Bristol but that was pretty cool doing some burnouts with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} {{one day before}} it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium. After the screening, it received [...] "wild cheering" [...] from the audience. When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced Wild at Heart as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony, the boos almost drowned out the cheers, with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors. Barry Gifford remembers {{that there was a}} prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail. [...] "All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like 'This is nothing like the book' or 'He ruined my book'. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> from Time magazine to What's On In London was disappointed when I said 'This is fantastic. This is wonderful. It's like a big, dark, musical comedy'".|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Idolator's Mike Wass, Bellion said [...] "Time Low is an illustration of {{what it feels like}} to be three days into a break up — the really heavy, emotional, 'I don’t even know if I want to continue living at this point.' I'm just being majorly honest and letting you know how horrible everything's been since you left. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it's a specific situation but I want it to be broad so everyone can relate to that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody's</b> been in that situation at least once in their life.

2500|$|Rose {{discussed}} the regrouping in a June 2016 interview, stating [...] "It was always {{looked at as}} a possibility, but it never seemed right or felt right". During the interview, Rose also reiterated his intention to release new Guns N' Roses music in the future. Slash later commented on the tour, telling Aerosmith's Joey Kramer {{in an interview with}} WZLX that [...] "We all were pretty positive (the reunion) would never happen, so it’s still sort of blowing our minds.... But everybody’s really getting along great and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody’s</b> come a long way, and it’s all cool." ...|$|R

2500|$|Details {{regarding}} the album were sparse; {{completion of the}} album was announced via a blog post on 8 July 2006. While the record was in the writing and recording stages, some band members were based in New York City and others in Los Angeles. Aaron Turner later confessed that the album [...] "suffered" [...] due to this situation. Jeff Caxide also felt discontent and dissatisfaction with the album, stating that In the Absence of Truth was “the kind of record I listen to and think ‘that could be better, {{and that could be}} better, and that could be better,’ and I think we all kind of felt that way”. Drummer Aaron Harris felt that the band pushed themselves too far musically, too; having learned a wealth of new techniques prior to its recording, he says he “grew so much as a drummer [...] that it was overwhelming even for me.” He continues: “I think I was trying to show off a little bit [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> was.” The eventual record proved dissatisfactory, with him opining that “some of it sounded a bit jumbled. I think a lot of things were happening that we didn't know what to do with.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2014, Azalea told Kiss 108 {{backstage}} at their Jingle Ball Tour 2014 that their collaborative song would premiere in 2015, [...] "We have a song, {{which is going}} to be her first single, coming out next year." [...] Asked how the collaboration came about, Azalea added, [...] "She said she would like to work with me in an interview and they reached out. We recorded a few different things and then one of those just ended up being, I think, undeniably great. Hopefully <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> will get to hear it at the beginning of next year." [...] In February 2015, Azalea tweeted there were [...] "epic" [...] ongoing plans for the song. For Spears's Billboard magazine cover story, published online on March 12, 2015, it was reported that despite Spears being back in the recording studio as back as in September 2014 working on a duet with Azalea, among other tracks, a proper full-length album would not be coming soon. Spears further explained, [...] "I'm gonna do [...] slowly but surely [...] I'm gonna try to do my best to do an amazing album, but it's not my full priority right now". Azalea confirmed the title of the track the following week. Afterwards, in Spears's cover story with People magazine, it was announced that [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] would be released on May 5.|$|E

Of course we showed absolutely no lights. One expected to be surprised any moment, and eventually we were. We suddenly found ourselves within 1000 yards of two or three big Hun cruisers.
