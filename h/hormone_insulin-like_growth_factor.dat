40|$|Skeletal muscle atrophy {{is defined}} as a {{decrease}} in muscle mass and occurs when protein degradation exceeds protein synthesis. Potential triggers of muscle wasting are long-term immobilization, malnutrition, severe burns, aging as well as various serious and often chronic diseases, such as chronic heart failure, obstructive lung disease, renal failure, AIDS, sepsis, immune disorders, cancer and dystrophies. Interestingly, a cooperation between several pathophysiological factors, including inappropriately adapted anabolic (e. g. growth <b>hormone,</b> <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1) and catabolic proteins (e. g. tumor necrosis factor alpha, myostatin), may tip the balance towards muscle-specific protein degradation through activation of the proteasomal and autophagic systems or the apoptotic pathway.

40|$|ABSTRACT With a {{continually}} expanding {{market for}} poultry meat products, increased production demands {{of as much}} as 50 % by the Year 2000 have been predicted. Indications already exist that this magnitude of expansion {{is not likely to be}} met by increased production output and genetic selection alone, and that other methods of improving growth performance per bird via exogenous manipulation of the growth process are needed. Studies in mammalian species clearly demonstrate the importance of growth hormone (GH) and its potential for enhancing productivity in domestic mammals. However, the role of GH in growth of poultry appears to be much more complex. Taken collectively, studies to date indicate that significant, positive effects of GH on growth performance of normal, growing poultry are possible. Expression of such effects appear to be largely contingent on the period of posthatch development (late posthatch being more responsive than early), and the pattern of several key metabolic regulatory hormones resulting in response to GH. Such regulatory hormone responses are largely influenced by the pattern or magnitude of exposure (acute versus chronic) to GH in birds. At this time, the available information on the potential for <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> to enhance <b>growth</b> is limited, and further studies are needed before a definitive role for these peptides in growth and development of poultry can be assigned.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Anorexia and {{cachexia}} are prevalent {{and devastating}} complications of {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) and cancer. Cachexia causes not only loss of body mass, but also decreased energy, decreased therapy tolerance, and increased infection susceptibility, all of which lead to a decreased quality of life. Metabolic abnormalities and decreased appetites seem to be respon-sible for weight loss in cachectic individuals. The release of cytokines {{has been found to}} correlate with weight loss and severe anorexia in animal models. The data in hu-mans is not strong as there are problems in the technical aspects of measuring cytokine levels. Agents such as corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, appetite stimulants, progestational agents, metabolic inhibitors, and anticytokine therapy have been studied for AIDS wasting syndrome and cancer cachexia. Megestrol acetate, a progestational appetite stimulant, has shown the most promise for the treatment of both cancer and AIDS-related cachexia. Recent literature suggests that agents such as growth <b>hormone,</b> <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor,</b> and thalidomide may stimulate lean body mass gain rather than fat mass gain.

40|$|The {{postnatal}} development and maturation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of neonatal calves {{is crucial for}} their survival.

It is generally accepted that colostrum intake provokes the maturation of organs and systems in young calves, illustrating {{the significance of the}} cow-to-calf connection at birth. These postnatal adaptive changes of the GI tissues in neonatal calves are especially induced by the action of bioactive substances such as <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>hormones,</b> or cholesterol carriers abundantly present in colostrum.

Design and methods: We report nine cases of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis in a cohort of 273 patients treated with ipilimumab between 2006 and 2015, as part of clinical trials or after its marketing. Thyroid function tests were scheduled at screening and during follow up (every 21 days) in all patients.

Environmental contaminants in particular, can act as environmental stressors on fish, typically causing disruption of ion homeostasis due to their close association with the aquatic environment. To examine the effects of the xenoestrogen 4 -nonylphenol (NP) or 17 �-estradiol (E 2) on stress sensitivity and ion regulation, we exposed juvenile Atlantic salmon continuously for 21 d to either 10 or 100 �g/L NP (NP-L or NP-H), 2 �g/L E 2 (positive control), or vehicle control during the parr-smolt transformation in April. After treatment, fish were sampled in freshwater (FW), transferred to 30 ‰ seawater (SW) for 24 h, or subjected to a handling stress. Estradiol and NP-H increased plasma vitellogenin in males and females, and E 2 increased gonadosomatic index only in males. In FW, E 2 reduced sodium potassium–activated adenosine triphosphatase activity as well as plasma levels of growth <b>hormone,</b> <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I, and triiodothyronine. Both E 2 and NP-H reduced plasma sodium in FW and increased plasma chloride in SW. Plasma cortisol levels pre- and poststressor were significantly elevated by all treatments relative to controls, but only E 2 increased plasma glucose before and after the stressor. These results indicate that exposure of anadromous salmonids to environmental estrogens heightens sensitivity to external stressors, impairs ion regulation in both FW and SW, and disrupts endocrine pathways critical for smolt development...|$|E

About 15 % to 20 % of type 1 diabetic patients and 30 % to 40 % of type 2 diabetic patients will eventually develop end-stage renal failure. To prevent the development or progression of diabetic kidney disease, good glycaemic control remains the cornerstone in the management of diabetic patients. Beyond glycaemic control, other metabolic factors {{have been shown to be}} involved in the development of diabetic kidney disease, i. e. advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and the aldose reductase pathway. Furthermore, an adequate control of high blood pressure and treatment of microalbuminuria are major therapeutic targets. To achieve adequate blood pressure control, a combination therapy with different classes of anti hypertensive agents is often necessary, especially including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Ghrelin requires modification by medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) to exert its physiological effects. In this study, we investigated ghrelin activation and the resulting physiological changes following MCT administration. MethodsThirty participants were selected from among inpatients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN). The patients were randomly divided into three groups by the MCT content of their nutritional supplement: (1) ‘MCT high’ (> 6  g/day), (2) ‘MCT moderate’ (1 – 6  g/day), and (3) ‘MCT low’ (< 1  g/day). Physical factors such as body weight and composition, as well as levels of nutrition-related serum factors such as acylated (active form) and desacyl (inactive form) ghrelin, leptin, growth <b>hormone,</b> <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor,</b> and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 of the treatment protocol.

Sexually mature 8 -wk-old CD 1 male mice were administered by gavages in corn oil daily with 0, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS for 7, 14, or 21 days. Serum concentrations of testosterone and epididymal sperm counts were significantly lower in the mice after 21 days of the exposure to the highest dose compared with the controls. The expression levels of testicular receptors for gonadotropin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor 1 were considerably reduced on Day 21 in mice exposed daily to 10 or 5 mg/kg PFOS. The transcript levels of the subunits of the testicular factors (i. e., inhibins and activins), Inha, Inhba, and Inhbb, were significantly lower on Day 21 of daily exposure to 10, 5, or 1 mg/kg PFOS.

At 1 week postpartum, spindle-shaped cells were seen in the testicular interstitium that differed from the precursor cells in that they were 3 βHSD-negative, luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor (LHR) -negative, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) -positive. These cells were purified from the testes of 1 -week-old rats. The cells contained proteins known to be involved in LC development, including GATA 4, c-kit receptor, and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. The putative SLCs expanded over the course of 6 months while remaining undifferentiated. When treated in media that contained thyroid <b>hormone,</b> <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I, and LH, 40 % of the putative SLCs came to express 3 βHSD and to synthesize testosterone. When transplanted into host rat testes from which LCs had been eliminated, the putative SLCs colonized the interstitium and subsequently expressed 3 βHSD, demonstrating their ability to differentiate in vivo. We conclude that these cells are likely to be the sought-after SLCs...|$|E
50|$|Estrone is {{approximately}} 10-fold less potent relative to estradiol as an estrogen, {{and also has}} a different binding profile relative to estradiol, for instance, lacking affinity to the GPER. In addition, the resulting supraphysiological levels of estrogen in the liver (4- to 5-fold higher relative to the circulation) {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, suppress <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (GH)-mediated <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (IGF-1) production, and increase levels of a variety of binding proteins including thyroid binding globulin (TBG), cortisol binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), growth hormone binding protein (GHBP), <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs), and copper binding protein (CBP), but also produce positive blood lipid changes.|$|R

We {{conducted}} pilot studies in Mongolia and Massachusetts to test {{the extent to which}} milk intake raised somatotropic hormone concentrations in prepubertal children. Methods In Ulaanbaatar, we compared plasma levels before and after introducing 710 ml daily whole milk for a month among 46 10 – 11 year old schoolchildren.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the effects of stress <b>hormones</b> on <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (IGF- 1). Methods. Insulin induced hypoglycemia (< 3 mmol/l) and clonidine induced depression of noradrenergic tone were used to assess the acute effects of cortisol, human growth hormone (hGH), and norepinephrine (NE). Results. Despite the increase of hGH during hypoglycemia, a statistically significant decrease of IGF- 1 was observed along with the expected rise of cortisol and NE. To eliminate the role played by NE, NE tone was depressed by administering clonidine. A statistically significant decrease of IGF- 1 was also observed. Conclusion. Acute cortisol release or a NE decrease induce low IGF- 1 levels...|$|R
