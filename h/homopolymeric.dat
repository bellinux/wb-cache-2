50|$|The {{protocols}} for 5' or 3' RACES differ slightly. 5' RACE-PCR begins using mRNA as {{a template}} for a first round of cDNA synthesis (or reverse transcription) reaction using an anti-sense (reverse) oligonucleotide primer that recognizes a known sequence {{in the middle of}} the gene of interest; the primer is called a gene specific primer (GSP). The primer binds to the mRNA, and the enzyme reverse transcriptase adds base pairs to the 3' end of the primer to generate a specific single-stranded cDNA product; this is the reverse complement of the mRNA. Following cDNA synthesis, the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is used to add a string of identical nucleotides, known as a <b>homopolymeric</b> tail, to the 3' end of the cDNA. (There are some other ways to add the 3'-terminal sequence for the first strand of the de novo cDNA synthesis which are much more efficient than <b>homopolymeric</b> tailing, but the sense of the method remains the same). A PCR reaction is then carried out, which uses a second anti-sense gene specific primer (GSP2) that binds to the known sequence, and a sense (forward) universal primer (UP) that binds the <b>homopolymeric</b> tail added to the 3' ends of the cDNAs to amplify a cDNA product from the 5' end.|$|E

30|$|During amplification, oligo-T primers {{can also}} serve as {{templates}} and get tailed. It is therefore necessary to remove these primers before next round of PCR amplification. Purified ssDNA with 3 ′ poly-A tail was first subjected to several rounds of low-annealing-temperature linear amplification aiming to add anchor sequence to the oligo-A ends. Then we applied amplification based on anchor sequences at both ends, with higher annealing temperature, to boost the yield of the final product. Through amplification, the oligo-T-containing primers will generate two long <b>homopolymeric</b> A:T pairing sections in each amplicon. These <b>homopolymeric</b> regions will create difficulties during sequencing, not only sacrificing the informative read length but also lowering the sequencing quality. To remove such <b>homopolymeric</b> regions, we inserted two AcuI digestion sites that can be removed by the Acul restriction endonuclease together with 16 A-T basepairs. The resulting DNA products are suitable for standard Illumina library preparation (end repair and ligation) (Fig.  1 B).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Helicobacter canadensis is an {{emerging}} human pathogen and zoonotic agent. The genome of H. canadensis was sequenced previously {{and determined to}} contain 29 annotated coding regions associated with <b>homopolymeric</b> tracts. Results Twenty-one of the repeat-associated coding regions were determined to be potentially transcriptionally or translationally phase variable. In each case the <b>homopolymeric</b> tract was within the predicted promoter region or at the 5 ' end of the coding region, respectively. However, eight coding sequences were identified with simple sequence repeats toward the 3 ' end of the open reading frame. In these cases, the repeat tract would be too far into the coding region to be mediating translational phase variation. All of the 29 coding region-associated <b>homopolymeric</b> tracts display variability in tract length in the sequencing read data. Conclusions Twenty-nine coding regions {{have been identified in}} the genome sequence of Helicobacter canadensis strain NCTC 13241 that show variations in <b>homopolymeric</b> tract length in the bacterial population, indicative of phase variation. Five of these are potentially associated with promoter regions, which would lead to transcriptional phase variation. Translational phase variation usually switches expression of a gene ON and OFF due to the repeat region being located sufficiently close to the initiation codon for the resulting frame-shift to lead to a premature termination codon and stop the translation of the protein. Sixteen of the 29 coding regions have <b>homopolymeric</b> tracts characteristic of translational phase variation. For eight coding sequences with repeats located later in the reading frame, changes in the repeat tract length would alter the protein sequence at the C -terminus but not stop the expression of the protein. This mechanism of C -terminal phase variation has implications for stochastic switching of protein sequence in bacterial species that already undergo transcriptional and translational phase variation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} enabled direct quantification of genome-wide errors that occur during RNA transcription. These errors occur at rates that are {{orders of magnitude}} higher than rates during DNA replication, but due to technical difficulties such measurements have been limited to single-base substitutions and have not yet quantified the scope of transcription insertions and deletions. Previous reporter gene assay findings suggested that transcription indels are produced exclusively by elongation complex slippage at <b>homopolymeric</b> runs, so we enumerated indels across the protein-coding transcriptomes of Escherichia coli and Buchnera aphidicola, which differ widely in their genomic base compositions and incidence of repeat regions. As anticipated from prior assays, transcription insertions prevailed in <b>homopolymeric</b> runs of A and T; however, transcription deletions arose in much more complex sequences and were rarely associated with <b>homopolymeric</b> runs.

40|$|Escherichia coli DinB (DNA {{polymerase}} IV) possesses {{an enzyme}} architecture resulting in specialized lesion bypass function {{and the potential}} for creating − 1 frameshifts in <b>homopolymeric</b> nucleotide runs. We have previously shown that the mutagenic potential of DinB is regulated by the DNA damage response protein UmuD 2. In the current study, we employ a pre-steady-state fluorescence approach to gain a mechanistic understanding of DinB regulation by UmuD 2. Our results suggest that DinB, like its mammalian and archaeal orthologs, uses a template slippage mechanism to create single base deletions on <b>homopolymeric</b> runs. With 2 -aminopurine as a fluorescent reporter in the DNA substrate, the template slippage reaction results in a prechemistry fluorescence change that is inhibited by UmuD 2. We propose a model in which DNA templates containing <b>homopolymeric</b> nucleotide runs, when bound to DinB, are in an equilibrium between non-slipped and slipped conformations.

We hypothesized that this variant may predispose to dilated cardiomyopathy in people who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods A case-control study of 30 HIV-positive cases with dilated cardiomyopathy and 37 HIV-positive controls without dilated cardiomyopathy was conducted. The study was confined to persons of black African ancestry to minimize confounding of results by population admixture. HIV-positive patients with an echocardiographically confirmed diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy and HIV-positive controls with echocardiographically normal hearts were studied. Patients with secondary causes of cardiomyopathy (such as hypertension, diabetes, pregnancy, alcoholism, valvular heart disease, and opportunistic infection) {{were excluded from the}} study. DNA samples were sequenced for the mtDNA T 16189 C polymorphism with a <b>homopolymeric</b> C-tract in the forward and reverse directions on an ABI 3100 sequencer. Results The cases and controls were well matched for age (median 35 years versus 34 years, P = 0. 93), gender (males 60 % vs 53 %, P = 0. 54), and stage of HIV disease (mean CD 4 T cell count 260. 7 /μL vs. 176 /μL, P = 0. 21). The mtDNA T 16189 C variant with a <b>homopolymeric</b> C-tract was detected at a frequency of 26. 7 % (8 / 30) in the HIV-associated cardiomyopathy cases and 13. 5 % (5 / 37) in the HIV-positive controls.

The establishment of rhizobium-legume symbioses requires the bacterial synthesis of oligosaccharides, exopolysaccharides, and capsular polysaccharides. Previous studies suggested that the 3 -deoxy-d-manno-oct- 2 -ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo) <b>homopolymeric</b> capsular polysaccharide produced by strain Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm 1021 contributes to symbiosis with Medicago sativa under some conditions. However, a conclusive symbiotic role for this polysaccharide could not be determined {{due to a lack of}} mutants affecting its synthesis. In this study, we have further characterized the synthesis, secretion, and symbiotic function of the Kdo <b>homopolymeric</b> capsule. We showed that mutants lacking the enigmatic rkp- 1 gene cluster fail to display the Kdo capsule on the cell surface but accumulate an intracellular polysaccharide of unusually high Mr. In addition, we have demonstrated that mutations in kdsB 2, smb 20804, and smb 20805 affect the polymerization of the Kdo <b>homopolymeric</b> capsule. Our studies also suggest a role for the capsular polysaccharide in symbiosis. Previous reports have shown that the overexpression of rkpZ from strain Rm 41 allows for the symbiosis of exoY mutants of Rm 1021 that are unable to produce the exopolysaccharide succinoglycan.

In addition, at least 3 meningococcal isolates from different body parts of each of 11 patients were analyzed. Sequence analysis of the porA promoter showed that the spacer between the - 35 and - 10 regions varies in length between 14 and 24 bp. PorA expression was observed in strains with a porA promoter spacer of 16 to 24 bp. All but one strain with a porA promoter spacer of 16 to 20 bp and undetectable PorA expression have a <b>homopolymeric</b> tract of 8 or 6 instead of 7 adenine residues in the porA coding region.

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the nature of the}} mutant androgen receptor in a family with a severe defect in virilization associated with a qualitative defect in receptor function. The androgen receptor gene in this family contains two structural alterations: a single nucleotide substitution at position 2444 in exon 5 (adenosine [...] guanosine) that converts tyrosine 761 to a cysteine residue and a shortened glutamine <b>homopolymeric</b> segment in exon 1 that encodes 12 rather than the usual 20 - 22 glutamines. A family study was performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the glutamine-rich segment, and it was shown that the sister of the proband does not carry the mutant allele. The effects of these two mutations on the function of the androgen receptor were studied by introducing the changes, individually and in combination, into cDNAs encoding the normal human androgen receptor and analyzing the receptor protein produced after transfection of the cDNAs into eukaryotic cells. The presence of a cysteine residue at position 761 causes rapid dissociation of dihydrotestosterone from the receptor protein. Marked thermolability of the transfected receptor protein, however, was demonstrable only upon introduction of an androgen receptor cDNA containing both the partial deletion of the glutamine <b>homopolymeric</b> segment and a cysteine residue at position 761. Likewise, the ability of the receptor to stimulate a reporter gene is strikingly diminished only when both alterations are present, suggesting that the shortened glutamine <b>homopolymeric</b> segment amplifies the impairment of receptor function caused by the tyrosine to cysteine substitution...|$|E
40|$|Mutation is {{the source}} of genetic {{variation}} and fuels biological evolution. Many mutations first arise as DNA replication errors. These errors subsequently evade correction by cellular DNA repair, for example by the well-known DNA mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism. Here we determine the genome-wide effects of MMR on mutation. We first identify ~ 9, 000 mutations accumulated over 5 generations in 8 MMR-deficient mutation accumulation (MA) lines of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. We then show that MMR deficiency greatly increases the frequency of both smaller-scale insertions and deletions (indels) and of single nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations. Most indels involve A or T nucleotides and occur preferentially in <b>homopolymeric</b> (poly A or poly T) genomic stretches. In addition, we find that the likelihood of occurrence of indels in <b>homopolymeric</b> stretches is strongly related to stretch length, and that this relationship causes ultra-high localized mutation rates in specific <b>homopolymeric</b> stretch regions. For SNVs, we show that MMR-deficiency both increases their frequency and changes their molecular mutational spectrum, causing further enhancement of the GC to AT bias characteristic of organisms with normal MMR function. Our final genome-wide analyses show that MMR-deficiency disproportionately increases the numbers of SNVs in genes, rather than in non-genic regions of the genome. This latter observation indicates that MMR preferentially protects genes from mutation, and has important consequences for understanding the evolution of genomes during both natural selection and human tumor growth...|$|E
