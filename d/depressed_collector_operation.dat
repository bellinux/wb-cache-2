RF measurements at pulse duration of a few milliseconds yielded an RF output power of 1. 15 MW at a beam current of 40 A and a beam voltage of 84 W. <b>Depressed</b> <b>collector</b> <b>operation</b> has been possible up to decelerating voltages of 33 kV without any reduction of the output power. Long pulse operation (10 s at 1 MW) was possible without any signs of a limitation caused by the tube. For this output power the efficiency of the tube could be increased from about 30 % without to about 50 % with depression voltage. The best performance reached so far has produced an energy per pulse as high as 90 MJ (power 0. 64 MW, pulse length 140 s) which is the highest value achieved in gyrotrons operating at this frequency and power level.

This thesis presents an experimental study of efficiency enhancement in a 1. 5 MW, 110 GHz gyrotron oscillator, which operated at 50 % efficiency with a single-stage <b>depressed</b> <b>collector.</b> We present the design and detailed experimental results of a new low ohmic loss cavity, a four-mirror internal mode converter and a single-stage <b>depressed</b> <b>collector.</b> The low ohmic loss TE 22, 6 cavity, designated "V- 2005 ", was designed using the code MAGY to have a Q factor of 830, which would be suitable for CW operation in an industrial gyrotron. The cavity was first tested in the axial configuration, in which the output waveguide also serves as the electron beam collector. In 3 microsecond pulsed operation at 97 kV and 40 A, an output power of 1. 67 MW at an efficiency of 42 % was obtained without a <b>depressed</b> <b>collector.</b> The V- 2005 cavity efficiency exceeds that of the older "V- 2003 " cavity by 5 percentage points. The enhanced efficiency of the V- 2005 cavity may be understood by analyzing the start-up scenario of the cavities. During start-up, the V- 2003 cavity suffers from strong mode competition with the TE 19, 7 mode, resulting in a relatively low efficiency, while the V- 2005 cavity has an absence of such mode competition. The experimental mode maps (regions of oscillation vs. magnetic field) obtained for the two cavities are in excellent agreement with the start-up simulations. Following the axial configuration experiments, the experiment was rebuilt with an internal mode converter consisting of a launcher and 4 mirrors, and with a single-stage <b>depressed</b> <b>collector.</b> An output power of 1. 5 MW was measured. The internal mode converter operated at 90 % efficiency. When the <b>depressed</b> <b>collector</b> was run at 25 kV, an overall efficiency of 50 % was achieved. An aftercavity interaction (ACI) was investigated as a possible cause of efficiency reduction in the gyrotron. (cont.) The ACI occurs when the spent electron beam interacts at cyclotron resonance with the traveling output microwave beam in a region of lower magnetic field just after the cavity. The presence of the ACI was identified from the comparison between simulation results and the measurement of the depression voltage as a function of beam current. Future research should consider ways of eliminating the ACI, ways of improving the internal mode converter, and the use of a two-stage <b>depressed</b> <b>collector.</b> by Eunmi Choi. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{observation of the}} effect of an aftercavity interaction (ACI) in a <b>depressed</b> <b>collector</b> gyrotron oscillator. The gyrotron generates an output power of 1. 5 MW at 110 GHz in 3 μs pulses with a 96 kV and 40 A electron beam and has a single-stage <b>depressed</b> <b>collector.</b> The ACI arises from an unintended cyclotron resonant interaction between the microwave beam traveling out from the cavity and the gyrating electron beam. The interaction occurs in the uptaper of the launcher, immediately downstream from the cavity, where the magnetic field is slightly lower than its value in the cavity region. The ACI results in a reduction in efficiency since the electron beam tends to extract power from the wave. There is also a broadening of the spent beam energy profile, which reduces the effectiveness of the <b>depressed</b> <b>collector</b> and in turn limits the overall efficiency of a gyrotron. Measurements of the maximum depression voltage of the collector vs beam current at 96 kV are compared with simulations from the MAGY code [M. Botton, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 26, 882 (1998) ]. Excellent agreement is obtained between theory and experiment but only if the ACI is included. In the present experiment, it is estimated that the observed efficiency of 50 % would have been about 60 % {{in the absence of the}} ACI. These results verify the role of the ACI in reducing the efficiency of the gyrotron interaction. open 151...|$|R
