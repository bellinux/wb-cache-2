40|$|Managers often {{struggle}} to promote {{an environment in}} which <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> have the opportunity to develop trust, which is central part of a design team's knowledge sharing. Trust plays a significant role in whether <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> cooperate or not and whether <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> share or conceal knowledge from the team members. Trust is determined {{to be one of the}} several antecedents to knowledge sharing as well as being integral to other variables that impact knowledge sharing culture. This study aims to investigate the factors that affect trust in design team knowledge sharing culture. This review provides more insight to managers and <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> on the value of trust and the factors affecting trust in building knowledge sharing culture and offers directions for enhancement...|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{technology}} and systems used on Black Arrow had already been developed or flight-proven on the Black Knight rocket, or the Blue Steel missile. Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible {{in order to reduce}} costs, and simplify the development process. Many senior staff of the Black Knight programme transferred directly to Black Arrow, including the Chief Missile Scientist, Roy Dommett, the Chief <b>Design</b> <b>Engineer,</b> Ray Wheeler and the Deputy Chief Engineer, John Underwood.|$|E
5|$|The final {{construction}} {{plan was}} accepted in February 1958 and work began in September of that year. Mott, Hay and Anderson and Freeman Fox and Partners {{carried out the}} design work and a joint venture of Sir William Arrol & Co., Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and Dorman Long constructed the bridge {{at a cost of}} £11.5million, while the total cost of the project including road connections and realignments was £19.5 million. The resident <b>design</b> <b>engineer</b> was John Alexander King Hamilton FRSE (1900–1982).|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from Korea, Bolt was {{assigned}} to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. as an aircraft <b>design</b> <b>engineer.</b> In this duty, he was detailed to The Pentagon and a board which reported on aircraft performance and tactics. A press conference was held in September 1953 to welcome him to the position, and during this he recounted stories from his service in Korea {{for the first time to}} local newspapers. Bolt's experiences in World War II and the Korean War were used to help shape air combat doctrine. He worked in this assignment for around a year, until 1954 when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and moved to the Naval Pilot Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, in St. Mary's County, Maryland. During this time, he took evening classes at the University of Maryland, eventually earning a Bachelor of Science in Military History.|$|E
40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>engineers</b> {{and process}} {{planners}} need {{to search for}} similar <b>designs.</b> <b>Design</b> <b>engineers</b> use similar <b>designs</b> to estimate a new design’s manufacturability. Like process planners, who need to generate process plans before production begins, <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> can use an existing, similar design’s process plan {{to create a new}} process plan. Then, they can evaluate the new design. Variant process planning, a common process planning approach, uses a design similarity measure to identify the most similar design and retrieve a useful process plan. However, standard design similarity measures do not explicitly consider the production process. This paper presents an approach for developing a new class of plan-based design similarity measures. Such a measure explicitly exploits process plan similarity and thus improves the variant process planning approach. An example illustrates the approach and compares the new measure and a traditional group technology code-based approach. <b>Design</b> <b>engineers</b> and process planners need to search for similar <b>designs.</b> Manufacturers, <b>engineers,</b> and researchers have understood for many years that designers (or produc...|$|R

5|$|In 1933, MGM hired Hilliard {{away from}} UA. His first {{assignment}} was to fix their problematic recording amplifiers whose overall phase shift measured {{out to a}} voice-distorting 1500 degrees. Hilliard's solution was to use higher linearity transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company, in consultation with founder Jim Lansing. Earlier, Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife's, Dr. John Blackburn, and in 1934, he helped Blackburn get a position as <b>design</b> <b>engineer</b> at Lansing Manufacturing. The following year, Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald's flat and weak soprano voice, picking up an Academy Award for Sound Recording on the duo's first film together: Naughty Marietta.|$|E
5|$|The Specialized Training Program was {{dissolved}} in early 1944, as {{the progress of}} the war tipped in favor of the Allies; many of the CCNY classmates were transferred to the infantry, while Koval and a dozen others were selected for the Special Engineer Detachment. The Detachment was part of the covert project to <b>design,</b> <b>engineer,</b> and fabricate an atomic bomb—an American, Canadian and British initiative known as the Manhattan Project. Koval was assigned to Oak Ridge, Tennessee; at the time, Project scientists were researching enriched uranium and plutonium-based bombs, with the Oak Ridge laboratories central to the development of both. The Project suffered from a lack of human resources, and asked the Army for technically qualified men.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Arroyo Seco Parkway, {{designed}} {{under the}} leadership of District Chief Engineer Spencer V. Cortelyou and <b>Design</b> <b>Engineer</b> A. D. Griffin, began with a groundbreaking ceremony in South Pasadena on March 22, 1938 and generally progressed from Pasadena southwest. The first contract, stretching less than a mile (1.5km) from Glenarm Street in Pasadena around Raymond Hill to Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena, and including no bridges, was opened to traffic on December 10, 1938. A 3.7-mile (6.0km) section opened on July 20, 1940, connecting Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena with Avenue 40 in Los Angeles. The remainder in Los Angeles, from Avenue 40 southwest to the Figueroa Street Viaduct at Avenue 22, was opened on December 30, 1940, in time for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. However, the highway through South Pasadena was not completed until January 30, 1941, and landscaping work continued through September. The final cost of $5.75 million, under $1 million per mile, was extremely low for a freeway project because the terrain was favorable for grade separations.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to develop and {{evaluate}} a prototype designer feedback tool to give manufacturability feedback information to <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> early at the conceptual design stage. Providing <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> early manufacturability information on their designs helps them to improve manufacturing quality of their designs thus reducing the overall cost and lead time to manufacture. The Three Dimensional Integrated Feedback (3 DIF) system is designed to be a manufacturing visualization feedback tool that is generalizable, automated, usable, inexpensive and portable. Feedback given to <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> can be in various modalities, including verbal, text, 2 D drawings, or 3 D. Information abstraction and modality significantly affect its interpretation, so it is important that feedback given to the <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> should be in the language understandable to them and is able to convey necessary information with minimal interpretation. An experiment has been designed to evaluate performance and workload differences between expert and novice <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> when they conduct design tasks in feedback modalities [...] The preliminary results from the study show that providing feedback in 3 D improves the manufacturing quality of the end design with lower overall cognitive workload...|$|R
50|$|<b>Design</b> <b>engineers</b> {{may work}} in a team along with other {{designers}} to create the drawings necessary for prototyping and production, {{or in the case}} of buildings, for construction. However, with the advent of CAD and solid modeling software, the <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> may create the drawings themselves, or perhaps with the help of many corporate service providers.|$|R
40|$|Design {{engineering}} {{has become}} a global business. Accordingly, <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> are confronted with a need to collaborate with other <b>design</b> <b>engineers,</b> coming from different countries {{from all parts of}} the world. So engineers with entirely different cultural backgrounds have to successfully work together in design teams. Some of them succeed better in this task, some worse. An unsolved question is why there are these differences in performing cross-cultural collaboration. This paper presents an approach to determining factors in the backgrounds of <b>design</b> <b>engineers,</b> which influence their way of performing design tasks in cross-cultural collaboration. A qualitative study has been deployed therefore. Study design, conduction and results are presented in this paper...|$|R
5|$|In 1928, Sverdrup {{joined with}} his former University of Minnesota {{engineering}} professor John Ira Parcel {{in the formation of}} Sverdrup & Parcel, a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges. Parcel had tenure at Minnesota {{for a long time and}} was reluctant to sever his ties completely, but eventually he decided to join the new company, taking an unpaid Sabbatical from the university for one year. Sverdrup owned 60% and Parcel 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he asked them if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired <b>design</b> <b>engineer</b> Brice R. Smith from Missouri's leading supplier of bridge components. By 1936, all three would become partners in the firm.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation chief <b>design</b> <b>engineer,</b> John L. Savage, {{surveyed}} {{the area and}} drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'. Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river {{above and below the}} dam too great for alternative methods. Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, {{in the midst of the}} Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{doubled the}} Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit to 3litres for the 1966 season and suitable engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm Repco, {{which had never}} produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 engine blocks from the defunct American Oldsmobile F85 road car project, and other off-the-shelf parts. Consulting and <b>design</b> <b>engineer</b> Phil Irving (of Vincent Motorcycle fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive, but the light and reliable cars ran at the front {{from the start of}} the season. At the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux, Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former teammate, Bruce McLaren, has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name (cf Surtees, Hill and Fittipaldi Automotive). In 1967, the title went to Brabham's teammate, New Zealander Denny Hulme. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Brabham's desire to try new parts first. The Brabham team took the Constructors' World Championship in both years.|$|E

This research defines the changing role of <b>design</b> <b>engineers,</b> and it discusses their impact on setting clear project targets and sharing knowledge about customers. The study investigates the impact of these variables on product development productivity. Data collected from 205 manufacturing firms were used to create valid and reliable instruments to assess role change of <b>design</b> <b>engineers,</b> clarity of project targets, shared knowledge about customers and product development productivity. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that as the role of <b>design</b> <b>engineers</b> expands the clarity of project targets increase.
