5|$|Based on Japanese mythology, Orochimaru {{was created}} {{as one of}} the series' main antagonists, and {{intended}} to represent the opposite of the protagonists' morals and values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended to make it easier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> to recognize that he is a villain. In Japanese, Orochimaru has been voiced by Kujira whereas in the English dub he is voiced by Steve Blum.|$|E
5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to its conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a history of censorship of artworks. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, as a method of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,"such laws were put forth by United States Postal Inspection Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail".|$|E

5|$|You {{are serving}} many masters, and inevitably you are {{compromise}}d. The man speaks and you listen {{but you do}} not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes....|$|E

25|$|Time- The {{novel is}} not chronological, {{but rather a}} series of anecdotes told by Anna. For example, stories of Alyona as a child, teenager, and mother are intermixed and often told without time markers.

25|$|The Waste Land {{is notable}} for its {{seemingly}} disjointed structure, {{indicative of the}} Modernist style of James Joyce's Ulysses (which Eliot cited as an influence and which he read {{the same year that}} he was writing The Waste Land). In the Modernist style, Eliot jumps from one voice or image to another without clearly delineating these shifts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> He also includes phrases from multiple foreign languages (Latin, Greek, Italian, German, French and Sanskrit), indicative of Pound's influence.|$|E
25|$|Ms. Jeri Johnson, senior tutor in English at Exeter College, Oxford, {{spoke as}} an expert witness in {{literature}} for the plaintiffs, decrying Vander Ark's work as unscholarly, and claiming that there was enough material in Rowling's world for serious academic analysis. Rowling's lawyers said that, unlike those guides, the Lexicon consists largely of information taken from the books and contains little interpretation or analysis. RDR's lawyers agreed, but said that such guides can provide other benefits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> than analysis.|$|E
