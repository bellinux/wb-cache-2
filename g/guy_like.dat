500|$|The Florida State {{defense was}} {{considered}} key to reining in Tech quarterback Vick. The Seminoles allowed less than 100rushing {{yards per game}} on average, and intercepted 22passes during the regular season. The Seminoles were ranked 15th nationally in pass defense {{at the end of}} the regular season but had allowed increasing amounts of pass yardage in the latter games of the season. Despite that fact, the Florida State defense's main concern was Michael Vick's ability to run the football.
