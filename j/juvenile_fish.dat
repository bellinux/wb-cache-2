Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition.

5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and <b>juvenile</b> <b>fish,</b> molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E

5|$|Dams {{interrupt}} {{the migration of}} anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams {{in which they were}} born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate. In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports <b>juvenile</b> <b>fish</b> downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper body}} of the bluefin {{trevally}} is a silver-brassy colour, fading to silvery white {{on the underside of}} the fish, often with blue hues. After they reach lengths greater than 16cm, blue-black spots appear on the upper flanks of the fish, with these becoming more prolific with age. There is no dark spot on the operculum. The species takes its name from the colour of its dorsal, anal and caudal fins, which are a diagnostic electric blue. The pelvic and pectoral fins are white, with the pectoral fin having a yellow tinge. <b>Juvenile</b> <b>fish</b> do not have the bright blue fins, instead have dark fins with the exception of a yellow pectoral fin.

40|$|In {{open access}} marine fisheries, the non-targeted catches {{in the form}} of juveniles are detrimental, as this would reduce future yield and {{subsequent}} recruitment to the fishery. The proliferating impact of <b>juvenile</b> <b>fishing</b> is much more intense in a multi-gear multi-species fishery like Indian marine fisheries, where intra- and inter-sectoral conflicts exist. Marine fishing in India is contributing significantly to the country’s economic growth and the coastal livelihood security. Although the recent changes in the techno-harvesting pattern of inshore fisheries of the country has led to a remarkable increase in fish landings, the problem of by-catch and targeted <b>juvenile</b> <b>fishing</b> is ever increasing. The present analysis shows that the contribution {{in the form of}} annual average profit by various craft–gear combinations is often not sufficient to compensate the overall loss generated by the same to the fishery through the harvest of <b>juvenile</b> <b>fishes.</b> Even though the fishermen gain some transient economic incentives from the juveniles landed, the estimated economic loss calculated was at about US 19, 445 million year− 1 from the mechanised as well as motorised sector.

We investigated the frontal areas, zooplankton abundance around the drifting seaweed, and the food availability of <b>fish</b> <b>juveniles</b> associated with drifting seaweed accumulations in the East China Sea in 2012 and 2013. A total of 14 drifting seaweed mass and 22 species (n = 408) of <b>fish</b> <b>juveniles</b> were collected. We found that 49. 7 - 99. 7 % of the individual fed on planktonic food and the feeding incidence on phytal animals was less than 50 %. Although drifting seaweeds were aggregated around the frontal areas of surface currents, the zooplankton abundance was not significantly different between these frontal areas and other areas.

The blue runner is primarily a semi-pelagic fish, inhabiting both inshore reefs and the outer shelf edges, sill reefs and upper slopes of the deep reef. Those individuals on shallower reefs often move between reef patches over large sand expanses. <b>Juvenile</b> <b>fish</b> are also known to inhabit the shallow waters of inshore lagoons, taking refuge around mangroves or in seagrass amongst coral reef patches.

25|$|The bumpnose trevally, Carangoides hedlandensis (also {{known as}} the bumpnose {{kingfish}} and onion kingfish) is a species of relatively small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The bumpnose trevally is fairly common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Samoa in the east. It is a small species by carangid standards, reaching a maximum known length of 32cm, and can be distinguished from the similarly shaped Carangoides armatus by a distinct 'bump' on the snout, which gives the fish its common name. The species inhabits coastal waters, often living along bays and beaches, where it takes shrimp, small crabs, and <b>juvenile</b> <b>fish</b> as prey. The bumpnose trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, trawls, and seine nets. It is also of minor importance to anglers, taken by baits from beaches and piers, and is considered a modest table fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of an {{anadromous}} salmon begins and, if it survives the full course of its natural life, usually ends in a gravel bed in {{the upper reaches of}} a stream or river. These are the salmon spawning grounds where salmon eggs are deposited, for safety, in the gravel. The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch into tiny larvae called sac fry or alevin. The alevin have a sac containing the remainder of the yolk, and they stay hidden in the gravel while they feed on the yolk. When the yolk has gone they must find food for themselves, so they leave the protection of the gravel and start feeding on plankton. At this point the baby salmon are called fry. At {{the end of the summer}} the fry develop into <b>juvenile</b> <b>fish</b> called parr. Parr feed on small invertebrates and are camouflaged with a pattern of spots and vertical bars.
