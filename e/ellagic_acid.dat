The available data indicate interesting chemical constitutions of some bryophyte species, i. e., active and new compounds {{are to be found}} within bryophytes, especially liverworts. In this study, one liverwort and two moss species were studied: Lunularia cruciata (L.) Dumort, Brachytheciastrum velutinum (Hedw) Ignatov & Huttunen and Kindbergia praelonga (Hedw) Ochyra. The phenolic compositions of these bryophyte species have not hitherto been reported. Their methanolic extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, coupled to a diode-array detector (DAD). Luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside and quercetin were found in the L. cruciata extract. The extract obtained from B. velutinum contained four phenolic acids (4 -O-caffeoylquinic, 5 -O-caffeoylquinic, caffeic and <b>ellagic</b> <b>acids)</b> and three flavonoids (apigenin- 7 -O-glucoside, luteolin and apigenin).

40|$|Tannins are {{distributed}} in several plant species, organs and tissues, where {{they play a}} role in inhibiting microbial decay, thus enhancing material durability. In the hydrolysable tannins (HTs), a carbohydrate molecule (usually D-glucose) is partially or totally esterified with phenolic groups, such as gallic or <b>ellagic</b> <b>acids</b> (gallotannins, GTs; or ellagitannins, ETs). HTs are hydrolyzed by weak acids or bases, and are more easily oxidized than condensed tannins (CTs).

Chestnut whole water extract (13 % HTs) was investigated in agriculture as a natural soil acidifier, salinity control agent, phosphate solubilizer, iron complexing agent, and nemastat product.

The necessary extraction of ellagitannins from wine was simplified to a single step of solid phase extraction (SPE) using size exclusion chromatography with Sephadex LH- 20 without the need for any previous SPE of phenolic compounds using reversed-phase materials. The quantitative recovery of wine ellagitannins requires a combined elution with methanol and ethyl acetate, especially for increasing the recovery of the less polar acutissimins. The chromatographic method was performed using a fused-core C 18 column, thereby avoiding the coelution of main ellagitannins, such as vescalagin and roburin E.
