5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, the result is an acidic salt. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> result of a reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{reasoned}} that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> result of culpable or vincible ignorance {{of factors that}} one {{has a duty to}} have knowledge of. Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures. In his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.|$|E

25|$|More specifically, if this pronoun is {{the subject}} of the {{relative}} clause, it is always suppressed. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition et, used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew—unlike in English—a preposition cannot appear without its object.

25|$|A major {{difference}} between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Powerball.

25|$|The G2/M {{checkpoint}} {{is where}} the cell ensures that it has enough cytoplasm and phospholipids for two daughter cells.

There are some situations where many cells need to all replicate simultaneously (for example, a growing embryo should have a symmetric cell distribution until it reaches the mid-blastula transition).

25|$|Gauss Code {{is limited}} {{in its ability to}} {{identify}} knots by a few problems. The starting point on the knot at which to begin tracing the crossings is arbitrary, {{and there is no way}} to determine which direction to trace in. Also, Gauss Code is unable to indicate the handedness of each crossing, which is necessary to identify a knot versus its mirror. For example, the Gauss Code for the trefoil knot does not specify <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right-handed or left-handed trefoil.|$|E

25|$|Stress is {{generally}} predictable in Unami. The rightmost nonfinal strong vowel is stressed, or a strong vowel in final position <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{only one in}} the word. Often when stress would be expected to fall on the antepenult it is shifted to the penult. This change is found in three conjunct endings: /-ak/, /-at/, and /-an/. In the last case, the accent shifts to the penultimate /-an/ only if it would otherwise fall on an antepenultimate short vowel, and if the consonant between them is voiced.|$|E
25|$|Let V be a {{vector space}} over a field K. Then a basis {{with respect to}} which the matrix has the {{required}} form exists {{if and only if}} all eigenvalues of the matrix lie in K, or equivalently if the characteristic polynomial of the operator splits into linear factors over K. This condition is always satisfied if K is algebraically closed (for instance, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> field of complex numbers). The diagonal entries of the normal form are the eigenvalues (of the operator), and the number of times each eigenvalue occurs is called the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue.|$|E
25|$|When 1 ≤ p < ∞, {{the real}} Hardy spaces Hp {{discussed}} further {{down in this}} article are easy to describe in the present context.
