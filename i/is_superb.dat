Cycle finding then allows combining a set of relations sharing several primes into a single relation.|$|E
25|$|The jukung is of Balinese origin, {{one of many}} {{genre of}} Pacific/Asian {{outrigger}} canoes. The considerable stability provided by the outriggers means that the jukung copes well with a lateen (triangular) sail. While the lateen sail presents some difficulties in tacking into the wind, requiring a jibe, the jukung <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> in its reaching ability and jybe-safe running. They are usually highly decorated and bear a marlin-like prow.|$|E
25|$|Although AAV2 is {{the most}} popular {{serotype}} in various AAV-based research, {{it has been shown that}} other serotypes can be more effective as gene delivery vectors. For instance AAV6 appears much better in infecting airway epithelial cells, AAV7 presents very high transduction rate of murine skeletal muscle cells (similarly to AAV1 and AAV5), AAV8 <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> in transducing hepatocytes and AAV1 and 5 were shown to be very efficient in gene delivery to vascular endothelial cells. In the brain, most AAV serotypes show neuronal tropism, while AAV5 also transduces astrocytes. AAV6, a hybrid of AAV1 and AAV2, also shows lower immunogenicity than AAV2.|$|E

500|$|However, {{some critics}} found it inconsistent. Music {{journalist}} Peter Shapiro criticized its [...] "loose playing and bohemian self-indulgence", stating [...] "Voodoo drifted {{all over the}} map in a blunted haze". Rolling Stones James Hunter disapproved of the experimental and loose-sounding structure, and viewed that it does not attain its potential, stating [...] "long stretches of it are unfocused and unabsorbing [...] Voodoo flatters the real {{at the expense of the}} thing. The result <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> smoke, but smoke nonetheless". Jon Caramanica wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "D'Angelo achieves through nuance what some singers with decades of experience and training never achieve: a throbbing, vital presence, that demands attention, even as it shuns it".|$|E

[...] IGN ranked the episode as the best episode of Veronica Mars, writing [...] "Once you realize Aaron is the one, you're glued to your seat {{for the rest of}} the episode, {{possibly}} hiding behind a blanket.

500|$|The {{reviewer}} from The Times said [...] "All {{the devices}} are infinitely sophisticated, {{and so is}} the film: the tradition of self-mockery continues, though at times it over-reaches itself", also saying that [...] "It is the mixture as before, only more so: it <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> hokum." [...] Connery's acting efforts were overlooked by this reviewer, who did say: [...] "There is some excellent bit-part playing by Mr. Bernard Lee and Mr. Harold Sakata: Mr. Gert Fröbe is astonishingly well cast in the difficult part of Goldfinger." [...] Donald Zec, writing for the Daily Mirror said of the film that [...] "Ken Adam's set designs are brilliant; the direction of Guy Hamilton tautly exciting; Connery is better than ever, and the titles superimposed on the gleaming body of the girl in gold are inspired." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{found the}} on-disc soundtrack to be strong; Daemon Hatfield of IGN {{believed}} that [...] "the entire soundtrack <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> and could easily {{stand on its}} own outside the game". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer considered it {{to be one of the}} [...] "most adventurous" [...] soundtracks of any music game, and said though it often relied too much on pop hits, it remained true to the spirit of the DJ mix scene. Johnny Minkley thought the game to have [...] "vital, varied, surprising and vast musical content" [...] and to be a fresh experience compared to previous music games. The game did not sell well in the first month after its release; Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica attributed the low sales of the game partially to its soundtrack. While Kuchera felt the soundtrack was good, he asserted that individual songs were unrecognizable because of modifications made to them for the mixes, and that they were more difficult to adjust to within the gameplay itself.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{found the}} on-disc soundtrack to be {{generally}} strong; Hatfield believed that [...] "the entire soundtrack <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> and could easily {{stand on its}} own outside the game".

Minkley thought the game to have [...] "vital, varied, surprising and vast musical content" [...] and to be a fresh experience compared to previous music games. Other reviewers felt the soundtrack had some weak areas. Shae noted that many of the mixes felt like [...] "random mash-ups that take disparate songs", which would be appropriate for a live DJ, but does not reflect well on the art of mixing that can be performed today. Li noted a clear distinction in the quality of the mixes between the early setsthose mostly created in-house by FreeStyleGamesand the latter sets centered on the work of famous DJs. While Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica felt the soundtrack was good, he asserted that individual songs were unrecognizable because of modifications made to them for the mixes, and that they were more difficult to adjust to within the gameplay itself.|$|E

500|$|Blackout {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. On music review aggregator Metacritic the album holds {{a score of}} sixty-one out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on 24 critical reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of AllMusic, described the album as [...] "state-of-the-art dance-pop, a testament to skills of the producers and perhaps even Britney being somehow cognizant enough to realize she should hire the best, even if she's not at her best." [...] Dennis Lim of Blender deemed it as [...] "her most consistent , a seamlessly entertaining collection of bright, brash electropop." [...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly commented that while the album is not poetry, [...] "there is something delightfully escapist about Blackout, a perfectly serviceable dance album abundant {{in the kind of}} bouncy electro elements that buttressed her hottest hits." [...] A reviewer for NME said that the heavily treated vocals make Spears sound robotic, adding that [...] "it could really do with a few more human touches." [...] Pitchfork's Tom Ewing called [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] the centerpiece of the album, and added that [...] "like most of Blackout, <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> modern pop, which could probably only have been released by this star at this moment. Britney as walking catastrophe makes for great car-crash copy and her record can fit into that if you want it to." [...] Ewing also compared the relationship between Spears and Blackout with American television series Twin Peaks, saying that what made the show [...] "so great wasn't the central good-girl-gone-bad story, it was the strangeness that story liberated. And Britney's off-disc life is both distraction from and enabler for this extraordinary album". Mike Schiller of PopMatters said that [...] "Right down to its utterly garish cover, Blackout is utterly disposable and ultimately forgettable." [...] Melissa Maerz from Rolling Stone explained that Blackout [...] "is {{the first time in her}} career that she's voiced any real thoughts about her life" [...] and that [...] "she's gonna crank the best pop booty jams until a social worker cuts off her supply of hits." [...] Rob Sheffield of the same magazine described Blackout as [...] "one of the most influential albums in modern pop".|$|E
500|$|Carter's helmsmanship of [...] "Triangle" [...] {{received}} mostly favorable critical attention. Shearman and Pearson praised his directing, {{pointing to}} the scene where Scully dashes through the FBI building as [...] "the best scene of all". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, in an [...] "A" [...] grade review, appreciated the unique style of filming, and wrote that the long scenes give [...] "the whole thing {{a sense of urgency}} that propels scenes that shouldn't work". In addition, he called the split-screen shot [...] "darn near perfect"; VanDerWerff later labeled it [...] "one of my favorite moments in the whole show". Andrew Payne from Starpulse applauded the acting and directing, saying, [...] "Chris Carter rarely directed his creation, leaving that mostly to Kim Manners, but when he did he showed a brilliant eye not usually seen on broadcast TV. This is the best example—a breathlessly-paced episode in which each act appears as one continuous shot....This episode is a lot of fun, particularly in the act that finds Scully blitzing through the FBI building in order to get some information on Mulder's whereabouts. The acting <b>is</b> <b>superb</b> and nothing can beat those no-cut acts." [...] Payne ultimately named it the fourth best X-Files episode. David Boston from Made Man wrote that [...] "we know whenever [...] directs an episode it is always among the best." [...] Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! Voices praised the split-screen scene and the scene featuring Scully running through the FBI building, comparing it favorably to Orson Welles' 1958 film Touch of Evil. Jonathan Dunn, writing for What Culture, described [...] "Triangle" [...] as [...] "great" [...] and included it in the [...] "5 Episodes [...] That Could Be Made Into Movies" [...] list. In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Triangle" [...] was presented as the [...] "Best Chris Carter-Directed Episode". Not all reviews were as glowing; Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique wrote that [...] "everyone certainly deserves an A for effort", she was unimpressed by the [...] "vertiginous camerawork" [...] and [...] "endless, monotonous tracking shots up and down hallways". She ultimately awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics. Sounds praised the album on its release. Kevin Murphy wrote, [...] "Tinderbox romps and swoons {{with all the}} majesty of Dreamhouse", and added, [...] "it's a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette." [...] Jon Savage also hailed the record in Spin magazine: [...] "Its scope, ease, and assurance make it a good collection for the Banshees to relaunch themselves into the international market this spring. Carruthers fits in {{to the point that}} you wouldn't know there was a change, and Budgie's drumming <b>is</b> <b>superb.</b> Apart from the singles [...] "Cities in Dust" [...] and [...] "Candyman" [...] (which perpetuates the Banshees' sinister view of childhood), the sparks fly on the crystal clear [...] "Cannons" [...] and the unsettling [...] "Parties Fall".|$|E
2500|$|Non video-game {{publications}} {{gave some}} strong {{praise for the}} game. [...] The A.V.

[...] The Daily Telegraph gave it seven out of ten and stated, [...] "The combat, and it's worth noting that this makes {{up the majority of}} the game, <b>is</b> <b>superb.</b> It's not particularly deep nor clever, but it's immensely rewarding, as too are the scripted first person sections which exist purely to, yes, let you punch things in the face." [...] However, The Escapist gave the Xbox 360 version three stars out of five and said, [...] "Creative set-pieces and an awesome concept can only hide a repetitious game structure for so long - and the stealth sections that mix it up are just frustrating." ...|$|E
