The simulations were prepared in support of LBNL's project for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study frequency-response-related issues {{that must be addressed}} to operate the power system reliably with large amounts of variable renewable generation. The objective of the simulation studies of each interconnection was to assess the effects of different amounts of wind generation on frequency behavior of each interconnection following a sudden loss of generation. The scenarios created to study these effects considered an operating circumstance in which system load is at or close to its minimum. The event studied was the sudden loss of the largest amount of generation recorded within each interconnection. The simulations calculated the impact of this event on <b>interconnection</b> <b>frequency</b> for three levels of wind generation.

40|$|As {{the use of}} {{wind power}} {{turbines}} increases worldwide, there is a rising interest on their impacts on power system operation and control. Frequency regulation in interconnected networks {{is one of the}} main challenges posed by wind turbines in modern power systems. The wind power fluctuation negatively contributes to the power imbalance and frequency deviation. Significant <b>interconnection</b> <b>frequency</b> deviations can cause under/over frequency relaying and disconnect some loads and generations. Under unfavorable conditions, this may result in a cascading fail-ure and system collapse. This chapter presents an overview of the key issues on frequency regulation concerning the integration of wind power units into the power systems. Following a brief survey on the recent developments, the impact of power fluctuation pro-duced by wind units on system frequency performance is presented. An updated frequency response model is introduced, and the inertia contribution of wind tur-bine in the overall system inertia is properly considered. The need for the revising of frequency performance standards is emphasized, and an intelligent agent based load frequency control (LFC), using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is proposed. Finally, nonlinear time-domain simulations on a 39 -bus test power system are used to demonstrate the capability of the proposed control structure, and to analyze the system frequency performance in the presence of high wind power penetration and associated issues. ...|$|E

It is well known that for an undirected graph of <b>interconnections,</b> synchronization <b>frequency</b> is equal to the average of natural frequencies. However, in the case of directed graphs this is not true, moreover for fixed natural frequencies and given coupling structure, frequency of synchronization can also depend on the coupling strength.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a novel manufacturing technology for high-aspect-ratio vertical interconnects for high-frequency applications. This novel approach {{is based on}} magnetic self-assembly of prefabricated nickel wires that are subsequently insulated with a thermosetting polymer. The high-frequency performance of the through silicon vias (TSVs) is enhanced by depositing a gold layer on the outer surface of the nickel wires and by reducing capacitive parasitics through a low-k polymer liner. As compared with conventional TSV designs, this novel concept offers a more compact design and a simpler, potentially more cost-effective manufacturing process. Moreover, this fabrication concept is very versatile and adaptable to many different applications, such as interposer, micro electromechanical systems, or millimeter wave applications.

To solve this problem, we propose an approach based on the Winkel method without using simplified assumptions.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to assess the role of {{motivation}} in the effective cognitive activity of elderly hypertension (HTN) patients provided with antihypertensive treatment; 25 patients with HTN took part in the study, stage 1 - 2; their mean age was 67. 6 ± 6. 1. The psychological examination program embraced a quantitative measurement of intelligence quotient (IQ) with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and an investigation into the qualitative features of their cognitive processes, applying a pathopsychological study procedure (Zeigarnik, 1962, 1972) and the principles of psychological syndrome analysis (Vygotsky-Luria-Zeigarnik school). The results showed that within the psychological syndrome structure of cognitive disorders in HTN patients, the leading part is played by two syndrome-generating factors: a neurodynamic factor and a motivational factor. The patients with reduced motivation would achieve poor general test results, if compared with the group of highly motivated participants. A correlation analysis of the data revealed the <b>interconnection</b> between <b>frequency</b> disturbances in motivation and the frequency in occurrence of various signs of cognitive decline, such as low efficiency in memorization and delayed recall, as well as lower IQ test results.

Changing trends in system frequency behavior of a power system following the loss of the largest generator are studied in detail here, using simpliﬁed frequency control models and extensive simulations of wind penetration scenarios over an extended multiyear timeframe. The system frequency response is characterized by the rate of change of frequency and the frequency nadir.

40|$|In future {{power systems}} reduced overall inertia {{caused by an}} {{increased}} dominance of asynchronous generation and <b>interconnections</b> would make <b>frequency</b> control particularly challenging. As the number and power rating of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC systems increases, network service provision would be expected from such systems {{and to do so}} would require overload capacity {{to be included in the}} converter specifications. This paper studies the provision of frequency services from Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) -based VSC HVDC interconnections using temperature-constrained overload capability. Overload of the MMC-based HVDC system is achieved through controlled circulating currents, at the expense of higher losses, and subject to a control scheme which dynamically limits the overload available in order to keep the semiconductor junction temperatures within operational limits. Two frequency control schemes that use the obtained overload capacity to provide frequency response during emergency conditions are investigated. The controllers’ performance is demonstrated in the context of the future Great Britain transmission grid through a reduced equivalent test system. Simulation results show that even modest temperature margins which allow overload of MMC- based HVDC systems for a few seconds are effective as a primary frequency reserve and also reduce the loss of infeed requirements of such interconnections...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this PhD thesis is {{complexity}} reduction of linear time-invariant models. The complexity in such systems {{is measured by}} the number of differential equations forming the dynamical system. This number is called the order of the system. Order reduction is typically used as a tool to model complex systems, the simulation of which takes considerable time and/or has overwhelming memory requirements. Any model reflects an approximation of a real world system. Therefore, it is reasonable to sacrifice some model accuracy in order to obtain a simpler representation. Once a low-order model is obtained, the simulation becomes computationally cheaper, which saves time and resources. A low-order model still has to be "similar" to the full order one in some sense. There are many ways of measuring "similarity" and, typically, such a measure is chosen depending on the application. Three different settings of model order reduction were investigated in the thesis. The first one is H infinity model order reduction, i. e., the distance between two models {{is measured by the}} H infinity norm. Although, the problem has been tackled by many researchers, all the optimal solutions are yet to be found. However, there are a large number of methods, which solve suboptimal problems and deliver accurate approximations. Recently, research community has devoted more attention to large-scale systems and computationally scalable extensions of existing model reduction techniques. The algorithm developed in the thesis is based on the frequency response samples matching. For a large class of systems the computation of the frequency response samples can be done very efficiently. Therefore, the developed algorithm is relatively computationally cheap. The proposed algorithm {{can be seen as a}} computationally scalable extension to the well-known Hankel model reduction, which is known to deliver very accurate solutions. One of the reasons for such an assessment is that the relaxation employed in the proposed algorithm is tightly related to the one used in Hankel model reduction. Numerical simulations also show that the accuracy of the method is comparable to the Hankel model reduction one. The second part of the thesis is devoted to parameterized model order reduction. A parameterized model is essentially a family of models which depend on certain design parameters. The model reduction goal in this setting is to approximate the whole family of models for all values of parameters. The main motivation for such a model reduction setting is design of a model with an appropriate set of parameters. In order to make a good choice of parameters, the models need to be simulated for a large set of parameters. After inspecting the simulation results a model can be picked with suitable frequency or step responses. Parameterized model reduction significantly simplifies this procedure. The proposed algorithm for parameterized model reduction is a straightforward extension of the one described above. The proposed algorithm is applicable to linear parameter-varying systems modeling as well. Finally, the third topic is modeling interconnections of systems. In this thesis an interconnection is a collection of systems (or subsystems) connected in a typical block-diagram. In order to avoid confusion, throughout the thesis the entire model is called a supersystem, as opposed to subsystems, which a supersystem consists of. One of the specific cases of structured model reduction is controller reduction. In this problem there are two subsystems: the plant and the controller. Two directions of model reduction of interconnected systems are considered: model reduction in the nu-gap metric and structured model reduction. To some extent, using the nu-gap metric makes it possible to model subsystems without considering the supersystem at all. This property can be exploited for extremely large supersystems for which some forms of analysis (evaluating stability, computing step response, etc.) are intractable. However, a more systematic way of modeling is structured model reduction. There, the objective is to approximate certain subsystems in such a way that crucial characteristics of the given supersystem, such as stability, structure of <b>interconnections,</b> <b>frequency</b> response, are preserved. In structured model reduction all subsystems are taken into account, not only the approximated ones. In order to address structured model reduction, the supersystem is represented in a coprime factor form, where its structure also appears in coprime factors. Using this representation the problem is reduced to H infinity model reduction, which is addressed by the presented framework. All the presented methods are validated on academic or known benchmark problems. Since all the methods are based on semidefinite programming, adding new constraints is a matter of formulating a constraint as a semidefinite one. A number of extensions are presented, which illustrate the power of the approach. Properties of the methods are discussed throughout the thesis while some remaining problems conclude the manuscript...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is a new chip to {{substrate}} interconnection technique using self-aligning elastic chip sockets. This work {{was focused on the}} technology steps which are necessary to fulfill in order to realize the suggested technique. Elastic chip sockets offer a solution for several assembly and packaging challenges, such a thermo-mechanical mismatch, effortless rework, environmental compatibility, high <b>interconnection</b> density, high <b>frequency</b> signal integrity, etc. Two of the most challenging technology aspects, metallization and etching of the silicone elastomer were studied, but also, air bubble free casting of the silicone elastomer was taken into consideration. Elastic chip sockets and single elastic micro-bump contacts of different shapes and sizes were manufactured and characterized. The contact resistance measurements revealed that the elastic micro-bump contacts manufactured by using the developed methods require less than one tenth of the contact force to achieve the same low contact resistance as compared to commercial elastic interconnection structures. The analysis and measurements of the high frequency properties of the elastic micro-bump structures have shown that they can operate up to several tens of GHz without a serious degradation of the signal quality. The same methods were applied to manufacture very high density contact area array (approximately 80000 connections/cm 2), which until now was achieved only using so called chip-first techniques. The low contact resistance, the absence of environmentally harmful materials, no need of soldering, easy rework as well as capability of very high interconnecting density and very high frequency compatibility, indicates a high potential of this technique for assembly and packaging. Moreover, the presented technology of the silicone elastomer micromachining (metallization and RIE in particular) can be used for manufacturing of other microstructures, like chemical or biological micro reactors.
