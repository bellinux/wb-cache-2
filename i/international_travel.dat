This was coupled with the provision of an airport lounge and check-in facilities at first-floor level, with dedicated escalators down to the Gatwick Express platforms. British Airways and other major airlines had their own check-in desks there. British Rail operated an <b>International</b> <b>Travel</b> Centre within the main station, separate from the domestic travel centre. At the time, Victoria was still a major departure point for <b>international</b> <b>travel,</b> with boat trains to Dover and Folkestone for France and Belgium and beyond. This ceased {{with the introduction of}} Eurostar in 1994, which did not serve Victoria, and the <b>International</b> <b>Travel</b> Centre closed.|$|E

5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport.

This expansion allowed for the airport to add customs officials to accommodate both <b>international</b> <b>travel</b> and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not occur {{as a result of}} the economic downturn in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2007, the prospect of changing the airport's name was again mentioned as a possibility by the Airport Commission.|$|E
