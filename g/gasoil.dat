40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} improvements have been reached {{both in the}} technology of hydrocarbons pyrolysis for olefines production and in the modeling of the kinetic schemes involved. Some {{of the reasons for}} these improvements are: - New sophisticated instrumentation for continuous analysis of effluents from commercial units. - Economic interest for non-conventional feedstocks, e. g. vacuum <b>gasoils,</b> hydrotreated heavy <b>gasoils,</b> recycle fractions, reformed naphthas and/or other refinery streams. - Improvements in computer technology, hardware and software, which allow handling, in real time, complex systems of kinetic equations. - New strategies for on-line plant control and optimization. The rising needs of accuracy in predicting the reactor effluents under a wider range of feedstocks and different reactor coils demand models even more flexible and more detailed than the best ones actually available. In this paper the criteria for the developement of complex and non-regular kinetic schemes (up to thousands of reactions involved) are presented and discussed. The automatic generation of the elementary reaction stoichiometries and the non-Arrhenius behaviour of the kinetic constants are also considered. Some effort has also been devoted to the optimization and data reconciliation of the reactors effluents {{within the framework of the}} entire olefins plant...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{separated}} and purified of any contaminants and impurities, the fuel or lubricant {{can be sold}} without further processing. Smaller molecules such as isobutane and propylene or butylenes can be recombined to meet specific octane requirements by processes such as alkylation, or more commonly, dimerization. The octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by catalytic reforming, which involves removing hydrogen from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as aromatics. Intermediate products such as <b>gasoils</b> can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of cracking such as fluid catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, and hydrocracking. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, vapor pressures, and other properties to meet product specifications. Another method for reprocessing and upgrading these intermediate products (residual oils) uses a [...] process to separate usable oil from the waste asphaltene material.|$|R
