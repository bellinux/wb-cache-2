40|$|This paper gives {{a general}} method for {{deriving}} limiting distributions of complete case statistics for missing data models from corresponding {{results for the}} model where all data are observed. This provides a convenient tool for obtaining the asymptotic behavior of complete case versions of established full data methods without lengthy proofs. The methodology is illustrated by analyzing three inference procedures for partially linear regression models with responses missing at random. We first show that complete case versions of asymptotically efficient estimators of the slope parameter for the full model are efficient, thereby solving the problem of constructing efficient estimators of the slope parameter for this model. Second, we derive an asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> <b>test</b> for fitting a normal distribution to the errors. Finally, we obtain an asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> <b>test</b> for linearity, that is, for testing that the nonparametric component of these models is a constant.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{of the construction of}} the asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> goodness-of-fit <b>tests</b> for three models of stochastic processes are considered. The null hypothesis for all models is composite parametric. All tests are based on the score-function processes, where the unknown parameter is replaced by the MLE. We show that a special change of time transforms the limit score-function processes into the Brownian bridge.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} the construction of the asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> <b>test</b> by the observations of ergodic diffusion process. It is supposedd that under the basic hypothesis the trend coefficient depends on the finite dimensional parameter and we study the Cramer-von Mises type statistics. The underlying statistics depends on the deviation of the local time estimator from the invariant density with parameter replaced by the maximum likelihood estimator. We propose a linear transformation which yields the convergence of the test statistics to the integral of Wiener process. Therefore the test based on this statistics is asymptotically distribution free. Comment: 27 page...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRegression {{models are}} {{commonly}} used to model the relationship between responses and covariates. For testing the error distribution, some classical test statistics such as Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and Cramér–von-Mises test suffer from the complicated limiting distribution due to the plug-in estimate for the unknown parameters. Hence some ad hoc procedure such as bootstrap method is needed to obtain critical points. Recently, Khmaladze and Koul (2004) [7] have proposed an asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> <b>test</b> via some Martingale transforms. However, the calculation of such a test becomes quite involved, which usually requires numeric integration when the Cramér–von-Mises type of test is employed.

40|$|In {{statistical}} analysis, distribution {{assumptions are}} often subject to be tested. In this dissertation, {{the problem of}} testing two important distribution assumptions, the normal distribution and uniform distribution, is considered.

Moreover, this dissertation also presents an asymptotic <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> <b>test</b> of multivariate uniformity based on $m$-nearest neighbors. Both tests have demonstrated good power performance by numerical studies. Incomplete data is another commonly encountered issue in practice. This dissertation also reports an efficient estimation method for population mean in longitudinal surveys under monotone missing pattern.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two new tests for the {{parametric}} {{form of the}} variance function in diffusion processes dX_t = b(t,X_t) +ω(t,X_t) dW_t. Our approach is based on two stochastic processes of the integrated volatility. We prove weak convergence of these processes to centered processes whose conditional distributions given the process (X_t) _t∈[0, 1] are Gaussian. In the special case of testing for a constant volatility the limiting process is the standard Brownian bridge in both cases. As a consequence an asymptotic <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> <b>test</b> (for the problem of testing for homoscedasticity) and bootstrap tests (for the problem of testing for a general parametric form) can easily be implemented.

40|$|The {{class of}} {{nonlinear}} time series models known as autoregressive conditional duration [ACD] models plays {{a central role}} for modeling durations, also known as waiting-times. These waiting-times/durations are positive random variables which are defined in relation to an irregularly observed time series of events occurring at random points in time. For example, the waiting time for {{the change in the}} share-price of an asset to exceed a certain threshold, or the duration between consecutive financial transactions such as share trading. This thesis focusses on the ACD family of models for such durations or waiting times. The ACD model describes a duration process {Zi } by Zi = Ψiεi, where Ψi is the expected duration conditional on the past information, and εi is an independent and identically distributed [iid] positive error term with E(εi) = 1. An ACD model is characterized by two specifications: (i) the specification of the conditional mean functionΨi, and (ii) the specification of the distribution of the error term εi. A number of parametric models have been proposed for (i) and (ii). A large proportion of these models have complicated probabilistic structures. As a consequence, assessing the goodness-of-fit of such models is a non-trivial task. However, the methodology for inference in ACD models is still {{in the early stages of}} development, and hence the literature on testing for the goodness or lack of fit of such parametric models is relatively scant. Thus, there is a need for developing new methodologies for testing parametric specifications for the ACD class of models. This thesis contributes to this broad area of statistical inference. Our results and methodology are presented in detail in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this thesis. The main objectives and contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows. (a) Martingale transformation techniques have been successfully adapted in the literature to develop asymptotically distribution free specification tests for regression and autoregressive models. We extend this transformation technique to multiplicative models in Chapter 3, in order to develop an asymptotically <b>distribution</b> <b>free</b> <b>test</b> for the specification of the conditional mean of an ACD model. (b) In Chapter 4 we introduce a new parametric form which nests all linear specifications of the conditional mean function of an ACD model, and develop a class of tests for checking its goodness-of-fit. In the process of deriving the asymptotic distributions of the proposed test statistics, we show that a quasi maximum likelihood estimator [QMLE] is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal for the proposed family of models. Further, a residual-based bootstrap procedure is proposed for computing the critical values of the test statistics, and its asymptotic validity is established. (c) Finally, in Chapter 5 a new class of tests is developed for fitting a parametric form for the error distribution of an ACD model. The critical values of the test statistics are obtained via a parametric bootstrap algorithm and its asymptotic validity is established. The tests proposed in this thesis were evaluated via simulation studies, comparing them with some of the best available tests from the existing literature. In these simulations, the tests proposed in this thesis exhibited a good overall performance. In each chapter, the proposed testing procedures are illustrated using empirical examples...|$|E

The errors may be heteroscedastic and the concrete form of the error distribution {{does not need to be}} known. Moreover, the asymptotic distribution for multiple regression with intercept does not depend on the location and scale of the explanatory variables. A simulation study suggests that the tests can be applied also to normal distributed explanatory variables. An application on multiple regression for shape analysis of fishes demonstrates the applicability of the new tests and in particular their outlier robustness.
