40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} the commonly used autoregressive filter method of adjusting appraisal-based real estate returns to correct for the perceived biases induced in the appraisal process. Many articles {{have been written}} on appraisal smoothing but remarkably few have considered the relationship between smoothing at the <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> level {{and the amount of}} persistence in the aggregate appraisal-based index. To investigate this issue we analyze a large sample of appraisal data at the <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> level from the Investment Property Databank. We find that commonly used unsmoothing estimates at the index level overstate the extent of smoothing that takes place at the <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> level. There is also strong support for an ARFIMA representation of appraisal returns at the index level and an ARMA model at the <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> level. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the commonly used autoregressive filter method of adjusting appraisal-based real estate returns to correct for the perceived biases induced in the appraisal process.

To investigate this issue in more detail we analyse a sample of <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> level appraisal data from the Investment Property Database (IPD).

5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> {{ownership}} and land tenure {{that can be}} traded was often introduced as part of colonialism.

40|$|One of the {{concerns}} in environmental and ecological economics is the overexploitation of natural resources, often leading to pollution.

These proponents also do not see (or downplay) the usually significant transaction costs, instead presuming that bargaining and other interactions between <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> owners is essentially costless and efficiency is easily achieved. In such a case, the role of government would be limited to: 1) providing a way to allocate the initial property rights, and 2) supporting the legal system to enforce the property rights...|$|R

5000|$|In {{community}} property {{states of the}} United States, [...] "commingling" [...] non-marital property with marital property can make it {{community property}}. For example, depositing money received by an individual through inheritance - ordinarily considered non-marital, <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> - into a joint bank account may transform the money into community property. Most community property states apply a presumption of community property; where there is any commingling {{the burden of proof}} is on the party disputing the classification to [...] "trace" [...] the <b>property</b> back to <b>individual</b> <b>property,</b> and demonstrate an intent to keep it separated.|$|R
