5|$|The corticioid {{species of}} Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma develop crust-like fruitbodies with a smooth, porous, or <b>flaky</b> surface and grow on tree logs or dead branches.|$|E
5|$|The firm {{bark and}} {{lanceolate}} leaves of P.lanceolata {{distinguish it from}} P.levis, with which it can be confused; the latter species has <b>flaky</b> bark and asymmetrical leaves.|$|E
5|$|Her next {{role was}} the <b>flaky</b> New Age mother Wendy Whitman in the {{independent}} comedy-drama Goats, which opened at the 2012 Sundance. That same year, she portrayed CIA operative Catherine Linklater in Daniel Espinosa's action thriller Safe House (2012). Farmiga starred opposite Ryan Reynolds and, for the second time, Denzel Washington.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, UK prog-rock band Twelfth Night {{included}} an impromptu song {{as part of}} an encore, to the tune of the flake jingle, [...] "Only the crumbliest, <b>flakiest</b> skin, remains on your body after nuclear war...".|$|R
50|$|The French and Italians {{specialized}} in redefining the pastry of the pie, making it <b>flakier</b> and tastier by {{new methods of}} adding butter, rolling, and folding the dough. In 1440, the Paris pastry guild was recognized and started to expand their product—and so something like the modern day crust began to be used.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large fat crystals found in lard, it is extremely effective as a shortening in baking. Pie crusts made with lard tend to be <b>flakier</b> than those made with butter. Many cooks employ both types of fat in their pastries to combine the shortening properties of lard with the flavor of butter.|$|R
5|$|Ottoman cuisine {{has given}} rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey, parts of the Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A {{distinctive}} element is the family of small <b>flaky</b> pastries called börek. These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. Börek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.|$|E
5|$|Bourekas are savory {{pastries}} {{brought to}} Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They {{are made of}} a <b>flaky</b> dough {{in a variety of}} shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, spinach, potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by home cooks. They are often served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with <b>flaky</b> particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E
50|$|The Flake Girl {{became famous}} {{as a symbol}} of indulgence and secret pleasure. Her {{emphasis}} - to a raspingly emotional jingle ("Only the crumbliest, <b>flakiest</b> chocolate, tastes like chocolate never tasted before"), voted third most memorable of all time, - was on allowing herself a guilt-free luxury. However, many saw in the delicacy with which she nibbled the crumbly chocolate bar, more than a hint of sexual pleasure. In the 1970s, an advert was taken off air following complaints about the suggestive manner in which the woman bit into the bar.|$|R
5000|$|Broadly, {{two schools}} of cooking the kabayaki exist. In the Kantō region (eastern Japan), the eel is slit down its back and butterflied, so a lighter-colored stripe of the belly {{runs down the}} middle of each fillet on the skin side. The long eel is cut into shorter, squarer fillets and {{skewered}}. In Kanto, the skewered eel is first broiled, plain, into what is known as [...] (白焼き or 素焼き), then steamed, before being flavored and grilled again; as a result, it turns out more tender and <b>flakier</b> after grilling.|$|R
50|$|Also {{common is}} the {{practice}} of dotting the bread. This creates multiple wells in the bread by using a finger or the handle of a utensil to poke the unbaked dough. As a way to preserve moisture in the bread, olive oil is then spread over the dough, by hand or with a pastry brush prior to rising and baking. In {{the northern part of}} Italy, lard will sometimes be added to the dough, giving the focaccia a softer, slightly <b>flakier</b> texture. Focaccia recipes are widely available, and with the popularity of bread machines, many cookbooks now provide versions of dough recipes that do not require hand kneading.|$|R
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The <b>flaky</b> soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E

25|$|Their {{wholesome}} {{flesh is}} whitish and <b>flaky</b> but firmer and tougher and less desirable {{than that of}} the Atlantic cod. The stock of Greenland cod has been strongly reduced in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|After the consolidation, the {{president}} of Nabisco, Adolphus Green, asked Frank Peters to create a package to distribute fresher products. This paved its way for In-Er Seal package, whose logo is a prototype for the [...] "Nabisco Thing", an animated character created in 1995 to sell its products to kids. The In-Er Seal package is a system of inter-folded wax paper and cardboard to [...] "seal in the freshness" [...] of the product. At {{the beginning of his}} presidency, Green decided the National Biscuit Company, often shortened to NBC, needed a new idea that grabbed the public's attention. He got it when his employees created a new cracker that was <b>flakier</b> and lighter than any of their competitors' versions.|$|R
5000|$|The monadnocks {{were formed}} when erosion {{resistant}} rock is exposed after softer rock is eroded over time. The individual {{characteristics of the}} monadnock {{are determined by the}} individual processes that formed the granite. For example, Arabia Mountain features a unique [...] "swirl" [...] pattern due to the heat and pressure that caused Arabia Mountain to have a taffy-like consistency when it was cooling over 400 million years ago. Bands of different minerals folded and twisted, creating the [...] "tidal swirl" [...] pattern seen today [...] By contrast, Panola Mountain has a <b>flakier</b> rock with less compressive strength due to differences in cooling rates. Panola Mountain also has a darker colored rock and different mineral grains. Differences in mineral composition between Panola and Stone Mountains indicated different magma sources at the time of formation.|$|R
5000|$|In Battle Creek {{they found}} fresh air, exercise, rest, [...] "hydrotherapy", a strict {{vegetarian}} diet, and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. To supplement the center's vegetarian regimen, Kellogg experimented with granola. Soon afterwards {{he began to}} experiment with wheat, resulting in a lighter, <b>flakier</b> product. In 1891 he acquired a patent and then in 1895 he launched the Cornflakes brand, which overnight captured a national market. Soon there were forty rival manufacturers in the Battle Creek area. His brother William K. Kellogg (1860-1951) worked for him for many years until, in 1906, he broke away, bought the rights to Cornflakes, {{and set up the}} Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company. William Kellogg discarded the health food concept, opting for heavy advertising and commercial taste appeal. Later, his signature on every package became the company trademark.|$|R
25|$|Cod {{is popular}} {{as a food}} with a mild flavor and a dense, <b>flaky</b> white flesh. Cod livers are {{processed}} to make cod liver oil, {{an important source of}} vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA).|$|E
25|$|Fish McBites – {{similar to}} the Chicken McBites, these are small pieces of <b>flaky</b> {{whitefish}} dipped in batter and fried until golden brown, and served with tartar sauce for dipping. They were taken off the menu {{at the end of}} March 2013.|$|E
25|$|The bark {{of mature}} white spruce is scaly or <b>flaky,</b> grey-brown (Brayshaw 1960) or ash-brown (Harlow and Harrar 1950), but silvery when freshly exposed. Resin {{blisters}} are normally lacking, but the Porsild spruce Picea glauca var. porsildii Raup has {{been credited with}} having smooth resin-blistered bark (Hosie 1969).|$|E
40|$|Cookies {{quality is}} {{influenced}} by material and processing. Wheat flour as major component of cookies production has a role on volume expansion of cookies. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of wheat flour substitution with waxy starch or modified waxy starch by HMT treatment and baking temperature effect on physical properties of cookies. Cookies was made by ratio of wheat flour and waxy starch or HMT waxy starch 50 : 50, this research was carried out including the analysis of texture, volume expansion, and color. Substituted HMT waxy starch cookies resulted on the <b>flakier</b> texture. The highest volume expansion was revealed by substituted waxy cookies with baking temperature 140 oC and substituted HMT waxy starch cookies with baking temperature 130 oC. Higher baking temperature and substitution cookies with HMT waxy starch were revealed on the higher intensity of the darkness of cookies color...|$|R
50|$|In eczema it is {{generally}} best to match thicker ointments to the driest, <b>flakiest</b> skin. Light emollients such as aqueous cream may not {{have any effect on}} severely dry skin. Some common emollients for the relief of eczema include Oilatum, Balneum, Medi Oil, Diprobase, bath oils and aqueous cream. Sebexol, Epaderm ointment, Exederm and Eucerin lotion or cream may also be helpful with itching. Lotions or creams may be applied directly to the skin after bathing to lock in moisture. Moisturizing gloves (gloves which keep emollients in contact with skin on the hands) can be worn while sleeping. Generally, twice-daily applications of emollients work best. While creams are easy to apply, they are quickly absorbed into the skin, and therefore need frequent reapplication. Ointments, with less water content, stay on the skin for longer and need fewer applications, but they can be greasy and inconvenient.|$|R
5000|$|The San Francisco Chronicle {{said that}} [...] "Kingsolver is admirably humane and intellectually consistent. Her economy of {{language}} is a genuine asset in the often overwrought genre of expository writing. But the book, which tackles such weighty issues as the Kyoto environmental agreements and social injustice, is too self-referential to be effectively persuasive." [...] Natasha Walter in The Guardian wrote that [...] "although I was rooting for these essays from the first page, over and over again, just as Kingsolver was heating up the rhetoric, I would find myself turning cold". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly argued that [...] "A reader in the wrong mood might impatiently brush {{away some of the}} <b>flakier</b> granola crumbs that come with the territory it glows with Kingsolvers honest literary language of enchantment, and with an eye for details of the living planet that Gerard Manley Hopkins might admire." [...] The New York Times Laura Ciolkowski concluded that [...] "Small Wonder has a lot to say, but its heavy-handed wisdom is unfulfilling." ...|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1992, {{military}} crews {{uncovered the}} well-preserved wreckage of a JB-2 {{at a site}} on an Air Force-owned section of Santa Rosa Island. Most crash sites on the barrier island {{were little more than}} <b>flaky</b> rust, but after the find, officials were planning further searches.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews {{negatively}} {{compared the}} film to the Shrek series. Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail considered {{the film to}} be [...] "a sort of discount Shrek", while Burr called it [...] "Shrek with added drek." [...] Westbrook wrote that [...] "Echoing such a popular predecessor as Shrek {{is not a good}} thing– especially when the echo is so faint." [...] Berardinelli felt that the fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in the first Shrek film, while Bernard felt that Hoodwinked! took fairy tale revisionism too far. He felt that the humor in Shrek worked due to the fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout the film, and wrote, [...] "It's pointless to scold them for behaving the way fairy tales intended, and that's far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic, considered Red's kung fu abilities to be overly similar to Princess Fiona's [...] "Matrix agility." [...] Gleiberman also noted the similarities between the film and Shrek, but he was positive in the comparison, feeling that its independent production gave the filmmakers [...] "the freedom to follow their <b>flakiest</b> corkscrew whims." [...] While Wilmington did not find Hoodwinked! as impressive or beguiling as Shrek, he wrote that [...] "when it's cooking, it does make you laugh." ...|$|R
40|$|Concrete in Sweden has {{traditionally}} been manufactured with natural aggregate from glaciofluvial eskers. There {{is a need to}} preserve the remaining eskers because of their cultural value and importance for water filtration, thus natural aggregate has to be replaced. The most realistic alternative is to use crushed rocks. The major problem with crushed rocks in concrete production is the workability. This is because crushed rocks have less favorable properties. The fragments are <b>flakier</b> and have a rougher surface than natural aggregates that have been rounded in water. Without any amelioration of the crushed rock, to reach a certain workability and strength, the amount of cement in the mix has to be increased. Cement production requires large amounts of energy and the decarbonation of limestone releases large amounts of CO 2. Combined, the release of CO 2, due to burning and decarbonation of limestone, accounts for about 5 % of the global CO 2 emissions. An increase in cement consumptions is less desirable. Thus to replace natural aggregates, the use of crushed rocks has to be optimized as regard cement consumption. Several crushed aggregates, most from granitic rocks, from all over Sweden were analysed in this study. These crushed rocks were characterized according to their grading, specific surface, shape and petrography and compared to natural sand. Rheological tests that reveals the workability in detail was performed on mortars. The tests showed that as regard workability the 0 - 2 mm fraction is the most important factor. Further, the maximum aggregate size was gradually increased up to 16 mm, to have a more realistic approach to the concrete produced by the building industry. The results showed that with grading optimization and superplasticizer, some crushed rocks can be used for concrete production without increasing, and even decreasing, the cement consumption. This research also contemplated the use of filler. As a mineral admixture it can improve the compressive strength. It {{can also be used to}} replace cement; a replacement up to 20 kg/m 3 of cement by filler can be done without significant effect on compressive strength...|$|R
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around A.D.800). Cod are popular as a food fish with a mild flavour, low fat content and a dense white flesh. When cooked, cod is moist and <b>flaky.</b> Cod livers are processed to make cod liver oil. Cod are currently at risk from overfishing.|$|E
25|$|Rajasthani cuisines have a {{whole lot}} of varieties, varying {{regionally}} between the arid desert districts and the greener eastern areas. Most famous dish is Dal-Baati-Churma.

25|$|Anhydrous chromium(III) {{chloride}} adopts the YCl3 structure, with Cr3+ occupying {{two thirds}} of the octahedral interstices in alternating layers of a pseudo-cubic close packed lattice of Cl− ions. The absence of cations in alternate layers leads to weak bonding between adjacent layers. For this reason, crystals of CrCl3 cleave easily along the planes between layers, which results in the <b>flaky</b> (micaceous) appearance of samples of chromium(III) chloride.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{has also}} been a long-standing {{priority}} among classified employees, but it had never been the large-scale concern that it became during the 1980s asbestos scare. Asbestos, a <b>flaky</b> white mineral, had been widely used in school construction between 1945 and 1973 on ceilings and as an insulator for pipes and boilers. Then in 1982, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered schools to be inspected for this cancer-causing substance.|$|E
25|$|Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea {{exhibits}} permanent redness (erythema) with {{a tendency}} to flush and blush easily. It is also common to have small, widened blood vessels visible near {{the surface of the}} skin (telangiectasias) and possibly intense burning, stinging, or itching.

25|$|The {{summit is}} broad and too flat to allow good all round views. These are further {{restricted}} by the higher fells to the west, {{but there is}} a fine prospect to the Pennines and Howgill Fells. Walls and fences follow the ridges from Gatesgarth, Tarn Crag and Selside Pike, meeting near the summit. A small cairn is situated a little to the north. A better view of Mardale, and certainly a better foreground, can be seen from Artlecrag Pike. This subsidiary top a little to the north has two fine columnar cairns built from the nearby outcrop of <b>flaky</b> rocks.|$|E
