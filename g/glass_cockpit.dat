5|$|Its design also {{included}} a full <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320's flight deck is equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Su-37: Technology demonstrator, {{converted}} from the eleventh developmental Su-27M (T10M-11). The Su-37 featured a digital fly-by-wire flight-control system, a <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit,</b> the N011M radar, and AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. The aircraft was later fitted with standard-production AL-31F engines, and had its flight-control system and cockpit systems revised.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{development}} of the longer range 747-400 began. The variant had a new <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit,</b> which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three, new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. Development cost soared, and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated {{at the request of}} airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400. The -400 entered service in 1989.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>cockpits</b> {{started to}} come into being with the Gulfstream Gâ€‘IV private jet in 1985. One of the key {{challenges}} in <b>glass</b> <b>cockpits</b> is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.|$|R

5|$|Boeing {{introduced}} {{a number of}} advanced technologies with the 777 design, including fully digital fly-by-wire controls, fully software-configurable avionics, Honeywell LCD <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> flight displays, and the first use of a fiber optic avionics network on a commercial airliner. Boeing made use of work done on the cancelled Boeing 7J7 regional jet, which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies. In 2003, Boeing began offering the option of cockpit electronic flight bag computer displays. In 2013, Boeing announced that the upgraded 777X models would incorporate airframe, systems, and interior technologies from the 787.|$|E
5|$|The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was {{a planned}} {{maritime}} patrol and attack aircraft intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2. The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan jet engines to almost double the flight range. The conversion of the flight deck to a digital <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional weapons for anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 has a <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> with all-digital flight instruments. The {{monochrome}} {{head-up display}} offers a wide {{field of view}} {{and serves as a}} primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140inches long, 45inches wide, and 27inches tall (355cm x 115cm x 69cm) and weighs 360 pounds.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued {{to serve with}} passenger airlines for over 30 years after the crash of Flight 191. In the end, it was newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E

Later <b>glass</b> <b>cockpits,</b> {{found in the}} Boeing 737NG, 747-400, 767-400, 777, A320 and later Airbuses, Ilyushin Il-96 and Tupolev Tu-204 have completely replaced the mechanical gauges and warning lights in previous generations of aircraft, although they still retain some analog instruments as backups in case the EFIS displays malfunction.|$|R
5|$|The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit,</b> turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating {{that allows them to}} operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, {{wide-body}} twin-engine jet airliner {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As selected, the Nimrod MRA4 {{was to be}} {{produced}} as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes {{were involved in the}} remanufacturing process, including the installation of current-generation BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger and more efficient wing, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order to provide the necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is significantly greater than that of the original Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit</b> used was derived from the Airbus A340 airliner. British Aerospace also teamed up with Boeing to provide the Nimrod MRA4's mission systems, making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>cockpits</b> {{originated}} in military {{aircraft in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the Mark II avionics of the F-111D (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970-73), which featured a multi-function display.|$|R
50|$|Many modern general {{aviation}} aircraft {{are available with}} <b>glass</b> <b>cockpits.</b> Systems such as the Garmin G1000 are now available on many new GA aircraft, including the classic Cessna 172.

5|$|The {{first two}} Air Medals {{presented}} {{by the president of}} the United States to the Civil Air Patrol went to Hugh Sharp and Eddie Edwards, who conducted the rescue in the S-39. This successful program, which spotted 173 German U-Boats, dropped 57 depth charges, hit 10 of the U-Boats, and sank two of them, was inevitably discontinued after the end of the second World War. Many of the planes used specifically for this program are now parts of exhibits, replaced by new aircraft that are more suited to teaching young students to fly and performing search and rescue, the current missions of the Civil Air Patrol. Currently, CTWG has two Cessna 172s, two Cessna 182s and one Cessna 182T with Garmin G1000 <b>Glass</b> <b>cockpit.</b> Connecticut Wing has the highest number of hours flown per aircraft of any state in the North East Region, and ranks high on a national scale.|$|E
5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital <b>glass</b> <b>cockpit.</b> Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E

50|$|The E-4B is {{designed}} to survive an EMP with systems intact and has state-of-the-art direct fire countermeasures. Although many older aircraft have been upgraded with <b>glass</b> <b>cockpits,</b> the E-4B still uses traditional analog flight instruments, as they are less susceptible to damage from an EMP blast.|$|R
50|$|During this period, civil {{aviation}} continued to expand. Airliners and engines grew {{larger and more}} fuel-efficient, while digital systems progressively took over the flight control and other avionics. Modern jet airliners have <b>glass</b> <b>cockpits,</b> full-authority digital engine and fly-by-wire computerised flight controls and, most recently, Mobile Internet communications connectivity.|$|R
50|$|As {{aircraft}} displays have modernized, {{the sensors}} that feed them have modernized as well.
