500|$|The Graves {{children}} lived varied lives. Mary Graves married early, but {{her first}} husband was murdered. She cooked his killer's food {{while he was in}} prison to ensure that the condemned man did not starve before his hanging. One of Mary's grandchildren noted that she was very serious; Graves once said, [...] "I wish I could cry but I cannot. If I could forget the tragedy, perhaps <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> how to cry again." [...] Mary's brother William did not settle down for any significant time.|$|E

500|$|On 6 October 1955, Diệm {{announced}} the referendum {{would be held}} on 23 October. The election was open {{to men and women}} aged 18 or over, and the government arranged to have a polling station set up for every 1,000 registered voters. The poll was contested by Bảo Đại, who had spent much of his time in France and advocated a monarchy, and Diệm, who ran on a republican platform. According to historian Jessica Chapman, it was a choice between [...] "the country's obsolete emperor and its far-from-popular prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem". In announcing the referendum, Diệm portrayed his decision as being motivated by a love of democracy and popular discontent with the rule of Bảo Đại. The prime minister cited a plethora of petitions from various social, religious, and political groups calling on him to stage a plebiscite to remove Bảo Đại, claiming he was motivated by these [...] "legitimate and democratic" [...] sentiments. Lansdale cautioned Diệm against electoral fraud, confident that Diệm would win a free election: [...] "While I'm away I don't want to suddenly read that you have won by 99.99%. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> that it's rigged then." [...] U.S. officials thought that a fair election would have seen Diệm poll between 60% and 70% of the vote.|$|E
2500|$|In {{practice}} {{these arguments}} are often fallacious {{and rely on}} the veracity of the supporting premise. For example, the argument that If I had just sat on a wild porcupine then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> it; in fact I do not know it; therefore I did not just sit on a wild porcupine is probably not a fallacy and depends entirely on the veracity of the leading proposition that supports it.

2500|$|At {{his trial}} {{in front of}} The High Court of Justice on Saturday 20 January 1649 in Westminster Hall, Charles asked [...] "I would know by what power I am called hither. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> by what authority, I mean lawful". In view of the {{historic}} issues involved, both sides based themselves on surprisingly technical legal grounds. [...] Charles did not dispute that Parliament as a whole did have some judicial powers, but he maintained that the House of Commons on its own could not try anybody, and so he refused to plead. [...] At that time under English law if a prisoner refused to plead then this {{was treated as a}} plea of guilty (This has since been changed; a refusal to plead now is interpreted as a not-guilty plea).|$|E

"It {{must then}} {{be some of}} these flaunting {{silkworm}} sirs about the court," [...] said the armourer, his natural heat of temper kindling from disappointment and vexation--"some of those who think they carry it off through the height of their plumed bonnets and the jingle of their spurs. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> which it was that, leaving his natural mates, the painted and perfumed dames of the court, comes to take his prey among the simple maidens of the burgher craft. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> but his name and surname!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
