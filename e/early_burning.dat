5000|$|It {{is usually}} the {{perception}} {{that there is no}} [...] "coherent" [...] politics or philosophical stance represented by the teknival subculture, mainly {{due to the fact that}} emphasis is placed on individual freedom. Many young teknival goers are disillusioned with mainstream politics. Nevertheless, the parties themselves require complex collective organisation and, in order to be successful, a sustainable environment of community relations. In themselves such events can be seen as a political statement of self-organisation at a distance from the State. Clashes with the police have mobilised some people to action against laws which would prohibit self-organisation and gathering to enjoy teknivals. These clashes date back to the '80s (when teknivals were arguably indistinguishable from UK Orbital raves, summer acid house parties, UK traveller gatherings, Stonehenge pagan events, <b>early</b> <b>Burning</b> Man and tribal gatherings, trance parties in Goa, India and the like) and have continued to be part of teknival life. In April 2006 there was a march followed by a small teknival in Strasbourg, France to protest against police repression generally and more specifically against the closure of Czechtek in 2005. During the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act in the UK, various large-scale protests took place during daylight and in public. The Reclaim the Streets and Anti-Capitalist Carnivals of the '90s that led up to and beyond the Seattle WTO protests (and subsequent [...] "anti-globalization" [...] events) drew from teknival and rave organisation and culture, often involving many of the same organisers and cross-section of the population.|$|E
30|$|The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) {{has passed}} a series of {{regulations}} {{in an attempt to}} prevent veld fires. For example, Statutory Instrument 7 of 2007, which governs veld fire management in the country compels users, owners and occupiers of given pieces of land to have pre-suppression measures to curb veld fires. Pre-suppression/prevention measures are a series of steps that are put in place {{before the start of the}} fire season in order to avoid and curb veld fires. A good fire preventive strategy should aim at minimizing the adverse effects of fire, and promote sustainability of livelihoods, human health and security. These are the social aspects affected by wild fires (van Lierop 2011). <b>Early</b> <b>burning</b> is one such technique which has been used (WWF 2001; Mudekwe 2007). The objective of <b>early</b> <b>burning</b> is to reduce fuel loads and therefore minimize the occurrence of devastating late dry season fires. <b>Early</b> <b>burning</b> creates a patchwork effect of burnt, partially burnt and unburnt areas which leaves substantial amounts of grass and browsing material intact to support wildlife and animal populations during the late dry season. The late hot season fires are checked by the patchwork effect (“firebreaks”) created by <b>early</b> <b>burning</b> (WWF 2001). However, <b>early</b> <b>burning</b> is considered essential to complement the fireguard system. In addition, controlled grazing to reduce fuel load is the most promising and effective way to prevent veld fires and this is still practiced by communities adjacent to forested areas and those possessing commercial grazing leases.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{occurrence}} of wild fires in Sengwa Wildlife Research Area (SWRA), Zimbabwe, is presented for the period 1965 - 1993. The effectiveness and desirability of <b>early</b> <b>burning</b> of peripheral areas introduced in 1979 are evaluated. More than 75 % of wild fires occurred between July and October, 48. 6 % of which originated from communal lands. <b>Early</b> <b>burning</b> of peripheral areas led to significant reductions in extent of areas burnt, from annual mean areas of 115 km 2 (1965 - 1978) to 11 km 2 (1979 - 1993) because of effective control of fires, which originated from communal lands. Some areas did not burn at all after 1979, and the overall probability of burning dropped from 0. 484 to 0. 187. Whilst it may be desirable to keep fires out of SWRA in the short term, fuel build-ups increase the fire hazard resulting in negative consequences on biodiversity in the long term. Consideration {{should be given to}} combine peripheral burning with low-intensity prescribed burning of selected blocks to keep a semblance of natural fire regimes to ensure the maintenance of biodiversity while simultaneously reducing the fire-hazard.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of three experimental fire regimes on the fecundity, ovule development and seedfall of two common wet-dry tropical savanna eucalypts, Eucalyptus miniata and Eucalyptus tetrodonta, in northern Australia. Both species flower early in the dry season and ovule development occurs during the dry season. This coincides with a period of frequent fires. The three fire regimes considered were applied for four years between 1990 and 1994. These regimes were (i) Unburnt, (ii) Early, fires lit early in the dry season, and (iii) Late, fires lit late in the dry season. The treatments were applied to nine catchments (15 - 20 km 2) with each fire regime replicated three times. Fire intensity typically increases as the dry season proceeds. Therefore, early dry season fires generally differ from late dry season fires in both their intensity and their timing {{in relation to the}} reproductive phenology of the eucalypts. Late dry season burning significantly reduced the fecundity of both species, whereas <b>Early</b> <b>burning</b> had no significant effect. Ovule success was significantly reduced by the <b>Early</b> <b>burning</b> for both species. The Late burning significantly reduced ovule success in E. tetrodonta, but not in E. miniata. The results suggest that fire intensity and fire timing may both be important determinants of seed supply. Fire intensity may be a determinant of fecundity, whereas fire timing in relation to the reproduction phenology may {{have a significant impact on}} ovule survival. Both fire regimes resulted in a substantial reduction in seed supply compared with the Unburnt treatment. This may have a significant impact on seedling regeneration of these tropical savanna eucalypts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fire regimes inmany northAustralian savanna {{regions are}} today characterised by frequentwildfires {{occurring}} {{in the latter part}} of the 7 -month dry season. A fire management program instigated from 2005 over 24 000 km 2 of biodiversity-rich Western Arnhem Land aims to reduce the area and severity of late dry-season fires, and associated greenhouse gas emissions, through targeted <b>early</b> dry-season prescribed <b>burning.</b> This study used fire history mapping derived mostly from Landsat imagery over the period 1990 – 2009 and statistical modelling to quantify the mitigation of late dry-seasonwildfire through prescribed burning. From 2005, there has been a reduction inmean annual total proportion burnt (from 38 to 30 %), and particularly of late dry-season fires (from 29 to 12. 5 %). The slope of the relationship between the proportion of early-season prescribed fire and subsequent late dry-season wildfire was,– 1. This means that imposing prescribed <b>early</b> dry-season <b>burning</b> can substantially reduce late dry-season fire area, by direct one-to-one replacement. There is some evidence that the spatially strategic program has achieved even better mitigation than this. The observed reduction in late dry-season fire without concomitant increase in overall area burnt has important ecological and greenhouse gas emissions implications. This efficientmitigation ofwildfire contrastsmarkedlywith observations reported from temperate fire-prone forested systems...|$|R

40|$|Fire is {{widespread}} in southern African savannas with {{important implications for}} tropical and global atmospheric chemistry. However, previous regional emission studies have not fully accounted for the variability of the emissions throughout the burning season and the associated impacts on emissions quantification. The main {{aim of this study}} is to address this gap. The complexity of the emissions process is described using a spatially and temporally explicit modeling approach that integrates recently published satellite-driven fuel load amounts, satellite burned area products, and empirically derived parameterizations of combustion completeness and emission factors. To represent fire behavior characteristics, land cover is classified into grasslands and woodlands, using a satellite-derived percent tree cover product. The combustion completeness is modeled as a function of grass fuel moisture and the emission factors as a function of grass fuel moisture in grasslands and fuel mixture in woodlands. Fuel moisture is derived from a fuel load model and by using satellite vegetation index time series. A sensitivity analysis with respect to three satellite burned area products reveals large differences in emissions due to differences in their amounts and spatial distribution. The analysis at the regional scale shows, that <b>early</b> <b>burning</b> in grasslands may lead to higher amounts of products of incomplete combustion despite the lower amounts of fuel consumed, compared with late dry season burning. In contrast, <b>early</b> <b>burning</b> in woodlands results in lower emissions because less fuel gets consumed. These seasonal emissions trends become more pronounced when the fuels are wetter. Burning in woodlands dominates the regional emissions budgets. Emissions estimates for various atmospheric species, many of which are modeled for the first time, are reported and compared with other regional sources of pyrogenic emissions and global biomass burning and fossil fuel emissions. The modeled estimates for 2000 are (in Tg) : 537 CO 2 , 23. 2 CO, 0. 726 CH 4 , 0. 661 NMHC, 2. 4 particulates (x and account for significant fractions of regional emissions from all pyrogenic sources.
