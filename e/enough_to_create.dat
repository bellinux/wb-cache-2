5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer.|$|E

5|$|The {{design was}} {{presented}} to the Air Force in November 1952, who were interested <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a new proposal, inviting several companies to participate. Three additional designs were received: the Republic AP-55, an improved version of its prototype XF-91 Thunderceptor; the North American NA-212, which would eventually evolve into the F-107; and the Northrop N-102 Fang, a new General Electric J79-powered design. Although all were interesting, Lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a development contract in March 1953.|$|E
5|$|Development of A.I. {{originally}} {{began with}} producer-director Stanley Kubrick, after he acquired {{the rights to}} Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in protracted development for years, partly because Kubrick felt computer-generated imagery was not advanced <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would {{have led to a}} sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinkhole}} formed due to volcanic pumice deposits, {{upon which}} Guatemala City is built. These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy erosion. According to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College, leaking pipes went unfixed long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> the conditions necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes. Bonis {{also says that}} the Guatemala City sinkhole is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but this one was mainly artificial. In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from limestone {{but there is no}} limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City. Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature.|$|E
5|$|Vesuvius {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> {{temperatures}} and pressures needed {{to cause the}} carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E

5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} sexual selection in his book The Descent of Man. Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} the males. Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways. For example, some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 96–66. Some described the Mets as collapsing {{late in the season}} while the race between the Reds and their division rival Houston Astros was close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> the possibility of a three-way tie. The Reds won a coin flip late in the season which, by rule at the time, awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Mets advanced to NL Division Series (NLDS) where they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, three-games-to-one. They then advanced to the NL Championship Series (NLCS) but were defeated by the Atlanta Braves in six games, bringing an end to the Mets' season. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular-season game by both teams, with all events in the game added to regular-season statistics.|$|E

5|$|The lepton epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E
5|$|The {{universe}} {{continued to}} decrease in density {{and fall in}} temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
