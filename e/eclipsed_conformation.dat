5|$|The crystal {{structure}} of octaphenylrhodocene shows a staggered conformation (similar {{to that of}} ferrocene, and {{in contrast to the}} <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> of ruthenocene). The rhodium–centroid distance is 1.904Å and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths average 2.26Å; the carbon–carbon bond lengths average 1.44Å. These distances are all similar to those found in the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation described above, with the one difference that the effective size of the rhodium centre appears larger, an observation consistent with the expanded ionic radius of rhodium(II) compared with rhodium(III).|$|E
5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E
50|$|In {{metallocenes}} of {{the type}} (C5R5)2M, the cyclopentadienyl rings rotate with very low barriers. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal both eclipsed or staggered rotamers. For non-substituted metallocenes the energy difference between the staggered and <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> {{is only a few}} kJ/mol. Crystals of ferrocene and osmocene exhibit <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> at low temperatures, whereas in the related bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes the rings usually crystallize in a staggered conformation, apparently to minimize steric hindrance between the methyl groups.|$|R
50|$|For example, butane {{has three}} rotamers {{relating}} to its two methyl (CH3) groups: two gauche conformers, {{which have the}} methyls ±60° apart and are enantiomeric, and an anti conformer, where the four carbon centres are coplanar and the substituents are 180° apart (refer to free energy diagram of butane). The energy difference between gauche and anti is 0.9 kcal/mol associated with the strain energy of the gauche conformer. The anti conformer is, therefore, the most stable (≈ 0 kcal/mol). The three <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> with dihedral angles of 0°, 120°, and 240° are {{not considered to be}} rotamers, but are instead transition states of higher energy. Note that the two <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> have different energies: at 0° the two methyl groups are eclipsed, resulting in higher energy (≈ 5 kcal/mol) than at 120°, where the methyl groups are eclipsed with hydrogens (≈ 3.5 kcal/mol).|$|R
5000|$|More complex molecules, such as butane, {{have more}} than one {{possible}} staggered conformation. The anti conformation of butane is approximately 0.9 kcal/mol (3.8 kJ/mol) more stable than the gauche conformation. [...] Both of these staggered conformations are much more stable than the <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations.</b> Instead of a hyperconjugative effect, such as that in ethane, the strain energy in butane is due to both steric interactions between methyl groups and angle strain caused by these interactions.|$|R
25|$|Phosphoryl {{groups are}} {{transferred}} during PEPCK action, {{which is likely}} facilitated by the <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> of the phosphoryl groups when ATP is bound to PEPCK.|$|E
25|$|The two conformations, {{also known}} as rotamers, differ in energy: The {{staggered}} conformation is 12.6nbsp&kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> (the least stable).|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} where hyperconjugation may {{be overlooked}} {{as a possible}} chemical explanation is in rationalizing the rotational barrier of ethane. It had been accepted {{as early as the}} 1930s that the staggered conformations of ethane were more stable than the <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation.</b> Wilson had proven that the energy barrier between any pair of eclipsed and staggered conformations is approximately 3 kcal/mol, and the generally accepted rationale for this was the unfavorable steric interactions between hydrogen atoms.|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{spectroscopy}} and {{ab initio}} calculations on the conformational isomers of 1, 6 -heptadiyne and allylbenzene {{indicate that the}} presence of π bonds help the molecules acquire gauche and <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> that are disfavored by the steric repulsions in alkanes. In 1, 6 -heptadiyne the isomers arrange in increasing energy as GG trans 3 ̆c AG 3 ̆c AA 3 ̆c GG cis. We have experimentally identified the GG trans and AG conformers. The other two isomers are too high in energy or not stable enough to allow experimental identification. For allylbenzene no isomers have been experimentally identified. MP 2 calculations predict the Cs structure to be more stable than the C 1 isomer by less than 1 kJ/mol. The rotational barrier for the isomer interconversion is estimated to be ∼ 12 kJ/mol. We discuss experimental and theoretical evidence that suggests that the CH/π and CC/π interactions responsible for the structural preferences is mostly dispersive in nature with very little contribution from electrostatics. ...|$|R
25|$|Ethane {{forms the}} {{simplest}} case {{for studying the}} conformation of alkanes, as {{there is only one}} C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called Newman projection. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> and staggered conformation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to ferrocene, wherein the cyclopentadienyl rings {{are in a}} staggered conformation, those of ruthenocene crystallise with an <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation.</b> [...] This difference {{is due to the}} larger ionic radius of ruthenium, which increases the distance between the cyclopentadienyl rings, decreasing steric interactions and allowing an <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> to prevail. [...] In solution, these rings rotate with a very low barrier.|$|E
2500|$|Because the E2 {{mechanism}} {{results in}} the formation of a pi bond, the two leaving groups (often a hydrogen and a halogen) need to be antiperiplanar. [...] An antiperiplanar transition state has staggered conformation with lower energy than a synperiplanar transition state which is in <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformation</b> with higher energy. The reaction mechanism involving staggered conformation is more favorable for E2 reactions (unlike E1 reactions).|$|E
40|$|Dihedral angles are {{evaluated}} for the phospholipid ligands of the lipid-binding proteins {{found in the}} Protein Data Base (PDB). Phospholipid structures occur with a trans C 1 –C 2 configuration of the glycerol backbone and oppositely extended chains, {{in addition to the}} gauche C 1 –C 2 rotamers found in membranes. Headgroup conformations are not restricted to the single bent-down configuration and gauche–gauche configuration of the phosphodiester that is found in phospholipid crystals. Additionally, fully extended headgroups and orientations directed away from the lipid chains are found for phospholipids in the protein binding pockets. On average, the hydrocarbon chains of the protein-bound lipids are conformationally more disordered than in fluid bilayer membranes. However, much of this configurational disorder arises from energetically disallowed skew conformations. This suggests a configurational heterogeneity in the lipids at a single binding site: <b>Eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> occur also in some lipid headgroups and glycerol backbones. Stereochemical violations appear for some of the ester carboxyl groups of the protein-bound phospholipids in the PDB, and two glycerol backbones have the incorrect enantiomeric configuration...|$|R
40|$|Methods for the {{quantification}} of statistically valid {{measures of}} the uncertainties associated with X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) data obtained from dilute solutions using fluorescence measurements are developed. Experimental data obtained from 10 mM solutions of the organometallic compound ferrocene, Fe(C 5 H 5) 2, are analysed within this framework and, following correction for various electronic and geometrical factors, give robust estimates of the standard errors of the individual measurements. The reliability of the refinement statistics of standard current XAFS structure approaches that do not include propagation of experimental uncertainties to assess subtle structural distortions is assessed in terms of refinements obtained for the staggered and <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> of the C 5 H 5 rings of ferrocene. Standard approaches (XFIT, IFEFFIT) give refinement statistics that appear to show strong, but opposite, preferences for the different conformations. Incorporation of experimental uncertainties into an IFEFFIT-like analysis yield refinement statistics for the staggered and eclipsed forms of ferrocene which show a far more realistic preference for the eclipsed form which accurately reflects {{the reliability of the}} analysis. Moreover, the more strongly founded estimates of the refined parameter uncertainties allow more direct comparison with those obtained by other techniques. These XAFS-based estimates of the bond distances have accuracies comparable with those obtained using single-crystal diffraction techniques and are superior in terms of their use in comparisons of experimental and computed structures...|$|R
40|$|Orientational order {{parameters}} and individual dihedral torsion angles are evaluated for phospholipid and glycolipid molecules that are resolved in X-ray structures of integral transmembrane proteins in crystals. The order {{parameters of the}} lipid chains and glycerol backbones in protein crystals are characterised by a much wider distribution of orientational order than is found in fluid lipid bilayers and reconstituted lipid-protein membranes. This indicates that the lipids that are resolved in crystals of membrane proteins are mostly not representative of the entire lipid-protein interface. Much of the chain configurational disorder of the membrane-bound lipids in crystals arises from C-C bonds in energetically disallowed skew conformations. This suggests configurational heterogeneity of the lipids at a single binding site: <b>eclipsed</b> <b>conformations</b> occur also in the glycerol backbone torsion angles and the C-C torsion angles of the lipid head groups. Conformations of the lipid glycerol backbone in protein crystals are not restricted to the gauche C 1 -C 2 rotamers found invariably in phospholipid bilayer crystals. Lipid head-group conformations in the protein crystals also do not conform solely to the bent-down conformation, with gauche-gauche configuration of the phosphodiester, that is characteristic of phospholipid bilayer membranes. Stereochemical violations in the protein-bound lipids are evidenced by ester carboxyl groups in non-planar configurations, {{and even in the}} cis configuration. Some lipids have the incorrect enantiomeric configuration of the glycerol backbone, and many of the branched methyl groups in the phytanyl chains associated with bacteriorhodopsin have the incorrect S configuration...|$|R
