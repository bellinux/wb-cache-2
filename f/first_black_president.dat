5|$|Obama entered Harvard Law School in {{the fall}} of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was {{selected}} as an editor of the Harvard Law Review {{at the end of his}} first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{was born}} in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{two years after the}} {{territory}} was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Raised largely in Hawaii, Obama also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.|$|E

25|$|Wilder made news in 2012 when {{he refused}} to support Barack Obama, the nation's <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president,</b> for another term. He noted that he {{supported}} Obama in 2008, but said the president's tenure in the Oval Office thus far had been a disappointment. Wilder did not endorse Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger, and later said that he hoped for an Obama victory despite having gone to a Romney fundraiser.|$|E
25|$|On November 24, 2008 Steele {{launched}} {{his campaign for}} the RNC chairmanship with the launching of his website. On January 30, 2009, Steele won {{the chairmanship of the}} RNC in the sixth round, with 91 votes to Dawson's 77. Steele, the Republican Party's first African American chief, was selected in the aftermath of President Obama's election, when many in the GOP saw him as a charismatic counter to the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Richard Pryor Show premiered on NBC in 1977, but was {{cancelled}} {{after only}} four episodes probably because television audiences {{did not respond}} well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. During the short-lived series, he portrayed the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>President</b> of the United States, spoofed the Star Wars cantina, took on gun violence, and in another skit, used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.|$|E

25|$|In 1947 the World Alliance of YMCAs gained special {{consultative status}} with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In 1955 the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of the World Alliance of YMCAs, Charles Dunbar Sherman from Liberia, was elected. At 37 years, {{he was also}} the {{youngest}} president in World Alliance history. In 1959 the YMCA developed the first nationally organised scuba diving course and certified their first skin and scuba diving instructors. By 1974, the YMCA had set up a curriculum to begin teaching cave diving.|$|E
25|$|Obama, {{having a}} Caucasian mother and Kenyan {{father of the}} Luo ethnic group, became the first African American {{as well as the}} first bi-racial president. Although he may have been the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> to win an election, Obama was not the first African American to run for president. Shirley Chisolm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither {{candidate}} was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President; all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 (Franklin D. Roosevelt/Henry A. Wallace). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent President or Vice-President.|$|E
500|$|On Day of Reconciliation, {{cultural}} groups participate in parades and various festivities take place throughout the country. On Day of Reconciliation 2013, {{a statue of}} Nelson Mandela, the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of South Africa, was unveiled in Pretoria. During the celebration in 2009, President Jacob Zuma honored forgotten heroes of South Africa, including inscribing around 100 dead veteran's names on the Wall of Names at Freedom Park. In 2008, the first victim of [...] "necklacing," [...] Maki Skosana, was given a tombstone and remembered. For the celebration in 2001, the African National Congress (ANC) remembered the police raid {{that led to the}} Rivonia trial. Some of the communities take part in a walk which also serve as a memorial to Mandela. Other parts of South Africa have chosen to emphasize their need for racial harmony in their communities.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in December 2008, Hammie {{painted a}} series of self-portraits perched atop stools and {{unstable}} pedestals. Hammie was inspired by images of America’s <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president’s</b> authoritative pose at the lectern, and their connection to the visual legacy of the enslaved black body on the auction block. The painting Recognition from 2009 depicts a backlit hulking man sitting atop a stool, turning his body to peer out at the viewer. The figure’s face is obscured by a shadow that interrupts the viewer’s gaze. Hammie pictures a figure {{in the process of}} confronting the heritage of a black male body, and on the verge of moving from objecthood to subjecthood.|$|R

500|$|Knight was {{selected}} as President of Pacific Union College in July 2009 and took office in September 2009. She was officially inaugurated on April 15, 2010 in a ceremony at the Pacific Union College Church. Her selection was historical, in that she is both the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> and first female president in Pacific Union College history. Furthermore, {{she is the first}} (and currently only) black woman to lead a North American Adventist college. When Knight took over, Pacific Union College had experienced two consecutive years of decline in enrollment, however, in her first year as president enrollment increased by 11%. After taking over at Pacific Union College, Knight has been noted for her wide experience at both Christian and secular schools and her ability to build consensus between various constituent parties. In December 2010, Knight received an award from the local Chamber of Commerce recognizing her attentiveness to and willingness to work with the community. [...] Knight completed her presidency at PUC in January, 2017.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{had some}} {{controversial}} interactions with Jewish leaders {{in his early}} years in office. In 1996, his message of unity and cooperation with the Jews was met with skepticism. In 1997, Jackson was criticized for stating simple disagreement with anti-Semitic remarks made by Louis Farrakhan {{while he was in}} New York City for the mayoral race; Jewish leaders were unsatisfied by Jackson's response to Farrakhan. In 1997, Newsweek mentioned Jackson in their list of 100 people to watch in the new century, dubbed [...] "the Century Club", and raised the question of whether he would be the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president.</b> Jackson criticized the Bill Clinton administration for working with Republicans and voted in dissent on several notable bills that were the products of compromise between Democrats and Republicans. Jackson preferred direct aid and debt relief to trade reform as a method of helping impoverished nations such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin, fearing that relaxed trade regulations would possibly benefit corporations and exploit labor. He is also an opponent of incentives for corporations to invest in developing nations. He was outspoken on issues of minority hiring in information technology. Jackson voted against the impeachment of Bill Clinton, voting against all four articles of impeachment considered by the House.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2009 {{interview}} with Channel 4 News, Griffin claimed that [...] "There's {{no such thing}} as a black Welshman", which was criticised by Vaughan Gething, the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of the Welsh NUS and the Welsh TUC, and the first black candidate for the Welsh assembly. Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said [...] "On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify. It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." [...] Griffin's {{interview with}} Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, [...] "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act." [...] He rejected claims that the BNP was [...] "acting unlawfully" [...] and said [...] "...because we are here, as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups—it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter there said that we'll only lift a finger for white people—that's a simple lie." [...] In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer, BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler, implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to [...] "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying [...] "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" [...] (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the often}} {{political}} and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>President</b> of the United States, because, as she put it, he displayed [...] "almost every trope of blackness". Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president,</b> noting, [...] "Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>President,</b> the first {{to come from the}} broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [...] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same." [...] Some black activists were also offended, claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests. They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform, which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s. Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{protests and}} boycott at Fisk had repercussions on other Black campuses. Shortly after McKenzie {{departed}} Fisk in 1925, students at Howard University {{went on strike}} to protest, among other things, compulsory chapel attendance. The protest led to the resignation of Howard's White president, J. Stanley Durkee, amidst accusations of such things as [...] "arbitrary and dictatorial policy and manner supported by a system of espionage and intimidation," [...] "violently mishandling of faculty," [...] and [...] "an open affront and insult to race-pride and respect." [...] On June 26, 1926, just one year after McKenzie departed Fisk, Dr. Mordecai Wyatt Johnson was named Howard University's <b>first</b> <b>Black</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Blackwell {{faced an}} uphill battle; {{according}} to a broad survey reported by The Plain Dealer on April 30, 2006, Ohio voters would [...] "prefer to see a Democrat occupy the governor's mansion." [...] Still, he had his supporters. John Stemberger, president and {{general counsel for the}} Florida Family Policy Council, was quoted as saying that Blackwell could [...] "potentially be president of the United States someday, and the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> at that." [...] Blackwell's campaign relied heavily on accusations that Ted Strickland was not a resident of Ohio, and later that Ted Strickland was gay. Both of these accusations played heavily in campaign literature that failed to resonate with Ohio voters. Due to his poor management of this campaign, Blackwell's ability to compete on a national stage was called into question.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} the speech, a Chicago Tribune {{editorial}} declared Obama [...] "The Phenom". The Washington Times acknowledged that it would likely disagree with Obama's policies, but compared with John Edwards' speech, [...] "his sentiments had a freshness and a realness that Mr. Edwards' lacked." [...] A reporter for Britain's The Independent declared that the mantle of who was {{most likely to be}} the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> had passed from Colin Powell to Obama, though another was left unimpressed, finding the speech [...] "disappointingly free of original thought". [...] Kenya's The Nation also covered the speech, and noted his use of biography, particularly his Kenyan heritage. [...] A columnist for Christian Science Monitor acknowledged that many aspects of his speech were typical of political speeches, but that Obama had managed to make it appear as though they were something new and exciting. [...] Speaking of the broadcast networks that had not covered the address, the column said, [...] "They missed the national debut of what {{could be one of the}} most exciting and important voices in American politics in the next half century." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} speech MSNBC host Chris Matthews admitted, [...] "I {{have to tell}} you, a little chill in my legs right now. That is an amazing moment in history right there. It is surely an amazing moment. A keynoter like I have never heard." [...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>president</b> there. And the reason I say that is because I think the {{immigrant}} experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama believe about this war?" [...] On PBS, columnist David Brooks responded positively, [...] "This is why you go to conventions, to watch a speech like this," [...] while Mark Shields said, [...] "A star is born." ...|$|E
