5|$|Gravel campaigned almost {{full-time}} in New Hampshire, {{the first}} primary state, following his announcement. Opinion polls of contenders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> showed Gravel with 1percent or less support.

5|$|In 1969, Rangel ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> for New York City Council President. In {{a tumultuous}} race that {{featured}} sportswriter Jimmy Breslin as mayoral candidate Norman Mailer's running mate, Rangel came in {{last in a}} field of six candidates.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Johnson was one {{of three}} contenders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> for {{lieutenant}} governor. In the primary, he received more votes than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright, but a newly enacted election law required a runoff if no candidate received a majority. On September 7, Johnson defeated Wise in the runoff.|$|E
5|$|Cordray was unopposed in the May 7, 2002, primary {{election}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> as Franklin County treasurer. He defeated Republican incumbent Wade Steen, {{who had been}} appointed in May 2001 to replace Bobbie M. Hall. The election was close, unofficially 131,199–128,677 (50.5%–49.5%), official margin of victory 3,232. Cordray was the first Democrat to hold the position since 1977, and he assumed office on December 9, 2002, instead of after January 1 because he was filling Hall's unexpired term.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, McCreary {{returned}} to his legal practice. In 1884, he sought election to Congress from Kentucky's Eighth District. His opponents <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> were Milton J. Durham and Philip B. Thompson, Jr., both of whom had held the district's seat previously. McCreary bested both men, and {{in the general election}} in November, defeated Republican James Sebastian by a margin of 2,146 votes. It was the largest margin of victory by a Democrat in the Eighth District.|$|E

5|$|Kefalas first ran for {{the state}} {{legislature}} in 2004, winning the Democratic Party primary by only seven votes over Fort Collins councilman Bill Bertschy after a recount process that lasted for several weeks. Kefalas lost the general election by fewer than 500 votes to incumbent Republican Bob McCluskey in a race that also included Libertarian Party candidate Jassen Bowman. Kefalas ran unchallenged <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> in 2006, and narrowly prevailed over McCluskey in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2016 presidential election, Booker {{endorsed}} Hillary Clinton <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination.</b> He was speculated as {{a potential}} vice presidential candidate during the primary and as the general election began, though Booker stated on June 16, 2016 {{that he was not}} being vetted. After the election, in which Donald Trump defeated Clinton, on January 11, 2017, Booker testified against Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, the first instance of a sitting senator testifying against another during a cabinet position confirmation hearing.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{clinched}} enough delegates for {{the nomination}} and his focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged battle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination.</b> McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounts {{for most of the}} couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{candidates}} declared their candidacy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination,</b> including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler. Former governor Beckham {{was not a}} candidate; {{his only}} son had died in late 1934, devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign. Near {{the end of the}} primary campaign, Laffoon suffered an attack of appendicitis and required an appendectomy, leaving him unable to campaign for Rhea. Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election.|$|E
5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who have entered the race <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> and won, {{including}} John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, he competed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> for the New York State Senate 57th District against {{incumbent}} Al Coppola and Samuel A. Herbert. Coppola was {{endorsed by}} Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello. Brown won the September 2000 primary by a wide 18% margin. However, Coppola remained {{on the ballot in}} the general election on the Conservative Party of New York, Working Families Party and Green Party lines. The Republican Party nominee was the politically inexperienced Harrison R. Woolworth. Although Brown began the race without organized political support, he earned endorsements from many veteran non-Western New York politicians such as H. Carl McCall, Andrew Cuomo, and Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Chico ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination</b> {{to succeed}} {{retiring}} Republican U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald. He {{was the first}} Democrat to declare his candidacy, doing so on July 30, 2002, during a rally with Hispanic leaders. His Senate committee preferences included education, transportation, and foreign relations. He also criticized the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, but supported gay marriage, abortion rights, stem cell research, the death penalty, and universal healthcare. Chico was the only candidate who supported gay marriage out of all seven Democrats and eight Republicans. Then-State Senator Barack Obama ultimately won the nomination over six other candidates including Chico.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, the Kentucky House {{achieved}} a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day. Having lost {{the battle against}} the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>nomination.</b> They believed that a double primary {{would be too much}} for the aging Beckham to endure. Supporters of a single primary found they did not have the votes in the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.|$|E
