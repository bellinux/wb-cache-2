50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of potential treatments for any disease is usually assessed in a randomized controlled trial, which compares {{the outcome of}} those who received treatment to those who received a placebo (i.e. <b>dummy</b> <b>treatment).</b> However, randomized controlled trials are considered unethical when a disease is frequently fatal, {{as is the case}} with Ebola. In December 2015, a study was released that found that the viral load found in a patient's blood in the week after the onset of symptoms is a strong indication of the patient's likelihood to die or survive the disease. The researchers suggested that this information could help to assess the efficacy of proposed treatments more accurately in non-randomized clinical trials.|$|E
30|$|Sample {{sizes of}} {{municipalities}} with less elderly people, large working age population, and {{high population density}} are larger than those of municipalities with more elderly people, a small working age population, and lower population density. Therefore, this paper calculates the effect size that is not influenced by the sample size. As a result, the program surely affects municipalities with fewer elderly people. Additionally, this paper runs another estimation for robustness. This paper adds a cross-term of the time <b>dummy,</b> <b>treatment</b> dummy, and features of regions (i.e., elderly, smaller working age population, or less population density dummy) in Eq. (1) and estimates the entire sample. As a result, the elderly dummy and the lower working age population dummy are significantly negative for workers although this estimation is constrained by some coefficients being equal.|$|E
40|$|The {{placebo effect}} is an {{interesting}} phenomenon whereby a <b>dummy</b> <b>treatment</b> can produce therapeutic benefit, such as, pain relief. While evidence for the placebo effect is growing, relatively few studies have explored ways of enhancing placebo effects. To address this, the current study tested whether placebo-induced analgesia could be enhanced by providing an educational handout about the efficacy of analgesics. Fifty university students were allocated to receive placebo treatment {{under the guise of}} a new analgesic formula, either with or without an educational handout, or to a no treatment control group before undergoing electrical and cold pressor pain tests. There was a placebo effect for electrically-induced pain with those receiving placebo treatment reporting significantly less pain compared with those who received no treatment. There was also some evidence of enhancement of this placebo-induced analgesia for electrically-induced pain {{as a result of the}} educational handout. No differences were found on cold pressor-induced pain. These findings suggest that providing educational information about a treatment could enhance its efficacy via the placebo effect. Future studies should test different methods of providing educational information in order to determine which elicit the strongest effects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{incidence}} of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is 50 % to 80 % after neurosurgery. The common prophylactic treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting is a triple therapy of droperidol, promethazine and dexamethasone. Newer, more effectives methods of prophylaxis are being investigated. We designed this prospective, double-blind, single-center study {{to compare the}} efficacy of ondansetron, a neurokinin- 1 antagonist, and aprepitant, {{as a substitute for}} droperidol, in the prophylactic treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting after neurosurgery. Methods After obtaining institutional review board approval; 176 patients, 18 to 85 [*]years of age with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classifications I to III, who did not receive antiemetics 24 [*]h before surgery and were expected to undergo general anesthesia for neurosurgery lasting longer than 2 [*]h were included in this study. After meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and providing written informed consent, patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: aprepitant or ondansetron. The objective {{of this study was to}} conduct a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group and single-center trial to compare and evaluate the efficacies of aprepitant versus ondansetron. Patients received oral aprepitant 40 [*]mg OR oral dummy pill within 2 [*]h prior to induction. At induction, a combination of intravenous dexamethasone 10 [*]mg, promethazine 25 [*]mg, and ondansetron 4 [*]mg OR dummy injection was administered. Therefore, all patients received one <b>dummy</b> <b>treatment</b> and three active PONV prophylactic medications: dexamethasone 10 [*]mg, promethazine 25 [*]mg, and either aprepitant 40 [*]mg OR ondansetron 4 [*]mg infusion. The primary outcome measures were the episodes and severity of nausea and vomiting; administration of rescue antiemetic; and opioid consumption for 120 [*]h postoperatively. Standard safety assessments included adverse event reports, physical and laboratory data, awakening time and duration of recovery from anesthesia. Discussion The results of this comparative study could potentially identify an improved treatment regimen that may decrease the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing neurosurgery. Also, this will serve to enhance patient recovery and overall satisfaction of neurosurgical patients in the immediate postoperative period.

I observed bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from a shore-based, rooftop theodolite station on the southeast side of Galveston Island to test their behavioral response to pingers. Pingers have been shown to alert some cetacean species to the presence of nets, but have not been tested adequately for bottlenose dolphins. Data were collected from September 1997 to August 1999 for behavioral variables (behavior, cohesion level, and group size) as well as for track variables (linearity, track speed, and reorientation) to determine differences between three levels of an experimental factor: active, dummy, and control. An active treatment consisted of pingers that contained batteries and were pinging, while a <b>dummy</b> <b>treatment</b> consisted of pingers that did not contain the batteries and would not ping, and the control with no pinger. Hypotheses were that with a change of pinger treatment, dolphins would not exhibit different: 1) behaviors, 2) cohesion levels, 3) group sizes; and 4) movement patterns. In addition, two criteria were used to select case-study tracks that exhibited possible reactions by the dolphins to pingers: 1) All tracks of dolphins that extended "through" the treatment line or just next to either buoy, as if there was nothing to deter dolphin movement; and 2) All tracks that showed an approximate 180 -degree turn by dolphins upon nearing or reaching the treatment line, as if movement was deterred. The first criterion was expected to occur for dolphin groups during control or dummy days, while criterion 2 was expected to occur for dolphin groups during active treatment. Chi-square tests and MANCOVA's did not detect significant differences among treatments; however, case studies showed interesting trends. Four of 5 dolphin pods that turned 180 degrees occurred on days when the treatment was active. At no time did a dolphin or dolphin pod swim through the treatment line during an "active" treatment. However, during "dummy" or "control" treatment days, 9 dolphins or dolphin groups, of 14 case study dolphin groups swam through the treatment line. It is apparent that the "active" pinger may have been deterring dolphins from passing across the treatment line...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of bipolar interferential electrotherapy (ET) and pulsed ultrasound (US) as adjuvants to exercise therapy for soft tissue shoulder disorders (SD).  METHODS—Randomised placebo controlled trial with a two by two factorial design plus an additional control group in 17  primary care physiotherapy practices {{in the south of}} the Netherlands. Patients with shoulder pain and/or restricted shoulder mobility, because of a soft tissue impairment without underlying specific or generalised condition, were enrolled if they had not recovered after six sessions of exercise therapy in two weeks. They were randomised to receive (1) active ET plus active US; (2) active ET plus dummy US; (3) dummy ET plus active US; (4) dummy ET plus dummy US; or (5) no adjuvants. Additionally, they received a maximum of 12  sessions of exercise therapy in six weeks. Measurements at baseline, 6  weeks and 3,  6,  9, and 12  months later were blinded for treatment. Outcome measures: recovery, functional status, chief complaint, pain, clinical status, and range of motion.  RESULTS—After written informed consent 180  patients were randomised: both the active treatments were given to 73  patients, both the <b>dummy</b> <b>treatments</b> to 72  patients, and 35  patients received no adjuvants. Prognosis of groups appeared similar at baseline. Blinding was successfully maintained. At six weeks seven patients (20 %) without adjuvants reported very large improvement (including complete recovery), 17  (23 %) and 16  (22 %) with active and dummy ET, and 19  (26 %) and 14  (19 %) with active and dummy US. These proportions increased to about 40 % at three months, but remained virtually stable thereafter. Up to 12  months follow up the 95 % CI for differences between groups for all outcomes include zero.  CONCLUSION—Neither ET nor US prove to be effective as adjuvants to exercise therapy for soft tissue SD. ...|$|R

ROTATOR cuff tendinitis (RCT) is a common disorder affecting individuals subjecting their shoulders to repeated stress, athletes and many middle-aged and elderly persons in whom a cause may not be apparent [1].

30|$|A similar {{evaluation}} method {{was used by}} Kopits (1978) to assess the employment effect of a temporary wage subsidy in France (incentive bonus for job creation) for the period 1959 – 1975. The author estimates an employment equation by industry for the period before the subsidy was made available. Then, employment is predicted over two quarters {{and the difference between}} the actual values and the forecasts are used to evaluate the impact of the wage subsidy. More recently, Dmitrijeva and Hazans (2007), Fahr and Sunde (2009), Hertweck and Sigrist (2013) and Klinger and Rothe (2012) evaluate the macro effect of the Hartz I/II and III reforms in Germany on the efficiency of the matching process between job seekers and vacancies. To that purpose, they estimate a matching function on their entire period of observation and make the matching efficiency dependent on a constant term, a business cycle indicator (the IFO business expectations index), month fixed effects and a (<b>treatment)</b> <b>dummy</b> equal to 1 after the implementation of the Harz reforms. This <b>treatment</b> <b>dummy</b> is not made time dependent, thus allowing only for a single structural change of the outcome variable. Given the usual lags associated with the implementation of policies and the response of the various parties involved, labor market reforms are expected to have an impact only after some time has passed. This justifies time-varying treatment effects as we do in the present paper. Besides, our evaluation approach, which consists in comparing actual outcomes to predicted ones, is less parametric and more flexible than estimating treatment effects within a regression model.|$|R
40|$|Sample {{selection}} {{models are}} widely used in microeconometric analysis. Most of these models are employed either as selection models or as dummy endogenous models to estimate the impact of e. g. an active labour market policy. So far, a mixture of these two models has rarely been used. This study aims to combine the sample selection model and the <b>dummy</b> endogenous <b>treatment</b> model using a bivariate selection rule. Moreover, estimation is carried out using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) methods to obtain fully efficient estimates. In most studies a two-step procedure is employed which yields consistent estimates, but inconsistent standard errors. The FIML estimator has rarely been used in micro econometrics so far, as estimation may be complex. To apply the FIML estimator, this study analyses {{the impact of the}} so called “bridging allowance ” on firm growth. In Germany start-ups from unemployment may be supported as part of the active labour market policy with bridging allowance. Why should we apply a bivariate selection rule for this kind of investigation? First, there is the classical selection bias that only for surviving firms as well as for firms...|$|R
30|$|To {{reinforce}} our confidence on {{the preliminary}} evidence from Table  2, we test for common trends between groups before {{the introduction of}} the program. For this purpose, we run a model of the outcome variable on a constant, the <b>treatment</b> <b>dummy,</b> year dummies, and interactions between the <b>treatment</b> and year <b>dummy</b> variables including only pre-intervention periods. We then apply an F test in which the null hypothesis states that all the coefficients for the interaction terms are jointly equal to zero. We find no evidence to reject the null hypothesis for all women in our sample. 20 Therefore, the result suggests the existence of a common underlying trend for the treatment and control groups before the implementation of the AUH, which then appears to have been broken since {{the introduction of the}} program.|$|R

40|$|In an {{evaluation}} of prison-based residential drug treatment programs, the authors use three dif-ferent regression-based approaches to estimating treatment effects.

40|$|Question: Concealment is {{integral}} to placebo-controlled clinical trials and insures that participants remain blind to whether they are receiving real (verum) or <b>dummy</b> (placebo) <b>treatment.</b> While participants are routinely informed about and consent to be randomised to verum or placebo, they are typically never told which treatment they actually received: they are not debriefed to treatment allocation. Participants’ experiences of this aspect of trials have not been well-described. Methods: We therefore conducted an idiographic phenomenological study of four participants’ experiences of being blinded to and then debriefed to placebo allocation in a placebo-controlled clinical trial (conducted in the USA). Four participants in a trial of acupuncture for IBS were interviewed before, during, and after receiving a course of placebo treatments over 6 weeks. During the final interview they were debriefed to placebo allocation. Results: Each participant's experiences of being blinded to and then debriefed to placebo allocation are described in depth using a phenomenological approach based on the Sheffield School. All four thought they had received real acupuncture, and based their belief {{on a combination of}} embodied experiences during and after treatments, and their perceptions of their acupuncturists. They were all surprised to be told they had placebo, and did not unquestionably accept this news. Instead, they developed revised explanations that reconciled their lived experiences (of real acupuncture) with the conflicting news (of placebo acupuncture) from the interviewer. Conclusions: Our participants’ experiences of blinding and debriefing were embodied, related to their goals in undertaking the study, and social – embedded in trusting and valued relationships with acupuncturists, told to others outside the study, and described to an interviewer. This work suggests that debriefing to placebo allocation can and should be managed sensitively to facilitate positive outcomes for participants: further research should focus on developing best practice in this area. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 62 – 66 OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} and tolerance of pantoprazole versus ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcers in the Brazilian population. METHODS: A total of 222 patients with active duodenal ulcers (DU) were randomly allocated to a double <b>dummy</b> blind <b>treatment,</b> either with ranitidine (RAN) 300 mg (111, aged from 20 – 68 yr old, 56 female) or with pantoprazole (PANT) 40 mg (111 patients, 18 – 70 yr old, 45 female). After a 2 -wk course of treatment, each patient was clinically and endoscopically assessed for ulcer healing. Failure to heal required a further 2 -wk course of treatment and a new evaluation thereafter. RESULTS: In all, 77 of the 103 patients in the PANT group (74. 8 %) and 42 of the 94 patients in the RAN group (44. 7 %) who completed the study had ulcer healing after one 2 -wk treatment course, and an additional 23 in the PANT group (22. 3 %) and 28 in the RAN group (29. 8 %) after the second 2 -wk treatment course, totaling 100 (97. 1 %) and 70 (74. 5 %), respectively. Therapeutic gain in favor of pantoprazole was significant both at the end of the first and the second 2 -wk treatment course (p < 0. 001). At 2 wk, symptoms remission was significantly higher in the PANT group (97. 6 %) than with the RAN group (77. 5 %) (p < 0. 001). The Intention-to-treat analysis showed results statistically similar to those observed in the per-protocol analysis. Minor adverse events were reported by four patients in the PANT group and three in the RAN group. No relevant laboratory abnormalities were seen. No patient withdrew from the study due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that pantoprazole is more effective than ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer providing faster ulcer healing in most patients (97. 1 %), in 4 wk. Adverse events were rare and were similar in both groups, and had no influence on the therapeutic outcome...|$|R

Available inhaled combinations differ in terms of drug delivery to the lung and the ability to reach small airways. Aim: To evaluate whether treatment with an extra-fine inhaled combination provides additional effects vs a nonextra-fine combination on airway function. METHODS: After a 1 - to 4 -week run-in period, patients with asthma were randomized to a double blind, double <b>dummy,</b> 12 -week <b>treatment</b> with either extra-fine beclomethasone/formoterol (BDP/F) 400 / 24 microg daily or fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S) 500 / 100 microg daily. Methacholine (Mch) bronchoprovocation challenge and single breath nitrogen (sbN 2) test were performed. RESULTS: Thirty patients with asthma (15 men), mean age 43, mean forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) 71. 4 % of predicted, were included. A significant increase (P < 0. 01) versus baseline was observed in predose FEV(1) in both BDP/F and FP/S groups (0. 37 +/- 0. 13 l and 0. 36 +/- 0. 12 l, respectively). PD(20) FEV(1) Mch improved significantly from 90. 42 (+/- 30. 08) microg to 432. 41 (+/- 122. 71) microg in the BDP/F group (P = 0. 01) but not in the FP/S group. A trend toward improvement vs baseline was observed for BDP/F in closing capacity (CC), whereas no differences were recorded in other sbN(2) test parameters. CONCLUSION: The findings of this pilot study suggest that an extra-fine inhaled combination for the treatment of asthma has beneficial effects on {{both large and}} small airways function as expressed by Mch and sbN(2) tests...|$|R
40|$|Remarkably {{little is}} known about the {{long-term}} impacts of project aid to lagging poor areas (Chen, Mu et al. 2006, 2008). This paper contributes to the debate about the role of rural transport infrastructure development in explaining the long-term rural development. In line with Grimm and Klasen (2008) we agree that there is value-added to consider this debate at the micro level within a country as particularly questions of parameter heterogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity are likely to be smaller than between countries. Moreover, at the micro level it is possible to identify more precise transmission mechanisms from rural transport infrastructure to socio-economic development outcomes. This is done empirically by analyzing a UNDP&UNCDF financed rural development project in Zambia's Eastern Province running from 1997 - 2002. The secondary datasets consist of respectively a series of repeated cross-sectional living conditions monitoring surveys (LCMSs). The LCMSs were collected in 1998 (baseline) and 2004 (follow-up), that is both prior, during and after the project implementation.

40|$|The bison {{industry}} has limited resources for increasing market share. Exploring how consumers react {{to information about}} bison and discovering what people know about bison is important to determine {{the most efficient way}} to increase market share and ensure the sustainability of the bison industry. This thesis examines the impact of three different information treatments on willingness-to-pay for bison. The three treatments are a nutritional comparison chart of negatively-perceived nutrients, a bison taste testimonial from a chef and a statement concerning the absence of growth hormones and antibiotics in the processed bison product used in the research. The hypothesis tested is that nutritional information about bison would elicit the greatest increase in willingness-to-pay for the processed bison product. A random nth-price auction was conducted in December 2002 in Guelph, Ontario with 57 participants to elicit willingness-to-pay values for the processed bison product. Participants’ initial bids for the processed bison product were elicited without being given any information and a second round of bidding was conducted once participants had reviewed an information treatment. The mean difference in the bids between round two and round one are $ 0. 221 for the nutritional comparison treatment, $ 0. 210 for the taste testimonial treatment and $ 0. 185 for the natural aspects treatment. ANOVA results indicate no statistically significant difference between the mean difference in bids between the three treatments. Further analysis with a regression model using the difference in bids as the dependent variable, <b>dummy</b> variables representing <b>treatment</b> types and survey data for the other relevant independent variables, shows that the coefficient for the nutritional comparison treatment is not significantly different from zero. Therefore, the hypothesis that nutritional information about bison would elicit the greatest increase in willingness-to-pay for the processed bison product has been rejected. The other independent variables examined in the regression are not significant. This thesis does not clearly indicate which information treatment would be the most effective for the bison industry to utilize in a bison information campaign. However, each information treatment did increase the group mean willingness-to-pay so any information relevant to consumers about bison may be beneficial in increasing market share for bison products. Industry participants may need to work together to simultaneously increase awareness, distribution and consumption of bison products to ensure the sustainability of the bison industry...|$|R
