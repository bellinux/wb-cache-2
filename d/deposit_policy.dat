40|$|We study two {{reservation}} deposit {{policies for}} a service firm {{to increase its}} revenue through higher capacity utilization. First, under the "no deposit" policy, the firm requires no reservation deposit and imposes no "no show" penalty. Anticipating potential "no shows," a firm may overbook; hence, {{there is no guarantee}} that the reserved service will be provided under the no <b>deposit</b> <b>policy.</b> On the contrary, under the "guarantee deposit" policy, a guarantee deposit is required for each customer to make a non-cancelable reservation. To honor the reserved service under the guarantee <b>deposit</b> <b>policy,</b> the firm will not overbook. We analyze each <b>deposit</b> <b>policy</b> as a Stackelberg game in which the firm acts as the leader who selects the booking capacity under the no <b>deposit</b> <b>policy</b> (or the required deposit under the guarantee <b>deposit</b> <b>policy),</b> and each customer acts as the follower who decides whether to reserve or not. Our model incorporates rational customer behavior so that each customer will take other customers' behavior into consideration. Using the firm's optimal booking capacity (optimal required deposit) in equilibrium under the no <b>deposit</b> <b>policy</b> (the guarantee <b>deposit</b> <b>policy),</b> we compare the firm's expected profits under these two policies in a monopolistic environment. Our results suggest that the firm should charge a higher optimal retail price under the no <b>deposit</b> <b>policy,</b> and adopt the no <b>deposit</b> <b>policy</b> when the demand rate is below a certain threshold. By analyzing a game of duopolistic competition between two firms, we develop the conditions under which the firms will adopt a particular pair of deposit policies in equilibrium, and we show this game can lead to a Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, when both firms charge the same retail price, we show the existence of an equilibrium in which both firms adopt the no <b>deposit</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E

First, we consider the stand-alone deposit purchase policy and then combine that policy with the option to tax or subsidize the supply of deposits. In either case, coalitions of any size turn out to buy deposits while the non-cooperative countries do not. In case of the standalone deposit purchase policy either no coalition is stable or the grand coalition is the only stable coalition. If the two-instrument policy is implemented, all countries inside and outside the coalition are better off than in case of the stand-alone <b>deposit</b> <b>policy,</b> but the conditions for stable grand coalitions are more favorable under the stand-alone <b>deposit</b> <b>policy</b> than under the two-instrument policy due to weaker free-rider incentives...|$|E

40|$|In Australia {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} emphasis on providing open access to research outputs where {{there has been}} public funding of the research. A major issue in providing open access to research is the development of complex relationships between public bodies, educational institutions, publishers and authors. These relationships can present significant barriers in the practical process of deposit. To overcome these barriers we need to understand: the impact of national and institutional open access policies; the nature of stakeholder interests and research culture; and the legal framework authors and repository staff must navigate to provide open access to the research. This paper briefly explains motivations for providing a policy of open access to research through an institutional repository and what form such policies have taken. There have been mixed successes in implementing open access repositories in Australian institutions and this paper explores some of the common elements in successful repository workflows. It is submitted that <b>deposit</b> <b>policy</b> must be adaptable to changing government and publishing trends.

40|$|In {{the world}} economy with interdependent markets for fossil fuel and deposits, some {{coalition}} of countries fights climate change by purchasing and preserving fossil fuel deposits, which would be exploited otherwise. If the coalition's policy parameters are the demand and supply of deposits (<b>deposit</b> <b>policy),</b> the outcome is inefficient, but the coalition is better off with than without exerting market power by influencing prices in its own favor. In the special case, in which noncoalition countries do not suffer from climate damage, the outcome is efficient if the coalition is a price taker on both markets, but inefficient otherwise. The latter result demonstrates that Harstad's (2012, Theorem 1) efficiency result is not robust with respect to variations in the concepts of deposit market and strategic behavior. We also analyze a policy where the coalition's first policy parameter is its deposit demand, as before, and the second policy parameter is fuel supply rather than deposit supply.

This study presents a model for determining the optimal cash deposit amount {{when there is a}} fixed per-payment cost; the model balances the tradeoff between the fixed payment cost with the lost interest on the cash deposit. We use a renewal theory approach to obtain the long-term expected total cost per period when the bill amounts in a future period are deterministic, exponentially distributed, normally distributed, or Poisson occurrence based with a constant per occurrence charge. For the first two cases, we obtain explicit expressions for the optimal deposit amount; for the latter two, we give numerical procedures. An example in each case is presented, along with a comparison with the usual pay-each-period strategy. We conclude that the advance payment strategy offers significant cost savings when the per-payment cost is relatively large compared with the lost interest of one period's average bill amount; i. e. when interest rate is low or the average bill amount is small. cost models <b>deposit</b> <b>policy</b> inventory theory application...|$|E

40|$|The {{allure of}} passing an {{institutional}} open-access (OA) policy {{as a strategy}} to populate an institutional repository is clear. After all, educating faculty to retain their rights to their scholarly publications through passage of such a policy, then requiring them to make those publications available through an IR seems a sure path to success. However, this approach of “if you pass it, they will comply” rings eerily similar to the early and decidedly misplaced optimism of populating institutional repositories through a “build it and they will come” proposition (Salo, 2007). The Registry of Open Access Repositories Mandatory Archiving Policies (ROARMAP) reports, though, that 73 campuses now {{have some form of}} institutional, departmental, or school open-access policy in place. Additionally, the Coalition of Open Access Policy Institutions (COAPI) consists of more than 60 institutions that have OA policies in place or are actively working to pass them. Some of the most dramatic growth in COAPI membership and ROARMAP registration occurred in 2013, indicating that open-access policies are increasing in popularity and have been implemented with success (Duranceau 2 ̆ 6 Kriegsman, 2013; Kipphut-Smith, 2014). So, while OA policies are not a panacea for obtaining repository content, with the right approaches in development and implementation they can provide content, educate campus communities, and enhance faculties’ academic freedom through rights retention. This chapter will explore some of the types of open-access policies and discuss whether or not an OA policy may be right for every institution. [...] .
