40|$|Background: Plantar {{fasciitis}} is the inflammatory at origo plantar fascia in calcaneus, {{caused by}} the degenerative process of plantar fascia or mikroruptur. The sore in plantar fasciitis condition can influence the work productivity and disturb the functional activity or <b>functional</b> <b>capability.</b> Aim: This research aims to reveal the differences in influence of diadynamic current and active stretching with diadynamic current and passive stretching toward the <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> in plantar fasciitis. Research Method: This research was an experimental research. The population {{of this research was}} plantar fasciitis patient who suffered from <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> degradation at Pundong Bantul Community Health Center. Sample was gotten through purposive sampling method and it consisted of 14 people in each treatment group. The first group was given the diadynamic current and active stretching 7 times in 7 days. The second group was given the diadynamic current and passive stretching treatment 7 times in 7 days. The instrument for measuring the <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> used Foot Function Index. The normality test was with Saphiro Wilk Test and the homogeneity data test was with Laveneâ€™s Test. The result of this research was analyzed by using Paired Sample T-Test for revealing the improvement of <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> in first and second group and the Independent Sample T-Test for testing the different influence in first and second group. Result: The first hypothesis test was with paired sample t-test and the p value= 0, 000 (p 0, 05). Conclusion: There are not any differences in influence between diadynamic current and active stretching and diadynamic current and passive stretching in the improvement of <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> for plantar fasciitis.

Methods: A quasy experimental design with pretest posttest with non-equivalent control group. The research was conducted at the Community Health Center of Kalikajar I, Selomerto I and Garung I in Wonosobo regency in January 2017. The samples of this research were 42 pregnant women in trimester III selected using purposive sampling, which 14 samples assigned in the yoga group, acupressure group, and control group. A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain level, and Oswestry Disability Index to measure <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> of lower back. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results: Findings showed that there was a statistically significant effect of yoga, acupressure, and pregnancy exercise (control group) in reducing lower back pain and lower back <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> with p < 0. 05. Pregnancy exercise (mean= - 1. 43) was more effective in reducing lower back pain compared with yoga (mean=- 2. 29) and acupressure (mean=- 2. 71); and acupressure (mean=- 14. 29) was more effective in improving lower back <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> than yoga (mean=- 6. 57) and pregnancy exercise (mean= - 13. 29). Conclusion: There were significant effects of yoga, acupressure, and pregnancy exercise in reducing pain and in improving the functional ability of the lower back.

2500|$|Representation of the {{networks}} own output structures, by which represents its own information message, is Orpwood's explanation that grounds the manifestation of qualia via neurobiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are particular to [...] networks of pyramidal neurons. Although computational neuroscience still has much to investigate regarding pyramidal neurons, their complex circuitry is relatively unique. Research shows that the complexity of pyramidal neuron networks {{is directly related to}} the increase in the <b>functional</b> <b>capabilities</b> of a species. When human pyramidal networks are compared with other primate species and species with less intricate behavioral and social interactions, the complexity of these neural networks drastically decline. The complexity of these networks are also increased in frontal brain regions. These regions are often associated with conscious assessment and modification of one's immediate environment; often referred to as executive functions. Sensory input is necessary to gain information from the environment, and perception of that input is necessary for navigating and modifying interactions with the environment. This suggests that frontal regions containing more complex pyramidal networks are associated with an increased perceptive capacity. As perception is necessary for conscious thought to occur, and since the experience of qualia is derived from consciously recognizing some perception, qualia may indeed be specific to the functional capacity of pyramidal networks. This derives Orpwood's notion that the mechanisms of re-entrant feedback may not only create qualia, but also be the foundation to consciousness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} a CMOS based {{artificial}} neuron implemented by threshold elements. We consider the artificial neuron as a threshold element with controlled inputs having weights formed during a learning process. A so-called Î²-driven threshold element is used for {{in the scheme of}} the neuron. Functioning of this element is described in a specific ratio form. The Î²-driven implementation is based on using summarized conductivities of n-and p-chains of a CMOS gate as the ratio of weighted sums. The threshold element has a wider <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> in comparison with the traditional functional basis. Moreover, its <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> can be enriched. We propose a method for increasing the <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> of the threshold element by introducing socalled functional inputs. Each functional input corresponds to a Boolean sum (or product) of a particular subset of input variables. This sum (or product) serves as a single input of the threshold element. It is shown that introducing functional inputs enables expansion of the <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> of Î²-driven elements up to the capability to implement an arbitrary monotonic function. The CMOS based implementation of the Î²-driven threshold element with newly proposed functional inputs is presented. Methods of the current stabilization of functional inputs are proposed. In the proposed implementation of the artificial neuron, each input weight is determined by the current value via a suitable current stabilizer. This value can be effectively controlled by the value of the voltage at the gate of one of the current stabilizerâ€™s transistors. The paper presents examples of the SPICE simulation of behavior of the proposed artificial neuron in the modes of learning and maintaining the input weights values. Key-Words: Artificial neuron, threshold element, learnable circuit, CMOS circuits, SPICE-simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the relationship between income and living conditions and well-being of elderly. The best from two worlds is used for this purpose: a Danish survey covering 1440 elderly aged 72 and 77 from 1997, connected to reliable register information on income, 1988 â€“ 1996. Indicators of physical activity, social and solitary activities, social contact, <b>functional</b> <b>capability,</b> loneliness and psychological well-being are constructed from the survey. Ordered logistic models are estimated controlling for demographics, education, previous occupation and whether the elderly are still working. It is found that elderly with low income levels have poorer <b>functional</b> <b>capability,</b> lower physical activity and poorer psychological well-being whereas social contact and social activities show no relationship with income. The relationship with income vanishes for solitary activities and loneliness when adding control variables. Having established that robust relations exist between income and some measures of well-being of elderly, we turn to an investigation of causality. Simultaneous models are estimated to assess whether the income relationship can be causally interpreted for <b>functional</b> <b>capability</b> and physical activity. The results show that it cannot be rejected that the income effects are causal, although care should be taken when interpreting results. We finally address our findings in the light of current and future changes regarding the size and economic well-being of the elderly population. Copyright Springer 2005...|$|R
