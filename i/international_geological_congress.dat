2500|$|Gardner {{served as}} a United States {{delegate}} to the 1926 <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Congress</b> in Madrid, Spain and to the 1937 Congress in Moscow. During World War II, {{as a member of}} the Military Geology Unit, she became the leader of a group known as [...] "The Dungeon Gang". Within this group she helped to prepare plans for the armed forces, organized texts, shared ideas, and created maps. Gardner was an incredibly hard worker and because of this she was well respected by all who worked with her. [...] Over the course of the war, she helped find the Japanese beaches used to launch incendiary balloon bombs, where they were being launched by identifying shell fragments in the sand-filled ballast of the balloons. After the war she toured Japan, encouraging Japanese scientists to continue their work. Gardner not only encouraged scientists, she also encouraged artists, for she showed interest in Art. Her versatility lead her to being a charter member of the Arts club in Washington.|$|E

Her work on deciphering chemical data for granite rocks led her to collect and correspond information with geologists from all around the world. The multiple associations with which she worked include the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Washington Academy of Sciences, the Geological Society of London, the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, and the Mineralogical Association of Canada. She also worked as a delegate of the <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Congresses</b> for their 19th, 20th, 23rd, and 24th meetings.

50|$|Numerous honours came Kitson's way in {{recognition}} of his work. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1918 and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1922. In 1927 Kitson was knighted (KBE) for his services to geology. The Geological Society of London elected him as a fellow in 1897, awarded him the Wollaston fund in 1918 before honouring him with the very prestigious Lyell Medal in 1927, an annual award given to an outstanding Earth Scientist. In 1929 he was appointed as President of the Geology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and, following his retirement, he became President of the Geologists' Association in 1934. Kitson was an official representative of the British Government at <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Congresses</b> (4 times) and at World Power Conferences (4 times). One of the Buchan Caves in Victoria Australia is named after him, as are a fossil mollusk, a fossil eucalypt and a living eucalypt. The Eucalyptus tree Eucalyptus kitsoniana (Gippsland Malee) bears his name as does the lizard Panaspis kitsoni. Kitson Avenue in Takoradi in modern-day Ghana is named in his honour as is Kitson Court in Benalla, Victoria, Australia and Kitson Place in the Florey suburb of Canberra, Australia.|$|R
