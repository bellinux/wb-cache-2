5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, <b>Jesus</b> (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in <b>Jesus</b> (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions <b>Jesus</b> by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that <b>Jesus</b> was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of <b>Jesus,</b> he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, <b>Jesus</b> is considered a Muslim.|$|E
5|$|According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas Iscariot was {{a disciple}} of <b>Jesus.</b> Before the Last Supper, Judas {{went to the}} chief priests and agreed to hand over <b>Jesus</b> in {{exchange}} for 30 silver coins. <b>Jesus</b> was then arrested in Gethsemane, where Judas revealed Jesus' identity to the soldiers by giving him a kiss.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about <b>Jesus</b> over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of <b>Jesus.</b> Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for <b>Jesus</b> in their religions. <b>Jesus</b> has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
50|$|According to the Gospel of Barnabas, a 16th-century work, Barnabas {{was one of}} <b>Jesus's</b> disciples. Barnabas {{was not one of}} {{the twelve}} apostles but was one of <b>Jesus's</b> seventy disciples. The Gospel of Barnabas has been proven to be Pseudepigraphical, or a false work.|$|R
50|$|The New Finnish Interpretation {{has been}} {{challenged}} because it downplays Luther's roots in key theological developments in Western Christendom, and it characterizes Luther's teaching on Justification as based on <b>Jesus's</b> righteousness which indwells the believer rather than <b>Jesus's</b> righteousness as imputed to the believer.|$|R
50|$|Whatever {{one thinks}} {{of the number of}} <b>Jesuses</b> in antiquity, no one can {{question}} the multiplicity of <b>Jesuses</b> in Medieval Jewish polemic. Many Jews with no interest at all in history were forced to confront a historical/biographical question that bedevils historians to this day.|$|R
5|$|Around AD 30, <b>Jesus</b> and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. <b>Jesus</b> caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. <b>Jesus</b> had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what <b>Jesus</b> intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. <b>Jesus</b> probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that <b>Jesus</b> was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe <b>Jesus</b> enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that <b>Jesus</b> will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of <b>Jesus</b> in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship <b>Jesus</b> as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|Christians revere {{not only}} <b>Jesus</b> himself, {{but also his}} name. Devotions to the Holy Name of <b>Jesus</b> {{go back to the}} {{earliest}} days of Christianity. These devotions and feasts exist in both Eastern and Western Christianity.|$|E

50|$|Luke 6 is {{the sixth}} {{chapter of the}} Gospel of Luke in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. <b>Jesus's</b> {{teaching}} about the Sabbath enrages the religious authorities and deepens their conflict. The recruitment of Jesus' first disciples is completed and followed by a sermon where key aspects of <b>Jesus's</b> teaching is presented.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{arguments}} {{put forward}} by authors who have questioned {{the existence of a}} historical <b>Jesus,</b> there remains a strong consensus in historical-critical biblical scholarship that a historical <b>Jesus</b> did live in that area and in that time period.|$|E

5|$|In John (18:1–11), <b>Jesus</b> {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, <b>Jesus</b> proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and <b>Jesus</b> rebukes him for it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the chapter}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Pain of Separation and Autonomy," [...] Miller examined the authoritarian (e.g.: Old Testament, Papist, Calvinist) interpretation of Judeo-Christian theism and its parallels to modern parenting practice, asserting {{that it was}} <b>Jesus's</b> father Joseph who should be credited with <b>Jesus's</b> departure from the dogmatic Judaism of his time.|$|R

5|$|In John's gospel, <b>Jesus</b> and {{his disciples}} go to Judea early in Jesus' {{ministry}} before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The <b>Jesus</b> Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information. According to the biblical historians at the <b>Jesus</b> Seminar, John likely had a larger {{presence in the}} public mind than <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Synoptics, <b>Jesus</b> and {{his disciples}} {{go to the}} garden Gethsemane, where <b>Jesus</b> prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses <b>Jesus</b> to {{identify}} him to the crowd, which then arrests <b>Jesus.</b> In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of <b>Jesus</b> uses a sword {{to cut off the}} ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing <b>Jesus.</b> After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jesus</b> is {{considered}} {{the first person to}} receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit descended on <b>Jesus</b> during his baptism and anointed him with power.

5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} <b>Jesus</b> was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of <b>Jesus</b> and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that <b>Jesus</b> was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of <b>Jesus,</b> according to which <b>Jesus</b> was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} <b>Jesus</b> was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed <b>Jesus</b> as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with <b>Jesus</b> both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that <b>Jesus</b> is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of <b>Jesus</b> Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that <b>Jesus</b> actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of <b>Jesus</b> that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that <b>Jesus</b> was a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the <b>Jesus</b> described in the gospels and the <b>Jesus</b> of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical <b>Jesus</b> have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of <b>Jesus,</b> and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of <b>Jesus</b> constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of <b>Jesus</b> are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that <b>Jesus</b> was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of <b>Jesus</b> became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that <b>Jesus</b> was a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E
5|$|The mural {{painted on}} {{the dome of the}} apse (pictured right) depicts <b>Jesus</b> seated on a cloud, red and golden rays {{radiating}} out of his golden halo. God the Father, pictured as a white-bearded man with triangular halo, looks down from a cloud above <b>Jesus.</b> A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above <b>Jesus</b> fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud as <b>Jesus,</b> three angels flank on each side. Slightly below <b>Jesus,</b> Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.|$|E
