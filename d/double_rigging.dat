40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general feasibility study on <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> versus single rigged trawls. This study used model experimental nets {{tested in a}} circulating water tank. Three kinds of trawls were tested, i. e. the Mexican semi ballon <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> shrimp trawl designed by Nichimo (hereafter called net A), the traditional two seam single rigged Malaysian shrimp trawl (net B) and the four seam trawl modified from the above Malaysian trawl (net C). The head rope length of net A is about half that of net B and net C. Primary objectives are to determine physical characteristics, working performance and to estimate the main engine output necessary to pull these nets. To provide a <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> shrimp trawl in the Malaysian shrimp fisheries, results of experiments are summarised as follows: 1) At 2 knots, which is a normal towing speed of a Malaysian shrimp trawler, net mouth height of net A is 1. 2 meter, net B is 2 meter and net C is 1. 8 meter. In accordance to the behaviour of shrimp, these net mouth height are sufficient. 2) In order to ensure {{the security of the}} catch, the most efficient average mesh opening was determined to be five vertical cross-sections. The mesh opening is bigger at the square panel and becomes smaller towards the cod end. The opening is about 3 centimeter for 5. 7 centimeter mesh size. 3) The wing tip spread of net A is 11 meter, which is 80 % of its head rope length. Net B is 14 meter (55 %) and net C is 14. 4 meter (60 %). 4) The working performance of a shrimp trawl is determined by its sweeping area. The obtained experimental equations of the sweeping area of the three net are slimplified as follows: 2 net A: A's= 2. 18 Vnet B: A"s= 1. 57 Vnet C: A‴s= 1. 58 V 5) The estimation of suitable main engine output necessary to pull the net is calculated from the conversion of total gear drag force values to horse power values. Equations of the above power of the three nets are: 2 net A: EHP'= 12. 19 V^ net B: EHP"= 11. 01 V^ net C: EHP‴= 10. 89 V< 2. 61...|$|R

50|$|The Goodnight western sidesaddle {{that was}} {{developed}} in the 1870s by Charles Goodnight for his wife was a <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> design. Goodnight developed this sidesaddle because there was a need to produce a woman's saddle for daily riding and work on the range. The saddle also had to fit a variety of horses on a day-to-day basis. it required two cinches. The cinches have a connecting strap, called a cinch hobble, to keep the rear girth from slipping back, which would cause the horse to buck. The girthing system still produced a shimmy in the rear, even though the rear cinch was brought up snugly against the horse. The double girthing system was not as secure as the balance strap seen on many modern sidesaddles.|$|R

The net model was constructed in accordance with Dr. Tauti's similarity-law of fishing gear. The measurements were carried out both on the shapes and on the resistances in seven stages of towing velocity (V). For the convenience of discussions, the experimental values were converted into full scale values. Results were obtained as in the following: 1) Under the consideration of the physical characteristics of the gear efficiency, we have some parameters obtained as net mouth height (H), net mouth area (A), and wing tip distance (W). The above parameters are represented as in the following: H= 2. 7 V^ A= 0. 016 V^ W= 2 V+ 10. 6 In the discussions of shrimp trawl gear efficiency, it is better for us to use the sweep area parameter of the gear (S_A), than to use the filtering volume (F_v).

This provides, greater challenge by way of financial investment, provision of infrastructure facilities, introduction {{of different types of}} large deep sea vessels, modern fishing gear and use of modern technologies in fish handling, processing, storage and marketing. Great strides have been made in increasing marine fish production of India from 0 - 53 million tonnes In 1951 to 1. 81 million tonnes in 1984. This has been possible by application of various technologies including fishing technology. The introduction of bottom trawls, purse seines, high opening trawls In selected areas, <b>double</b> <b>rig</b> shrimp trawls from deep sea fleet, etc has made significant impact on tha marina fish production- Introduction of synthetic twines contributed to the increase of efficiency of gear like gill nets and trawls.

40|$|In Brazil, an {{industrial}} trawling fishery directed to Euvola ziczac started in 1973 and collapsed after 1980, when scallop landings reached 8, 800 t. Since 1995 E. ziczac landings have not surpassed {{a few hundred}} kilograms. Based on surveys carried out in 1974 - 1975 and in 1995 - 1996, this work assesses temporal changes occurred in scallop distribution and relative abundance patterns and analyzes the current stock situation under the present management regimes applied to the local demersal trawling fishery. In the 1970 ’s E. ziczac was concentrated in a main bed extending from southern São Paulo to northern Santa Catarina States and between 30 and 50 m depth. This pattern changed dramatically during the 1990 ’s, when only two very small and low-density concentrations {{were found in the}} region. Cumulative effects of reducing areas and density within the remnant concentrations produced a reduction in the stock biomass of 98 %. Management of the local <b>double</b> <b>rig</b> trawler fishery has always focused on its first main target, the shrimps Farfantepenaeus paulensis and F. brasiliensis. Additional measures have not been implemented, even after substantial part of the fleet has directed its effort to alternative shelf and slope resources. The collapse of the Brazilian scallop fishery provides a striking example of irreversible damage caused by uncontrolled fishing redirection allocated to other resources, demonstrating the need of changes in the Brazilian demersal fishery management model.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{rational}} viscous Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology applied to sailing yacht rig aerodynamic design and analysis. After an outlook of present challenges in high speed sailing we emphasized the necessity of innovation and Computational Fluid Dynamics to think, validate and optimize new aero-hydrodynamic concepts. Then we present our CFD methodology through CAD, mesh generation, numerical and physical modelling choices and their validation on typical rig configurations through wind-tunnel tests comparisons. The methodology defined, we illustrate the relevance and wide potential of advanced numerical tools to investigate sailing yacht rig design questions like the relation between sail camber, propulsive force and aerodynamic finesse, and like the mast-mainsail non linear interaction. Through these examples, it is shown how sailing yacht rig improvements may be drawn by using viscous CFD (RANS). Then the extensive use of viscous CFD based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations rather than wind-tunnel tests on scaled models for the evaluation or ranking of improved design open the door to time saving. The last part illustrates on a preliminary study of the Y. Parlier Hydraplaneur <b>double</b> <b>rig</b> how the proposed CFD methodology may be applied to this complex largely unknown rig. We show how it is possible to increase our understanding of his flow physics with strong sails interactions and we hope this will open new roads toward optimized design. Along the paper, the necessary mutual comparison presented between CFD and wind-tunnel test will be also the occasion to focus on limitations and drawbacks of viscous CFD tools to discuss them and address their future improvements...|$|R
40|$|A distribuição espaço-temporal, a estrutura populacional e a biologia reprodutiva de Callinectes ornatus foram analisadas na enseada da Fortaleza, município de Ubatuba – SP. As coletas foram {{realizadas}} mensalmente, entre janeiro e dezembro de 2009, em sete transectos localizados no interior da enseada, com auxilio de um barco de pesca camaroeiro equipado com redes do tipo <b>double</b> <b>rig.</b> Foram capturados 921 indivíduos, distribuídos em 570 imaturos, 247 machos adultos, 63 fêmeas adultas não ovígeras e 41 fêmeas ovígeras. Observa-se um nítido padrão de variação temporal da abundância, relacionado positivamente com as variações de temperatura da água. A distribuição espacial também é variável com maiores capturas no transecto II. Indivíduos imaturos predominam nos transectos mais internos e mais próximos da influência estuarina. Indivíduos adultos predominam nos transectos centrais e mais próximos à boca da enseada e fêmeas ovígeras são mais abundantes nos transectos interpretados como sendo aqueles que facilitariam a dispersão das larvas em direção ao mar aberto (transectos I e II). Machos são maiores que as fêmeas e os valores de LC 50 foram 52, 2 mm de e 48, 1 mm de, respectivamente. A proporção sexual varia espacialmente com predomínio de fêmeas apenas no transecto I e também varia em função dos grupos demográficos sendo que entre os jovens a proporção observada não difere de 1 : 1, ao passo que entre os adultos predominam os machos. Isso sugere que as desproporções entre os sexos se processem após a maturidade e possam estar relacionadas aos padrões de deslocamento diferencial de machos e fêmeas durante as atividades reprodutivas.

The spatial-temporal distribution, population structure, {{and reproductive}} biology of Callinectes ornatus were analyzed at the inlet of Fortaleza, Ubatuba - SP. Samples were collected monthly from January to December 2009, in seven transects within the bay, {{with the aid}} of a shrimp fishing boat equipped with nets of <b>double</b> <b>rig</b> type. It was captured 921 individuals distributed in 570 immature, 247 adult males, 63 females and 41 adult non-ovigerous females. There is a clear pattern of temporal variation in abundance, positively related to changes in water temperature. The spatial distribution is also variable with the greatest catches in transect II. Immature individuals predominate in transects that are innermost and closer to estuarine influence. Adults individuals predominate in transects central and closer to the mouth of the cove, and ovigerous females are more abundant in transects interpreted as those that facilitate the dispersal of larvae toward open ocean (transects I and II). Males are larger than females and the LC 50 values were 52. 2 mm CW and 48. 1 mm CW, respectively. The sex ratio varies spatially with predominance of females only in transect I, and also varies for different demographic groups. Amongst young individuals, the proportion does not differ from the observed ratio of 1 : 1, while males predominate among adults. This suggests that the imbalance between the sexes is conducted after maturity, and might be related to differential displacement patterns of males and females during reproductive activities. It was not possible to ascertain a continuous reproduction pattern for the species, as suggested in the literature available, and the reproductive peak observed coincides with the peak of fishing activity during the summer. These facts might be related to intense [...] . (Complete abstract click electronic access below...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{velocity}} feedback {{system for the}} reduction of sound radiated by a simplified aircraft double panel is analysed experimentally. The <b>double</b> panel <b>rig</b> consists of a thin aluminium panel and a honeycomb trim panel, coupled acoustically by the air cavity between them and structurally by four elastic mounts. Nine small-scale electromagnetic actuators are mounted in the cavity such that they can react against the two panels. A pair of velocity sensors is added at the two actuator-panel junction points. The two velocity signals are first asymmetrically weighted and then subtracted to form the error signal. Finally, the error signal is fed back to the actuator via a constant amplification gain. In this way the control loops produce a combination of relative and sky-hook active damping, which tends to reduce the response and sound radiation of the double panel at low resonance frequencies. The stability and performance of the control system are analyzed experimentally {{as a function of}} the weighting factor. Reductions between 10 and 25 dB in the radiated sound power have been measured at low frequency resonances of the double panel. status: accepte...|$|R

The purpose of the Phase 2 Program was to further develop the two most promising concepts identified in the Phase 1 Program, the double annular combustor and the radial/axial staged combustor, and to design a combustor and breadboard fuel splitter control for CF 6 - 50 engine demonstration testing in the Phase 3 Program. Noise measurement and alternate fuels addendums to the basic program were conducted to obtain additional experimental data. Twenty-one full annular and fifty-two sector combustor configurations were evaluated. Both combustor types demonstrated the capability for significantly reducing pollutant emission levels. The most promising results were obtained with the <b>double</b> annular combustor. <b>Rig</b> test results corrected to CF- 50 C engine conditions produced EPA emission parameters for CO, HC, and NOX of 3. 4, 0. 4, and 4. 5 respectively.
