Findings were that in this case, portfolios were an im-portant mechanism through which teachers came to a deeper understanding of their professional practices. Teachers began to recognize changes in classroom practice and schoolwide responsibilities and to identify organizational structures and professional development opportunities necessary for the inquiry and reform process.
