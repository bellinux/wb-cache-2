5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called for just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> idea of a march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The idea of a march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of}} the Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers {{prefer to}} bite the throat and use their {{powerful}} forelimbs to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton {{have been killed by}} tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them.|$|E

5|$|In reply, Australia were {{in trouble}} at 7/208 when Johnston came to the crease to join Lindwall, with five more runs needed to avoid the follow on. As Sid Barnes was unable to bat due to injury, Australia were {{effectively}} eight wickets down. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Dick Pollard {{in the direction of}} Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball at full stretch in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Jack Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Johnston was out for three as Australia ended with 221 to narrowly avoid the follow on by eight runs. He was wicketless in the second innings, taking 0/34 as England declared at 3/174 and set Australia 317 for victory on the last day after the fourth day was completely washed out by rain. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 1/92, after many rain interruptions.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrives at}} a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the {{apparent}} leader. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark. The party battles Nene, but are easily defeated. They are {{thrown out of the}} base and start to fall to their deaths, but a beam of light from the base catches them, and brings them back to the base. The party find three small floating spheres {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres. The party refuses, and instead <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> spheres for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E

25|$|Plant-based paste {{tends to}} dry {{more quickly than}} silk-based pastes because the plant extract does not <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> oil as tightly as silk. Depending on the paper used, plant pastes can dry in 10 to 15 minutes. The more {{absorbent}} the paper is, the faster it dries as the paper absorbs most of the oil. Also, plant pastes tend to smudge more easily than silk pastes due to the loose binding agent.|$|E
25|$|With daybreak on 21 November, it was {{discovered}} that the crest of the ridge was a Japanese outpost position, used during the day as an observation post and abandoned at night. Approaching Japanese soldiers who were preparing to take up positions were fired upon and they withdrew and fled down the hill. The enemy having regrouped and having been reinforced launched numerous attacks against Cibik's platoon, which itself had been reinforced by more machine guns and mortars, and was able to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> crest despite fanatical attempts by the Japanese to reoccupy the position.|$|E
25|$|Another {{meeting was}} held on 27 April, {{attended}} by Clemenceau, Foch, Milner, Wilson and Haig. Wilson pressed Foch on whether the priority was to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Channel Ports or to keep the British and French armies united. Foch indicated that the latter was the priority. British IX Corps {{was moved to the}} French sector. By the end of April Haig claimed to notice a slackening of enemy fighting spirit and on 30 April Ludendorff called a halt to the Flanders offensive, although he hoped to attack the British in Flanders again {{at some point in the}} future.|$|E

25|$|Between 1984 and 1986, {{military}} intelligence (G-2) maintained an operations {{center for the}} counterinsurgency programs in southwest Guatemala at the southern airbase at Retalhuleu. There, the G-2 operated a clandestine interrogation center for suspected insurgents and collaborators. Captured suspects were reportedly detained in water-filled pits along {{the perimeter of the}} base, which were covered with cages. In order to avoid drowning, prisoners were forced to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> cages over the pits. The bodies of prisoners tortured to death and live prisoners marked for disappearance were thrown out of IAI-201 Aravas by the Guatemalan Air Force over the Pacific Ocean ("death flights").|$|E
25|$|Five {{months after}} losing the HoPWF belts, they beat NWL Tag Team Champions The Goodfellos (Shorty Smalls & Deuce Donnatelli) for the titles in Waynesboro on September 10. When Scott Vaughn was unable to appear for a show in Hagerstown three days later, the titles were awarded to Shorty Smalls & Doken. However, they quickly regained the titles within the week. They would <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> titles until November 19, 2005, when they were {{defeated}} by then HoPWF Tag Team Champions The Goodfellos in a 3 Way Dance with John Rambo & Headshrinker Samu in Newville.|$|E
25|$|One common {{group of}} people that have visual memory {{problems}} are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities are caused by failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show {{it is more likely that}} it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word. This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was found that children with reading disabilities had comparable visual memory to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the visual memory system has been found to cause reading disabilities.|$|E

25|$|Cephalopods, as {{the name}} implies, have muscular {{appendages}} extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In coleoids they number eight or ten. Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed tentacles, are actively involved in capturing prey; they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds). In giant squid they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club. The shorter four pairs are termed arms, and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism. They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth; these help to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> prey. Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, {{as the name}} suggests, though developmental abnormalities can modify the number of arms expressed.|$|E
25|$|In {{both males}} and females the legs are short and sturdy, with an {{enlarged}} tarsomere on the first pair, containing the silk-producing glands. The abdomen has ten segments, with a pair of cerci on the final segment. These cerci are highly sensitive to touch, and allow the animal to navigate while moving backwards through the gallery tunnels, which are too narrow to allow the insect to turn round. Because morphology is so similar between species, it makes species identification extremely difficult. For this reason, the main form of taxonomic identification used in the past has been close observation of distinctive copulatory structures of males, (although this method is now thought by some entomologists and taxonomists as giving insufficient classification detail). Although males never eat during their adult stage, they do have mouthparts similar to the females. These mouthparts are used to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> female during copulation.|$|E
25|$|Missouri amassed 418total {{yards to}} Oklahoma's 384. 361 of those Missouri yards game {{through the air}} {{compared}} to Oklahoma's 266. Both teams averaged 7.4yards per pass attempt. The Sooners managed 118yards on the ground while they held the Tigers to just 57. Both teams struggled to <b>hold</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ball. Oklahoma finished with two turnovers, both from Juaquin Iglesias, while Missouri had four, one fumble and three interceptions. Bradford finished the game completing 24 of his 34 passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Chris Brown led the team {{on the ground with}} 67rushing yards, 5.2yards per attempt and three touchdowns. Lofton was named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week for his performance in the game which included one fumble recovery returned for a touchdown, seven solo tackles and eleven assisted tackles. It was the third time an Oklahoma defensive player had received the award in seven weeks.|$|E
