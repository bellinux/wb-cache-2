30|$|Another {{categorisation}} {{within the}} field of entrepreneurship is the theory of Dynamic Capitalism put forward by Bruce A. Kirchhoff. In his 1994 book, he argues that firm growth and the firm innovation rate will determine the extent of the creative destruction effect the <b>firm</b> <b>has</b> on the economy as a whole. Kirchhoff distinguishes four categories of firms contributing differently {{to the development of a}} capitalist economy. Economic Core <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> a low growth rate and a low innovation rate, while Ambitious <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> a high growth rate and a low innovation rate. Constrained Growth <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> a high innovation rate and a low business growth rate and, finally, Glamorous <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> a high business innovation rate and a high business growth rate.|$|R
40|$|Comparing the {{financial}} characteristics of firms {{in different countries}} and different regions has been a popular research topic in finance. However, NAFTA and Latin American manufacturing <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> never been compared. In this paper, we undertake such a study with the MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) method and with data drawn from the Research Insight/Global Vintage database in October 2015. Our findings indicate that NAFTA manufacturing <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> less liquidity risk, but more financial risk, compared with Latin American Manufacturing firms. NAFTA manufacturing <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> significantly higher returns on equity due to achieving higher returns on assets and using more financial leverage. Latin American manufacturing <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> more efficient inventory management.

5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the <b>Firm</b> <b>had</b> moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 Ian Davis, {{the head}} of the London, UK office, was elected to the {{position}} of managing director. Davis promised a return to the company’s core values, after a period in which the <b>firm</b> <b>had</b> expanded rapidly, which some McKinsey consultants felt was a departure from the company's heritage. Also in 2003, the firm established a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, China. By 2004, more than 60 percent of McKinsey's revenues were generated outside the U.S. The company started a Social Sector Office (SSO) in 2008, which is divided into three practices: Global Public Health, Economic Development and Opportunity Creation (EDHOC) and Philanthropy. McKinsey does much of its pro-bono work through the SSO, whereas a Business Technology Office (BTO), founded in 1997, provides consulting on technology strategy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} dual sourcing (e. g., outside options) in vertical and horizontal relations. In a bilateral monopoly market, if either the upstream or downstream <b>firm</b> <b>has</b> outside options, the other firm could lose from seemingly positive shocks, e. g., market expansion or technology improvements. We extend this setting to a bilateral duopoly market in which each downstream <b>firm</b> <b>has</b> outside options and upstream firms can engage in cost reducing investments and generate technological spillovers. We find that each upstream <b>firm</b> <b>has</b> an incentive to voluntarily generate technological spillovers to its upstream rival if the downstream <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> better outside options...|$|R

The company also assisted in comprehensive infrastructure renovations, restored a dependable supply of electricity, revamped the baggage handling facilities as well as the arrival and departure lounges, put into place electronic check-in systems, and firmed up on security and work-flow. Additionally, SKA connected the grounds' Somali Civil Aviation and Meteorological Agency (SCAMA) and immigration, customs, commercial airlines and Somali Police Force officials to the internet.

5|$|Scientific Atlanta's first {{business}} {{focus was}} antennas for military and industrial use. Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. When {{they could not}} afford an automatic antenna pattern recorder, of which there was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within six months of the development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the <b>firm</b> <b>had</b> captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25 acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees on the payroll including 40 engineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the <b>firm</b> <b>had</b> to {{cut back}} operations, because {{news coverage of the}} Persian Gulf War drew viewers away from infomercials. Ron Perelman of Forbes Holdings Inc. bought a 37.5 percent share of Guthy-Renker in 1993 in exchange for $25 million and priority access to air-time on Perelman's television stations. At the time, Guthy-Renker had grown to $60 million in revenue. In 1996, Perelman's stake in the company was resold to News Corp and Guthy-Renker bought it back. Two years later, Goldman Sachs bought a stake in the company that valued Guthy-Renker at $3 billion, and a Japanese trading company, Nissho Iwai Group, bought a 17 percent portion of Guthy-Renker's Asia subsidiary for $9 million. Guthy-Renker created a television station for infomercials called GRTV in 1996, which was sold to TVN Entertainment Corporation in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott. A {{number of}} foreign players were signed, {{including}} Dutch internationals Theo Snelders and Hans Gillhaus. In the 1989–90 season, the club won both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994–95 season second-bottom, and {{had to rely on}} a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt {{for the first time in}} its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose <b>firm</b> <b>had</b> built the stand, to bring business acumen to the running of the club.|$|E

5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed {{that there was nothing}} in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the <b>firm</b> <b>had</b> charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} public {{corruption}} scandal of Daley's tenure as mayor involved {{the circumstances of}} the resignation of his City Council floor leader, Alderman Patrick Huels, in October 1997. Daley, Huels, and another close friend Michael Tadin grew up within two blocks on S. Emerald Avenue in Bridgeport. Huels attended De La Salle Institute, the same high school attended by Daley, his father, and Michael Bilandic. Huels worked for the city's Public Works Department as a laborer and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor Richard J. Daley died, 11th Ward Alderman Bilandic was named acting mayor, and Huels, then 26, replaced Bilandic as alderman. Huels chaired the Council's Transportation Committee and became Mayor Richard M. Daley's floor leader. In the summer of 2007, in reaction to ongoing indictments and convictions of aldermen, Daley and Huels shepherded a package of ethics reforms through city council. Huels owned a security firm, SDI Security, Inc. along with his wife and his brother, a Chicago police lieutenant. In the mid-1990s, the <b>firm</b> <b>had</b> about 390 full-time employees and was grossing $7 million a year. Huels was president and a director, and Council Finance Committee Chairman Alderman Edward M. Burke (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971 in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on SDI for $326,951 and in June 1996 for $997,382 for failing to pay payroll taxes, including money withheld from its employees' pay checks.|$|E
