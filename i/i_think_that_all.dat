25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
2500|$|Foreign {{minister}} said [...] "this is a disproportionate {{response to what}} has happened and if both sides are going to drive each other into a tight corner then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> this will develop in a very dramatic and tragic way." [...] He added: [...] "We firmly reaffirm support for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity." ...|$|E
2500|$|And now it {{is clear}} for me, that this prophecy should be fulfilled, but not during my life. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> of us, Orthodox bishops, who were born and came to America from the old countries, like me, and now control the {{jurisdictional}} eparchies, must die. The Holy Orthodox Church needs new generations of Americans to come after us, who shall fulfill the Lord's instructions [...] and [...] prophecy. [...] Because [...] now, [...] as [...] Fr. Vladimir Berzonsky writes: [...] "Spiritually we are still drinking mother's milk, not yet ready for loftier and deeper experiences of the life reaching out to us from Christ and present through the Holy Spirit within our hearts." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hulton nodded. [...] "I guess that's {{the best}} thing. When {{you have got}} her started, come {{and see what we}} want. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> in the meantime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jim. [...] "In a way, I don't care if I'm nice or not. The bannock {{is first}} grade; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> matters. If you don't mind, I'll take another bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ellams nodded. [...] "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was, so to speak, a {{personal}} thing. For <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> our trade got slack {{and has not}} since touched the mark it reached in your uncle's time. Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all,</b> and perhaps <b>I</b> have talked too much." ...|$|R
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{only meant}} {{that there were}} {{difficulties}};--difficulties which {{will have to be}} got over. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> difficulties are got over when a man looks at them steadily." ...|$|E
5000|$|Everett True of Melody Maker {{magazine}} {{gave the}} EP an enthusiastic and unconventional review, stating, [...] "THIS one kicks some serious ass. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> {{you need to}} know." [...] The record has remained popular with fans of the band's later work due to it being stylistically similar to La Sexorcisto.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll moor the hulk {{alongside}} and rig {{the diving}} pumps. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> to-day," [...] Brown remarked. [...] "When {{the sun is}} low I'll go to the factory up the creek and try to hire some native boys. On this coast, a white man who does heavy work soon gets fever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And that's {{the whole}} story, my friends. After Jane's death you {{offered me a}} home--the best you had to give--and I {{accepted}} it. I {{had to come to}} New York anyway, you know, for Isham, Marvin & Co. have been my bankers for years, and there was considerable business to transact with them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all,</b> isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Iden. (aside). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> {{the world}} are grown anonymous, [...] Since no one cares {{to tell me what}} he's called! [...] Pray, has his Excellency a large suite? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> will hate me,--here and hereafter--except you. Lucius will hate me, and {{how shall}} I bear that? Oh, Mrs. Orme, I wish he knew it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must see}} Miss Grey before I leave England. We have corresponded, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> will be well. She must {{come out with}} me. I don't think I could go without her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tommie has the temper of {{an angel}} with the people he likes," [...] she said. [...] "When he bites, it {{generally}} means that he objects to strangers. He loves my Lady, and he loves Mr. Moody, and he loves me, and--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all.</b> This way, sir, if you please, I am sure I heard my Lady call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm glad you're pleased!' exclaimed his wife. 'I {{thought you}} would be; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all,</b> and so no more at present from yours and cetrer, C. Britain. Ha ha ha! There! Take all the papers, and lock 'em up. Oh! Wait a minute. Here's a printed bill to stick on the wall. Wet from the printer's. How nice it smells!' ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> with <b>all</b> the Navy activities, BUNAV {{might find}} {{something}} that colored enlistees could do {{in addition to the}} rating of messman.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Sybil's doings," [...] Lady Caroom answered. [...] "She {{declared}} {{that she was}} dull, {{and that she had}} never seen A /Message from Mars./ <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> that serious talk the other evening gave her the blues." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] I answered; [...] "only then I am sure I {{should have}} been dead to-day, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> who {{have to do with}} her will be ere long. And now, Umbezi, I wish you a good breakfast." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> this courteous lying is a {{sweet and}} loving art, {{and should be}} cultivated. The highest {{perfection}} of politeness is only a beautiful edifice, built, from the base to the dome, of graceful and gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{underlying}} <b>all</b> {{these comments}} of Mr. Ruskin on the Lord's Prayer {{is a failure}} to recognize the truth of man's fall.|$|R
5000|$|Ross is an [...] "out" [...] gay man. [...] He explains, [...] "As {{for being}} [...] "out," [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> {{a part of}} being {{comfortable}} with {{who you are and}} that ultimately helps you in all aspects of life. It's not always easy to get to that point though, which is why a supportive community always helps as well as knowing that others have taken that path (with success) before you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Part of this,' {{said the}} girl, 'I have drawn out {{from other people}} at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can give you to know him by. Stay though,' she added. 'Upon his throat: so high {{that you can see}} a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{bad enough}} sometimes. But never mind. You {{remember}} that Roman wisdom,--'Dabit Deus his quoque finem.' And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> things are bearable if a man will only {{make up his mind}} to bear them. Do not tell any one that I have complained." ...|$|E
60|$|Do not {{let your}} brow be clouded {{when you read}} this. I could kill myself if I thought I could {{increase}} your difficulties. I love you; God knows how I love you. I will be patient; and yet, my Ferdinand, I feel wretched when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> is concealed from papa, and my lips are sealed until you give me permission to open them.|$|E
60|$|Dean of St. Paul's. In short, {{a modern}} Pompeian Gallery?--Yes; I {{know how much}} greater extent that {{involves}}, but I think that you should include all the iron work, and china, and pottery, and so on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> works in metal, all works in clay, all works in carved wood, should be included. Of course, that involves much. It involves all the coins--it involves an immense extent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate beauties. My niece, Lizzie Eustace, is a beauty; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> of <b>all</b> the heartless {{creatures in}} the world, {{she is the}} most heartless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't {{forgotten}} that you're a fire-eater," [...] said Jolly slowly, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> about <b>all</b> you are; {{or that you}} called me a pro-Boer." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked by}} Noisey in 2014 {{if he ever}} felt bitter {{for a lack of}} recognition, singer Kyle Bishop stated, [...] "There’s a lot of accolades that people give us for {{supposedly}} starting something and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>all</b> bullshit to be honest with you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there’s a billion bands that were doing similar things before us and after that that deserve just as much credit. And if we do get some credit by certain people, awesome. If we don't, it doesn’t really matter because <b>I</b> really don’t <b>think</b> it’s true anyways." ...|$|R
60|$|It may be but an idle whim, but it {{has always}} seemed to me, that the {{extraordinary}} vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so common to such whales; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} you will laugh at me, Henry," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps you will be angry. However, one must amuse oneself. Frankly, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> this talk {{that is going on}} about occultism, and being able to read the future, and to find new laws for the {{government}} of the will, has perhaps turned my brain a little. Anyhow, I went to one of those Bond Street people, and asked them a few questions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{poor little}} {{innocent}} thing {{had no chance}} for its life--we were short of even bare necessities, for Tom could pick up only a few dollars now and then--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> that was good in me died with it. So when he found work watching the heater of a store a few hours each night, and the wages would not keep two, I {{had to go out}} and earn my bread here--and I sometimes wish I had never been born." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{best thing}} for a kid is encouragement. My mother always got me art {{supplies}} and encouraged me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was <b>all</b> it took. -Ryan Singer, 2009 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is far {{too much}} frightened and overcome. She says you may go to her father, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is <b>all</b> you can expect her to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I don't {{ask you if}} you decline the appointment, {{because we}} are certain in time of war you will not do so, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all,</b> except <b>that</b> you will be {{accredited}} ostensibly to the staff of the General in command in East Africa, and also receive private instructions, of which the General and the local Governments will have copies. Now, do you understand everything, especially that your powers will be very wide and that you will have to act largely on your own discretion?" ...|$|R
