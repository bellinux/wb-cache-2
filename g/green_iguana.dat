25|$|Although hunting, trapping, {{and killing}} of these iguanas is illegal {{throughout}} Mexico; the Balsas depression along {{the borders of}} the states Michoacán and Guerrero {{is one of the largest}} illegal hunting and trading areas. The remoteness of the areas and lack of enforcement of the laws is seen as the main reason. A study is being conducted by the Instituto de Biologia, UNAM, to solve the over-exploitation problem and to determine if the iguanas can be successfully farmed as a food source similar to the <b>Green</b> <b>Iguana</b> and the closely related Ctenosaura similis.|$|E
25|$|The land fauna is characterised by the {{presence}} of numerous ground iguanas. On this small territory live the <b>green</b> <b>iguana</b> of South America (the heraldic symbol of the municipality of Terre-de-Haut) and the endemic species of the Antilles, Iguana delicatissima, which is threatened by the appearance of a hybrid stemming from the reproduction between the both species. Other reptiles live with these prehistoric saurians: the Terre-de-Haut racer (Alsophis sanctonum sanctonum), Terre-de-Bas racer (Alsophis sanctonum danforthi), Les Saintes anole (Anolis terraealtae - strictly endemic to the archipelago), and lot of species of anoles. To be found throughout the hill are agoutis (Dasyprocta noblei), rodents of South America and the Caribbean; goats which populate woods and the edges of beaches; and, well hidden, some species of stick insects (praying mantises).|$|E
25|$|In April 2005, Cartoon Network debuted Krypto {{in his own}} series Krypto the Superdog, with Krypto {{voiced by}} Samuel Vincent. The series sees him team with fellow animal superheroes Streaky the Supercat, the Dog Star Patrol, and Ace the Bat-Hound. In this series, Krypto lives with a young boy named Kevin in a Metropolis suburb, and fights crime against various foes, {{including}} a space cyborg feline named Mechanikat and his feline agents (including his sidekick, the evil genius alien kitten Snooky Wookums), the Joker's pet hyenas Bud and Lou, the Penguin's trained birds (Artie the Puffin, Griff the Vulture, Waddles the Penguin), Catwoman's cat Isis, and Lex Luthor's pet <b>green</b> <b>iguana</b> Ignatius. This version of Krypto shares {{the origin of the}} original comic book version of Krypto, having been launched by Jor-El from Krypton in a similar turn of events, but he did not arrive till after Superman was already grown. Otherwise, the show is an original interpretation created just for this series, and is not based on any of the previous comic book versions. A noticeable change from the original is that this Krypto can talk, as can all of his other animal friends and enemies, and can be understood by his boy caretaker, Kevin, through the use of an ear-implanted translator. In this continuity, Superman knows full well about Krypto's existence but he decided that it was best the dog stay with Kevin, especially after realizing the existing bond between the two.|$|E
50|$|Despite their name, <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> {{can come}} in {{different}} colors. In southern countries of their range, such as Peru, <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> appear bluish in color with bold blue markings. On islands such as Bonaire, Curaçao, Aruba, and Grenada, a <b>green</b> <b>iguana's</b> color may range from green to lavender, black, and even pink. <b>Green</b> <b>iguanas</b> from the western region of Costa Rica are red and animals of the northern ranges, such as Mexico, appear orange. Juvenile <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> from El Salvador are often bright blue as babies, however they lose this color as they get older.|$|R
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>Iguanas</b> are {{primarily}} herbivores, with captives feeding on leaves such as turnip greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of upwards of 100 {{different species of}} plant. In Panama one of the <b>green</b> <b>iguana's</b> favorite foods is wild plum, Spondias mombin.|$|R
50|$|Primarily herbivorous, <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> are {{presented}} with a special problem for osmoregulation; plant matter contains more potassium and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet metabolic needs. As <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> are not capable of creating liquid urine more concentrated than their bodily fluids, like birds they excrete nitrogenous wastes as urate salts through a salt gland. As a result, <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> have developed a lateral nasal gland to supplement renal salt secretion by expelling excess potassium and sodium chloride.|$|R
500|$|Reptiles have a {{particular}} affinity for the South Florida ecosystem. Virtually all lizards appearing in the Everglades have been introduced, such as the brown anole (Anolis sagrei) and the tropical house gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia). The herbivorous <b>green</b> <b>iguana</b> (Iguana iguana) can reproduce rapidly in wilderness habitats. [...] However, [...] the reptile that has earned media attention for its size and potential to harm children and domestic pets is the Burmese python (Python bivittatus), which has spread quickly throughout the area. The python can grow up to [...] long and competes with alligators for {{the top of the}} food chain.|$|E
2500|$|There are 500 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} (94% {{of which are}} endemic). Islands are inhabited by some endemic species such as rock iguanas and American crocodile. The blue iguana, endemic to the island of Grand Cayman, is endangered. The <b>green</b> <b>iguana</b> is invasive to Grand Cayman. [...] The Mona ground iguana which inhabits the island of Mona, Puerto Rico, is endangered. The rhinoceros iguana from the island of Hispaniola which is shared between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is also endangered. The region has several types of sea turtle (loggerhead, green turtle, hawksbill, leatherback turtle, Atlantic ridley and olive ridley). Some species are threatened with extinction. Their populations have been greatly reduced since the 17th century – the number of green turtles has declined from 91million to 300,000 and hawksbill turtles from 11million to less than 30,000 by 2006.|$|E
2500|$|American {{crocodiles}} {{breed in}} late fall or early winter, engaging in drawn-out mating ceremonies in which males emit {{very low frequency}} bellows to attract females. Body size {{is more important than}} age in determining reproductive capabilities, and females reach sexual maturity at a length of about [...] In February or March, gravid females will begin to create nests of sand, mud, and dead vegetation along the water's edge. Nest location is crucial, and with the correct amount of vegetation, the eggs will develop within a small temperature range. Because sex determination is temperature-dependent in crocodilians, slight aberrations in temperature may result in all-male or all-female clutches, which would possibly harm the health of the population. About one month later, when it is time to lay, the female will dig a wide hole diagonally {{into the side of the}} nest and lay 30 to 70 eggs in it, depending on her size. After laying, the female may cover the eggs with debris or leave them uncovered. The white, elongated eggs are [...] long and [...] wide and have a number of pores in the brittle shell. During the 75- to 80-day incubation period, the parents will guard the nest, often inhabiting a hole in the bank nearby. Females especially have been known to guard their nests with ferocity. But in spite of these precautions, American crocodile eggs sometimes fall prey to raccoons (Procyon sp.) (arguably the most virulent natural predator of crocodilian nests in the Americas), coatis, foxes, skunks or other scavenging mammals (even coyotes (Canis latrans) in Mexico and American black bears (Ursus americanus)) in south Florida), as well as large predatory ants, crabs and vultures. In Panama, <b>green</b> <b>iguana</b> (Iguana iguana) were seen to dig up and prey on American crocodile eggs occasionally, although in several cases were caught by the mother American crocodile and subsequently consumed. Crocodilian eggs are somewhat brittle, but softer than bird eggs. Young of this species hatch after 75–80 days.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hurricane Luis and Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, a raft of uprooted trees carrying fifteen or more <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> landed {{on the east side}} of Anguilla - an island where <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> have never been recorded before. The new iguanas had apparently been accidentally caught on the trees and rafted two hundred miles across the ocean from Guadeloupe, where <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> are indigenous. Examination of the weather patterns and ocean currents indicated that the iguanas had probably spent three weeks at sea before arriving on Anguilla. This colony began breeding on the new island within two years of its arrival.|$|R

50|$|The common <b>Green</b> <b>Iguana,</b> (Iguana iguana), {{has been}} {{introduced}} from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the endemic blue iguana. No direct negative consequences of this introduction on the blue iguana are known, but {{the mere presence of}} the <b>Green</b> <b>Iguana</b> confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, and when they subsequently see large numbers of the introduced <b>Green</b> <b>Iguana,</b> they do not understand the difference.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} a large-core manual biopsy device (Spirotome®, Medinvents, 3500 Hasselt, Belgium) for liver sampling and histologic diagnosis in <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> (Iguana iguana). The study included eight <b>green</b> <b>iguanas,</b> and two ultrasound-guided biopsies were collected for each lizard, for 16 biopsies in total. The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia induced by intravenous injection of propofol (10 mg/kg) maintained with a mixture of 2. 0 % isoflurane and 0. 8 - 1. 2 L/min oxygen after tracheal intubation. Fourteen (87. 5 %) of the 16 biopsies were considered diagnostic. Liver biopsy quality was assessed according to sample size and tissue preservation. In particular, mean length (16. 2 ± 4. 5 mm), width (2. 2 ± 0. 5 mm), area (34. 8 ± 6. 9 mm 2), and number of portal areas (9. 4 ± 3. 9) of each biopsy were recorded for all <b>green</b> <b>iguanas.</b> The total available surface of the sections obtained from the biopsies and their grade of preservation enabled a satisfactory evaluation of the parenchymal architecture. One of the <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> in the study died the day after the procedure due to severe hemocoeloma. Risk assessment evaluation suggested that small <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> may not be suitable for this biopsy procedure...|$|R

50|$|Although <b>green</b> <b>iguanas</b> {{in captivity}} will eat meat if {{presented}} with it, excessive consumption of animal protein results in severe kidney problems and possible premature death. Misinformed pet owners tend to feed iguanas iceberg lettuce, which provides iguanas with water {{but has no}} other nutritional value.
