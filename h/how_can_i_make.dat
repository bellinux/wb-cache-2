In the first years the focus will be on customers having lactose intolerance, milk allergy, diabetes, celiac disease.

The translation is done by way of the language settings within the MINDBODY software. By accessing and altering these settings, I am able to translate {{the vast majority of the}} software to Spanish. I collaborate weekly with a mentor at MINDBODY to gain insight into <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> the transition of the software as comprehensive, effective and beneficial as possible for MINDBODY and for the company’s Spanish-speaking clients. This project allows me to exhibit the skill and knowledge I have gained from my undergraduate language studies at Cal Poly and abroad in Chile. MINDBODY is a leading software company, and as an employee, I see the struggle many of our natively Spanish-speaking clients face with the software in English. Translation of a demonstration of the software to Spanish is a significant stepping-stone for the company and for myself. With the knowledge that I have gained during my university studies, this endeavor allows me an invaluable experience that I will take forward and benefit from in the future. This project unites the world of liberal arts with that of business, and merges many of the facets that comprise my life.

The T. of the S. is a very mechanical matter, I honestly think--an inferior, a merely pictorial, subject and rather a shameless pot-boiler. The thing that, as I recall it, I most wanted not to fail of doing, under penalty of extreme platitude, was to give the impression of the communication to the children of the most infernal imaginable evil and danger--the condition, on their part, of being as exposed as we can humanly conceive children to be. This was my artistic knot to untie, to put any sense or logic into the thing, and if I had known any way of producing more the image of their contact and condition I should assuredly have been proportionately eager to resort to it.

40|$|With {{characteristic}} insight, Thomas Shaffer has posed {{two questions}} that I think {{each of us}} might try to answer and urge our students to try to answer. The first question is, 2 ̆ 2 Who is the client? 2 ̆ 2 That is, how do I view my client with respect to my role as a lawyer? The second question is, 2 ̆ 2 What is the concern of lawyers 2 ̆ 7 ethics? 2 ̆ 2 Shaffer 2 ̆ 7 s answer {{to the first question}} is that the client is 2 ̆ 2 this other person, over whom I have power. 2 ̆ 2 His answer to the second question is that legal ethics is 2 ̆ 2 concern[ed] with the goodness of someone else, 2 ̆ 2 that is, the client. 3 He adds that the subject of legal ethics begins and ends with Socrates 2 ̆ 7 question to the law professors of Athens: 2 ̆ 2 Pray, will you concern yourself with anything else than <b>how</b> we citizens <b>can</b> be made as good as possible? 2 ̆ 74 Even if one disagrees, as I do, with Shaffer 2 ̆ 7 s answers, the process of finding one 2 ̆ 7 s own answers to his questions provides considerable insight into one 2 ̆ 7 s perspective on legal ethics and how it affects one 2 ̆ 7 s answers to particular issues. My own answers to Shaffer 2 ̆ 7 s questions are surely affected by my having to come to legal ethics from litigation involving civil rights, civil liberties, and the representation of indigent criminal defendants. Accordingly, although I agree that the concerns Shaffer expresses are important to lawyers 2 ̆ 7 ethics, my attitude toward my client has a different emphasis. I identify the client not as 2 ̆ 2 this other person, over whom I have power 2 ̆ 2 but as 2 ̆ 2 this other person whom I have the power to help. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, my central concern is not so much <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> my client a better person but rather <b>how</b> far <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ethically go-or <b>how</b> far I should be required to go-to achieve for my client full and equal rights under law. 6 Shaffer thinks of lawyers 2 ̆ 7 ethics as rooted in moral philosophy, while I think of lawyers 2 ̆ 7 ethics as rooted in the Journal of Legal Education Bill of Rights as expressed in our constitutionalized adversary system. 7 My view of lawyers 2 ̆ 7 ethics is, therefore, client-centered, emphasizing the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s role in enhancing the client 2 ̆ 7 s autonomy as a free person in a free society...|$|R
