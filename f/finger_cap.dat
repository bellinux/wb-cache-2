40|$|Introduction: Fingertip {{amputation}} {{injuries are}} common in all ages. Conservatively treated fingertips can regenerate skin and soft tissues to form a functionally and cosmetically excellent new fingertip. Little is known about this ability that, in humans, is confined to the fingertips. Even less {{is known about the}} role of the bacteria that regularly colonize these wounds without negative impact on regeneration and healing. As an alternative to surgery, self-adhesive film dressings are commonly used to establish a wet chamber around the injury. These dressings leak malodorous wound fluid eventually until the wound is dry. Having that into consideration, we have therefore developed a silicone <b>finger</b> <b>cap</b> that forms a mechanically protected, wet chamber around the injury for optimal regeneration conditions. It contains a puncturable reservoir for excess wound fluid, which can be thus routinely analyzed for diagnostic and research purposes. This study protocol explains the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the semiocclusive treatment of fingertip amputations in both children and adults comparing traditional film dressings with the novel silicone <b>finger</b> <b>cap.</b> Being the first RCT using 2 medical devices not yet certified for this indication, it will gather valuable information for the understanding of fingertip regeneration and the design of future definitive studies. Methods and analysis: By employing an innovative pseudo-cross-over-design with a dichotomous primary endpoint based on patients preference, this pilot study will gain statistically significant data with a very limited sample size. Our RCT will investigate acceptance, safety, effectiveness, and efficacy of this novel medical device while gathering information on the clinical course and outcome of conservatively treated fingertip injuries. A total of 22 patients older than 2 years will be randomly assigned to start the conservative treatment with either the traditional film-dressing or the novel <b>finger</b> <b>cap.</b> The treatment will be changed to the other alternative for another 2 weeks before the patient or the guardian is confronted with the decision of which method they would prefer for the rest of the treatment (if required). Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval (EK 148042015) of the study protocol has been obtained from Institutional Review Board at the TU Dresden. The trial is registered at the European Database on Medical Devices (EUDAMED-No. : CIV- 15 - 03 - 013246) and at ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 03089060) ...|$|E
50|$|Some rock climbers use {{cyanoacrylate}} {{to repair}} {{damage to the}} skin on their fingertips. Similarly, stringed-instrument players can form protective <b>finger</b> <b>caps</b> (in addition to calluses) with cyanoacrylates. While the glue is not very toxic and wears off quickly with shed skin, applying large quantities of glue and its fumes directly to the skin can cause chemical burns.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} occlusion status (i. e., open, <b>finger,</b> <b>capped)</b> of the tracheotomy tube and removal of the tracheotomy tube that may have upon bolus flow and durational measurements in nondysphagic persons requiring a tracheotomy tube. Study Design. Prospective, single subject, repeated measure design. Methods. Participants had their swallow evaluated with 5 &#x 2009;mL pureed boluses using nasal endoscopy with the tracheotomy tube in place, removed, and under the following occlusion conditions: open, <b>finger,</b> and <b>capped.</b> The order of occlusion condition was randomized. Results. Aspiration was never observed but laryngeal penetration was a common finding. Durational measurements for swallow initiation and duration of white out {{were not significantly different}} by occlusion status or after removal of the tracheotomy tube. Conclusion. This study provides corroborating evidence demonstrating the lack of a relationship between a tracheotomy tube and swallowing dysfunction...|$|R
50|$|The {{treatment}} {{starts with}} water being released down the aqueduct, followed by closeup shots of Anggun focusing on {{her eyes and}} mouth. The singer then stood near the underground stream singing while the water drips on her. The scene is later followed by Anggun singing {{with the aid of}} her band. The following shot sees Anggun in Roberto Cavalli camo-print caftan swinging the elongated sleeves against the incoming wind. The band-aided singing scene repeated until the next, where she, dressed in an embellished black tulle ballgown, plays with fire lit from the tips of her silver <b>finger</b> <b>caps.</b> As the video enters its second half ending frame, the shots were mixed with Anggun and her band performing in the rain. The video ends with a pan shot of Anggun catwalking while extending her elongated sleeves, and fades out.|$|R

40|$|Sixth Sense Technology {{has emerged}} as a field of study that makes an {{effective}} interaction between digital world and human (techno savvy) without any physical interface. The information around us of different formats is digitalized and processed by human by gestures and some kinds of expressions. This paper introduce how to use this virtual technology in a lecture room as teaching aids to make lecture more effective. A lecturer needs different kinds of teaching aids like writing board, writing Marker, Ink remover, Notes, power point slides and more during teaching but using sixth sense technology all these aids can be used by our gestures and expression only. The information what we want to deliver through the lectures can be digitalized, projected and expressed by gestures that can be handled by our <b>finger</b> <b>caps</b> or by other movement of our hands. The lectures are delivered more effectively using images, videos, real life examples, query session. Besides those things the attendance list, library status of each student can be easily updated in the data base. Even a student can fetch lecturer’s delivered lecture of a particular date from his hostels with some restrictions.

40|$|We use a {{recently}} developed numerical matching procedure to calculate conductances g(12) and scattering wave functions psi for a quantum dot. The dot is formed in a 2 D quantum wire by pushing in two hard wall fingers with height h, width d and separation s.

We find two resonant tunnelling peaks in g(12) below the transmission threshold at wave numbers which decrease with decreasing h/w. We use contour plots of ψ 2) to show that this behaviour when h decreases is due to increasing "spillage" of ψ 2) {{over the tops of}} the fingers and above the space between them.

40|$|METHOD 1. Place 2 mL of the {{appropriate}} sterile medium in a 13 mm yellow-capped culture tube. If more culture is needed, place up to 5 mL in a 16 mm green-capped culture tube. Large amount of culture should be made in growth flasks, using up to 25 % flask volume in medium (e. g., no more than 30 mL in a 125 mL flask, or 250 mL in a 1000 mL flask). - Touch a single colony {{with the end of}} an applicator stick and hold it in your primary hand (right hand if right-handed). - Holding the test tube in you other hand with palm and lower <b>fingers,</b> remove the <b>cap</b> of the test tube with your thumb and index finger. Dip the inoculated end of the applicator into the sterile medium and, if necessary, wipe the end onto the side of the tube. - Briefly flame the end of the test tube and replace the cap. - Always inoculate a dummy tube with no cells to verify that the medium, tubes, and sticks were sterile. - If inoculating large cultures, dilute an existing culture 1 : 100. - Grow culture for 12 to 18 hours. After 24 - 30 hours, cells have entered stationary phase and should not be used for critical procedures. - "Quicky" overnights can be made by rescuing a 2 or 3 day culture. Dilute culture 1 : 10 in sterile medium and grow for 3 hours. [![DOI]([URL]...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cooperia oncophora and Ostertagia ostertagi {{are among}} the most {{important}} gastrointestinal nematodes of cattle worldwide. The economic losses caused by these parasites are on the order of {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} per year. Conventional treatment of these parasites is through anthelmintic drugs; however, as resistance to anthelmintics increases, overall effectiveness has begun decreasing. New methods of control and alternative drug targets are necessary. In-depth analysis of transcriptomic data can help provide these targets. Results: The assembly of 8. 7 million and 11 million sequences from C. oncophora and O. ostertagi, respectively, resulted in 29, 900 and 34, 792 transcripts. Among these, 69 % and 73 % of the predicted peptides encoded by C. oncophora and O. ostertagi had homologues in other nematodes. Approximately 21 % and 24 % were constitutively expressed in both species, respectively; however, the numbers of transcripts that were stage specific were much smaller (similar to 1 % of the transcripts expressed in a stage). Approximately 21 % of the transcripts in C. oncophora and 22 % in O. ostertagi were up-regulated in a particular stage. Functional molecular signatures were detected for 46 % and 35 % of the transcripts in C. oncophora and O. ostertagi, respectively. More in-depth examinations of the most prevalent domains led to knowledge of gene expression changes between the free-living (egg, L 1, L 2 and L 3 sheathed) and parasitic (L 3 exsheathed, L 4, and adult) stages. Domains previously implicated in growth and development such as chromo domains and the MADF domain tended to dominate in the free-living stages. In contrast, domains potentially involved in feeding such as the zinc <b>finger</b> and <b>CAP</b> domains dominated in the parasitic stages. Pathway analyses showed significant associations between life-cycle stages and peptides involved in energy metabolism in O. ostertagi whereas metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were specifically up-regulated in the parasitic stages of C. oncophora. Substantial differences were observed also between Gene Ontology terms associated with free-living and parasitic stages. Conclusions: This study characterized transcriptomes from multiple life stages from both C. oncophora and O. ostertagi. These data represent an important resource for studying these parasites. The results of this study show distinct differences in the genes involved in the free-living and parasitic life cycle stages. The data produced will enable better annotation of the upcoming genome sequences and will allow future comparative analyses of the biology, evolution and adaptation to parasitism in nematodes...|$|R
5000|$|Descriptions of Bette {{are often}} {{connected}} to savagery and animal imagery. Her name, for example, is a homophone in French for [...] "bête" [...] ("beast"). One passage explains that [...] "elle ressemblait aux singes habillés en femmes" [...] ("she sometimes {{looked like one}} of those monkeys in petticoats"); elsewhere her voice is described as having [...] "une jalousie de tigre" [...] ("tiger-like jealousy"). Her beastly rage comes to the surface with ferocity when she learns of Steinbock's engagement to Hortense: La physionomie de la Lorraine était devenue terrible. Ses yeux noirs et pénétrants avaient la fixité de ceux des tigres. Sa figure ressemblait à celles que nous supposons aux pythonisses, elle serrait les dents pour les empêcher de claquer, et une affreuse convulsion faisait trembler ses membres. Elle avait glissé sa main crochue entre son bonnet et ses cheveux pour les empoigner et soutenir sa tête, devenue trop lourde; elle brûlait! La fumée de l'incendie qui la ravageait semblait passer par ses rides comme par autant de crevasses labourées par une éruption volcanique.The peasant-woman's face was terrible; her piercing black eyes had the glare of the tiger's; her face was like that we ascribe to a pythoness; she set her teeth to keep them from chattering, and her whole frame quivered convulsively.

The smoke of the flame that scorched her seemed to emanate from her wrinkles as from the crevasses rent by a volcanic eruption.|$|R
40|$|Based on the geochemical results {{presented}} by Kraml et al. (this volume) the proposed high-temperature reservoir was traced by resistivity methods. To cover an exploration depth down to approximately 10 km {{a combination of}} the transient electromagnetic (TEM) and magnetotelluric (MT) methods have been applied. 2 -dimensional resistivity models have been calculated and used for horizontal resistivity maps at several depth levels. The resulting resistivity structure may be interpreted as a high-temperature geothermal reservoir: • high resistivity at shallow depth down to approximately 500 m, • very low resistivity between 500 and 1000 m depth interpreted as clay <b>cap</b> <b>fingering</b> out laterally, and • localized slightly increasing resistivities interpreted as advancement into the hottest part of the reservoir at about 2200 m depth below the surface. At greater depth around 4000 m below surface the major NW-SE rift trend within the high-resistive Precambrian basement can be distinguished by its resistivity structure. The interpretation of an intense alteration in the subsurface only to the W of Ngozi volcano deduced from MT and TEM measurements is supported by a prominent magnetic low with coinciding lateral extent, indicating demagnetization by alteration of the originally magnetic volcanic rocks forming the clay cap of the geothermal reservoir. Deep exploration wells (about 2200 m) could be located according to the resistivity model derived. However, additional MT measurements are recommended to define the southward extension of the geothermal upflow zone more precisely. Additionally, deep temperature gradient wells reaching the top of the clay cap in about 500 m depth would further constrain the presented model and reduce resource related risk for the drilling of deep exploration wells. 1...|$|R

The mild nature of the editor might have yielded to his violence, but the martial spirit of General Triscoe was roused. He shrugged the gendarme's hand from his shoulder, and with a voice as furious as his own required him, in English, to say what the devil he meant. The gendarme rejoined with equal heat in German; the general's tone rose in anger; the dancing-girls emitted some little shrieks of alarm, and fled noisily up the stairs. From time to time March interposed with a word of the German which had mostly deserted him in his hour of need; but {{if it had been a}} flow of intelligible expostulation, it would have had no effect upon the disputants. They grew more outrageous, till the manager himself, appeared at the head of the stairs, and extended an arresting hand over the hubbub. As soon as the situation clarified itself he hurried down to his visitors with a polite roar of apology and rescued them from the gendarme, and led them up to his room and forced them into arm-chairs with a rapidity of reparation which did not exhaust itself till he had entreated them with every circumstance of civility to excuse an incident so mortifying to him. But with all his haste he lost so much time in this that he had little left to show them through the theatre, and their presentation to the prima donna was reduced to the obeisances with which they met and parted as she went upon the stage at the lifting of the curtain. In the lack of a common language this was perhaps as well as a longer interview; and nothing could have been more honorable than their dismissal at the hands of the gendarme who had received them so stormily. He opened the door for them, and stood with his <b>fingers</b> to his <b>cap</b> saluting, in the effect of being a whole file of grenadiers.|$|R
40|$|Authors: Wei Zou ### Abstract Phospholipids are {{important}} lipid species in cell signal transduction. The assays of total phospholipids and phospholipid subclasses {{are important}} for signal transduction studies. ### Reagents 1. Sol I: 1. 6 g of ammonium molybdate ((NH 4) 6 Mo 7 O 24  4 H 2 O; M. W. = 1235. 86) is dissolved in 12 mL water. - Sol II: 4 mL concentrated HCl and 1. 0 mL of mercury are shaken with 8 mL of Sol I for 60 min and filtered through glass wool. - Sol III: 20 mL of concentrated H 2 SO 4 {{is added to the}} remainder of Sol I, then, Sol II is added to the resultant solution to give Sol III. - Chromagenic solution: 45 mL methanol, 5 mL chloroform, and 20 mL water are added to 25 mL Sol III. It is stable for 3 months at 5 C. - CM mixture 2 : 1 : chloroform: methanol w/BHT = 2 L: 1 L: 100 mg - Mobile phase: - 1. Use 1000 mL graduate cylinder to add 3 L of HPLC grade acetonitrile to a 4 L bottle; - 2. Use 100 mL graduate cylinder to add 150 mL of HPLC grade methanol to the 4 L bottle; - 3. Use 50 mL graduate cylinder to add 27 mL of HPLC (or ACS) grade phosphoric acid to the 4 L bottle; - 4. Use 1000 µL automatic pipette to add 760 µL of to HPLC (or ACS) grade 98 % sulfuric acid to the 4 L bottle; - 5. Use stir bar to degas the mixture. Shake the bottle upside down vigorously several times. - CM mixture:chloroform:methanol:butylated hydroxytolune (BHT) = 2 L: 1 L: 100 mg. - CM mixture:chloroform:BHT= 100 mL: 900 mL: 100 mg. ### Equipment HPLC priming: 1. Check if mobile phase is enough. - Check if the washing solvent bottle in 507 E autosampler is enough. It is recommended to use degassed methanol as washing solvent (Ref 3 : pp 2 - 9). - Wash the autosampler syringe to get rid of air bubbles. Click the button of “ 507 E wash” 2 - 3 times. - Check if the autosampler tubing is leaking. - Change to the method for use. Click “single run” botton. Check if the mobile phase line is in the right solvent bottle. - Prime the pumps (First prime lines, then prime pumps). - Check if batch file options are right. Check the shutdown method {{to make sure that it}} uses the same mobile phase as the running method. - Check the hard disk space in Windows File Manager. - Check if the waste solvent bottle is full. ### Procedure I. Total PL assay 1. Check the automatic pipette before sample pipetting. Add 100 µL lymph/bile/serum with automatic pipette into a 16 × 100 mm PTFE capped test tube, wash the pipette tip with 100 µL D. I. water, and add 4 mL of CM mixture with 5 mL dispenser. - Vortex the tube vigorously. Wait at least 1 h for proteins in the sample to denature. There will be white stuff emerging gradually. - Add 800 µL D. I. water into the tube. Shake the tube upside down 3 times. Wait until there are two clear layers. Siphon off the upper layer with the negative water pressure instrument. - Evaporate the tube under a gentle stream of N 2 at 40 C. - Add 400 µL chloroform to the tube. Cap tightly. Vortex the tube with Vortex-Genie gently 3 times at # 3. - Add 100 µL chromagenic solution and shake the tube 3 times with <b>fingers.</b> - <b>Cap</b> the tube tightly. Otherwise the chloroform will evaporate and the absorbance will be very high. Boil the tube in the boiling water bath for 1 min 10 sec. Wait 5 min for the tube to cool down to room temperature. - Add 4 mL of chloroform gently into the tube and shake the tube 3 times with fingers. (Crucial point!!!) - Allow the tube to stand for 30 min at room temperature. - Take the lower solution quickly with a pasteur pipette. - Determine the absorbance at 710 nm. Use chloroform as the blank. II. PL subclasses assay 1. Prepare a set of 16 × 100 mm tubes. - Use 100 µL autopipette to add 100 µL of lymph/bile/serum. Wash the pipette tip with 100 µL of fresh D. I. water. - Add 5 mL of CM (2 : 1) mixture to the tube. Vortex vigorously. - Use multiple automatic pipette to add 25 µL of concentrated HCl to lower PH. Lower PH to separate phospholipids from proteins and deactive proteins. Optimum amount of concentrated HCl needs to be determined in the future studies. - After overnight deproteinization, cotton-like residue will appear. - Add 1 mL of fresh D. I. water (20 %). Shake gently upside down. Don’t vortex vigorously to break the protein residue to make sure easy separation of the residue. - Wait until two clear layers appear. - Siphon off the upper water layer. - Wait 30 min to let the leftover clear, then some white residue will appear on the surface, siphon off the residue again. - Evaporate the lower CM mixture layer. Check the temperature of the evaporator before using. - After drying, add 500 µL of inject solvent to dissolve the lipids. Methanol causes a negative peak close to PE peak. Acetonitrile causes a negative peak close to chloroform peak. - Too much chloroform is detrimental to the column and cause big solvent peaks. Small amount of chloroform is needed to dissolve the PI and PS. - To the best knowledge of this lab, acetonitrile (10) :chloroform (1) (v/v) is considered the most suitable inject solvent. - Pour the final mixture into the autosampler vials for HPLC running.
