40|$|Basic {{principles}} of fabricating tile glazes based on cordieritic glass-ceramics are explained. Glass compositions from the MgO-Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 three-component phase diagram have been melted {{with and without}} the nucleating agent TiO 2.

When added to a borosilicate glass, only one composition is capable of crystallizing cordierite under a fast-firing cycle used for ''monoporosa'' production. The porosity of the glaze layer is sufficiently low and the crystal size is small to ensure good mechanical and chemical properties, The presence of cordierite crystals in the glaze should enhance abrasion and acid resistance, in comparison to a traditional matte glaze that contains mostly enstatite or diopside crystals...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This study {{evaluated}} {{blood lead}} data (including zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) and haemoglobin levels) {{collected at the}} UK’s Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) {{in order to determine}} temporal changes in occupational exposure to lead between 1995 and 2007. Methods A total of 20 889 blood lead measurements and accompanying ZPP and haemoglobin results from 8810 workers at 972 companies from routine samples received by HSL over the period 1995 e 2007 were analysed. Time trends in blood lead levels for each industry sector were estimated using Bayesian mixed effects modelling. Results Reductions in median blood levels over the period 1995 e 2007 were seen in every sector except for those samples forwarded by occupational health providers, and range from 1. 6 % per year for workers in the smelting industry to 12 % per year for workers in pottery and <b>glazing</b> <b>industries.</b> An overall reduction of 3. 1 % per year across all industries was determined. The percentage of results above the current UK suspension limit of 60 mg/dl fell from 4. 8 % in 1995 to 0. 6 % in 2007. ZPP and blood lead exhibited a strong association, but no significant correlation was found between blood lead and haemoglobin. Conclusions Occupational exposure to lead has fallen across UK industries in recent years, although it remains substantially above background levels. There is evidence that many workers are exposed to elevated lead levels {{over a long period of}} time and this deserves renewed consideration now that inorganic lead has been reclassified as a probable human carcinogen...|$|R
30|$|Nanoparticles are {{the most}} common {{elements}} in nanoscience and nanotechnology, and their interesting properties have led to numerous applications in chemical, medical, pharmaceutical, electronic, and agricultural industries. According to the chemical composition, these particles are divided into metal, ceramic, polymer, and semiconductor. Chemical preparation and solid-state processes, such as grinding and steam condensation, are the usual methods for nanoparticles production, but these methods are not affordable [2]. Nanotechnology has significant advances in nanomaterial production and the use of new methods and materials. By the development of new methods and materials, concern about environmental pollution with nanoparticles produced by chemical methods and the production of harmful side-effects has been doubled. Safe biological methods can be considered as a substitute for conventional chemical methods for nanoparticles preparation [3]. In recent years, scientific advances in nanotechnology and the use of nanoparticles have expanded dramatically, and among nanoparticles, zinc oxide is most likely to be of interest for researchers. Zinc oxide with a broadband gap of (3.3 -ev) is a semiconductor, with special usages compared to the micron-sized particles. It is used in various industries such as burning ointments, antibacterial treatments and sunscreen, as strong absorbent UV rays, transistors manufacturing, diodes, props, atomic force microscopes, and display screens. It is used as catalyst [4], photocatalyst [5], absorbent, dental cement manufacturing, solar cell electrodes [6] and gas sensors [7, 8]. They are also used in rubber manufacturing, in the varistors and fire extinguishers, as pigments for dyeing, anti-corrosion coatings, in the glass, ceramic and <b>glaze</b> <b>industry</b> because it can reduce the thermal expansion coefficient and melting point and increase chemical resistance [9]. There are various physical–chemical methods for zinc oxide nanoparticles production [10]; for example, synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles by ionic liquids, hydro-thermal, direct precipitation, and microwave-assisted methods, respectively [11, 12, 13, 14].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{levels of}} dioxin and {{comparable}} substances {{rose to a}} large extent in our environment {{during the second half of}} the 20 'Th century. This was the result of the synthesis of, and careless usage of these substances in cooling fluids, hydraulics, pesticides etc. Background levels of dioxins and furans in sealed samples prior to this era suggest that former sources of these substances existed. Salt glazing is a method of adding a smooth acid resistant exterior to stoneware ceramics. The technique has been in use since the 16 'Th century, maybe even earlier than that. Some sources date the origin of the technique to the 13 'Th century. Salt glazed ceramics were the prime type of industrial vessels and it was extensively used for food preservation in households from the 17 'Th century to the early/mid 20 'Th century. The method was/is primarily used by Germany, Great Britain, America and Sweden. Salt glazing is a source of graphite structures from soot, and of chlorine gas. Hence, the formation of organochlorides should be able to occur. The reports main objective is to highlight the question; “Could the salt <b>glazing</b> <b>industry</b> be one of the sources to early dioxin emissions?” Secondary objectives are to present an introduction to dioxin and comparable substances, methods of analysis and symptoms of exposure. The salt <b>glazing</b> <b>industry</b> is much likely one of the anthropogenic sources of early PCDD/F emissions. Though emission levels seem to be quite low, due to the persistence of PCDD/F noticeable levels could have accumulated. When the Leblanc soda process (a known source of PCDD/F) was introduced in 1791, the salt glazing process had already been used for nearly three hundred years...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{simulation results}} and experimental data for a collector type with an all-round supported absorber and a fully adhesive edge bond that is produced on a highly automated production line. A literature review discussing measures {{to reduce the}} convective heat loss in flat plate collectors {{as well as on}} the status quo of the collector production was conducted. It was determined that an adaption of an existing automated production technique from the insulated <b>glazing</b> <b>industry</b> opens new paths towards a collector design allowing a mass production and an improved thermal collector efficiency. Within the thesis, the thermal and mechanical behaviour as well as the applied production method for this collector type are discussed. By implementing and validating a finite element model of the collector, the absorber deflection was analysed, different calculation approaches compared and conclusions drawn on the pressure change in the cavity of gas-filled collectors. Unlike stated in the literature, it was found that the thermal elongation of an all-round supported absorber has a considerable effect on the overall collector performance. Based on these conclusions, an optimised sheet-pipe absorber structure is introduced allowing a predictable absorber deflection and, thus, reduced chance of contact between absorber and glazing in collectors. The findings of the thermal simulation and, in particular, on the convective heat transfer confirmed the reliability of a recently extended convection calculation approach for solar collectors. Even though the gas-filled collector is capable of a superior thermal performance, simulation and testing results could not confirm the calculated efficiency increase given in recent literature. In comprehensive testing, the strengths and weaknesses of different batches of prototypes are discussed. Based on an economic analysis considering the collector production costs and the solar yield, the new approach was compared to a conventional solar collector...|$|E

40|$|Most modern {{architectural}} glazing are {{coated with}} at least one low emissivity layer stack. As a consequence of deploying those coatings, the heat transfer through the glazing can be significantly minimized. The desired heat-insulating properties result from the low emissivity in the infrared (IR) achieved by employing a thin metal film. Consequently, the majority of industrially fabricated low emissivity coatings on glass feature a layer stack including a thin silver film. DC magnetron sputtering is the preferred fabrication process in the architectural <b>glazing</b> <b>industry</b> for the deposition of low emissivity films due to the inherent advantages of this fabrication process like the homogeneous and time-efficient coating of large glass substrates. Thus, all layers discussed throughout this work are deposited by magnetron sputtering. To improve the efficiency of these coatings, the emissivity in the infrared needs to be decreased. This is equivalent to a maximization of the IR reflectance. Due to a fundamental link between the IR reflectance and the electrical resistance, the intended efficiency improvement can be achieved by a reduction of the electrical resistance of the silver film. The application of seed layers, namely ZnO, is a known method to decrease the resistance. In this context, the zinc oxide is used as a template to tailor the texture of silver thin films. Hence, one goal of the present work is to investigate the corresponding interface of the standard Ag/ZnO system to improve the understanding of this layer stack and to identify ways to obtain silver thin films with an improved structural quality in the thickness range between 8 nm to 12 nm. In particular one of the main objectives is the analysis of the epitaxial relationship between Ag and ZnO. Hence, various analysis techniques are employed to characterize and gain new insights about this system. Primarily, these techniques comprise electrical and structural characterization methods to correlate the film resistance with the structural quality of the Ag film and its relation to the substrate. To this end, different transport measurements are utilized including temperature dependent resistance measurements, whereas the structural characterization focuses on x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the influence of alternative seed layers on silver thin films is analyzed. Two suitable approaches for the modification of the silver structure have been identified and were tested. The first approach features the integration of an additional seed layer, namely NiO, whereas the second one is based on using hydrogen-passivated, (111) oriented silicon substrates for the silver deposition. In both cases, {{the focus is on the}} interplay between seed layer and functional silver film. Particularly, it has been analyzed whether the silver structure and the electrical properties can be improved by these alternative seed layers. In detail, it has been also tested if the texture can be changed and whether the different seed layers have a pronounced impact on the percolation limit of the silver thin film or not...|$|E

A industria de ceramicas tradicionais utiliza uma gama de corantes e pigmentos para a decoracao dos produtos. Com frequencia, tem-se buscado de forma empirica a reducao do numero de pigmentos, gerando uma palheta de cores otimizada que atenda as necessidades decorativas dos vidrados ceramicos, reproduzindo o maior numero de tonalidades possiveis. O {{principal}} objetivo deste trabalho foi o desenvolvimento de uma metodologia para prever uma determinada tonalidade, ainda durante a etapa grafica do projeto decorativo, em substituicao ao empirismo, ate entao muito comum na industria de revestimentos ceramicos. O trabalho envolveu, inicialmente, experimentos com formulacoes combinando corantes, base vitrea e veiculo. Foram avaliados uma serie de pigmentos, metodos de dosagem, tintas industriais, tintas reproduzidas em laboratorio e produtos comerciais, bem como a impressao grafica. Alem da caracterizacao fisico-quimica dos pigmentos, tambem foi realizada a caracterizacao dos vidrados resultantes pela determinacao cromatica com espectrofotometro de refletancia, criando-se um banco de dados das coordenadas (L*, a* e b*). Foram comparados diferentes modelos de cor, tais como RGB (imagem digital), CMYK (impressao grafica) e CIE- L*a*b* (amostra ceramica). A partir deste banco de dados, baseando-se na Teoria de Kubelka- Munk, uma serie de calculos foi realizada a fim de se aproximar as tonalidades do produto com as tonalidades previstas e capturadas digitalmente. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que determinadas cores apresentaram maiores desvios de tonalidade quando comparadas em monitor, papel e amostra, sobretudo a cor preta e a verde. Nao foi observado nenhum comportamento linear com a adicao de pigmentos. A avaliacao do metodo de dosagem de pigmentos (porcentagem em massa ou em volume) mostrou que nao existe uma diferenca significativa entre as duas formas de adicao. Os calculos para a previsao da tonalidade mostraram que a Teoria de Kubelka- Munk e de dificil aplicacao para vidrados transparentes e semi-transparentes. This study {{aimed to}} streamline the use and provide for the tone {{in the implementation of}} the decoration in <b>glazed.</b> The <b>industry</b> of traditional ceramics uses a range of dyes and pigments for the decoration of products. Often, it has sought empirical way of reducing the number of pigments, creating a palette of colors optimized {{to meet the needs of}} decorative glazed ceramic, reproducing the largest possible number of shades. The main objective of this work was the development of a methodology to provide a certain tone, even during the stage of the project decorative graphics in place to empiricism, until now very common in the industry of tiles. The work involved, initially, experiments with formulations combining dyes, basic glass and vehicle. A series of dyes, dosing methods, industrial paints, reproduced paints in laboratory and commercial products, as well graphic print were evaluated. The dyes were physico-chemical characterized and in addiction the resulting glazes were characterized by the colour of reflectance with spectrophotometer, creating a database of chromatic coordinates (L*, a* and b*). Different colour models, such as RGB (digital image), CMYK (graphic print) and CIE- L*a*b* (ceramic sample) were compared. Based on the database and Kubelka-Munk Theory, a series of calculation were made to adjust the product tonalities to the foreseen tonalities and the captured image. The results showed that some colours presented higher deviation than those obtained in the case of the monitor, paper and sample, specially the black and green. No linear behavior was observed with the addition of the dyes. The evaluation of the dosing method of the dyes (weight percent or volume percent), showed no difference between them. The calculation for the foreseen tonalities showed that the Kubelka-Munk Theory is difficult to be applied for transparent and semi-transparent glazes...|$|R
