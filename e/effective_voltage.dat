The benistor overcomes these shortcomings because, unlike the transistor and thyristor, it has separate control terminals for simultaneously managing {{the amount of}} current, maximum voltage, and <b>effective</b> <b>voltage</b> in an AC generator-load circuit, by means of either linear switching and/or self-switching mode of operations.|$|E

The overdrive voltage (sometimes known as the <b>effective</b> <b>voltage)</b> is customarily chosen at about 70-200 mV for the 65 nm technology node (ID ≈ 1.13 mA/μm of width) for a gm of 11-32 mS/μm.|$|E
50|$|As the DC motor {{starts to}} turn, {{interaction}} of the magnetic fields inside causes it to generate a voltage internally. This back EMF (electromotive force) opposes the applied voltage and the current that flows is governed by {{the difference between the}} two. As the motor speeds up, the internally generated voltage rises, the resultant EMF falls, less current passes through the motor and the torque drops. The motor naturally stops accelerating when the drag of the train matches the torque produced by the motors. To continue accelerating the train, series resistors are switched out step by step, each step increasing the <b>effective</b> <b>voltage</b> and thus the current and torque for a little bit longer until the motor catches up. This can be heard and felt in older DC trains as a series of clunks under the floor, each accompanied by a jerk of acceleration as the torque suddenly increases in response to the new surge of current. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is applied directly to the motor. The train's speed remains constant {{at the point where the}} torque of the motor, governed by the <b>effective</b> <b>voltage,</b> equals the drag - sometimes referred to as balancing speed. If the train starts to climb an incline, the speed reduces because drag is greater than torque and the reduction in speed causes the back-EMF to fall and thus the <b>effective</b> <b>voltage</b> to rise - until the current through the motor produces enough torque to match the new drag. The use of series resistance was wasteful because a lot of energy was lost as heat. To reduce these losses, electric locomotives and trains (before the advent of power electronics) were normally equipped for series-parallel control as well.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{inverting}} version, the attenuation and summation are separated. The two resistors R1 and R2 act {{only as a}} [...] "pure" [...] attenuator (voltage divider). The input loop acts as {{a simple}} series voltage summer that adds {{a part of the}} output voltage in series to the circuit input voltage. This series positive feedback creates the needed hysteresis that is controlled by the proportion between the resistances of R1 and the whole resistance (R1 and R2). The <b>effective</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to the op-amp input is floating so the op-amp must have a differential input.|$|E

Device characteristics of these devices are seriously influenced by contact effects, with the parasitic voltage drops at the contacts reducing the <b>effective</b> <b>voltages</b> applied to the channel of the transistor.

50|$|If the {{electron}} beam is aimed towards a thick acrylic specimen, {{the electron}}s easily penetrate {{the surface of}} the acrylic, rapidly decelerating as they collide with molecules inside the plastic, finally coming to rest deep inside the specimen. Since acrylic is an excellent electrical insulator, these electrons become temporarily trapped within the specimen, forming a plane of excess negative charge. Under continued irradiation, the amount of trapped charge builds, until the <b>effective</b> <b>voltage</b> inside the specimen reaches millions of volts. Once the electrical stress exceeds the dielectric strength of the plastic, some portions suddenly become conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the {{rotational}} {{speed of a}} DC motor {{is proportional to the}} EMF in its coil (= the voltage applied to it minus voltage lost on its resistance), and the torque is proportional to the current. Speed control can be achieved by variable battery tappings, variable supply voltage, resistors or electronic controls. The direction of a wound field DC motor can be changed by reversing either the field or armature connections but not both. This is commonly done with a special set of contactors (direction contactors).

The benistor achieves this modulation by means of several voltage and current control terminals. The benistor’s capability to operate in linear, switching, or self-switching mode of operation, controlling the voltage amount on the vertical axis and the current amount on the horizontal axis (see oscilloscope waveforms), makes it an extremely versatile control device for power management applications, especially for circuits involving non-linear loads, such as LED (Light Emitting Diode) power converters (drivers).|$|E

Actually, the overpotential η {{is affected by the}} parameters like <b>effective</b> applied <b>voltage</b> and equilibrium potential. The <b>effective</b> applied <b>voltage</b> is the real applied voltage subtracting the voltage exhausted by electrolyte inside template channel because the electrolyte acted as a resistance. And the voltage exhausted by electrolyte inside template channel is greatly influenced by the temperature. Namely, higher temperature is beneficial for ions diffusion and, in sequence, making the resistance of electrolyte lower. In this case, the voltage exhausted by the electrolyte is less. Therefore, the overpotential η is higher and consequently the formation of polycrystalline nanowires is favorable, and the situation at lower temperature is vice versa.|$|R
50|$|A {{rectifier}} and {{a filter}} capacitor were connected directly to the mains. If the mains power was AC, the rectifier converted it to DC. If it was DC, the rectifier effectively acted as a conductor. When operating on DC, the voltage available was reduced by the voltage drop across the rectifier. Because an AC waveform has a voltage peak that {{is higher than the}} average value produced by the rectifier, the same set operating on the same root mean square AC supply voltage would have a higher <b>effective</b> <b>voltage</b> after the rectifier stage. In areas using 110-120 volt AC, a simple half-wave rectifier limited the maximum plate voltage that could be developed; this was adequate for relatively low-power audio equipment, but television receivers or higher-powered amplifiers required either a more complex voltage doubler rectifier or warranted the use of a power transformer with a conveniently high secondary voltage. Areas with 220-240 volt AC supplies could develop higher plate voltage with a simple rectifier. Transformerless power supplies were feasible for television receivers in 220-240 volt areas. Additionally, the use of a transformer allowed multiple independent power supplies from separate transformer windings for different stages.|$|E
5000|$|Messages {{that the}} body uses to {{influence}} thoughts, senses, movements, and survival are directed by nerve impulses transmitted across brain tissue and {{to the rest of}} the body. Neurons are the basic functional unit of the nervous system and are highly specialized cells that are capable of sending these signals that operate high and low level functions needed for survival and quality of life. Neurons have special electro-chemical properties that allow them to process information and then transmit that information to other cells. Neuronal activity is dependent upon neural membrane potential and the changes that occur along and across it. A constant voltage, known as the membrane potential, is normally maintained by certain concentrations of specific ions across neuronal membranes. Disruptions or variations in this voltage create an imbalance, or polarization, across the membrane. Depolarization of the membrane past its threshold potential generates an action potential, which is the main source of signal transmission, known as neurotransmission of the nervous system. An action potential results in a cascade of ion flux down and across an axonal membrane, creating an <b>effective</b> <b>voltage</b> spike train or [...] "electrical signal" [...] which can transmit further electrical changes in other cells.
