Another <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> in the finding that structural MRI images link the severity of white matter lesions to deficits in cognition.|$|E
25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this is because he wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get people talking about their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release. An <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that the album essentially evolved during 1981 and wasn't written from a single conceptual starting point.|$|E
25|$|This Deiva Neetham {{tells about}} {{the thought of}} people about the Almighty and about their {{religious}} harmony during that (old) age, and tells the way by which one should be get divinized. The most <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> this part says that when the other two Neethams are correctly followed the Deiva Neetham will be automatically fall in the right path. This concept was reveals from the mythical narration.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{time series}} {{analysis}} usually conducts by determining the series <b>important</b> <b>points.</b> These <b>important</b> <b>points</b> which <b>are</b> the peaks and the dips indicate the affecting of some important factors or events which are available both internal factors and external factors. The peak and the dip points of the series may appear frequently in multiresolution over time. However, to manipulate financial time series, researchers usually decrease this complexity of time series in their techniques. Consequently, transfonning the time series into another easily understanding representation is usually considered as an appropriate approach. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution <b>important</b> <b>point</b> retrieval method for financial time series representation. The idea of the method is based on finding the most <b>important</b> <b>points</b> in multiresolution. These retrieved <b>important</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> recorded in each resolution. The collected <b>important</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> used to construct the TS-binary search tree. From the TS-binary search tree, the application of time series segmentation is conducted. The experimental {{results show that the}} TS-binary search tree representation for financial time series exhibits different performance in different number of cutting points, however, in the empirical results, the number of cutting <b>points</b> which <b>are</b> larger than 12 points show the better results...|$|R

25|$|Garuda Vyuha is worshiped in Tantra for Abhichara and {{to protect}} against Abhichara. However, the {{interesting}} thing is that Garuda is the Sankarshna form of the lord who during creation primarily possesses the knowledge aspect of the lord (among Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha forms). The <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that Garuda represents the five vayus within us : prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana through his five forms Satya, Suparna, Garuda, Tarkshya, Vihageshwara. These five vayus through yoga can be controlled through Pranayama which can lead to Kundalini awakening leading to higher levels of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{political}} unit {{of ancient}} Ireland was the tuath. All “freemen” who owned land, all professionals, and all craftsmen, {{were entitled to}} become members of a tuath. Each tuath’s members formed an annual assembly which decided all common policies, declared war or peace on other tuatha, and elected or deposed their “kings.” An <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that, in contrast to primitive tribes, no one was stuck or bound to a given tuath, either because of kingship or of geographical location. Individual members were free to, and often did, secede from a tuath and join a competing tuath.|$|E
25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer {{must be prepared to}} establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E

500|$|Many {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker's looseness with scientific fact. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that [...] "Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only {{within the context of}} uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." [...] David B. Norman criticized the book as [...] "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." [...] Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, [...] "The most <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And if it turns out in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker has given us a unique window onto the era of dinosaurs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But {{what does it mean}} to have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{principles}} of Cobbenhagen's economic thinking was that the economy is inherently linked to sociology and psychology. He believed that an economic science isolated from the rest of human knowledge contributed to human materialism and mechanization of life. A second <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> his philosophical and ethical treatment of economic issues, inspired on Catholic moral theology.|$|R

2500|$|In her {{influential}} book Desire and Domestic Fiction (1987), Nancy Armstrong {{argued that}} the modern individual self is a construct of late-18th and early-19th-century domestic fiction. According to Armstrong, [...] "written representations of the self allowed the modern individual to become an economic and psychological reality". Perhaps her most <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that subjectivity is constituted through language, specifically the printed word. In the section of her book devoted to Austen, Armstrong compares and contrasts Emma with Richardson's Pamela and contends that the novel demonstrates the power of language to construct and deconstruct communities and selves. As Wiltshire has observed, [...] "middle class" [...] British society in Austen's time placed a premium on outward decorum, manners and the limitation of emotional distress to [...] "private" [...] life. In Austen's novels, the reader is aware that a character is suffering psychological stress or disturbance, but the other characters are aware only of physical symptoms and complaints. The body becomes a place of social tension in these novels. For example, Mrs. Bennet continually refers to her [...] "poor nerves", a bodily affliction which it was appropriate to discuss. Her obvious emotional frustrations were not an appropriate topic, as {{the notion of the}} private, individualized self developed.|$|E
2500|$|The name 'Turnpike' {{originated}} {{from the original}} 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army {{at that time and}} therefore we get 'turnpike'. The term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses. In addition to providing better surfaces and more direct routes, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles, which varied from 4,854 to nearly [...] Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928ft), Irish miles (6,720ft), etc. all existed. [...] seems to have been an average! Another <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that when these new toll roads were constructed the Turnpike Trusts went to a great deal of trouble to improve the route of the new road and these changes could be quite considerable as the old roads tended to go from farm to farm, hardly the shortest route! The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 {{to be replaced by a}} road 'assessment', which was taken over by the County Council in 1889.|$|E
2500|$|Palaeobotany {{relies on}} the fact that each {{ecosystem}} is characterised by certain plants, which in turn act as a proxy for climate by knowing which modern habitats they occur in. A lake core taken from Sacred lake at [...] on the mountain, traces the warming of the climate by studying pollen found in the core. The depth of the core can be calibrated with an age by using carbon-14 dating techniques assuming a constant sedimentation rate. The [...] Sacred Lake core is estimated to go back 18,600 years. The core shows an abrupt jump of pollen specimens at 11,000 years, corresponding with the Younger Dryas stadial in Europe. At this time the African redwood, Hagenia, [...] pollen appeared. This tree is closely associated with the upper edge of Afro-timberline forests. Before this the moorland grasses and heather species dominated the core. Following the introduction of Hagenia, other tree species started appearing until the lake was situated in full montane forest at 5,000 years before present. This corresponds to an 8°C warming {{since the start of the}} core. 18,000 years ago the lake was in the habitat now located at [...] on Mount Kenya, [...] higher than the lake. An <b>important</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that this research only applies directly to one site on the mountain. This work shows that changes in the Kenyan climate occur at the same time as in Europe.|$|E
