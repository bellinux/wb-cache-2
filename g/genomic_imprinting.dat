Imprinting is an important process in human development, and its deregulation can cause certain defined disease states of other imprinted human disease loci.

50|$|CpG {{methylation}} is an epigenetic modification that {{is important}} for embryonic development, imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. Studies in mice have demonstrated that DNA methylation is required for mammalian development. This gene encodes a nuclear protein with similarity to DNA methyltransferases. This protein is not thought {{to function as a}} DNA methyltransferase as it does not contain the amino acid residues necessary for methyltransferase activity. However, this protein does stimulate de novo methylation by DNA cytosine methyltransferase 3 alpha and it is thought to be required for the establishment of maternal <b>genomic</b> <b>imprints.</b> This protein also mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase 1. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants. An additional splice variant has been described but its biological validity has not been determined.|$|R
25|$|A further {{improvement}} to {{this technique}} was recently described by Wong et al., which uses allele-specific primers that incorporate single-nucleotide polymorphisms into {{the sequence of}} the sequencing primer, thus allowing for separate analysis of maternal and paternal alleles.

25|$|However, our {{understanding}} of the molecular mechanisms behind <b>genomic</b> <b>imprinting</b> show that it is the maternal genome that controls much of the imprinting of both its own and the paternally-derived genes in the zygote, making it difficult to explain why the maternal genes would willingly relinquish their dominance to that of the paternally-derived genes in light of the conflict hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{approached}} {{their study of}} the origins of <b>genomic</b> <b>imprinting</b> from a different side, arguing that natural selection is operating on the role of epigenetic marks as machinery for homologous chromosome recognition during meiosis, rather than on their role in differential expression. This argument centers on the existence of epigenetic effects on chromosomes that do not directly affect gene expression, but do depend on which parent the chromosome originated from. This group of epigenetic changes that depend on the chromosome's parent of origin (including both those that affect gene expression and those that do not) are called parental origin effects, and include phenomena such as paternal X inactivation in the marsupials, nonrandom parental chromatid distribution in the ferns, and even mating type switching in yeast. This diversity in organisms that show parental origin effects has prompted theorists to place the evolutionary origin of <b>genomic</b> <b>imprinting</b> before the last common ancestor of plants and animals, over a billion years ago.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{selection}} for <b>genomic</b> <b>imprinting</b> requires genetic variation in a population.

There appears to be an over-representation of retrotransposed genes, that is to say genes that are inserted into the genome by viruses, among imprinted genes. It has also been postulated that if the retrotransposed gene is inserted close to another imprinted gene, it may just acquire this imprint.|$|E
25|$|Whereas DNA {{methylation}} is {{not necessary}} per se for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a “locked” state that definitely inactivates transcription. In particular, DNA methylation appears critical {{for the maintenance of}} mono-allelic silencing in the context of <b>genomic</b> <b>imprinting</b> and X chromosome inactivation. In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their methylation status, and loss of DNA methylation results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their methylation status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline. DNA methylation appears absolutely required in differentiated cells, as knockout of any of the three competent DNA methyltransferase results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, DNA methylation is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since DNA methylation appears to directly regulate {{only a limited number of}} genes, how precisely DNA methylation absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question.|$|E

Furthermore, we show that DNMT 3 L protein contains an active nuclear localisation signal at amino acids 156 – 159.

Apart from DNA demethylation, germline reprogramming has been shown to entail reprogramming of histone marks and chromatin remodelling. Contrary to other animal models, there is limited information about the epigenetic dynamics during early germ cell development in humans. Here, we provide further characterization of the epigenetic configuration of the early human gonadal PGCs. We show that early gonadal human PGCs are DNA hypomethylated and their chromatin is characterized by low H 3 K 9 me 2 and high H 3 K 27 me 3 marks. Similarly to previous observations in mice, human gonadal PGCs undergo dynamic chromatin changes concomitant with the erasure of <b>genomic</b> <b>imprints.</b> Interestingly, and contrary to mouse early germ cells, expression of BLIMP 1 /PRDM 1 persists in through all gestational stages in human gonadal PGCs and is associated with nuclear lysine-specific demethylase- 1.

25|$|Triploidy may be {{the result}} of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by {{reduplication}} of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the fetal period. However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops.

H 19 ICR activity is regulated by DNA methylation. The ICR is methylated in sperm but not in oocytes, and this paternal chromosome-specific methylation is maintained throughout development. We recently showed that the H 19 ICR can work as an ICR even when inserted into the normally nonimprinted alpha fetoprotein locus. Paternal but not maternal copies of the ICR become methylated in somatic tissue. However, the ectopic ICR remains unmethylated in sperm. To extend these findings and investigate the mechanisms that lead to methylation of the H 19 ICR in the male germ line, we characterized novel mouse knock-in lines.

40|$|Background: Mammalian {{germ cells}} {{progress}} through a unique developmental program that encompasses proliferation and migration of the nascent {{primordial germ cell}} (PGC) population, reprogramming of nuclear DNA to reset imprinted gene expression, and differentiation of mature gametes. Little is known of the genes that regulate quantitative and qualitative aspects of early mammalian germ cell development both in vivo, and during differentiation of germ cells from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in vitro. Methodology and Principal Findings: We used a transgenic mouse system that enabled isolation of small numbers of Oct 4 DPE:GFP-positive germ cells in vivo, and following differentiation from mESCs in vitro, to uncover quantitate and qualitative phenotypes associated with the disruption of a single translational regulator, Dazl. We demonstrate that disruption of Dazl results in a post-migratory, pre-meiotic reduction in PGC number accompanied by aberrant expression of pluripotency genes and failure to erase and re-establish <b>genomic</b> <b>imprints</b> in isolated male and female PGCs, as well as subsequent defect in progression through meiosis. Moreover, the phenotypes observed in vivo were mirrored by those in vitro, with inability of isolated mutant PGCs to establish pluripotent EG (embryonic germ) cell lines and few residual Oct- 4 -expressing cells remaining after somatic differentiation of mESCs carrying a Dazl null mutation.
