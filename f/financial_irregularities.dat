5|$|In {{the seasons}} {{following}} the FA Cup triumph, {{the club was}} dogged by allegations of <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities,</b> culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United. A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between state tax amnesties and <b>financial</b> reporting <b>irregularities.</b> State tax amnesty programs, which potentially signal a lax regulatory enforcement environment, provide a unique setting in which {{to examine the effects}} of state tax authorities on non-tax financial reporting behavior. The results suggest that firms head-quartered in states offering a tax amnesty program are more likely to begin engaging in a <b>financial</b> reporting <b>irregularity</b> during the amnesty period. Furthermore, the results show that the observed increase in <b>financial</b> reporting <b>irregularities</b> occurs only during periods of repeat, not initial...|$|R
5|$|In {{his second}} season as manager, 2000–01, Adams guided Brighton to {{promotion}} as Division Three champions after the club had spent five seasons in the league's basement division. A late chase for the title proved to be unnecessary, as high flying Chesterfield were deducted nine points for <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities,</b> leaving Brighton ten points clear at the season's end. He was named as Third Division Manager of the season for a second time, also picking up the Third Division Manager of the Month award in September 2000.|$|E

5|$|He signed {{experienced}} forward Paul Bracewell for 1989–90, who partnered {{an increasingly}} effective Gabbiadini, and spent £130,000 on Portsmouth left-back Paul Hardyman. He introduced the exceptionally talented teenage winger Kieron Brady {{to the first}} team, {{but was unable to}} discipline the precocious teenager, and Brady never realised his full potential. Sunderland reached the play-offs, and faced rivals Newcastle United in the semi-final, securing passage into the final with a 2–0 victory at St James' Park. They lost 1–0 to Swindon Town in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. However, Swindon were found guilty of <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities</b> and remained in the Second Division, whilst Sunderland took their place in the First Division.|$|E

5|$|Luton Town's {{most recent}} {{successful}} period began in 1981–82, when the club won the Second Division, and thereby gained promotion to the First.

Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations came during the 2008–09 season, when 30 points were docked from Luton's record for various <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Luton thereafter spent five seasons in non-League football before winning the Conference Premier in 2013–14, securing promotion back into the Football League.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{appeared}} {{in their first}} League Cup final in 1985, but lost 1–0 to Norwich City.

Under new chairman Bob Murray and new manager Denis Smith, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances. Sunderland lost to Swindon Town in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities</b> and Sunderland were promoted instead. They stayed up for one year before being relegated {{on the final day of}} the following season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Using {{organizational}} strategy theory (Miles and Snow 1978, 2003), we analyze whether auditors differentially price {{their clients}} ‟ business strategies. We also investigate whether certain business strategies are inherently riskier by examining {{their association with}} <b>financial</b> reporting <b>irregularities.</b> Based on Ittner, Larker and Rajan (1997) and Miles and Snow (1978, 2003), we form a composite business strategy measure comprised of six firm-level components from publicly available data. We find that innovative Prospector strategies {{are associated with a}} greater likelihood of <b>financial</b> reporting <b>irregularities</b> and that audit fees are higher for such clients. Our findings suggest that business strategy is a separate construct with incremental information content beyond the individual measures of client complexity and risk used in traditional audit fee models. Further, our findings have implications for fraud research by providing an ex ante factor that is a determinant of <b>financial</b> reporting <b>irregularities.</b> Preliminary draft—please do not quote...|$|R

However, the game was resumed and Sunderland completed the win. In the play-off final, Sunderland lost 1–0 against Swindon Town at Wembley. However Sunderland were promoted a few weeks later in place of Swindon, who were kept in the Second Division after admitting <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Newell's {{place was}} taken first by Kevin Blackwell and later former player Mick Harford, {{the team was}} then relegated twice in a row, {{starting}} in 2006–07, and spent {{the latter part of}} the 2007–08 season in administration, thus incurring a ten-point deduction from that season's total. The club then had a total of 30 points docked from its 2008–09 record by the Football Association and the Football League for <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities</b> dating back several years. These deductions proved to be too large an obstacle to overcome, but Luton came from behind in the final of the Football League Trophy to win the competition for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{returned}} to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby {{to take up}} a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No reason was given for his resignation, but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities,</b> involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds' refusal to allow the authorities access to their financial records was deemed a sign of guilt, and they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, with the players auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the LNC relied on taking over all, {{or at least a}} {{significant}} portion, of the burials of London's dead. However, while the Metropolitan Interment Amendment Act 1852 had repealed Chadwick's scheme for two very large cemeteries near London, it had also permitted London's parishes to make their own arrangements for the burial of their dead. Each parish could make arrangements with the cemetery of its choosing, or use money from the rates to create their own cemeteries. The financial mismanagement and internal disputes within the LNC had delayed the opening of Brookwood Cemetery by 18 months, and during this period new cemeteries nearer London had opened or were nearing completion. While some parishes did choose Brookwood as their burial site, many preferred either to make arrangements with less distant cemeteries, or to buy land on the outskirts of London and open their own suburban cemeteries. Concerns over the <b>financial</b> <b>irregularities</b> and the viability of the scheme had led to only 15,000 of the 25,000 LNC shares being sold, severely limiting the company's working capital and forcing it to take out large loans. Buying the land from Lord Onslow, compensating local residents for the loss of rights over Woking Common, draining and landscaping the portion to be used for the initial cemetery, and building the railway lines and stations were all expensive undertakings. With far fewer burial contracts with London parishes than had been anticipated, by the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in November 1854 the LNC {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy.|$|E
