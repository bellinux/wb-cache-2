40|$|A pair of {{hypoid gears}} {{refers to a}} pinion and a gear with skew axes. Hypoid gears are crucial to some power {{transmission}} systems, {{such as those of}} helicopters, power generation machines and automobiles. However, the design and manufacturing of hypoid gears are quite difficult. Currently, the major parameters of hypoid gears are calculated, but the geometries of the gears are not fully defined. To machine a hypoid gear, parameters of cutting systems are determined according to the gear design, whereas, settings of CNC machine tools with the machining parameters are also computed. The existing hypoid gears machining methods use the simplified blade model of the cutting systems, resulting in large errors in the machined gears. This new work proposes an accurate approach, to determine the parameters of the cutting system blades, for the <b>face-milling</b> of hypoid gears. In this work, a parametric model of the blades is established; and according to the hypoid gear parameters, the pressure angle and the cutting system radius are precisely calculated. Currently, hypoid gear engineers can use special CAD/CAM software to design the gears and to calculate machine settings. Unfortunately, these software are developed only for particular machine tools; it cannot be used for hypoid gear machine tools of different configurations. Moreover, few technical articles has been published to clearly address challenges in the CNC programming and post-processing for the multi-axis <b>face-milling</b> of hypoid gears, such as the parameters determination of a cutter system, its location and orientation calculation and CNC programs generation. To solve the current problems, another part of this research proposes a generic approach to CNC programming and post-processing for gear <b>face-milling.</b> The main contributions of this part includes (1) a new mathematical model to calculate the cutter system location and orientation and (2) a generic post-processing method to establish the machine kinematics chain and to compute the coordinates of the machine axes in <b>face-milling.</b> This approach provides a general and accurate methodology for the <b>face-milling</b> of hypoid gears on any machine tools and can be directly applied to the hypoid gear manufacturing for better quality...|$|E
40|$|Spiral {{bevel gears}} are {{important}} components on all current rotorcraft drive systems. These components {{are required to}} operate at high speeds, high loads, and for an extremely large number of load cycles. In this application, spiral bevel gears are used to redirect the shaft from the horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor. Because of the high expense of manufacturing these gears, methods that can achieve {{the same level of}} performance at reduced cost are highly desirable to aerospace gear manufacturers. Gears manufactured for aerospace applications use high-quality materials and are manufactured to tight tolerances. Special manufacturing machine tools and computer numerically controlled coordinate measurement systems have enabled rotorcraft drive system manufacturers to produce extremely high-quality gears during their normal production. Because of low production rates for rotorcraft, these gears are manufactured in small batches, and thus are unable to benefit from the economics of high production numbers as in other industries. In this investigation, two different manufacturing methods, <b>face-milled</b> and face-hobbed, were used to fabricate spiral bevel gears. For <b>face-milled</b> spiral bevel gears, grinding of the contacting surfaces is the final manufacturing step. At least two different specialty machines are needed to generate the teeth for <b>face-milled</b> spiral bevel gears. For face-hobbed gears, hard cutting is the final manufacturing process. The same machine is used to rough cut and finish cut the gears. This study compared the operational behavior of <b>face-milled</b> spiral bevel gears with that of face-hobbed spiral bevel gears. Test hardware was manufactured to fit within NASA Glenn Research Center's Spiral Bevel Test Facility and to aerospace quality standards. Tests were conducted for stress, vibration, and noise. A comparison of the results attained indicated that the face-hobbed gears had a lower alternating stress level with a more even distribution of loading across the teeth, and slightly reduced levels of vibration and noise. Results of this study show that the face-hobbed method is a viable and lower-cost alternative for producing aerospace-quality spiral-bevel gears...|$|R

For these processes, special machine tools designed with peculiar manuals for calculating the gear geometry, and the setting-up processes were developed.

A two-step ap- proach is proposed to solve the problem: in the first step, the pinion tooth micro-topography is automatically modified to bring the perturbed contact patterns (as the assembly errors are varied within the tolerance limits) match a target area of the tooth, while keeping them off the edges; in the second step, {{a subset of the}} machine-tool settings is identified to obtain the required topog- raphy modifications. Both steps are formulated and solved as un- constrained nonlinear optimization problems. While the general methodology is similar to the one recently proposed by the same authors for the optimization at nominal conditions, here the ro- bustness issues with respect to misalignment variations are con- sidered and directly included in the optimization procedure: no a posteriori check for robustness is therefore required.

However, in the gear literature and in the common practice machine-settings, corrections are usually performed within the classical cradle-style framework. We believe that, working in the 6 -axis framework, may have advantages with respect to correction performances, and numerical conditioning of the resulting optimization problem. However, since for historical and practical reasons basic kinematic settings are usually given within the cradle-style framework, an imperative intermediate step is the translation of the cradle-style kinematics into the 6 -axis (minimal) layout. Therefore, in this paper the estimation of the continuous mappings from the cradle-style to the 6 -axis kinematics is investigated. In particular, the performances of two methods are assessed: (i) an existing central difference method (CDM) approach, and (ii) an original Least Squares Method (LSM) approach.

40|$|Computerized {{simulation}} of meshing and bearing contact for {{spiral bevel gears}} and hypoid gears is a significant achievement that could substantially improve the technology {{and the quality of}} the gears. An approach to the synthesis of <b>face-milled</b> spiral bevel gears and their tooth contact analysis is presented. The proposed approach is based on the following ideas: application of the principle of local synthesis that provides optimal conditions of meshing and contact at the mean contact point, M, and in the neighborhood of M; and application of relations between principle directions and curvatures for surfaces being in line contact or in point contact. The developed local synthesis of gears provides the following: (1) the required gear ratio at M; (2) a localized bearing contact with the desired direction of the tangent to the contact path on gear tooth surface and the desired length of the major axis of contact ellipse at M; (3) a predesigned parabolic function of a controlled level for transmission errors which enables absorption of linear functions of transmission errors caused by misalignment and reduces the level of vibrations. The proposed approach does not require either the tilt of the head-cutter for the process of generation or modified roll for the pinion generation.

40|$|Spiral {{bevel gears}} usually are {{cut by the}} machine tools which are {{specifically}} made for manufacturing spiral bevel gear. For some practical applications, such as repair, prototype, and small batch, there are only several spiral bevel gears need to be machined. It seems not wise to buy a gear manufacturing machine tool for cutting those several gears. Consequently, some other manufacturing methods are introduced {{to cope with this}} situation. Recent advances in computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine tools make it possible to manufacture good quality spiral bevel gears. Moreover, CNC milling machine tools are usually cheaper than the specific gear manufacturing machine tools. Even more, they are not only cut gears but also other parts. Therefore, computer numerical control (CNC) milling is introduced in industry to cut spiral bevel gears. End milling and flank milling are two modes of CNC milling. Compared to end milling, flank milling has been highlighted in quality enhancement, manufacturing time and cost reduction. Theoretically, the result of flank milling a developable ruled surface does not contain geometric deviations. Hence, flank milling has been widely used to machine the parts with ruled surface or the surface close to ruled surface, such as turbines and blades. Due {{to the fact that the}} tooth surfaces of spiral bevel gears are close to ruled surface (the tooth surface of Format-cut spiral bevel is part of a cone), flank milling can also be used to cut spiral bevel gears. However, there is no literature about flank milling spiral bevel gears. Moreover, the current existing tooth surface models (except the tooth surface of Format-cut spiral bevel gear) are implicit, which makes further calculation inefficient and difficult. To address these two problems, a new ruled tooth surface design is proposed to spiral bevel gears design. Subsequently, the design model is used to be machined with five-axis flank milling by introducing a new tool path planning approach. To obtain the simulate machined tooth surface, a new geometric envelope approach is proposed to calculate the cutter envelope surface as a closed-form representation. Then the result of geometric deviations, which are obtained by comparing the design tooth surface and the simulate machined tooth surface, shows the flank milling is appropriate to cut spiral bevel gears. Furthermore, the conventional <b>face-milled</b> model is also used as the design model for flank milling, and another result of geometric deviations is obtained. Subsequently, both results are compared, and the comparison shows that the proposed design reduces the geometric deviations effectively. Moreover, the closed-form simulate machined tooth surface can only be obtained by using the proposed design...|$|R

A key feature of the proposed method is that elementary motions allowed by the machine joints are parameterized directly via twist exponentials, with the twofold advantage of: (1) avoiding {{the introduction of a}} long chain of reference frames; (2) obtaining the rigid-body velocity (twist) of the enveloping motion directly from the parametrization. A layout typical of the <b>face-milling</b> process for hypoid gears is chosen as a paradigm in the unfolding of the theory, although the approach can be adapted to any process and arrangement. As examples of application, explicit expressions pertinent to gear generation between two fixed axes, and for a set-up typical of a 9 -axis Gleason CNC universal motion concept (UMC) machine are presented...|$|E
