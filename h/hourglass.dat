5|$|Critics {{were highly}} {{positive}} towards Phantom <b>Hourglass.</b> Its control scheme was praised, while criticism focused on its online features, which were considered too simple. The game received several video game industry awards, including the Nintendo DS Game of the Year award from GameSpot, GameSpy, and IGN. Phantom <b>Hourglass</b> was the best-selling game {{in its first}} month in Japan, with 302,887 copies sold. In the United States, it was the fifth best-selling game in the month it debuted, with 262,800 copies sold. 4.13 million copies of Phantom <b>Hourglass</b> were sold worldwide by March 2008.|$|E
5|$|The game takes {{advantage}} of the Nintendo DS's stylus in several different ways. The player can draw shapes to open certain doors and plot out the path of ships on the ocean, among other tasks. The device's touchscreen {{can also be used to}} direct Link's boomerang. Phantom <b>Hourglass</b> features cel-shaded graphics, similar to that of The Wind Waker, with some influence from Four Swords Adventures. Link and Zelda's appearances in Phantom <b>Hourglass</b> closely resemble those from The Wind Waker.|$|E
5|$|Coquitlam's {{geographic}} shape can {{be thought}} of as a tilted <b>hourglass,</b> with two larger parcels of land with a smaller central section connecting them.|$|E

5|$|A manga set {{right after}} the events of Last Exile and before Fam, The Silver Wing, Travelers from the <b>Hourglass</b> {{continues}} the story of Claus, Lavie, Alvis, and the others who left Prester and settled on Earth, their ancestors' home world. As they get used to their new home, Al is pursued by the Earth Guild.|$|E
5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the <b>hourglass</b> of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, the Prince hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the Prince wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the <b>hourglass</b> by monsters. To save the Prince, Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the Prince mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. The Prince refuses and stabs the <b>hourglass</b> with the Dagger. Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the Prince, still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the Prince has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The Prince kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the Prince mentions a private word she told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{websites}} named Phantom <b>Hourglass</b> the 2007 DS Game of the Year, including IGN and GameSpy. It {{was also}} mentioned in Best of the Year lists from Wired, Time, and Edge. The game received Editor's Choice awards from GameSpot and IGN. It was also named Best Adventure Game by 1UP.com. The game was designated the Best Handheld Game at the 2008 Golden Joystick awards, the 2007 Game Developers Choice Awards, the 2007 GamePro Editors' Choice awards, the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards, and the 2008 Interactive Achievement Awards. At E3 2006, Phantom <b>Hourglass</b> was {{designated as the}} Best Nintendo DS Game by GameSpot and the Best Handheld Game at the Game Critics Awards. The game placed 38th in Official Nintendo Magazines 100 Greatest Nintendo Games of All-Time.|$|E

5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an <b>hourglass</b> containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the <b>hourglass.</b> The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|E
5|$|A {{party can}} expand into an alliance, {{with up to}} three parties combined, {{with a total of}} 18 players. Alliances are {{necessary}} to complete more difficult challenges: including missions, quests, nation or territory driven events, and defeating notorious monsters. Much of end-game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players (e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an <b>hourglass</b> item).|$|E
5|$|In the {{alternative}} image for this stage, produced as a woodcut by Bell, Tom is shown {{with his hands}} free. There are also differences in {{the wording of the}} letter and some items, like the lantern and books, are larger and simpler while others, such as the man to the left of Tom and the topiary bush, have been removed. The owl has become a winged <b>hourglass</b> on the clock tower.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hourglasses</b> were {{an early}} {{dependable}} and accurate measure of time. The {{rate of flow}} of the sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument will not freeze in cold weather. From the 15th century onwards, <b>hourglasses</b> were being used {{in a range of}} applications at sea, in the church, in industry, and in cookery. During the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan around the globe, 18 <b>hourglasses</b> from Barcelona were in the ship's inventory, after the trip being authorized by emperor Charles V. It was the job of a ship's page to turn the <b>hourglasses</b> and thus provide the times for the ship's log. Noon was the reference time for navigation, which did not depend on the glass, as the sun would be at its zenith. A number of sandglasses could be fixed in a common frame, each with a different operating time, e.g. as in a four-way Italian sandglass likely from the 17th century, in the collections of the Science Museum, in South Kensington, London, which could measure intervals of quarter, half, three-quarters, and one hour (and which were also used in churches, for priests and ministers to measure lengths of sermons).|$|R
50|$|The singer, Stefano Galifi, later joined an art {{rock band}} named Il Tempio delle Clessidre (The Temple of <b>Hourglasses),</b> quoting {{the title of}} the track.|$|R
50|$|While {{they are}} no longer widely used for keeping time, some {{institutions}} do maintain them. Both houses of the Australian Parliament use three <b>hourglasses</b> to time certain procedures, such as divisions.|$|R
5|$|Little, Brown Young Readers {{published}} {{the next two}} books in April and June 2003. The first, Speed, was written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld. The second, Buried Secrets, was written by Suzan Colon. In Speed, a boy uses an <b>hourglass</b> his father gave him for his birthday to stop time and commit hate crimes without being caught. Clark stops him before he disrupts a local multicultural festival. In Buried Secrets Clark and Lex {{fall in love with}} a mind-reading substitute Spanish teacher, jeopardizing their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>hourglass</b> {{was one of}} the few {{reliable}} {{methods of}} measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The <b>hourglass</b> also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.|$|E
5|$|Currently {{there are}} two manga. The first is a manga {{adaptation}} of Last Exile: Fam, The Silver Wing written by Gonzo and illustrated by Robo Miyamoto and is serialized in Young Ace magazine and published by Kadokawa Shoten. The second, titled , tells {{what happened to the}} Claus and his friends after the events of Last Exile and before the events of Last Exile: Fam, The Silver Wing. The manga is written by Gonzo and illustrated by Minoru Murao, one of the original animators of the Last Exile anime. Last Exile – Travelers from the <b>Hourglass</b> is serialized in Newtype Ace and published by Kadokawa.|$|E
5000|$|Special. They are side {{stories to}} the Original Story. There was a 2016 Valentine's Day Special (no longer available), a 2016 Christmas Special, and a 2017 April Fool's Day Special, each costing 60 <b>hourglasses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{penultimate}} scene {{took place}} in a contemporary American home. Rudolfs set was dominated by large horizontal windows. The room was filled with clocks, <b>hourglasses</b> and navigational equipment, in line with Dr. Arnold Mayers fascination with time travel.|$|R
50|$|Just as Plus adds Diamonds and Advanced adds <b>Hourglasses,</b> Challenge dancing adds new {{formations}} {{which have}} their own rules for circulation as well as calls that apply specifically to them. Additional formations include Butterflies, Galaxies, Triangles, Xs, and Zs.|$|R
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an <b>hourglass</b> shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The same {{development}} {{team that}} worked on Four Swords Adventures also worked {{on what would}} become Phantom <b>Hourglass.</b> In the game's first prototype, the action {{took place in the}} upper screen while the touchscreen was a flat map that allowed Link to be controlled. However, the developers believed that this interface caused the player to be too disconnected from the game's action, thereby prompting them to switch the two screens. They felt that this interface would appeal to Japanese players, who they said prefer simple interfaces. The developers added a battle mode that was played over Wi-Fi to appeal to American players.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} items and treasures located {{throughout}} the game. Many of these treasures are obtained by defeating enemies and include the following: gold; golden water jugs, necklaces, scales of justice, harps, mirrors, and crowns which increase the player's score; hourglasses which refill the <b>Hourglass</b> Timer; hearts which refill the life meter; gauntlets which temporarily double Wonder Boy's attack power; helmets which temporarily provide additional protection from enemy attacks; Wing Boots which allow Wonder Boy {{to fly over}} obstacles; Revival Potions; and magic mantles which make Wonder Boy temporarily invisible. Other special items hidden in the game which the player must find include letters, the flute, various charms, the bell, and the ruby.|$|E
50|$|The first signalmen, {{originally}} called Railway Policemen (leading to {{the nickname}} of 'Bobby'), {{were employed in}} the early 19th century and used flags {{to communicate with each}} other and train drivers, and <b>hourglasses</b> for the purpose of Time Interval Working between stations.|$|R
5000|$|After Ending: This is a {{story for}} each {{character}} routes that happens after the good ending. There is also the Valentines After ending, which costs 20 <b>hourglasses.</b> There is also a Christmas after ending once you complete a route in the Christmas DLC.|$|R
50|$|Controversially, {{the lyrics}} compose a concept album of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, {{particularly}} Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The song titles translate into The Last Man, The King of Yesterday, Beyond Good and Evil, Übermensch, The Temple of <b>Hourglasses,</b> Of Man, Of Nature, and Of the Eternal Return.|$|R
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight <b>hourglass</b> waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved <b>Hourglass</b> Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouring}} the Great Sea, Link learns {{that he must}} use maps and clues hidden in the Temple of the Ocean King to find the Spirits of Courage, Wisdom, and Power, which in turn will help him locate the Ghost Ship. With {{the help of the}} Phantom <b>Hourglass,</b> Link finds the Spirits of Wisdom and Power. When Link asks Oshus where to find the Spirit of Courage, Oshus explains that it is in fact Ciela, after which she transforms into her true form. Now in possession of the three Spirits, Link, along with Ciela and Oshus, locate the Ghost Ship and find Tetra on board, who has been turned to stone. While Link determines how to save Tetra, Oshus reveals that he is the Ocean King and that he and Ciela had to change their appearances to hide from Bellum, a life-eating monster that Link must destroy to save Tetra. Oshus also mentions that Bellum was the one who created the Ghost Ship and turned Tetra into a statue, and that he has taken residence deep in the Temple of the Ocean King. Linebeck quickly readies to abandon their quest; outraged at the lack of treasure to be found. However, his loyalties instantly return when Oshus promises the captain one wish in return for his continued aid.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to {{retrieve}} five <b>hourglasses</b> from diverse scenarios to restore the flow of time. It features elements of both platform and puzzle games. The puzzles are mostly logical (keys unlock doors, gold placates a burglar), though there are exceptions.|$|R
50|$|Reasonably dependable, {{affordable}} and accurate measure of time. Unlike {{water in a}} clepsydra, the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. <b>Hourglasses</b> are a medieval innovation (first documented in Siena, Italy).|$|R
50|$|The show {{consists}} of three stages, with the aim primarily being to keep as many <b>hourglasses</b> from draining as possible, each timer containing different amounts of cash. In each episode four contestants compete against each other {{with the aim of}} answering as many questions correctly as possible.|$|R
