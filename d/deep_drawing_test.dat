However, if a delayed crack initiated in a highly stressed location, strain-induced martensite transformation decreased the crack arrest tendency of the austenite phase in a duplex microstructure. According to electron microscopy examination and electron backscattering diffraction analysis, the fracture mode was predominantly cleavage, and cracks propagated along the body-centered cubic (BCC) phases ferrite and α’-martensite.

40|$|Abstract. A {{forming process}} for heated sheet metal, such as hot-stamping, has limited use in {{deformable}} shapes. Higher temperature areas {{which have not}} yet {{come into contact with}} dies are more easily deformed; therefore, local deformation occurs at these areas which leads to breakage. To improve the formability of heated sheet metal, a deformation control technique utilizing the temperature dependence of flow stress is proposed. This technique can suppress local deformation by partial cooling around potential cracking areas to harden them before forming. In order to apply this technique to a variety of product shapes, a procedure to determine a suitable initial temperature distribution for deep drawing and biaxial stretching was developed with a coupled thermal-structural simulation. In this procedure, finite elements exceeding forming limit strain are highlighted, and an initial temperature distribution is defined with areas of decreased temperature around the elements to increase their resistance to deformation. Subsequently, the partial cooling technique was applied to a <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>test</b> with a heated steel sheet. The results of the experiment showed that the proposed technique improved 71 % in the forming limit depth compared with results obtained using a uniform initial temperature distribution. ...|$|E

It is known that strip casting of aluminum alloy 5182 is very difficult because of their wider freezing zones. The vertical-type high-speed twin-roll caster {{used in the present}} study was devised to overcome these disadvantages. Features of the high speed twin roll casters are as below. Mild steel rolls were used in order to increase the casting speed and to be made at a lower equipment cost. Roll coating is produced in casting of Al-Mg alloy. Therefore lubricant, that resists heat transfer, was not {{used in the present study}}. Heat transfer between melt and the roll was improved by hydrostatic pressure of the melt. Low superheat casting was carried out in order to improve microstructure of the strip.

40|$|The {{difference}} between steel and aluminium in {{sheet metal forming}} operations, {{and the influence of}} roughness in these operations, have been studied by making <b>deep</b> <b>draw</b> and friction experiments. The friction tests have been carried out with flat contacts to simulate the conditions in the blankholder. In <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> the influence of roughness cannot be neglected. The punch force is affected by the roughness, and related properties such as the dimensions of the product after <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> and the fracture limit, are affected as well. The relative amount of this influence depends on the amount of lubricant, the type of product and the type of sheet metal, and can also vary with the state of the process. In rectangular products however the effects were less clear than in cylindrical products. For aluminium the influences of process conditions in <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> are stronger than for steel, caused by strong asperity flattening. When using a high speed and much lubricant at aluminium, the friction in the blankholder became so low that the blankholder force could be increased up to the limit of the press without causing fracture. Friction tests showed that for steel the friction as expressed in a Stribeck curve, barely depends on the pressure, while for aluminium the influence of pressure is strong. Both the position of the region of mixed lubrication, and the 'classic' friction coefficient at conditions of boundary lubrication are influenced by pressure. The influence of pres-sure could be linked to the phenomena encountered in the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tests</b> success-fully.

40|$|International audienceAdvanced {{macroscopic}} models {{give a good}} {{description of}} initial plastic behavior of most metallic materials like initial anisotropy. However, the modeling of anisotropic hardening, in particular for non-proportional loading paths, still is a difficult task for these models. The complex distortion of the yield locus {{is related to the}} activation and cross-hardening of different slip systems, depending on crystallographic orientations. These physical mechanisms are taken into account in polycrystalline models. The novel approach consists in: (i) drastically reducing the number of crystallographic orientations, (ii) applying a specific parameter calibration procedure to obtain a good agreement with all stress–strain and transverse strains curves of an extended experimental database including pseudo-experimental tests. In the present study, the methodology has been applied to a strongly anisotropic aluminum alloy (Part I) and to an initially isotropic fcc material (Part II, submitted to Int. J. Plasticity). Very good modeling is achieved with 8 and 14 crystallographic orientations, respectively, in particular for the Lankford ratios along different loading directions. The additional hardening for non-proportional loadings, such as simple shear followed by tension, can be modeled. The effects of texture evolution are also qualitatively investigated. It must be emphasized that the objective of the methodology is not to obtain results at the microscopic scale or material science level.

40|$|International audienceThe {{modeling}} of anisotropic hardening, in particular for non-proportional loading paths, is a challenging task for advanced macroscopic models. The complex {{distortion of the}} yield locus {{is related to the}} activation and cross-hardening of different slip systems, depending on crystallographic orientations. These physical mechanisms can be taken into account in polycrystalline models but the computation times are enormous. The novel approach detailed in Part I (Rousselier et al., 2009) consists in: (i) drastically reducing the number of crystallographic orientations to save the computation cost, (ii) applying a parameter calibration procedure to obtain a good agreement with the experimental database. This methodology is first applied here to the anisotropic hardening in the proportional loadings of the strongly anisotropic aluminum alloy of Part I. Very good modeling is achieved with only eight crystallographic orientations. Different levels of additional hardening in biaxial proportional loading as compared to uniaxial loading can be modeled with the same polycrystalline model. For this, only the parameter calibration has to be performed with different databases. The same methodology has also been applied for the {{modeling of}} isotropic behavior. The best compromise between model accuracy and numerical cost is obtained with fourteen orientations. The deviations from isotropy are acceptable in all loading directions. Different levels of hardening in orthogonal loading: simple shear followed by simple tension, are achieved without any modification of the model equations. Only the parameter calibration has to be performed with different hardening levels in the database. FE calculations of a <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>test</b> have been performed. The CPU time of the polycrystalline model is only five times larger than that with the simple von Mises model. The CPU time with texture evolution is further increased by a factor of two. The effects of texture evolution in rolling of the initially isotropic fcc material have been investigated. The resulting texture and hardening are qualitatively good...|$|E
40|$|Economical and {{fuel-efficient}} {{vehicles are}} a current topic of interest worldwide, due to increasing fuel costs and environmental concerns. The most strident demand from various auto-sector stakeholders {{is to reduce}} emissions from vehicles and keep the environment clean. To solve this issue we need to reduce vehicle weight to lower fuel consumption. In this context, magnesium alloys {{can be considered as}} an alternative for sheet metal components, as they are 35 percent lighter than aluminium alloys and 78 percent lighter than steel. The AZ magnesium alloy series is widely used by the modern light metal industry. In this research, AZ 80 magnesium alloy was selected. AZ 80 is an important structural wrought-magnesium alloy with a high aluminium content of about 8 wt. %. AZ 80 is the main subject of this study because it offers higher strength and greater hardness than the more widely used AZ 31. In this research, magnesium AZ 80 alloys with two different grain sizes were considered, that is fine grain AZ 80 (grain size ≈ 10 µm) and coarse grain AZ 80 (grain size ≈ 60 µm). These grain sizes were chosen for investigations of the effect of grain size at higher temperatures and to observe changes in mechanical and forming capabilities with respect to grain size. To investigate the formability characteristics of magnesium alloys, various tensile <b>tests</b> and <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>tests</b> were performed at different temperatures, test speeds and grain sizes {{to understand the nature of}} the material. Anisotropy of material, strain sensitivity index and flow stress were also determined by varying all of these parameters. Moreover, load-displacement diagrams, forming-limit diagrams and the effects of variations in various pre-and-post processing parameters were also examined. A further part of this research was to examine microstructure changes through the use of microscopic images at high magnification by utilising optical and scanning electron microscopes. It was observed that the microstructure of magnesium alloys was extremely sensitive to processing parameters in tensile tests and deep-drawing tests. The final part of the research was the verification of mathematical modelling and simulation of metal forming processes by using the commercial FEA software package Abaqus...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePolycrystalline {{models have}} shown a good {{capability}} of predicting mechanical and textural evolution. Among them, self-consistent models {{take into account the}} influence of several microstructural features. These models can be coupled to finite element formulations in order to simulate the evolution of microstructural and anisotropic properties of the material during a forming process. In this paper, we couple an anisotropic viscoplastic self-consistent polycrystalline model with a 3 D large deformations finite element code. A <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process (Erichsen <b>test)</b> applied to a square sheet of a strongly anisotropic alloy (Zircaloy 4) is simulated. The final strain field in the sheet depends on the initial microstructure and its evolution. The calculation is illustrated at a stage where texture evolution starts playing a role in the critical thickness prediction, where the sheet is the most deformed. Updating of textural anisotropy becomes necessary when further deformation is applied...|$|R

O presente trabalho visa relatar as principais alterações microestruturais e texturais da liga AA 3104 em diferentes condições de deformação a frio. As amostras investigadas foram obtidas por meio de laminação a quente nas espessuras de 1, 80 e 2, 25 mm. O {{material}} A com espessura de 1, 80 mm foi laminado duas vezes a frio com reduções de 64 % e 59 %. Já o material B com espessura de 2, 25 mm foi laminado três vezes a frio com reduções de 55 %, 52 % e 51 %. Após cada redução a frio foram retiradas amostras para as caracterizações. A espessura final nos dois materiais foi de 260 ?m. A caracterização microestrutural foi realizada por meio de microscopia ótica convencional e microscopia eletrônica de varredura. A textura de recristalização foi obtida por meio de difração de raios X.
