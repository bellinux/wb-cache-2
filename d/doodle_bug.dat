25|$|During World War II, Nazi Germany air-launched 1,176 V-1 {{missiles}} from Heinkel He 111 bombers. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) studied this weapon system. Testing {{was conducted}} in the United States using B-17 bombers and the JB-2 <b>Doodle</b> <b>Bug,</b> a locally produced copy of the V-1. Successful testing of this combination led {{to the release of}} requirements to the aerospace industry for an air-to-surface missile on 15 July 1945.|$|E
500|$|The verdict from {{motoring}} organisations, {{road safety}} groups, and consumer watchdogs was decidedly negative and probably sealed the C5's fate. The British Safety Council (BSC) tested the C5 at Sinclair Vehicles' headquarters in Warwick {{and issued a}} highly critical report to its 32,000 members. Sinclair was furious and {{announced that he would}} sue the BSC and its chairman, James Tye, for defamation (although nothing came of it) after Tye told the press: [...] "I am shattered that within a few days 14-year-old children will be allowed to drive on the road in this <b>Doodle</b> <b>Bug</b> without a licence... without insurance and without any form of training." [...] Several years later, Tye was happy {{to take responsibility for the}} C5's failure, describing himself as [...] "the man entirely to blame for the failure of the Sinclair C5".|$|E

50|$|Armadillidiidae is {{a family}} of woodlice, a {{terrestrial}} crustacean group in the order Isopoda. Unlike members of other woodlouse families, members of this family can roll into a ball, an ability they share with the outwardly similar but unrelated pill millipedes and other animals. This ability gives woodlice in this family their common names of pill bugs, roly polies, or <b>doodle</b> <b>bugs.</b> The best known species in the family is Armadillidium vulgare, the common pill bug.|$|R

40|$|Horz {{describes}} {{the evidence for}} lava tubes associated with rills in lunar photoimaging. These tubes have terrestrial counterparts as described by Billings, et al., and Gillet. The widths of these tubes range from 10 s to 100 s of meters. Their roof thickness are at least 0. 125 to 0. 25 times their widths and stand unsupported on the Moon. To confine one atmosphere of internal pressure, static roof thickness {{must be at least}} 16 m. Favorable locations of lava tubes may be surveyed using roving gravity meters on <b>Doodle</b> <b>Bugs,</b> which consist of platforms containing equipment for communication with Earth-based control stations. The stable - 20 C temperature of the lava tubes should provide a workable habitat environment. The greater than 16 m of basalt in the roof should give adequate radiation and impact protection. Typically, after clearing entries and grading ramps, habitats might be placed in tubes and inflated. Later, larger habitats might be built by enclosing tube sections with compacted-regolith dams. The interior can then be sealed to hold an atmosphere. The huge lava tubes inferred from the photographs are capable of providing habitats hundreds of meters wide, in lengths of kilometers...|$|R

50|$|In 1928, McDonnell left Huff Daland {{and set up}} J.S. McDonnell & Associates, {{and with}} the help of two other engineers, McDonnell set out to design his first {{aircraft}} with his company name. This aircraft would then compete in a safe airplane contest sponsored by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics and offered a $100,000 prize for the winning entry. His design was the <b>Doodle</b> <b>Bug.</b> After the failure of the <b>Doodle</b> <b>Bug</b> to win the contest (the Curtiss Tanager won) or any commercial orders due to the Great Depression, he dissolved his firm and worked for the Great Lakes Aircraft Company in 1931 before he was hired as an engineer for the Glenn L.

A cloth fairing behind the pilot streamlines drag and provides space for baggage stowage. The propeller is protected on the ground by two support legs that retract automatically when the pilot assumes the normal flying position, though pressure on the foot rest. Electric starting is optional.|$|E
