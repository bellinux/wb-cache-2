The {{use of a}} variety of strategies by the students show that conveying <b>disagreements</b> is not an easy task for the academia living in a collectivist society. Responses to the <b>disagreements</b> are also varied, ranging from communication deadlock to partial acceptance, support, offer of an account, support from another participant, neutralizer from another participant, and acceptance. The analysis of the data shows that, in the presence of <b>disagreements,</b> learning is mostly facilitated by <b>disagreements</b> expressed through peer acknowledgment and vulnerability assertion...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contends that}} Dworkin's notion of ‘genuine’ {{theoretical}} <b>disagreements,</b> {{which is a}} fundamental pillar in his criticism of legal positivism and semantic <b>disagreements,</b> requires a realist reinterpretation. This view is defended according to two core arguments. First, a realist reinterpretation of ‘genuine’ theoretical <b>disagreements</b> enables Dworkin to avoid semantic criticisms {{such as the one}} advanced by Joseph Raz, who propounds a sophisticated model of criterial semantics to explain theoretical <b>disagreements.</b> Second, to make intelligible the distinction between theoretical and semantic <b>disagreements</b> in law, we need to resort to realist elements. The conclusion is striking and in clear contradiction with Dworkin's ametaphysical and epistemic abstinence. The article shows that there is a problematic tension within Dworkin's constructivist project and that he should revise either its ametaphysical view and epistemic abstinence, or notions such as ‘genuine’ theoretical <b>disagreements...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Cross-national {{research}} suggests that married people {{have higher levels of}} well-being than cohabiting people. However, relationship quality has both positive and negative dimensions. Researchers have paid little attention to <b>disagreements</b> within cohabiting and married couples. OBJECTIVE This study aims to improve our understanding of the meaning of cohabitation by examining <b>disagreements</b> within marital and cohabiting relationships. We examine variations in couples’ <b>disagreements</b> about housework, paid work and money by country and gender. METHODS The data come from the 2004 European Social Survey. We selected respondents living in a heterosexual couple relationship and aged between 18 and 45. In total, the study makes use of data from 22 European countries and 9, 657 people. Given that our dependent variable was dichotomous, we estimated multilevel logit models, with (1) disagree and (0) never disagree. RESULTS We find that cohabitors had more <b>disagreements</b> about housework, the same <b>disagreements</b> about money, but fewer <b>disagreements</b> about paid work than did married people. These findings could not be explained by socio-economic or demographic measures, nor did we find gender or cross-country differences in the association between union status and conflict. CONCLUSIONS Cohabiting couples have more <b>disagreements</b> about housework but fewer <b>disagreements</b> about paid work than married people. There are no gender or cross-country differences in these associations. The results provide further evidence that the meaning of cohabitation differs from that of marriage, and that this difference remains consistent across nation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} identified <b>disagreements</b> {{between patients}} and psychiatrists on problems, goals, and methods for treatment. Specifically, their nature, type, contributing variables, and consequences were investigated.;The {{study was conducted}} at two provincial psychiatric hospitals in Ontario. Subjects included patients (n = 135) diagnosed as depressed, manic, neurotic, or schizophrenic. The attending psychiatrist (n = 29) also participated in the study.;Two to five days after admission to hospital, patients were interviewed according to a checklist on problems, goals, and methods for treatment. At the same time, the psychiatrist completed an identical checklist. Patients were observed for discharge against medical advice (AMA) and absent without leave (AWOL) within the first six weeks of hospitalization.;Findings pertaining to <b>disagreements</b> on problems, goals, and methods for treatment, of an environmental and psychological nature, were consistently of the type whereby psychiatrists identified items when their patients did not. In addition, the relationship between patient variables; psychiatrist variables; variables related to both the patient and psychiatrist; and <b>disagreements</b> were examined. Few of these variables, {{with the exception of}} involuntary detainment, were found to be associated with <b>disagreements.</b> There was a strong relationship between involuntary detainment and <b>disagreements</b> on problems, goals, and methods for treatment. Also, a significant relationship was found between <b>disagreements</b> and the likelihood of patient discharge AMA or AWOL.;In summary, <b>disagreements</b> were of the type whereby the psychiatrist identified problems, goals, and methods for treatment, when the patient did not. A consequence of these <b>disagreements</b> was found to be patient discharge AMA or AWOL. The above findings have implications for clinical practice. Awareness of <b>disagreements</b> would enable the psychiatrist to attempt appropriate interventions to prevent or mitigate adverse consequences. This, in turn, would provide for the effective management of psychiatric patients...|$|R

The <b>disagreement</b> over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E
