25|$|In Sanskrit, grantha is {{literally}} 'a knot'. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{was used for}} books, and the script used to write them. This stems from the practice of binding inscribed palm leaves using a length of thread held by knots. Although Sanskrit is now mostly written with Devanagari, Grantha was widely used to write Sanskrit in the Tamil-speaking parts of South Asia until the 19th century. Scholars believe that the Grantha script was used when the Vedas were first put into writing around the 5th century CE. In the early 20th century, it began {{to be replaced by}} Devanagari in religious and scholarly texts and the Tamil script (with the use of diacritics) in popular texts.|$|E

500|$|Competition, for Russell, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{may have}} many uses. Although most often meant {{to refer to}} {{competition}} between companies, {{it may also be}} used to speak of competition between states, between ideologues, between classes, rivals, trusts, workers, etc. On this topic, Russell ultimately wishes to answer two questions: [...] "First, in what kinds of cases is competition technically wasteful? Secondly, in what cases is it desirable on non-technical grounds?" [...] (Russell 1938:176). In asking these questions, he has two concerns directly in mind: economic competition, and the competition of propaganda.|$|E

2500|$|The colophons {{of ancient}} manuscripts, dated {{as late as}} the 20th century, refer to Kathmandu as Kāṣṭhamaṇḍap Mahānagar in Nepal Mandala. [...] Mahānagar means [...] "great city". The city is called [...] "Kāṣṭhamaṇḍap" [...] in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as Kāṣṭhamaṇḍap. [...] During medieval times, the city was {{sometimes}} called Kāntipur (कान्तिपुर). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words – Kānti and pur. [...] "Kānti" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> stands for [...] "beauty" [...] and is mostly associated with light and [...] "pur" [...] means place. Thus, giving it a meaning as [...] "City of light".|$|E

2500|$|In {{associative}} priming, {{the target}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{has a high}} probability of appearing with the prime, and is [...] "associated" [...] with it but not necessarily related in semantic features. dog is an associative prime for cat, since the words are closely associated and frequently appear together (in phrases like [...] "raining cats and dogs"). A similar effect is known as context priming. Context priming works by using a context to speed up processing for stimuli {{that are likely to}} occur in that context. A useful application of this effect is reading written text. The grammar and vocabulary of the sentence provide contextual clues for words that will occur later in the sentence. These later words are processed more quickly than if they had been read alone, and the effect is greater for more difficult or uncommon words.|$|E
2500|$|Suomirock <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{literally}} means Finnish rock music. However, {{its true}} meaning {{is a more}} specific one, meaning rock/pop music with Finnish lyrics. As a genre and a name it really started its life in the 1980s following the punk movement. It means rock/pop music, {{that is not only}} imitating international trends or otherwise having international sound and English lyrics, but a form of rock-music, that is recognizably Finnish and have Finnish lyrics. A more and more general and recent term is [...] "suomipop". The boundaries between what is considered [...] "rock" [...] and [...] "pop" [...] have become quite blurred and arbitrary, and largely dependent upon personal preference. As it is also to some extent with rock / pop and iskelmä. Traditionally in iskelmä-music the artists themselves with few exceptions did not write their songs or lyrics, but in the rock scene the singer/songwriter aspect of the artist was considered important. [...] It still is, but in the 2000s it is more and more typical that new performers such as Idols songcontest winner Ari Koivunen perform even heavy rock in the manner, that used to be typical only in iskelmä-scene.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking on RTÉ on 15 May 2010, Cowen said that, in hindsight, {{he should}} have {{introduced}} a property tax to cool the property boom. Responding to the Taoiseach's defence of his actions as minister for finance, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny accused him of [...] "washing his hands" [...] of his role in Ireland's economic crisis. Speaking during a front bench meeting in Cork Mr. Kenny also claimed Fianna Fáil was spreading fear by considering cuts to the old age pension. [...] "Sorry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> Fianna Fáil do not recognise, they don't understand," [...] Mr. Kenny told party colleagues. Mr. Kenny said Taoiseach Cowen, in defending his own personal handling of events, was refusing to acknowledge that he drove the economy [...] "up on the rocks" [...] for four years when he was minister for finance. [...] "He expects everybody else {{to accept responsibility for}} it but not him. It's another example of hands being washed by those in charge, a refusal to accept responsibility for their part in destroying the Irish economy and heaping economic woes [...] [...] [...] upon so many people." [...] The Fine Gael leader said the best thing the Taoiseach could do was to hold the three pending by-elections, or a general election, so the people could have their say.|$|E

2500|$|According to Walker, while {{feminism}} is incorporated into womanism, {{it is also}} instinctively pro-humankind. The focus of the theology is not on gender inequality, but race and class-based oppression. [...] She sees womanism as a theory/movement {{for the survival of}} the black race; a theory that takes into consideration the experiences of black women, black culture, black myths, spiritual life, and orality. Walker's much cited phrase, [...] "womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender", suggests that {{feminism is}} a component beneath the much larger ideological umbrella of womanism. Walker's definition also holds that womanists are universalists. This philosophy is further invoked by her metaphor of a garden where are all flowers bloom equally. A womanist is committed to the survival of both males and females and desires a world where men and women can coexist, while maintaining their cultural distinctiveness. This inclusion of men provides Black women with an opportunity to address gender oppression without directly attacking men. A third definition provided by Walker pertains to the sexuality of the women portrayed in her review of [...] "Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson". Here, she argues that the best term to describe Rebecca Jackson, a black Shaker who leaves her husband and goes on to live with her white Shaker companion, would be a womanist, because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> affirms the connection to the world, regardless of sexuality. The seemingly contrasting interpretations of womanism given by Walker validates the experiences of African-American women, while promoting a visionary perspective for the world based on said experiences.|$|E
2500|$|As much as Saadia's Judeo-Arabic {{translation}} of the Pentateuch (Tafsīr) has brought relief and succor to Jews living in Arabic-speaking countries, his identification of places, fauna and flora, and the stones of the breastplate, has found him at variance with some scholars. Abraham ibn Ezra, in his own commentary of the Pentateuch, wrote scathing remarks on Saadia's commentary, saying: [...] "He doesn't have an oral tradition [...] perhaps he has a vision in a dream, while he has already erred with respect to certain places therefore, we will not rely on his dreams." [...] However, Saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty odd unclean fowl that are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Leviticus 11:1319; Deuteronomy 14:1218), his translation {{was based on an}} oral tradition received by him. In fact, Saadia's method of conveying names for the fowls based on what he had received by way of an oral tradition, prompted him to add in his defense: [...] "Every detail about them, had one of them merely come unto us , we {{would not have been able}} to identify it for certain, much less recognize their related kinds." [...] The question often asked by scholars now is whether Saadia applied this principle in his other translations. Ra'em (Heb. [...] ), as in Deut. 33:17, improperly translated as [...] "unicorn" [...] in some English translations, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> is now used in Modern Hebrew to represent the [...] "oryx," [...] although Saadia understood the same word to mean [...] "rhinoceros", and writes there the Judeo-Arabic word אלכרכדאן for the creature. He interprets the zamer (Heb. [...] ) in Deuteronomy 14:5 as meaning the giraffe.|$|E
