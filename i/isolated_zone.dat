50|$|A tectonic {{aneurysm}} is an <b>isolated</b> <b>zone</b> {{of extreme}} uplift and exhumation rates. This forms when uplift from local tectonics are combined with very weak crust and uplift from a river anticline. When a major river flows over {{an area of}} tectonic uplift, the erosion from the river will erode the uplifted material. This will cause extremely rapid exhumation along the major rivers, of up to 10 mm per year. Within the Himalaya there are two tectonic aneurysms, each {{on one of the}} two syntaxis of the orogenic belt: Nanga Parbat in the west and Namche Barwa in the east. These tectonic aneurysms form in similar ways to river anticlines, but with extreme erosion rates and very weak and ductile crust. The syntaxis mark the end of the Himalayan orogen on either side and define the location of two large rivers, the Indus and the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The syntaxis {{on either side of the}} Himalaya are dominated by a strike slip fault zone, instead of a compressional thrust faulting, as in the rest of the orogen. In the west the Indus River flows through the Nanga Parbat and in the east the Yarlung Tsangpo River flows through the Namche Barwa. The very high erosion rates of these two rivers is coupled with weak, hot, thin, dry, crust to form areas of extreme uplift and exhumation.|$|E

50|$|One of Yazawa's {{earliest}} manga works was a dojinshi work called Itadaki! Panther {{which ran}} {{in a small}} monthly magazine called Pyon Pyon. Yazawa started with Shogakukan in 1990, during which she released Wedding Peach. Wedding Peach ran in Ciao magazine from 1994 to 1996, published by Shogakukan for six tank≈çbon volumes, and was adapted into an anime series. She worked on several other stories until 2000.In 2003, she released the shojo manga Nozomi, {{a story about a}} girl who makes a wish upon a falling star and meets a demon who teaches her about love. It was the first manga she drew for English readers. She attended Anime Expo that year to promote Nozomi and Wedding Peach. In 2010, she released Mizuki through Digital Manga Publishing. The story is about a teenage girl who transforms into a devil whenever she gets angry and must fight a bevy of evil monsters. In 2011, she released Moon and Blood on Digital Manga Publishing in English prior to the Japanese release. Moon and Blood is about a teen vampire guy who stays with a family. In 2012, she begin teaching courses on how to make manga in Tokyo; this led to her creating online English courses as well as teaching overseas through Japan Foundation Toronto. In 2013, she published her autobiographical four-panel manga Go-Go Nao-P in English.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and sealed with bulkheads against leakage. The <b>isolated</b> <b>zone</b> was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the <b>isolated</b> <b>zone</b> for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the <b>isolated</b> <b>zone,</b> at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or exhaust end of the <b>isolated</b> <b>zone.</b> The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the exhaust end of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using raw exhaust instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel Diagnostic Link (DDDL) and from exhaust backpressure and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the DPF systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We derive 1 D steady equilibria for {{partially}} saturated downslope flow as {{a solution}} to the reposed vadose-zone problem. The equilibria are determined by two free parameters: a mean flow and a downstream saturation. Where there is no downstream saturation, a uniform outflow of constant saturation is obtained, but if an <b>isolated</b> <b>zone</b> of excess downstream saturation exists, the upstream flow speed is reduced and saturation increased. The saturated zone produces a capillary head jump that blocks the downward percolation. With a fully saturated downstream zone in medium clay mixtures, flow backs up more than 20 km projected vertically, but with 90 % downstream saturation, the back up is reduced to less than a km. The drying of downstream saturated zones with the increased rate of mountain moisture outflow gives a viable quantitative explanation for the mysterious 56 % unaccounted drop seen in the output of the southern NM La Luz / Fresnal Watershed at Alamogordo‚Äôs upstream spring-box diversions...|$|E

40|$|Formation of {{recirculating}} wakes is {{a prominent}} feature of inertial flow around bluff bodies. Below {{the onset of}} vortex shedding in uniform unbounded flows, the fluid in the recirculating wake region moves on closed planar orbits. The steady wake is thus an <b>isolated</b> <b>zone</b> in the flow and does not exchange fluid with the free stream. In this work, we utilize lattice-Boltzmann simulations and microfluidic experiments to demonstrate that in microchannel inertial flow of Newtonian fluids, the recirculating wake {{is replaced by a}} three-dimensional vortical flow. Spiraling streamlines generate a continuous exchange of fluid between the vortex behind the obstacle and the free stream. The flow inertia is represented by Reynolds number defined as Re = u_maxD_y/ŒΩ, where u_max is the maximum fluid velocity in the channel inlet, D_y is the characteristic obstacle length and ŒΩ is the fluid kinematic viscosity. We discuss the effects of Re, the obstacle shape and the wall confinement on the fluid entry into the vortex. Further, we demonstrate that in flow of a dilute suspension of particles around the obstacle, the fluid entry into the vortex can result in entrapment of particles as well...|$|E

The equilibria are determined by two free parameters: the downslope flux and a boundary condition. Solutions exhibit a constant downslope flow speed and moisture content for the constant equilibrium flux, which is the product of the two. However where an <b>isolated</b> <b>zone</b> of fixed saturation degree exists representing a boundary condition, the flow speed immediately upslope is reduced and the moisture content correspondingly increased to preserve the constant equilibrium flux. The capillary head jump at the saturated zone produces a blockage that gives a high moisture content back upslope through a pooling distance determined by the equilibrium condition that the downslope flux is constant. In our numerical integrations, the vertically projected pooling height is more than 10 km for a fully saturated zone in mixed silty or clay soils, but decreases by about an order of magnitude with every 10 % decrease in the boundary-zone saturation degree.

Zone 1 replantation, however, should not be associated with any mechanical deficit, as the joint and tendon are intact. We evaluate short-term motor functions in patients who have undergone single-digit zone 1 replantation. MethodsA single-institution retrospective review was performed for all patients who underwent zone 1 replantation. Hand and pinch strengths were evaluated using standard dynamometers. Each set of measurements was pooled according to follow-up periods (within 1 month, 1 to 2 months, 2 to 3 months, and after 3 months). The uninjured hand was used as reference for measurements. ResultsThe review identified 53 patients who had undergone zone 1 replantation and presented for follow-up visits. Compared to the uninjured hand, dynamometer measurements revealed significantly less strength for the hand with replanted digit at one month.
