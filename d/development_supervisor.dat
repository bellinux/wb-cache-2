40|$|Supervision {{has been}} {{referred}} to as the component of doctoral training that has the greatest impact on the competencies of psychology trainees (Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Stewart, 2000). Nevertheless, there are considerable gaps in the empirical literature examining psychotherapy supervision. One topic that has been particularly ignored in the empirical literature is <b>supervisor</b> <b>development.</b> Considering this, the purpose of the current study was twofold. The first purpose was to examine factors that promote the <b>development</b> of <b>supervisors.</b> The second purpose was to explore how <b>supervisor</b> <b>development</b> impacts <b>supervisor</b> attributes. Supervisors (N = 99) of pre-doctoral interns from APA approved internship sites in counseling and clinical psychology completed a questionnaire that examined types of training in supervision, as well as length of experience as both a supervisor and therapist, the Psychotherapy Supervisory Development Scale (PSDS), the Supervisory Styles Inventory (SSI), and the Working Alliance Inventory—Supervisor (WAI-S). Results indicated that types of training were related to <b>supervisor</b> <b>development.</b> Specifically, it was found that supervisors who had participated in a practicum class on supervision, a combined practicum/didactic class on supervision, or had received supervision of his/her provision of supervision had significantly higher scores on <b>supervisor</b> <b>development</b> than those <b>supervisors</b> who had not. However, experience as a supervisor and experience as a therapist were not significantly related to <b>supervisor</b> <b>development.</b> In addition, <b>supervisors</b> with more varied types of training experiences were significantly more developed that those with fewer training experiences. Results of {{the second part of the}} study demonstrated a connection between <b>supervisor</b> <b>development</b> and two components of supervisory style as well as the supervisory working alliance. Specifically, results provided support that both interpersonally sensitive and attractive supervisory styles serve as mediators in the relation between <b>supervisor</b> <b>development</b> and the supervisory working alliance. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{constructing}} a psychological retention profile by investigating the relationship between an individual’s psychological career-related attributes (psychological contract and psychosocial career preoccupations), biographical variables (generational cohorts, gender, race, marital status, job level and employment status) and retention factors (compensation, job characteristics, training and <b>development,</b> <b>supervisor</b> support, career opportunities, work/life balance and commitment) in order to inform retention management practices for diverse groups of employees {{in the context of}} higher educational environment in South Africa. A quantitative survey was conducted on a purposively selected sample of academic and support staff (N = 579) at the University of South Africa. The canonical correlation analysis indicated employer obligations and state of the psychological contract as the strongest psychological career-related variables in predicting the retention factor variables of compensation, training and development opportunities, supervisor support, career opportunities and organisational commitment. The canonical correlation data were used to inform the structural equation modelling, which indicated a good fit between employer obligations and compensation and training and development opportunities and between the state of the psychological contract and supervisor support and career opportunities. Hierarchical moderated regression showed that psychosocial career preoccupations significantly moderated the relationship between the psychological contract and training and development opportunities as retention factor. Moderated mediation modelling found that the effect of positive perceptions of employer obligations on high levels of retention factors satisfaction through the state of the psychological contract increased when the scores on psychosocial career preoccupations were high. The results also indicated that the effect of positive perceptions of employer obligations on high levels of retention factors satisfaction through positive state of psychological contract increased when the age group of participants was lower (i. e. younger generations). Tests for significant mean differences revealed significant differences in terms of the biographical variables. On a theoretical level, the study expanded the understanding of the individual and behavioural elements of the hypothesised psychological retention profile. On an empirical level, this study delivered an empirically tested psychological retention profile in terms of the behavioural elements.

40|$|The {{development}} of competency in clinical supervision {{is becoming an}} increasingly important element of training and practice in professional psychology. To assist students in developing supervisory competencies, knowledge of relevant research and effective training methods is required.

In the first study, I conducted a systematic review to examine the extent to which theoretical models of <b>supervisor</b> <b>development</b> have been used in empirical studies of <b>supervisor</b> <b>development</b> within professional psychology. This study revealed that studies rarely employ theory, and when they do, the Supervisor Complexity Model is the most often used theory, likely because it is the only one with an associated measure, the Psychotherapy <b>Supervisor</b> <b>Development</b> Scale (PSDS; Watkins, Schneider, Haynes, & Nieberding, 1995). Building on the findings of this systematic review, in the second study I conducted a reliability and validity generalization on the PSDS. Reliability and validity generalizations are meta-analytic methods that allow reliability and validity data from a measure to be summarized across studies. Results indicate the PSDS has a history of excellent reliability, and higher scores are found with increased supervisory training and experience, evidence of the scale’s validity. The third study is a meta-analysis of the <b>supervisor</b> <b>development</b> literature, in order to assess the effect sizes of training and experience on supervisory development and self-efficacy. Results indicate that training and experience have significant positive effect sizes, though they do not differ from one another.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} percentage of non-mainstream (e. g., ethnically diverse) individuals studying and practicing psychology, research {{on race and}} ethnicity is critical towards understanding their role in professional development. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of incorporating discussions of racial attitudes and culture in counseling supervision. Racial and ethnic identities have been suggested as potential facilitators or inhibitors in supervisory relationships. Racial identity (RI) development {{has been found to}} be related to supervisors 2 ̆ 7 and supervisees perceptions of the supervisory working alliance. Supervisory dyads where both the supervisor and the supervisee have high levels of RI development have been found to have the strongest supervisory working alliance (i. e., most satisfied with the relationship). Conversely, dyads in which both members have low levels of RI development have been found to be the least satisfied with their relationship (Bhat 2 ̆ 6 Davis, 2007; Ladany, Brittan-Powell, 2 ̆ 6 Pannu, 1997). This study examined whether similar relationships exist between ethnic identity (EI) development and the supervisory working alliance. The sample included 164 participants, 68 supervisors and 96 supervisees. Analyses on supervisory dyads included 64 dyads, 57 supervisors and 60 supervisees. All participants completed the Ethnic Identity Scale to measure their level of El <b>development.</b> <b>Supervisors</b> and supervisees in supervisory dyads were assigned to interaction groups based on their level of EI <b>development.</b> <b>Supervisors</b> completed the Supervisory Working Alliance Inventory and supervisees completed the Supervisory Working Alliance Inventory - Trainee Version to measure the working alliance in counselor supervision.

There was a significant difference found between supervisors and supervisees level of El affirmation (i. e., their feelings toward their ethnicity). In contrast to prior findings with RI development, a relationship was not found between EI development and the supervisory working alliance. Reliance on supervisor/supervisee self-report rather than their perceptions of each other 2 ̆ 7 s EI development may have contributed to disparate findings.
