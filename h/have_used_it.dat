5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures {{to prevent it}} from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|Goodwin's sixth book, Team of Rivals {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{and won the}} 2006 Lincoln Prize and the inaugural Book Prize for American History of the New-York Historical Society. US President Barack Obama cited {{it as one of}} his favorite books and was said to <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as a model for constructing his own cabinet. In 2012, a Steven Spielberg film based on the book was released to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Of the 55Japanese-born {{players who}} have played in MLB, 15 have entered the league using the posting system. Since the system's {{creation}} in 1998, the 22players that <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> have experienced a range of success. Of these 22, eleven were immediately signed to Major League contracts and one player who drew no bids on his first posting was signed to a Major League contract on his second posting. These contracts range from $1.4million to $155million. Of the remaining nine, three were signed to Minor League contracts, two were unable to reach a contract agreement and five were unsuccessful in drawing bids from any Major League clubs (one player failed to draw bids during two separate postings). The following tables outline each posting and its outcome.|$|E

5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors {{and a day}} or so with each player and member of the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at the}} University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E

25|$|Cannabis {{is mostly}} used recreationally or as a {{medicinal}} drug, {{although it may}} also be used for religious or spiritual purposes. In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). In 2015, 43% of Americans had used cannabis, which increased to 51% in 2016. About 12% <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> in the past year, and 7.3% <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> in the past month.

25|$|During {{this period}} {{the most popular}} style was the Ephyraean style; most {{commonly}} represented on goblets and jugs. This style {{is thought to be}} a spin-off of the Alternating style of LM IB.

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} <b>had</b> been <b>used</b> {{to separate}} isotopes before. Francis William Aston <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running {{it through a}} series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G.
