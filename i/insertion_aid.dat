40|$|AbstractLow pH-induced fusion {{mediated}} by the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus involves a conformational change in the protein {{that leads to the}} insertion of a “fusion peptide” of the protein into the target membrane. It has been suggested that this <b>insertion,</b> <b>aided</b> by the formation of a complex of multiple HA trimers, would lead to perturbation of the bilayer structure of the membrane, initiating fusion. Here we present data showing that the interaction of the bromelain released ectodomain of the protein (BHA) with liposomal membranes at low pH leads to pore formation, at least at low temperatures. Strongly temperature-dependent low pH-induced inactivation of BHA resulted in a complete lack of activity of BHA above 10 °C. Even at 0 °C, only about 5 % of the BHA participated in pore formation. Viral HA was less rapidly inactivated and still induced pores at 37 °C. BHA-induced pore formation showed a sigmoidal time course. Once BHA had formed a pore in one liposome, it did not form a pore in a further liposome. Quantitative analysis of pore formation indicated that one single BHA trimer sufficed to produce a pore. These data indicate that fusion peptide insertion perturbs the membrane and that the formation of a complex of trimers is not a prerequisite for the perturbation...|$|R

50|$|To {{improve the}} {{location}} and precision of the transgenic process, an enzyme known as Cre has been introduced. Cre {{has proven to be}} a key element in a process known as recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). While it has shown to have a lower efficiency of transgenic transformation than the P element transposases, Cre greatly lessens the labor-intensive abundance of balancing random P <b>insertions.</b> Cre <b>aids</b> in the targeted transgenesis of the DNA gene segment of interest, as it supports the mapping of the transgene insertion sites, known as loxP sites. These sites, unlike P elements, can be specifically inserted to flank a chromosomal segment of interest, aiding in targeted transgenesis. The Cre transposase is important in the catalytic cleavage of the base pairs present at the carefully positioned loxP sites, permitting more specific insertions of the transgenic donor plasmid of interest.|$|R

50|$|The {{practice}} may be pleasurable {{because of}} the large number of nerve endings in the anal area, and {{because of the}} added stimulation gained from stretching the anal sphincter muscles while inserting the finger. A good quality personal lubricant is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and <b>aid</b> <b>insertion.</b> Some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring of the anus, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers. Fingering may be seen as an act in itself, or as an arousing prelude in preparation for further anal sex. Anal fingering can arouse the receiver, allowing them to relax their anus and prepare them for the insertion of a penis or any other sexual instrument. Anal fingering is also an effective way of stimulating the prostate in males, and thus may bring the receiver to orgasm. Anal fingering can also stimulate the perineal sponge in females.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{computational}} efficient method for isotropic hyper elasticity based on functional analy-sis. By selecting {{a class of}} shape functions, we arrive at a computational scheme which yields very sparse tensors. This enables fast computations of the hyper elastic en-ergy potential and its derivatives. We achieve efficiency and performance {{through the use of}} shape functions that are linear in their parameters and through rotation into the eigen space of the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor. This makes near real time evaluation of hyper elasticity of complex meshes on CPU relatively easy to implement. The approach does not rely on a specific shape function or material model but offers a general framework for isotropic hyper elasticity. The method is aimed at interactive and accurate non-linear hyper elas-tic modeling {{for a wide range of}} industrial virtual design applications, which we exemplify by <b>insertion</b> of hearing <b>aid</b> domes into the ear canal. We validate the method for tetrahedral meshes with linear shape functions with an Ogden material model by comparing simulations to deformations of real material. We illustrate the use of other shape functions and models using uniform cubic B-splines in combination with Riemanian elasticity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A {{preoperative}} {{prediction of}} the 360 ° point <b>insertion</b> depth would <b>aid</b> {{the planning of}} electric acoustic stimulation (EAS) implantation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish whether the distance between the round window and the opposite cochlear wall on CT or MR imaging may be used to predict the length of a cochlear implant electrode array required to be inserted to the 360 ° point of the basal turn. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT and MR imaging data were studied in 19 patients undergoing cochlear implantation. Distances were measured between the round window and the opposite outer cochlear wall on an oblique paracoronal reformatted image. Adjusted distance measurements were applied to a spiral function to estimate the length of an electrode array extending between the round window entry point and the 360 ° point. This was compared with measurements of implant length to this insertion depth on postoperative CT. RESULTS: Intraobserver reproducibility for each of the 2 observers was r 0. 85 / 0. 55 for CT and r 0. 87 / 0. 67 for MR imaging. Interobserver reproducibility was r 0. 68 for CT and r 0. 84 for MR imaging. There was no bias between CT and MR imaging measurements, with a mean difference of less than 0. 1 mm. CT and MR imaging estimates markedly correlated with the actual length of th...|$|R
40|$|The Proseal TM {{laryngeal}} mask airway (PLMA TM, Laryngeal Mask Company, UK) {{was designed to}} improve ventilatory characteristics and offer protection against regurgitation and gastric insufflation. The PLMA is a modified {{laryngeal mask}} airway with large ventral cuff, dorsal cuff and a drain tube. These modifications improve seal around glottis and enable better ventilatory characteristics. The drain tube prevents gastric distension and offers protection against aspiration. There were occasional problems, like failed insertion and inadequate ventilation, in placing PLMA TM using the classical digital technique. To overcome these problems, newer placement techniques like thumb insertion technique, introducer tool placement and gum elastic bougie (GEB) -aided placement were devised. We compared classical digital placement of PLMA TM with gum elastic bougie-aided technique in 60 anaesthetised adult patients (with 30 patients in each group) with respect to number of attempts to successful placement, effective airway time, airway trauma during insertion, postoperative airway morbidity and haemodynamic response to insertion. The number of attempts to successful placement, airway trauma during insertion and haemodynamic response to insertion were comparable among the two groups, while effective airway time and oropharyngeal leak pressure were significantly higher in bougie- guided insertion of PLMA. Postoperatively, sore throat was more frequent with digital technique while dysphagia was more frequent with bougie-guided technique. Hence gum elastic bougie guided, laryngoscope <b>aided</b> <b>insertion</b> of PLMA is an excellent alternate to classical digital technique...|$|R
40|$|Abstract HIV- 1 : Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus- 1 (HIV- 1) is a widespread, incurable retrovirus {{known to}} cause immunodeficiency and a shortened life span. Despite successful treatment methods, HIV- 1 frequently mutates, resulting in antiviral resistance. Many therapies target the HIV- 1 protease (PR), {{which is responsible for}} cleaving the viral polyprotein essential for its life cycle. HIV- 1 PR often evades treatment by way of mutations and less commonly through residue insertions. We have identified a clinical isolate with a five residue insertion between residues 28 and 29. Through molecular dynamics simulations we analyzed the protease protein structure and determined that the residue insertion created a change in the secondary structure of the hinge region of the viral protease. Elucidating the role of <b>insertions</b> could both <b>aid</b> in understanding viral mutations as well as the theoretical effect on patient treatment/outcome. Abstract Chikungunya: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an incurable Arbovirus creating the most notable symptom of severe and sometimes chronic arthralgia. CHIKV is considered a neglected tropical virus by the World Health Association (WHO), with the potential of becoming a larger scale threat in part due to the influence of global warming on the mosquito population that serve as vectors for CHIKV. The virus has a life cycle is dependent on its nonstructural protein function, one of specific interest is nsP 2. We have successfully expressed, optimized, and purified active CHIKV nsP 2.

40|$|The {{demonstration}} by Zhang and Spradling (1) of efficient P element transposition into heterochromatic regions {{will aid}} ongoing studies of heterochromatin structure and function. P element insertions will provide entry points for further molecular analysis of heterochromatin and {{will allow the}} isolation of small and large heterochromatic deficiencies. The generation of heterochromatic P <b>insertions</b> also will <b>aid</b> the study of heterochromatic genes. Of the heterochromatic insertions isolated by Zhang and Spradling, five were homozygous lethal, and one of these defined a lethal locus not previously uncovered by heterochromatic deficiencies. P elements have previously been used to mutagenize and clone specific heterochromatic genes (14, 19, 26). New methods, like those described here (1, 32), should allow the efficient identification and molecular isolation of other single-copy heterochromatic genes. Furthermore, since position-effect suppression allowed the recovery of heterochromatic P insertions, it may also allow the recovery of insertions in euchromatic regions previously refractory to P mutagenesis. Studies of position-effect variegation show that genes normally found in heterochromatin require a heterochromatic context for normal expression and that heterochromatin is inhibitory to euchromatic gene expression (16). The physical basis of these related phenomena [...] chromatin assembly, nuclear positioning, and/or heterochromatin elimination [...] can be resolved only with a more thorough understanding of heterochromatin structure and functions. Analyzing heterochromatin also will help define the chromosomal components responsible for inheritance processes such as chromosome pairing, sister chromatid adhesion, and centromere function. These efforts will be facilitated by the effective use of P elements combined with other current molecular-genetic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Background: The ProSeal {{laryngeal}} mask airway (PLMA) {{is a unique}} {{laryngeal mask}} with a modified cuff to improve seal and a channel to facilitate gastric tube placement. This is a better device in difficult airway situations compared to classic laryngeal mask airway. This prompted us to study the ease of insertion and positioning of PLMA in patients with simulated restricted neck mobility while using gum elastic bougie (GEB) group or introducer tool (group IT) to <b>aid</b> <b>insertion.</b> Methods: Sixty ASA I or II patients, aged between 18 years and 60 years, undergoing minor non-head and neck surgeries in the supine position were studied. A rigid neck collar was used to simulate restricted neck mobility in all patients. After anaesthetising the patients with a standard protocol, the PLMA was inserted using either of the technique using the tongue depressor to open the mouth. The ease of insertion, positioning, haemodynamic responses to insertion and other complications related to the procedure were noted. Results: Regarding demographic variables, both groups were similar. The mean time taken for insertion of PLMA in group GEB was 67. 80 s as compared to 46. 79 s in group IT (P< 0. 05). Patients of group GEB had better positioning assessed by an intubating fiberscope with less end tidal carbon-di-oxide (ETCO 2) values. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar. The incidence of sore throat, dysphagia, and dysphonia were higher in IT group in the 12 h, but similar in 24 h. Conclusion: Guided insertion technique with GEB took a longer time, but had a better positioning and lower ETCO 2 values when compared to IT technique...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} pelvic vein embolization with aethoxysclerol in aero-block technique {{for the treatment of}} impotence due to venous leakage in men using sildenafil for intercourse. The aim of the procedure was to reduce the use of sildenafil. Methods: A total of 96 patients with veno-occlusive dysfunction, severe enough for the need of PDE 5 inhibitors for vaginal penetration, underwent pelvic venoablation with aethoxysclerol. The mean patient age was 53. 5 years. Venous leaks were identified by Color Doppler Ultrasound after intracavernous alprostadil injection. Under local anesthesia a 20 -gauge needle was inserted into the deep dorsal penile vein. The pelvic venogram was obtained through deep dorsal venography. Aethoxysclerol 3 % as sclerosing agent was injected after air-block under Valsalva manoeuver. Success was defined as the ability to achieve vaginal <b>insertion</b> without the <b>aid</b> of any drugs, vasoactive injections, penile prosthesis, or vacuum device. Additionally, a pre- and post- therapy IIEF score and a digital overnight spontaneous erections protocol (OSEP) with the NEVA™-system was performed. Results: At 3 month follow-up 77 out of 96 patients (80. 21 %) reported to have erections sufficient for vaginal insertion without the use of any drug or additional device. Four (4. 17 %) patients did not report any improvement. Follow up with color Doppler ultrasound revealed a new or persistent venous leakage in 8 (8. 33 %) of the patients. No serious complications occurred. Conclusions: Our new pelvic venoablation technique using aethoxysclerol in air-block technique was effective, minimally invasive, and cost-effective. All patients were able to perform sexual intercourse without the previously used dosage of PDE 5 inhibitor. This new method may help in patients with contra-indications against PDE 5 inhibitors, in patients who cannot afford the frequent usage of expensive oral medication or those who do not fully respond to PDE 5 -inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|I {{conducted}} {{clinical studies}} on {{application of the}} speech aid {{for the purpose of}} improving nasopharyngeal function in those patients who still had speech disturbance due to nasopharyngeal insufficiency even after palatal repair. For the treatment of speech disturbance accompanying cleft palate, it is necessary to perform palatal repair to restore nasopharyngeal function to its normal level as early as possible and also to give systematic speech therapy. However, we encounter not infrequently cases with residual speech difficulty due to nasopharyngeal insufficiency even after such palatal repair. For this reason, I carried out clinical studies on 64 cases by applying the speech aid in order to improve their nasopharyngeal function and giving speech therapy. As a result I have drawn the conclusions as follows. 1. For the improvement of nasopharyngeal function and normalization of speech, the speech aid seemed to be indicated for those those patients with expiration loss rate of over 2. 1 at the time of blowing with Taguchi's manometer. 2. When the speech aid applied was classified into four types according to the morphology and function of its palatomaxillar section, there were 36 cases (56. 2 %) for whom the palatomaxillar section was used {{for the sole purpose of}} supporting the pharyngeal section, but in the cases of bilateral and unilateral cleft lip and palate patients there were 63. 4 % of them for whom speech aid was used for restore the tooth defect and hard palate perforation. 3. Among 29 cases whose cephalometric x-ray films were taken at the time of pronouncing the vowel "a", the cases showing Passavant's bar amounted to 66. 5 %, where the upper margin of Passavant's bar was in contact with the posterior inferior edge of the pharyngeal section, which coincided with the produced under the direct view of mirror, but in those cases not revealing Passavant's bar there could be observed no definite position-relationship. 4. With growth of the jaw the speech aid applied in 3 - 5 year old children had to be reconstructed in the majority of cases, and the duration of time from the first speech <b>aid</b> <b>insertion</b> to the first reconstruction set ranged 19 months to 23 months. 5. The speech aid proved to bo effective on nasopharyngeal function in 85. 9 % of the cases applied, bringing up the respiration loss to O point at the blowing time, which in the majority of them had been attained within 4 months after the application of speech aid. Especially marked was such an effect in those cases whose palato-pharyngeal sphincter function before the application was good, some even showing an immediate effect. 6. As to the speech improvement after the application of speech aid, there were 41. 7 %, of the cases recovering to normal speech level (degree one), and 22. 9 % of them who could carry on normal speech (degree two), revealing the application to be most effective in the age range of 3 to 6 years old. 7. As for the relation of speech improvement to repiration loss rate, in the cases whose respiration loss rate recovered to O after the application of speech aid there were 48. 8 % whose speech improvement reached degree one and 26. 8 % of them degree two, but in all those whose respiration loss rate did not recover to O, there was recognized a residual cleft palate speech (degree 3) that existed prior to the application of speech aid. 8. After the application of speech aid it required a speech therapy suitable to each individual in a narrow sence for a certain length of time, and most of the patients over one year old but under two years had to be given speech therapy. 9. There were some cases of auditory disturbance with slight hearing difficulty that seemed to affect the speech recovery, hence cases with auditory disturbance require oto-rhinologic therapy. 10. It had been shown that the application of speech aid inhibits speech recovery effect in the cases of markedly low intelligence so that the speech aid was preferably indicated for those with intelligence of over (IQ= 80). 11. Factors contributing to the interference of speech recovery were mental disturbance, auditory disturbance and poor family environments, and it is essential to discover the most suitable methods to eradicate these factors or to develop speech therapy most suitable for individual cases. 12. In the cases of unoperated submucous cleft palate, speech aid proved to be effective, for those cases of relatively young age with a good palato-pharyngeal sphineter function. 13. We tried adjustments of speech such as reduction of pharyngeal section by scraping on 20 cases whose speech had recovered to normal, and we found 5 cases whose speech aid could be removed, 8 cases whose pharyngeal section had shrunken, and 7 cases whose one could not be reduced in size. 14. The cases removed of speech aid were lower aged-children and had the good function of the palato-pharyngeal sphincter and the sufficient length of soft palate, and by the age of 7 years both the anterior to posterior diameter and the left-to-right diameter of the pharyngeal section had shrunken to 5 or 6 mm and they showed the shrinkage rate of less than 1 / 2 in comparing that before and after scraping. Macroscopic examinations of these cases revealed the enhancement of the palato-pharyngeal sphincter function, especially marked was the functional improvement of the pharyngeal lateral wall in the majority of cases. In addition, the cephalometric x-ray films showed an improved movement of soft palate, a marked Passavant's bar, and the shortening of the minimum distance between the soft palate and Passavant's bar. 15. From these findings it seemed that in order to achieve the most ideal result with speech aid we should plant to restore speech level to its normal at first with speech aid, then to scrape the pharyngeal section gradually while observing patient's speech manner, and finally to try to remove the speech aid as soon as feasible...|$|R
