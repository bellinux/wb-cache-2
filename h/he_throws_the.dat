25|$|After the performance, Christine and Raoul meet on {{the rooftop}} of the Opera House to discuss running away from the Opera House and The Phantom together. But The Phantom isn't very far away at all. He appears from behind the statue of Apollo and towers above them ("To Pain My Heart Selfishly Dooms Me"). Christine and Raoul leave the roof, leaving The Phantom alone. An Old Man enters, {{throwing}} bird-seed down for the pigeons on the Opera House's roof. The Phantom's hurt turns to anger, and <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> unfortunate man off the building. The Phantom screams that Christine will be his and the first act ends.|$|E
25|$|Stiffelio, a Protestant {{priest or}} minister, is {{expected}} to return from a mission. His wife Lina, her father Stankar, and her cousins Dorotea and Federico are waiting for him. In addition, there is Raffaele who, unknown to all, is Lina's lover. Stiffelio arrives and recounts how the castle's boatman has told him the strange story of having seen {{a man and a}} woman escaping from a castle window and, as they did so, dropping a packet of letters, which Stiffelio now holds. Refusing to learn by opening the package who was involved, <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> letters into the fire, much to the relief of Lina and Raffaele. Secretly, Raffaele communicates to Lina that he will leave instructions as where they may next meet inside a locked volume in the library.|$|E
25|$|One summer, Mr. O'Brien {{takes a long}} {{business}} trip. While he is away, {{the boys}} enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. <b>He</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating {{to work in an}} inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> fled, <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> white bottle behind him, and {{it became}} a thicket of thorns. As a fox, she made her way through it. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> blue bottle behind him, and trapped her in a river, but as a fox, she swam ashore. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> red bottle behind, and she was trapped in fire. It burned her until she {{was no more than a}} mosquito.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> slowest fastball of all NL {{starters}} in 2007, averaging 81.1 mph.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> card {{upon the}} table. It was the ace of spades.|$|R
25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line, facing each other at about ten yards’ {{distance}} midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator throws up a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals. At a loss and gain of a snotch a recommencement takes place.|$|E
500|$|Jeter has {{won five}} Gold Glove Awards, {{trailing}} only Vizquel, Ozzie Smith, Luis Aparicio, Dave Concepción, and Mark Belanger for most by a shortstop. He {{is credited with}} positioning himself well and for a quick release when <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> ball. One of his signature defensive plays is the [...] "jump-throw", by which he leaps and throws to first base while moving towards third base.|$|E
500|$|Crisler said Chappuis was [...] "the finest passer I {{have ever}} handled and {{probably}} one of the best I've ever seen. He plays as though he had ice water in his veins." [...] Crisler felt that [...] "great passers are born," [...] and the difference between a great and a merely good passer is in the eyes. Time noted that Chappuis had great field vision for his downfield receivers and for oncoming defenders. [...] "Like a good baseball catcher, <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> ball off his right ear, with a snap motion. He throws what the coaches call a ‘heavy ball.’" [...] Another writer noted that Chappuis was [...] "endowed with a passer's sixth sense, ‘split vision,’" [...] and an ability to [...] "pick out his receiver after one glance over the field." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> {{paper on}} the table, and Hawtrey, who took it up, perused it.|$|R
60|$|In {{another minute}} she slowly floated away and <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> anchor off the bow.|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> fastest fastball of {{all major}} league {{starters}} in 2005, averaging 95.6miles per hour.|$|R
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Jim, an expert chauffeur, is discharged from a garage, for insobriety. Penniless and being unable to obtain a new situation, he takes to the road, a common tramp. At one house where he applies for food, he is harshly refused, {{and is about to}} turn away and try his luck elsewhere, when little Marie, the daughter of the house, comes to his assistance and orders the butler to at once give him the food he requires. She also picks a rose for him from the garden. Jim strolls into a nearby park and sits on a bench to enjoy his lunch. He is about to take a drink from the ever-present flask, which he takes from his pocket, when the sight of the rose, which the sweet-faced little girl gave him, inspires him with a desire to reform. <b>He</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> flask from him, and refreshed by the lunch, he starts out with a new ambition to face the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Weems {{picks up}} a lottery ticket and wins $100,000 but learns {{that it would take}} 12 months to get the money, so <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> ticket away. A man picks the ticket out of the trash and is then hit by a truck after Weems warned him (to no avail) that [...] "something bad will happen." [...] Later, Mulder comes to {{question}} Weems again and another one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems but his bullet ricochets off Weems' pocket knife, barely grazes Mulder's arm, and hits and kills the enforcer. Weems confesses that he's been {{trying to find a way}} to get $100,000 to pay for an expensive medical treatment for the serious illness of a boy in his apartment building named Richie (Shia LaBeouf). Weems attempts at getting the money, however, have brought him above the radar. Later, after Weems is hit by a car, it appears that Henry's lucky streak has reached its end. Cutrona kidnaps Richie's mom, Maggie, to stop Henry from testifying against him. Weems turns himself in to Cutrona so he would let Maggie go; instead, they plan to kill him. As they are about to execute Weems in the basement (where Maggie is also being held), Cutrona and his mobster partner, Dominic, are killed in a bizarre turn of events, whereas Weems and Maggie are unharmed as Mulder arrives with backup. In the end, it turns out by surprise that Cutrona is an organ donor and a perfect match for Richie, who gets the treatment and lives. Weems then activates a toy Goldberg machine that he made for Richie earlier.|$|E
2500|$|His {{playing and}} singing annoys Mr. Warbucks to no end, and <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> book he is reading down in frustration. Warbucks {{is clearly not}} fooled by Selby's {{so-called}} [...] "manners". Annie also isn't fooled by him (as was proven when she tripped him and he fell on his face, after he snobbishly insulted her). The staff isn't fooled by him either, as it turns out, when Egbert, the Warbucks' butler, lets fly with his anger about the aggravating interloper driving him mad.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> word at the assistants {{as though}} it were the bitterest term of reproach.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> fastest fastball of {{all major}} league {{starters}} in 2005, averaging 95.6 miles per hour.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} {{on the table}} at his side, and thought over what he had read.|$|R
2500|$|Baseball America named Hirsh Houston's top {{prospect}} {{heading into}} the 2006 season; it also listed Hirsh as having the [...] "Best Control" [...] in the organization. Before the season, Houston added him to its 40-man roster. [...] "He's a very mature kid," [...] Astros assistant general manager Ricky Bennett said. [...] "He keeps everything in perspective." [...] With Hirsh in spring training with the major league team, manager Phil Garner summed up his estimation of Hirsh as follows: [...] "He {{looks to me like}} he maintains good concentration. [...] Whatever he's doing, he looks like he focuses at it. [...] He looks like <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> ball down in the zone well, which is really good for as big as he is. And his stuff's good. [...] He looks like he has some of the other ingredients that you've got to have to go along with having good stuff. [...] He's a good athlete. [...] He swings the bat pretty good, and he moves on the mound well." ...|$|E

50|$|Blake Miller {{has only}} ever competed in one {{accordion}} competition, against his will. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> competition in protest.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> paper down again. Then {{the door}} was {{suddenly}} opened, and Fenella appeared. She rang a bell.|$|R
