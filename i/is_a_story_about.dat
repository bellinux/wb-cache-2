25|$|Su Wu (140 - 60 BC) {{was held}} captive for 19 years, {{returning}} to China in 81 BC: 4 poems {{collected in the}} Wen Xuan are only questionably attributed to him. However, at the time, it was not uncustomary to confuse the persona of a poem with {{the person of the}} author. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> Su Wu which became a common allusion in Chinese poetry. According to this story, during the beginning of his captivity in the Xiongnu empire Su Wu was treated harshly, to the point it is said of having to eat the lining of his coat for food and to drink snow which he melted for water. Later Su was elevated in status, even it is said given a wife who bore him children. Upon the Han emperor sending an ambassadorial mission toward the territory in which he was being held, the Xiongnu ruler (the chanyu) wished to conceal the presence of Su Wu, presumably in order avoid diplomatic complications; but, Su Wu hearing of this tricked the chanyu by claiming that he had sent a message to the emperor by tying it to the leg of a goose, and accordingly, that since his presence was already known to the Chinese delegation that any attempts at concealing his presence would be viewed as unseemly. This is {{at least part of the}} origin of the use of the image of a flying goose as a messenger, carrying tied to its foot (perhaps symbolically) a letter between two people separated so far seasonally north and south that a migrating goose could be conceived as a possible mode of communication.|$|E
500|$|Potter {{used her}} cousin's daughter, Stephanie Hyde Parker, as {{audience}} for the draft of the story.

500|$|The Killing Joke <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> Batman and the Joker; it isn't about {{anything}} that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, {{it was something that}} I thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson later {{remarked that}} [...] "Johari Window" [...] was a [...] "stand-alone" [...] episode in an interview: [...] "There is nothing from that thing that {{broadens}} the story, {{except at the}} heart of it, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> love and acceptance and family... Which of course, for these two guys, is the entire theme of the show for them. So I think we've done that really well". Actor John Noble added, [...] "Tolerance. Acceptance. I loved 'Johari Window'.

Devastated, Venetia {{attempts}} to get him back. In the process, she becomes enchanted and, for example, ends up wandering around a cemetery with bleeding bare feet. The community assumes she is insane. However, as Lucy Atkins in The Times notes, who calls this [...] "most memorable" [...] story of the collection, [...] "for her this is not madness, it is persistence." [...] As Hoyle argues, in this story Clarke toys with the stereotypes of women as both hysterical and intuitive.|$|E

500|$|In his 2013 book Bollywood Nation: India through Its Cinema, Vamsee Juluri wrote, [...] "Maya Bazar {{appeal is}} of course as much in its story as in its stars. But the {{performances}} and the beautiful songs and sets aside, the film also reveals an interesting feature of the Telugu mythological in its Golden Ageit <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> something not very important from a doctrinal view of religion at all". Juluri also termed Ranga Rao's performance as [...] "mighty and majestic". In April 2013, CNN-News18 referred to Mayabazar as a [...] "pioneer in every sense". They praised its cinematography and music, adding that Rama Rao [...] "proved his calibre as a method actor". In their 2015 book, Transcultural Negotiations of Gender: Studies in (Be)longing, Saugata Bhaduri and Indrani Mukherjee opined that Mayabazar [...] "both breaks and perpetuates the stereotypes for masculine and feminine bhavas by making a single female actor Savitri perform both the set of emotions".|$|E
500|$|Others, like {{journalist}} Nick Gillespie, see The Great Gatsby {{as a story}} [...] "underlying {{permanence of}} class differences; {{even in the face}} of a modern economy's attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers' needs." [...] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to modern day have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, [...] "While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of Gatsbys basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society." [...] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).|$|E
500|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> {{a dragon}} {{man from the}} village of Pečenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, [...] "I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me," [...] before he lay down and fell asleep. A man who swung the scythe, however, {{inadvertently}} grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood. A dragon {{from the village of}} Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a scythe blade or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would lie down on the ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, [...] "How tired I am!" [...] This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds.|$|E
