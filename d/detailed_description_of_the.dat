5|$|Much of the {{traditional}} history of the Fairy Flag is preserved in manuscript form. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Fred T. MacLeod noted one manuscript written around 1800, which he considered to be the most <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag. Another source of the flag's traditional history is the Bannatyne manuscript, which documents {{the traditional}} history of Clan MacLeod. It dates to the 1830s, however, it is thought to have been based upon earlier traditions.|$|E
5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magyars {{by western}} {{contemporary}} sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give {{the presumption that}} the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin {{since the middle of}} the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western neighbors of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave a <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E

The publication also had a general description of the Oregon Country, a <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Willamette Valley, and included {{a copy of the}} Organic Laws of Oregon adopted by settlers at the Champoeg Meetings. It was a popular guidebook for immigrants for the next ten years.|$|E
5|$|In early 1928, Chaplin {{began writing}} the script with Harry Carr. The plot {{gradually}} grew from an initial concept Chaplin had considered after {{the success of}} The Circus, where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls. This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp for the first time. A highly <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene was written, as Chaplin considered {{it to be the}} center of the entire film.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E

5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented a <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Truso in Prussia {{was another}} Baltic seaport and trade emporium {{known from the}} {{reworking}} of Orosius' universal history by Alfred the Great. King Alfred included {{a description of a}} voyage undertaken around 890 by Wulfstan from the Danish port of Hedeby to Truso, which is located near the mouth of the Vistula. Wulfstan gave a rather <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location of Truso, within the land of the Aesti, yet close to the Slavic areas west of the Vistula. Truso's actual site was discovered in 1982 at Janów Pomorski, near Elbląg.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of}} the differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E

5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving a <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Tulun now {{seized the}} initiative. Having served {{in his youth}} in the border wars with the Byzantine Empire at Tarsus, he now {{requested}} to be conferred the command of the frontier districts of Cilicia (the Thughūr). Al-Muwaffaq initially refused, but following the Byzantine successes of the previous years al-Mu'tamid prevailed upon his brother and in 877/8 Ibn Tulun received responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the Cilician frontier. Ibn Tulun marched into Syria in person. He received the submission of the son of Amajur, who had recently died, whom he appointed governor at Ramla, and proceeded to take possession of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. At Damascus Ibn Tulun encountered his old rival Ibn al-Mudabbir, who since his eviction from Egypt had served as Amajur's ʿāmil for Palestine and Damascus. Ibn al-Mudabbir was fined 600,000 dinars and thrown into prison, where he died in 883/4. In {{the rest of the}} provincial administration, however, he largely left the people who had served under Amajur in place. Only the governor of Aleppo, Sima al-Tawil, resisted, and fled to Antioch. Ibn Tulun laid siege to the city until Sima was killed, reportedly by a local woman. He then continued on to Tarsus, where he began preparing for a campaign against the Byzantines. The presence of his numerous soldiers, however, led to a rapid rise in prices, causing great hostility among the Tarsians, who demanded that he either leave or reduce his army. At this juncture, news arrived from Egypt that his son Abbas, whom he had left as his regent, was preparing to usurp his position under the influence of his entourage. Ibn Tulun hastily withdrew from Tarsus, but as more information about the situation in Egypt began to arrive, clarifying that Abbas posed no real threat, Ibn Tulun decided to spend more time in Syria and consolidate his authority. He redressed the injustices of Sima, installed troops in Aleppo (under his ghulam Lu'lu') and Harran, secured the co-operation of the Banu Kilab tribe and their leader Ibn al-Abbas, and captured the rebel Musa ibn Atamish. At some point after his takeover of Syria, Ibn Tulun ordered the refortification of Akka, a task undertaken by Abu Bakr al-Banna, the grandfather of al-Muqaddasi, who provides a <b>detailed</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work.|$|E
