40|$|Rhodamine-phalloidin {{was added}} to F-actin, and the {{orientation}} of transition dipoles of the dye was measured in single actin filaments by polarization of fluorescence. Rhodamine-phalloidin was well immobilized {{on the surface of}} actin, indicating that changes in orientation of the dye reported changes in orientation of actin monomers. In stationary filaments the dipoles were inclined at 49. 3 degrees with respect to the filament axis. The disorganization of dipoles in stationary filaments was insignificant. When the filaments were made to translate, the average orientation of the dye did not change, but disorganization slightly increased. Disorganization increased significantly when filaments were free in solution. We concluded that, within the accuracy of our measurements (approximately 18 %), actin monomers did not undergo major reorientations during motion, but that binding of myosin <b>heads</b> <b>deformed</b> the structure of filaments...|$|R

Percentages of motility, fertilization and injured spermatozoa were quantified by optic microscopy and scanned electron microscopy. These parameters were evaluated in sperm without treatment (CTR), spermatozoa incubated in cryoprotective solution but not freezed (ICS) and freezed-thawed spermatozoa (FTS). Spermatozoa of ICS treatment remained motile longer {{than those of}} CTR, whereas those of FTS treatment were lowest. Morphology of the spermatozoa was affected in several ways by the freeze-thawing treatment; some had their <b>head</b> <b>deformed</b> or swollen, others had their cell membrane folded or broken; acrosome reaction; anomalous positions or absence of mitochondria as well as broken, stiff or loss of lineal structure of tail. CTR and ICS treatments had higher percentages of undamaged sperm (87. 7 % and 79. 0 % respectively), while FTS samples had 14. 2 % of undamaged sperm. The tail was the spermatic structure most commonly injured in FTS (77. 0 %), the percentage of sperm with head injury was 55. 1 % and with acrosome reaction was 28. 7 %, whereas middle piece was affected in 23. 9 % of sperm. Percentages of fertilization were 68. 3 %, 67. 9 % and 58. 2 % for CTR, ICS and FTS respectively, which were not significantly different. There was a higher correlation between injuries and motility than between injuries and fertilization success.

50|$|Rimfire is {{a method}} of {{ignition}} for metallic firearm cartridges {{as well as the}} cartridges themselves.

Once the rim of the cartridge has been struck and the bullet discharged, the cartridge cannot be reloaded, because the <b>head</b> has been <b>deformed</b> by the firing pin impact. While many other different cartridge priming methods have been tried since the 19th century, only rimfire technology and centerfire technology survive today in significant use.|$|R

The mean functional score according to the Mallet classification system was 12. 3 points. The joint was stabile in nine, subluxed in seven and dislocated in nine cases. Gleno-scapular angle in affected joints was 23. 3 ° and in non-affected 4. 5 °. The glenoid was statistically more retroverted in older children.

40|$|Abstract The current {{treatment}} of painful hip dysplasia in the mature skeleton {{is based on}} acetabular reorientation. Reorientation procedures attempt to optimize the anatomic position of the hyaline cartilage of the femoral head and acetabulum in regard to mechanical loading. Because the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy is a versatile technique for acetabular reorientation, {{it is helpful to}} understand the approach and be familiar with the criteria for an optimal surgical correction. The femoral side bears stigmata of hip dysplasia that may require surgical correction. Improvement of the head-neck offset to avoid femoroacetabular impingement has become routine in many hips treated with periacetabular osteotomy. In addition, intertrochanteric osteotomies can help improve joint congruency and normalize the femoral neck orientation. Other new surgical techniques allow trimming or reducing a severely <b>deformed</b> <b>head,</b> performing a relative neck lengthening, and trimming or distalizing the greater trochanter.  An increasing number of studies have reported good long-term results after acetabular reorientation procedures, with expected joint preservation rates ranging from 80...|$|R
