5|$|Molly Holly's final WWE {{pay-per-view}} appearance {{occurred at}} Taboo Tuesday in 2004 as {{she appeared in}} the Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal {{along with many other}} WWE Divas. The fans voted online for the Divas to wear schoolgirl uniforms, as opposed to French maid or nurse outfits. In contrast to the other girls who wore sexy schoolgirl uniforms, Molly wore a demure 1980s-style schoolgirl uniform with large pink panties underneath. Molly failed to win the match when Stratus eliminated her by tossing <b>her</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ropes for the win. Molly's efforts in subsequent attempts to regain the title failed. Due to several wrestlers from the company's women's division being released in late 2004 and the introduction of the Raw Diva Search program, Molly was mostly left off television, only occasionally appearing on Sunday Night Heat and Raw in losing efforts to the likes of Lita, Victoria, Trish Stratus, and Christy Hemme.|$|E
