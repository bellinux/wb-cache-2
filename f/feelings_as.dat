25|$|The church recognizes and officially welcomes {{gays and}} lesbians as members under {{condition}} that they attempt to live the church's moral code. The church teaches that homosexual <b>feelings,</b> <b>as</b> distinct from behavior, may sometimes seem to be inborn, and that although these feelings are sometimes unwanted, they {{can and should be}} controlled. The church's law of chastity forbids homosexual sex in all contexts. Consistently breaking the law of chastity may result in excommunication. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints who identify themselves as gay or lesbian may remain in good standing in the church, without ramification, if they abstain from homosexual relations.|$|E

25|$|Feeling or affective {{reaction}} (vedana) {{is also at}} {{the source}} of the emotions and it is categorized in various ways; as physical or mental, as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral; and as rooted in the different senses. The Buddha also makes a distinction between worldly and unworldly or spiritual feelings, seeing spiritual <b>feelings</b> <b>as</b> superior. Out of these basic immediate reactions as well as our situational context, conceptualization and personal history arise more complex emotions, such as fear, hatred, hope or despair. The Buddhist theory of emotions also highlights the ethical and spiritual importance of positive emotions such as compassion and friendliness as antidotes for negative emotions and as vehicles for self development.|$|E

25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing the problem would not be solved in a long time. Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's <b>feelings</b> <b>as</b> a result of living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist {{that could not be}} related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past as difficult to understand he might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience could relate to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his message that he wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of Luang Pu Sodh the method was criticized by some for being extra-canonical, {{although}} Asian Studies scholar Edwin Zehner downplays this, stating there was no widespread criticism. Discussion within the Thai Sangha led to an inspection at Wat Paknam, but {{it was concluded that}} Luang Pu Sodh's method was correct. More recently, Dhammakaya meditation has been criticized as being a simplistic meditation method for busy working-people with little time. Some scholars object to this, saying that the appeal of this meditation type is rather that its benefits can be more readily experienced than more orthodox models, and noticing that it is a method with increasing levels of difficulty. As is common with all meditation techniques that emphasize samatha, the technique has been commented on mostly from a modernist standpoint, criticizing an emphasis on pleasant <b>feelings</b> <b>as</b> opposed to insight. Such critics argue against the mystical dimension of meditation practice, saying that bliss in meditation is a hindrance to insight. On the other hand, practitioners of the technique often argue how the technique is capable of changing people for the better, and has positive effects in all aspects of the practitioner's daily life.|$|E
25|$|Jackson was {{nominated}} for president by Tennessee legislature in October 1825, {{more than three years}} before the 1828 election. It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency floundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. Senator Martin Van Buren, who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in the 1824 election, {{emerged as one of the}} strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in the 1828 election. Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who also opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. In the election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good <b>Feelings,</b> <b>as</b> Jackson's supporters coalesced into the Democratic Party and Adams's followers became known as the National Republicans.|$|E
