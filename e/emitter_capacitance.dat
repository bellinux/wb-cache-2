40|$|A first direct {{measurement}} of the minority-carrier transit time in a transparent heavily doped emitter layer is reported. The value was obtained by a high-frequency conductance method recently developed and used for low-doped Si. The transit time coupled with the steady-state current enables {{the determination of the}} quasi-static charge stored in the emitter and the quasi-static <b>emitter</b> <b>capacitance.</b> Using a transport model, from the measured transit time, the value for the minority-carrier diffusion coefficient and mobility is estimated. The measurements were done using a heavily doped emitter of the Si p(+) -n-p bipolar transistor. The new result indicates that the position-averaged minority-carrier diffusion coefficients may be much smaller than the corresponding majority-carrier values for emitters having a concentration ranging from about 3 x 10 to the 19 th per cu cm to 10 to the 20 th per cu cm...|$|E
40|$|Carbon-doped GaInP/GaAs {{heterojunction}} {{bipolar transistors}} (HBT's) and heterostructure-emitter bipolar transistors (HEBT's) grown by MOCVD were fabricated. Experimental comparison of HBT's and HEBT's {{has been made}} based on the dc and the RF performance. HBT's have higher current gains than those of HEBT's in the high current regime, while HEBT's offer a smaller offset voltage and better uniformity in dc characteristics across the wafer. The current gain and cutoff frequency of the HEBT with a 150 angstroms emitter set-back layer are {{comparable to those of}} HBT's. DC (differential) current gains of 600 (900) and 560 (900) were obtained at a collector current density of 2. 5 × 104 A/cm 2 for the HBT and HEBT, respectively. The cutoff frequencies are 37 and 31 GHz for the HBT and HEBT, respectively. It is shown that there is negligible contribution of the diffusion capacitance to the <b>emitter</b> <b>capacitance</b> in HEBT's with a thin emitter set-back layer but not with a thick emitter set-back layer. The behavior of HEBT's both in dc and RF characteristics {{is similar to that of}} HBT's. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{limitation of}} Silicon bipolar transistors is the inherent tradeoff between the dc current gain and the base resistance. One can overcome this limitation of Si bipolar transistors by introducing Germanium {{into the base}} material. In last several decades, silicon-germanium (SiGe) technology has come into the global electronics marketplace for its better noise performance {{in terms of the}} minimum noise figure, high speed performance, high cut-off frequency, low base <b>emitter</b> <b>capacitance,</b> low base resistance, high current density. As noise is a component in the transistors that degrades the performance of mobile wireless receivers, amplifiers and oscillators from meeting the essential requirements imposed on them while working at high frequencies in the GHz range. Small noise improvement on device level can have a large effect on the overall system performance. In this paper, an accurate noise model of SiGe HBT having 0. 18 µm base width is being presented by observing the behaviour of its noise parameters, that is, minimum noise figure (NFmin), base transit time and a variety of analytical equations are being used to analyse and to compare the minimum noise figure NFmin {{as a function of the}} Ge concentration for rectangular or box type profile and the triangular profile of SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor for the better performance. The results of simulated model have been presented based on VISUAL TCAD Simulator tool...|$|E
40|$|When a {{transistor}} is triggared from reversely biased voltage, {{the excess}} turn on deley phenomena occurs before the ordinary response by {{the influence of}} a base to <b>emitter</b> junction <b>capacitance.</b> Analysis and experiments are carried out concerning how this excess deley time τ_d and its wave form are affected by the magnitude of reverse bias and source impedance. Moreover, taking into acount that C_{be} is a function of reverse bias, τ_D is obained by drawing approximate discharge curves of such non- 1 inear capacitance as C_{be}. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} on the pulse {{response}} of a emitter follower，an approach to the practical output wave is analysed by introducing an emitter impedance (paralell circuit of a forward emitter resistance r_E and an <b>emitter</b> diffusion <b>capacitance</b> C_{b'e}) into the modified T eqivalent circuit. The response of the transfer function for unit step input，of which the denominator polinomial is 2 nd- or 3 rd-oder in P operator，is compared respectivly. Paticulary {{in the case of}} 3 rd-order (which realizes in r_E, C_{b'e} insertion) an analog computor is used to draw the time response of the given transfer function in place of complicate culculation to time function. As a result new criteria of a critical condition for non-oescilatory is such outlined that unstable area widens in K 0. 2 for an alloy type junction unit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We report common-base medium power {{amplifiers}} designed for-band (140 – 220 GHz) and-band (75 – 110 GHz) in InP mesa double HBT technology. The common-base topology is preferred over common-emitter and common-collector topologies {{due to its}} superior high-frequency maximum stable gain (MSG). Base feed inductance and collector <b>emitter</b> overlap <b>capacitance,</b> however, reduce the common-base MSG. A single-sided collector contact reduces ce and, hence, improves the MSG. A single-stage common-base tuned amplifier exhibited 7 -dB small-signal gain at 176 GHz. This amplifier demonstrated 8. 7 -dBm output power with 5 -dB associated power gain at 172 GHz. A two-stage common-base amplifier exhibited 8. 1 -dBm output power with 6. 3 -dB associated power gain at 176 GHz and demonstrated 9. 1 -dBm saturated output power. Another two-stage common-base amplifier exhib-ited 11. 6 -dBm output power with an associated power gain of 4. 5 dB at 148 GHz. In the-band, different designs of single-stage common-base {{power amplifiers}} demonstrated saturated output power of 15. 1 dBm at 84 GHz and 13. 7 dBm at 93 GHz.
