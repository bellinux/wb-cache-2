5|$|Partridge {{was created}} by Coogan and Armando Iannucci for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy {{programme}} On the Hour, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show's sports presenter. In 1992, Partridge hosted a spin-off Radio 4 spoof chat show, Knowing Me, <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> with Alan Partridge. On the Hour transferred to television as The Day Today in 1994, followed by Knowing Me, <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> later that year. In 1997, Coogan starred as Partridge in a BBC sitcom, I'm Alan Partridge, written by Coogan, Iannucci and Peter Baynham, following Partridge's life working for a small radio station {{and living in a}} roadside hotel. It earned two BAFTAs and was followed by a second series in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the character Alan Partridge {{and many of the}} cast and writers, there are other crossovers between the fictional worlds of On the Hour, The Day Today and the radio and television series of Knowing Me <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> with Alan Partridge.|$|E
25|$|While {{working with}} Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris on the Radio 4 comedy On the Hour, Coogan {{conceived}} his {{most popular and}} developed character, a socially awkward and politically incorrect regional media personality. He appeared as a sports presenter on the television comedy The Day Today, before hosting his own chat show, Knowing Me <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> with Alan Partridge. In 1997, Partridge returned in the sitcom I'm Alan Partridge, which {{was followed by a}} second series in 2002, and received five BAFTA nominations. Partridge featured in Coogan's 2008 stand-up tour.|$|E

6000|$|... "But then," [...] {{she murmured}} in liquid Spanish, [...] "I had not beheld thee, thou great, red {{mountain}} of a man! And thou art kind and good, {{as well as}} strong. Could one choose him, <b>knowing</b> <b>thee?</b> Let him die; for then I will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt thee or me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should then}} repent {{me of the}} only hours of {{happiness}} I have known for years," [...] he said. [...] "Thou hast been to me, Gelsomina, like a flower in a desert--a pure spring to a feverish man--a gleam of hope to one suffering under malediction. No, no, not for a moment have I repented <b>knowing</b> <b>thee,</b> my Gelsomina!" ...|$|R
25|$|TalkBack became {{particularly}} {{well known for}} its comedy output, which included such shows as The Day Today (BBC Two, 1994), Knowing Me <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> with Alan Partridge (BBC Two, 1994), They Think It's All Over (BBC One, 19952006), Never Mind the Buzzcocks (BBC Two, 19962015), I'm Alan Partridge (BBC Two, 1997 and 2002), Smack the Pony (Channel 4, 19992003) and Da Ali G Show (Channel 4, 2000). Fincham served as executive producer on many of these programmes. He also helped to establish TalkBack as a noted producer in other genres, with the company moving into drama with Stephen Poliakoff's Shooting the Past (BBC Two) in 1999. In 2001, Fincham was given an Indie Award for outstanding contribution to the independent production sector.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. <b>Knowing</b> <b>you</b> are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|Following On the Hour, Partridge {{presented}} six {{episodes of}} a spoof Radio 4 chat show, Knowing Me, <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> with Alan Partridge, broadcast on 1 December 1992. The series saw Partridge annoy and offend his guests, and coined the character's catchphrase, [...] "Aha!" [...] In 1994, On the Hour transferred to television as The Day Today, in which Partridge reprised {{his role as}} sports reporter. Later the same year, Knowing Me, <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> transferred to television; the series ends with Partridge accidentally shooting a guest and attacking a BBC commissioning editor, ending his television career. It was nominated for the 1995 BAFTA for Light Entertainment Performance. The BBC broadcast a Christmas special, Knowing Me, Knowing Yule, in December 1995.|$|E

500|$|At {{the height}} of Akhmatova's fame, in 1918, she {{divorced}} her husband and that same year, though many of her friends considered it a mistake, Akhmatova married prominent Assyriologist and poet Vladimir Shilejko. She later said “I felt so filthy. I {{thought it would be}} like a cleansing, like going to a convent, <b>knowing</b> <b>you</b> are going to lose your freedom.” [...] She began affairs with [...] theatre director Mikhail Zimmerman and composer Arthur Lourié, who set many of her poems to music.|$|E
500|$|According to Forbes, Partridge has [...] "parochial bad taste", and Coogan {{described}} him as [...] "on {{the wrong side of}} cool". He is a fan of the Daily Mail newspaper, James Bond films and Lexus cars. His music taste includes Wings and Abba, naming his son Fernando and his talk show Knowing Me, <b>Knowing</b> <b>You</b> after Abba songs; Partridge's catchphrase, [...] "Aha!", also comes from Abba. In earlier incarnations, Partridge's wardrobe included a blazer, badge and tie, driving gloves, and [...] "too-short" [...] shorts, styles he describes as [...] "sports casual" [...] and [...] "imperial leisure". According to Iannucci, by the time of Alpha Papa Partridge's wardrobe had [...] "evolved to the Top Gear Presenter Circa 2005 stage", with sports jackets and a [...] "borderline-foppish" [...] fringe. As Coogan aged, the ageing make-up he wore in earlier performances became unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Bootland played Daavettila for two {{shifts in}} his first game with the Wings and more in his second game. Daavettila responded with his first {{professional}} hockey goal and went on to score 9goals and 9assists in 20games for the Wings that season. During the off-season, the New York Rangers of the NHL invited Daavettila to participate in a development camp for their recent draftees and other prospects. [...] "It was the hardest I've ever had to push myself as far as conditioning and the longevity of it", said Daavettila. Also during the off-season, the Kalamazoo Wings left the IHL to become members of the ECHL, and Daavettila {{was one of the first}} players the team signed to play in their new league. [...] "It was a weird feeling <b>knowing</b> <b>you</b> had a ... plan for next year, somebody actually wants you", he said.|$|E

500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but <b>knowing</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Vandernoot {{wanted to}} leave the show because {{shooting}} Highlander was too demanding and required her to spend several months each year in Canada. Vandernoot also wanted {{to spend more time}} with her family. According to Abramowitz, a further, artistic, reason was that [...] "...a small part of [...] being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show and sadly, the nature of the beast was that it couldn't happen and she made a decision." [...] Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to [...] "...have the women be something other than a victim, a hostage, other things when [...] dealing with an immortal hero." [...] Consequently, the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but [...] were restricted because of the character's strong relationship with MacLeod. Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said that, [...] "There was no way... to have a scene where she said, 'Okay, I'm going to go to Paris without you. Nice <b>knowing</b> <b>you,</b> MacLeod.'" [...] The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die, despite Abramowitz's feeling that her death was [...] "...sad" [...] and [...] "...heartbreaking".|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} an orchestral intro that {{introduces}} the first track [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", a downtempo song composed {{in the key}} of F-sharp major and set in a [...] time signature at a moderate tempo of 63 beats per minute. The song explores the 1950s musical style mixing doo-wop with an urban-inspired sound. Lirically, [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] uses several metaphors to speaks about someone in a car being driven by her (romantic) partner. The driver is stuck to the same old route and driving mode that may make them crash. In interview with MTV, Grande explained its lyrics saying that [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] "is about <b>knowing</b> <b>you</b> are {{at the end of}} a relationship and wishing it could not be the end and go back to the beginning and start over." [...] The second track [...] "Baby I" [...] is drenched in a [...] "retro sound" [...] from 1990s R and pop sonority. Lyrically, [...] "Baby I" [...] is a confession on Grande's behalf admitting a special love for someone and how she can't formulate her strong feelings into words. The elements of [...] "Baby I" [...] are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a syncopated beat, horns and drums.|$|E

500|$|In a game {{in which}} Penn State {{dominated}} the line of scrimmage, the Nittany Lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes, allowing Penn State to achieve their goal of rushing the football, despite not achieving offensive tackle Garry Gilliam's goal of 400 yards. Purdue's coach Darrell Hazell had opined earlier in the week that Penn State's offensive line was not as good as previous opponents Wisconsin and Iowa, and Penn State used it as motivation, dominating the line of scrimmage, which numerous offensive lineman noted was [...] "fun". Starting center Ty Howle, who noted,"It's fun, <b>knowing</b> <b>you</b> can go out there and impose your will each play. It's a lot of fun." [...] and all-conference guard John Urschel, who agreed, saying, [...] "This was a real fun game for us, with respect to coming off the ball and just hitting guys. The offensive linemen really enjoyed it. We were having a blast. When you're an offensive lineman and you're getting yards, you want to run the ball over and over again." [...] Allen Robinson caught his 78th pass of the season with his fifth catch of the game, and in doing so topped his 77 catches from the 2012 season. Aside from offensive accomplishments, the defense was also impressive, particularly play from Jordan Lucas, who ESPN commented earlier in the week plays with [...] "swagger", and who, during the game, intercepted a pass, garnering a comment from The Patriot News that he is the [...] "top playmaker in the secondary". Despite jubilation from the victory, including one Penn State player who quipped that the sixth win made Penn State bowl eligible (the NCAA banned Penn State from bowl participation as part of sanctions imposed in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal), seniors nostalgically remembered this was their second-to-last game at Beaver Stadium. The Lions bounced back from their previous loss against Minnesota, and had not lost two consecutive games under Bill O'Brien since their first two in 2012.|$|E
