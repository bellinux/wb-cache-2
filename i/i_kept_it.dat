Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
2500|$|Walter R. Hamilton {{was among}} those who {{completed}} the route. In his book The Yukon Story he describes the state of the trail thirty years after it was abandoned [...] "All evidence of the right-of-way and poles were gone, but in a few instances we found pieces of old telegraph wire imbedded several inches in the spruce, jack-pine and poplar trees that had long-since grown up and over the wires that touched them. [...] I found one of the old green glass insulators still attached to a galvanized wire. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> as a souvenir but lost it later with a camera and some clothing when a scow was nearly overturned on Lake Laberge." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Within the series, Maggie's {{relationship}} with Henry soon ends, but {{the character is}} not heavily romantically linked with any other man for months and Maggie's {{relationship with}} Bianca continues to deepen. Hendrickson was perplexed by this aspect. [...] "Maggie was asexual for a long time. It was frustrating, and I was getting confused how I should play it," [...] said Hendrickson. [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> honest: She loved Bianca as a friend. There was a possibility that she could love her more intimately. She still does love her, {{and there was a}} point in time when she might have thought otherwise. But ultimately she likes men." [...] Despite Hendrickson's early views about the character's sexual orientation, the show continued to showcase Maggie sending [...] "mixed signals" [...] to Bianca, with her romantic feelings for Bianca coming through as intense. The character is shown to resort to having sex with good guy and best friend Jamie Martin on several occasions to bury these feelings, though most of her sexual interaction with Jamie takes place offscreen. Maggie's romantic attraction to Bianca finally gets the better of her, and she impulsively kisses her. Maggie panics, however, and tells Bianca it meant nothing. Heartbroken, she finds comfort in Jamie.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it,</b> and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E

Much of the album, in particular [...] "Extraordinary Day", was inspired by her battle with cancer. Reflecting on that period of her life, Goodrem said [...] "It's weird to see pictures of that time. In some ways the fact that I was so sick was so out there, and yet <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> really private. No-one saw me on the days I was really sick. I was 18 when I was diagnosed and I had a number one album and single in the country. And in the UK, I was number two. It was such a bipolar year.|$|E
