5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} receives several surgical {{residents from}} Mercy West {{as they enter}} Seattle Grace, a repercussion of the recent merger. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is recovering from her liver transplantation surgery, after donating a portion of it to her father. In the residents' lounge, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening to fight her. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> when Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams)' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act {{in the manner of}} Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy (Robert Baker). After months of the two not speaking, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez)'s father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in homosexuality.|$|E

None of <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> patients had indwelling intravascular devices {{at the time}} that the blood samples for cultures were obtained. In addition, we reviewed the contamination rates for a cohort of patients already hospitalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DUMC inpatient medical service, most of whom had indwelling intravascular devices. The bloodstream infection rates among the patients at MNH (n = 513) and LCH (n = 486) were similar (∼ 28 %); the contamination rates at the two hospitals were 1. 3 % (7 / 513) and 0. 8 % (4 / 486), respectively. Of 54 microorganisms isolated from cultures of blood collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DUMC <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> 26 (48 %) were identified as skin contaminants. Cultures of blood collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DUMC <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> were significantly more likely to yield growth of contaminants than the cultures of blood collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> at MNH and LCH combined (26 / 332 versus 11 / 1, 003; P < 0. 0001) or collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DUMC inpatient medical service (26 / 332 versus 7 / 283; P < 0. 01). For the MNH and LCH blood cultures, lower contamination rates were observed when skin was disinfected with isopropyl alcohol plus tincture of iodine rather than isopropyl alcohol plus povidone-iodine. In conclusion, blood culture contamination was minimized in sub-Saharan African hospitals with substantially limited resources through scrupulous attention to aseptic skin cleansing and improved venipuncture techniques. Application of these principles when blood samples for culture are obtained in U. S. hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> should help mitigate blood culture contamination rates and the unnecessary microbiology workup of skin contaminants...|$|R

Methods A seven day survey of pharmacological {{management of}} aggressive people with psychosis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> of all four public psychiatric hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Results In one hospital data were not available. Of the 764 people with psychosis attending these ERs, 74 were given IM medication for rapid tranquillisation (9. 7 %, 2. 1 /week/ 100, 000). A haloperidol-promethazine mix (with or without other drugs) was used for the majority of patients (83 %). Conclusion The haloperidol-promethazine mix, given intramuscularly for rapid tranquilization, is prevalent in Rio, where it is considered both safe and efficient. However, scientific evaluation of all pharmacological approaches to rapid tranquilization of psychotic people is inadequate or incomplete and a randomized trial of IM haloperidol-promethazine is overdue. </p...|$|R

However, {{little is known about the}} follow-up of these patients after they leave the hospital. AimTo identify the clinical outcome of patients treated for epistaxis following discharge. Materials and MethodsWe analyzed the results of questionnaires from patients hospitalized for non-traumatic epistaxis between March 2006 and March 2007. Study designCohort longitudinal. ResultsFifty-four of eighty-seven patients answered (62 %). Epistaxis recurred in 37 % of the patients. Of the patients who had recurrent bleeding, 70 % were hypertensive, 35 % were chronic users of acetylsalicylic acid, and 55 % used tobacco. Forty per cent of <b>the</b> recurrences occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first week after discharge, and fifty per cent needed to return to <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> Seventy per cent of those who returned to <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> required a second treatment.
