40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the characterization of}} six different amorphous silica samples {{with respect to their}} application in cement paste. Different mixes are compared and analyzed using the mini spread-flow test method. Also the granular properties, different void fraction states of packing and distribution moduli q of the modified Andreasen and Andersen (A 2 ̆ 6 amp;A) curve are analyzed and compared using a mix design tool. In this way, a deformation coefficient is derived from the spread-flow test, which correlates with the value of the computed specific surface area (SSA) based on measured particle size distribution (PSD) and intrinsic density of the individual silica samples. Similar correlations with equal accuracy are found with a computed SSA using the BET method. Finally, the thickness of a constant water layer (24. 8 nm) around the powder particles is computed for all silica samples at the onset of flowing. The granular analysis demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} decrease the water demand of cement paste with addition of nano particles when the grading of the powders follows the modified A 2 ̆ 6 amp;A curve with a q = 0. 5 (similar to <b>Fuller</b> <b>curve)</b> and the concentration of nano particles is less than 5...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} comovement of factors driving {{commodity}} futures curves. We adopt {{the framework of}} the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model, enabling us to examine not only comovement in price levels but also futures curve shapes, as characterized by their slope and curvature. Our empirical results based on 24 commodities over the period 1995 - 2012 demonstrate that the individual commodity futures curves are driven by common components. The commonality is mostly sector specific, which implies that commodities are a heterogeneous asset class. The common components in the level of the curve have become more important over time, coinciding with the finan-cialization of the commodities market. The market-wide level component, which is common to all commodities, is related to economic output variables, exchange rates and hedging pressure. Factors driving the shape of the futures curve are related to inventory data (theory of storage), hedging pressure (theory of normal backwarda-tion) and interest rates. The use of <b>full</b> <b>curve</b> data alters findings on comovement, compared to the use of only first-nearby contract data. The <b>full</b> <b>curve</b> commonality results give more insight in the market dynamics and can help in the construction of commodity futures portfolios and hedging decisions.

The effects of strain rate and drying and wetting cycle time on the compressive strength, elasticity modulus, and stress-strain <b>full</b> <b>curve</b> are investigated. Experimental {{results show that the}} strain-stress <b>full</b> <b>curve</b> of CA mortar is affected obviously by strain rate and drying and wetting cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus increase with the strain rate under the same drying and wetting cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus decrease with the increase of drying and wetting cycle time in the same strain rate. The lower the strain rate is, the greater the compressive strength and elasticity modulus of CA mortar decrease. When the strain rate is 1 × 10 − 5 [*]s− 1 and drying and wetting cycle time is 8, the largest reduction of average compressive strength of CA mortar is 40. 48 %, and the largest reduction of elasticity modulus of CA mortar is 35. 51 %, and the influence of drying and wetting cycle on the compressive strength of CA mortar is greater than its influence on the elasticity modulus...|$|R
