25|$|Bulls have a fibro-elastic penis. Given {{the small}} amount of erectile tissue, there is little {{enlargement}} after erection. The penis is quite rigid when non-erect, and becomes even more rigid <b>during</b> <b>erection.</b> Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure.|$|E
2500|$|Arched {{door and}} window {{openings}} required {{the use of}} wood centering <b>during</b> <b>erection,</b> as did corridor arches and any type of vault or domed construction. [...] Windows were kept small and to a minimum, and placed high on walls as a protective measure in case of Indian attack. A few of the missions had imported glass window panes, but most made do with oiled skins stretched tightly across the openings. [...] Windows were {{the only source of}} interior illumination at the missions, other than the tallow candles made in the outposts' workshops. Doors were made of wood cut into planks at the carpintería, and most often bore the Spanish [...] "River of Life" [...] pattern or other carved or painted designs. [...] Carpenters used a ripsaw (or [...] "pitsaw") to saw logs into thin boards, which were held together by ornate nails forged in the mission's blacksmith shop. [...] Nails, especially long ones, were scarce throughout California, so large members (such as rafters or beams) which had to be fastened together were tied with rawhide strips. Connections of this type were common in post and lintel construction, such as that found over corridors. Aside from nails, blacksmiths fashioned iron gates, crosses, tools, kitchen utensils, cannons for mission defense, and other objects needed by the mission community. Settlements had to rely on cargo ships and trade for their iron supplies as they did not have the capability to mine and process iron ore.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic {{infusion}} cavernosometry (DICC): {{technique in}} which fluid is {{pumped into the}} penis at a known rate and pressure. It gives a measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum <b>during</b> an <b>erection.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typically, the glans is {{completely}} or partially {{covered by the}} foreskin, except in {{men who have been}} circumcised. The foreskin can generally be retracted over and past the glans, and may automatically retract <b>during</b> an <b>erection.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{function}} of the corpus spongiosum in erection is to prevent the urethra from pinching closed, thereby maintaining the urethra as a viable channel for ejaculation.

40|$|Penile skin bridges are {{adhesion}} between penile shaft {{skin and}} the glans penis after circumcision. [1] They may tether the circumcised penis during erec-tions, causing deformity and occasionally pain. [2] Skin bridges constitute healed surgical wounds and require division for correction. [1] We herein present a healthy 13 -year-old adolescent, who complaint of tightening and tugging of his penis <b>during</b> <b>erections.</b> He was circumcised {{at the age of}} three year. Clinical examination revealed three skin bridges at 3, 11 and 12 o’clock position, with a width of about 2 - 3 mm each. These acted as bridles <b>during</b> <b>erections</b> (Fig. 1). The bridges were surgically ex-cised under general anesthesia using electrocautery, with no bleeding. There was no recurrence three months after surgery. Figure 1 : Penile skin bridges. The etiology of this condition remains unknown. Several possible factors have been proposed, such as injury to the glans at the time of circumcision or incomplete separation of the inner preputial skin. [2, 3] During healing, the shaft skin can adhere to the glans and in some cases the adhesions separate partially at the corona to form bridges. [4, 5] In order to prevent the formation of penile skin bridges, care-ful suturing and good dressing at the time of circum-cision should be done. Small bridges are narrow and avascular. These can be divided {{with the use of a}} silver nitrate stick. On the other hand, the thicker more vascular ones require the use of electrocautery as done in index case...|$|R

Common complaints include; A chronic soft erection insufficient for sexual intercourse, position-dependent erectile rigidity, difficulty achieving erections, difficulty maintaining erections without constant manual stimulation and a soft glans of the penis <b>during</b> <b>erection.</b>|$|E

50|$|Straight {{barbells}} {{are almost}} exclusively worn in ampallangs, both initially {{and after they}} are healed.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the role of}} the venous outflow restriction <b>during</b> human <b>erection,</b> we compared intracavernous pressure with deep dorsal vein pressure in 6 normal subjects <b>during</b> papaverine-induced <b>erection</b> and penile saline infusion. In addition, flows necessary to produce and maintain erection were measured in 10 cadavers before and after resection of the deep dorsal vein alone or together with ligation of the cavernous veins. Elongation of tunica albuginea was measured at the crural and mid portions of the penis. At rigidity there was complete blockage of the venous return through the emissary veins. The venous outflow through the cavernous veins was reduced but still persisted. The distention of the tunica albuginea was less important at the crural portion than at the distal portion and could explain why the cavernous veins were not blocked completely.

50|$|The {{function}} of the mammalian penis relies {{on the use of}} a hydrostatic skeleton and is known as a hydrostatic organ. The hydrostatic fluid, which in this case is blood, fills the penis <b>during</b> an <b>erection.</b> Unlike the use of hydrostatic skeletons in many invertebrates, which use the bending of the animal for locomotion, the penis must resist bending and shape changes during sexual intercourse. Instead of connective fibers arranged in a helical shape, the penis contains a layer called the corpus cavernosum. The corpus cavernosum contains connective fibers arranged both parallel and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. These fibers remain folded when the penis is flaccid, but unfold as the penis fills with blood <b>during</b> an <b>erection,</b> which allows the penis to resist bending. The penises of turtles are structured similarly, although they evolved separately.|$|R

50|$|Each {{front corner}} of the chassis was fitted with a swing-out A-frame boom {{equipped}} with a screw jack and foot plate. The booms enlarged the Meillerwagen footprint to stabilise it <b>during</b> <b>erection</b> of the rocket, and provided a means of adjusting the Meillerwagen transverse level. The booms deployed outward and forward of the lifting frame trunnion axis to prevent it toppling forward or to either side.|$|E
50|$|Blood {{can leave}} the erectile tissue only through a {{drainage}} system of veins around the outside wall of the corpus cavernosum. The expanding spongy tissue presses against a surrounding dense tissue (tunica albuginea) constricting these veins, preventing blood from leaving. The penis becomes rigid as a result. The glans penis, the expanded cap of the corpus spongiosum, remains more malleable <b>during</b> <b>erection</b> because its tunica albuginea is much thinner than elsewhere in the penis.|$|E
50|$|The girder bed engine avoided {{some of this}} {{dependency}} {{by providing}} the engine with a single long bed casting that spanned the crankshaft and trunk guide. The bed was connected to its plinth {{by a number of}} short pillars. Although this bed still required care <b>during</b> <b>erection</b> to avoid twisting by clamping it down too firmly to a misaligned foundation, it did simplify engine alignment and also reduced effects if the foundation settled in service.|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of {{vasoactive}} intestinal polypeptide {{were measured}} in blood drawn from the cavernous spaces of corpus cavernosum of the human penis <b>during</b> tumescence and <b>erection,</b> {{and the effect of}} injecting the polypeptide into the cavernous spaces was studied. A significant release of the polypeptide was shown <b>during</b> tumescence and <b>erection.</b> Injection of exogenous {{vasoactive intestinal polypeptide}} induced erection. These findings support the concept of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide as a neurotransmitter in penile erection and suggest that it might have a clinical use in patients suffering from erectile dysfunction...|$|R

50|$|Erectile tissue {{exists in}} places such as the corpora cavernosa of the penis, and in the {{clitoris}} or in the bulbs of vestibule. <b>During</b> <b>erection,</b> the corpora cavernosa will become engorged with arterial blood, a process called tumescence.

This may also become slightly engorged with blood, but less so than the corpora cavernosa.|$|E
