5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 2013, Shakira {{released}} a teaser {{of the commercial}} for the fragrance along with a photo of her posing with two cheetahs. A full version of the commercial was released later. It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region. The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her {{in an effort to}} attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks.</b> They are later seen prowling around her while she is standing atop a rock and a bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed on a log of wood. The official website of the perfume also features a game made to promote the fragrance and Shakira's Barefoot Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The 1855 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured tropical cyclone landfalls in the Gulf Coast of the United States, the Greater Antilles, and Mexico, but none along the East Coast of the United States. It was inactive, with only five known tropical cyclones. Operationally, another tropical storm {{was believed to}} have existed offshore Atlantic Canada in late August and early September, but HURDAT – the official Atlantic hurricane database – now excludes this system. The first system, Hurricane One, was initially observed on August 6. The final storm, Hurricane Five, was last observed on September 17. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. At one point during the season, two tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. Two of the cyclones only have a single known point <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> due to a sparsity of data, so storm summaries for those systems are unavailable.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 5 April, the Viet Cong's 5th Division launched another major ground assault on Lộc Ninh from the west to try {{to break through the}} defenses of the southern compound. American AC-130 and AH-1 Cobra gunships stopped the Viet Cong formations <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks,</b> as supporting North Vietnamese tanks were either destroyed or forced to pull back. Despite having suffered many casualties as a result of U.S. air strikes, the Viet Cong continued their assaults well into the evening. In order to deal with the onslaught, Smith continued to direct the AC-130 Spectres against targets around Lộc Ninh. Vinh, on the other hand, was either planning to surrender or desert when he ordered two of his soldiers to open the gates of the command compound at around 10 pm. Throughout the night, the North Vietnamese 69th Artillery Command continued bombarding South Vietnamese positions around Lộc Ninh, as the Viet Cong massed for another assault.|$|E
5|$|Territory size {{is highly}} variable, ranging {{from less than}} 40km2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000km2 in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and {{boundary}} patrols. Clans mark their territories by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> once their prey crosses into another clan's range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males {{are more likely to}} enter another clan's territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan's home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. An intruder can be accepted into another clan after {{a long period of time}} if it persists in wandering into the clan's territory, dens or kills.|$|E

25|$|Armenian general Movses Silikyan ordered {{elements}} of the 5th Armenian Regiment under Poghos Bek-Pirumyan, a reserve guerrilla unit, and a special cavalry regiment to check the advance of the Ottoman army. An offensive was launched on May 22 and the Armenian forces were successful in halting the Ottomans <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> and forcing Yakub Shevki Pasha's forces into a general rout (retreating nearly 15-20 kilometers in a westerly direction). The Ottoman command, however, was able to recuperate from its losses and reorganized its forces near the mountain heights on the north-west bank of the Araks river. Repeated attempts to cross the river were met with fierce resistance by the 5th Armenian Regiment.|$|E
25|$|The drought {{breaks and}} heavy rain begins to fall, {{threatening}} to drown Jaguar Paw's family, {{who are still}} trapped in the pit cave despite their attempts to escape. Seven gives birth to another son, who is born into the now dangerously rising water. Meanwhile, the two remaining raiders chase Jaguar Paw out of the undergrowth towards the coast. As they reach the beach, all three are stopped <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> {{by the sight of}} conquistador ships anchored off the coast and Europeans making their way ashore holding up a large cross. Jaguar Paw escapes while the two raiders remain, seemingly mesmerized at the conquistadors' presence. Jaguar Paw returns in time to save his family from the flooded pit.

500|$|In {{breeding}} years, {{the loud}} booming calls {{of the males}} at their mating arenas {{made it easy for}} Māori hunting parties to track the kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using snares, pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated Polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> and making the capture easier. Cooking was done in a hāngi or in gourds of boiling oil. The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the Ngāi Tahu tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of totara tree or in containers constructed from kelp. Bundles of kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents. Also taken by the Māori were the bird's eggs, which are described as whitish [...] "but not pure white", and about the same size as a kererū egg.|$|E
500|$|Dilkes, {{instead of}} {{following}} Browne's route up the slope, {{advanced to the}} right where there was more cover and ground not visible to the French. [...] As a result, the French artillery could not be brought to bear, and Dilkes's brigade managed to get {{near the top of}} the ridge without suffering serious loss. [...] By this time, though, its formation had become disorganised, so Ruffin deployed four battalion columns in an attempt to sweep both Dilkes and the remaining [...] "Flankers" [...] back down the slope. Contrary to French expectations, the crude British line stopped the attacking columns <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks,</b> and the two forces exchanged fire. [...] Marshal Victor, by then himself on the crest of the ridge, brought up his reserve in two battalion columns of grenadiers. [...] These columns were, as with the previous four, subjected to intense musket fire and were brought to a halt just metres from the British line. [...] The first four columns had started to give ground, so Victor tried to disengage his reserves and bring them to their support. [...] However, as the two grenadier columns attempted to move off from their stalled positions, they came under additional fire from the remnants of Browne's battalion, which had renewed its own advance. [...] Prevented from rallying, the entire French force broke and fled to the valley below.|$|E

500|$|During the war, an {{incident}} occurred involving the Prince George's County jail, when local resident Dr. William Beanes, (1775–1824) captured several marauding British Army deserters from the passing army of General General Robert Ross (1766–1814) and Vice Admiral, Sir George Cockburn, (1772–1853), {{and held them}} in the County Jail, after he had treated several wounded [...] "Redcoat" [...] soldiers in their march on to Washington and the disastrous Battle of Bladensburg on the Eastern Branch stream of the Anacostia River in August 1814. Later he was arrested along with several others including Robert Bowie, former 11th Governor of Maryland (1803–06, 1811–12) by retreating British cavalry on orders from Ross who had stayed in his home as headquarters. Later Francis Scott Key (1779–1843), a Georgetown and Frederick lawyer with Col. John S. Skinner, U.S. Prisoner-of-War and Parole Agent went to Baltimore secured a small sailing ship, the Minden, and sailed down the Patapsco River and the Chesapeake Bay to find the British Royal Navy fleet after leaving the Patuxent River, beating up the Bay from their base on Tangier Island, Virginia heading for their attack on the hated [...] "nest of pirates" [...] - Baltimore. After being received and negotiating with General Ross, Admiral Cockburn and their superior, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, (1758–1832), and showing him some letters written by captured British wounded soldiers testifying to [...] the fair treatment Beanes had given them and tended to them, they agreed to free him {{but that would be}} held up until they could celebrate after the Burning of Baltimore following their attack on Fort McHenry and landing troops to the east at North Point. Well, the famous story has been told, how the general was killed prior to the skirmishing at the Battle of North Point on September 12, how the advancing British under successor, Colonel Arthur Brooke led the British regiments to face the 20,000 drafted and volunteer citizens and militia under the command of Major General Samuel Smith, (1752–1839), of the Maryland Militia on the eastern heights of [...] "Loudenschlager's Hill" [...] (later known as [...] "Hampstead Hill" [...] in modern Patterson Park, between Highlandtown and Canton neighborhoods) whose dug-in fortifications and dragged cannon were so numerous that the [...] "Redcoats" [...] halted <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> and decided to await the shelling of the fort which guarded the entrances to the Harbor to pass into the inner port and the waterfront of Fells Point. Following the failure of the fort to fall to two days of [...] "the rockets' red glare and the bombs bursting in air" [...] and their flanking troop-loaded barge attack around the west end but driven back by alert artillery seamen at Forts Covington and Babcock in a driving night rainstorm, the British fleet turned about and set sail. Key and his companions Beanes and Skinner who were startled, amazed and emotionally overcome [...] to see a huge 30 by 42 foot banner being raised {{in the light of the}} early morning with the distant booming of the morning's gun salute, knew that the fort and the city had held. When they landed at [...] "The Basin" [...] (modern [...] "Inner Harbor") and Key finished up his draft of a new poem [...] "The Defence of Fort McHenry" [...] at the Indian Queen Hotel at West Baltimore and Hanover Streets, (later to be set to music in a few days) and sung lustily through the city, performed on the stage at the famed Holliday Street Theatre, and then soon throughout the state and soon the nation as [...] "The Star Spangled Banner".|$|E

2500|$|Underground Resistance's music {{embodied}} a kind {{of abstract}} militancy by presenting themselves as a paramilitary group fighting against commercial mainstream entertainment industry who they called [...] "the programmers" [...] <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>tracks</b> such as Predator, Elimination, Riot or Death Star.
