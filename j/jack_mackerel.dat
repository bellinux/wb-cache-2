25|$|The most {{prominent}} failure of fisheries management {{in recent times}} has perhaps been the events {{that lead to the}} collapse of the northern cod fisheries. More recently, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists produced a series of journalistic investigations called Looting the seas. These detail investigations into the black market for bluefin tuna, the subsidies propping up the Spanish fishing industry, and the overfishing of the Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jamaican waters contain {{considerable}} {{resources of}} fresh-and saltwater fish. The chief varieties of saltwater fish are kingfish, <b>jack,</b> <b>mackerel,</b> whiting, bonito, and tuna. Fish that occasionally enter freshwater and estuarine environments include snook, jewfish, mangrove snapper, and mullets. Fish that spend {{the majority of}} their lives in Jamaica's fresh waters include many species of livebearers, killifish, freshwater gobies, the mountain mullet, and the American eel. Tilapia have been introduced from Africa for aquaculture, and are very common.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E
50|$|Three {{species of}} <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels</b> {{are found in}} coastal waters around New Zealand: the Australasian, Chilean and Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels.</b> They are mainly {{captured}} using purse seine nets, and are managed as a single stock that includes multiple species.|$|R

50|$|Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels</b> mainly eat fish larvae, shrimp, {{and other}} small {{crustaceans}} such as copepods, although they also eat squid and small fishes. They can live up to 16 years. Not a lot is known about their predators, though they {{have been found in}} the stomachs of albacore tuna and swordfish. Tunas, billfish, and sharks are known to prey on other carangid mackerels, and will presumably also prey on Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels.</b>|$|R
500|$|Small, benthic {{bony fishes}} {{constitute}} over 90% of the marbled electric ray's diet by weight; these include gobies, hake, sea bass, mullets, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> sea breams, goatfish, damselfish, wrasses, conger eels, and flatfish. Cephalopods such as European squid (Loligo vulgaris) and elegant cuttlefish (Sepia elegans) are a minor secondary food source. There {{is a single}} record of an individual that had swallowed a penaeid prawn, Penaeus kerathurus, and a study of captive rays found that they reject live Macropodia crabs. Off southern France, {{by far the most}} important prey species is the leaping mullet (Liza saliens). Food items are swallowed whole; there is a record of a ray [...] long that had consumed a three-bearded rockling (Gaidropsarus vulgaris) [...] long.|$|E
500|$|At night, {{when many}} diurnal fishes descend {{from the water}} column and become {{inactive}} a short distance above the bottom, the Pacific electric ray switches to an active hunting strategy. It stalks fish by slowly swimming or simply drifting through the water; when it closes to [...] of the prey, it lunges forward and again envelops the prey within its disc while delivering shocks. To better secure the fish within its disc, the ray will make short kicks with its tail that sometimes send it into barrel rolls or somersaults. Finally, the stunned prey is maneuvered to the mouth with ripples of the disc. In one recorded case, a [...] long female captured and consumed a [...] long <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus) in under ten seconds. Nighttime seine net sampling at the surface of Monterey Bay has captured Pacific electric rays in surprising numbers, suggesting that they rise upward from the bottom to feed on small fishes.|$|E
50|$|The Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{has been}} {{recognised}} as a sister {{species of the}} Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Trachurus symmetricus, since 2004. However, in its statistical returns, the FAO still treats the Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{as though it were}} a subspecies. The capture graph in the fisheries section above is based on the figures supplied by the FAO for the capture of Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and presumably includes also the capture amounts for Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus) (also {{known as}} the Californian <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> or simply <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel),</b> is an {{abundant}} species of pelagic marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is distributed along the western coast of North America, ranging from Alaska in the north to the Gulf of California in the south, inhabiting both offshore and inshore environments. The Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 81 cm, although commonly seen below 55 cm. It is very similar in appearance to other members of its genus, Trachurus, especially Trachurus murphyi, which was {{once thought to be}} a subspecies of T. symmetricus, and inhabits waters further south. Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> travel in large schools, ranging up to 600 miles offshore and to depths of 400 m, generally moving through {{the upper part of the}} water column.|$|E
5000|$|The Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus murphyi), {{the most}} intensively {{harvested}} mackerel-like species, {{is found in}} the south Pacific from West Australia to the coasts of Chile and Peru. A sister species, the Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus), {{is found in the}} north Pacific. The Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> occurs along the coasts in upwelling areas, but also migrates across the open ocean. Its abundance can fluctuate markedly as ocean conditions change, and is particularly affected by the El Niño.|$|E
50|$|Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} fished species {{which is not a}} true mackerel. They are caught commercially with surround nets designed for small pelagic purse seining, or with midwater trawls, or by trolling or longlining.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Jack</b> <b>mackerels</b> or saurels are marine {{fish in the}} Trachurus genus of {{the family}} Carangidae. The name of the genus derives from the Greek words trachys ("rough") and oura ("tail"). Some species, such as T. murphyi, are {{harvested}} in purse seine nets, and overfishing (harvesting beyond sustainable levels) has sometimes occurred.|$|R
50|$|Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> tastes {{similar to}} canned sardines. It {{may be used}} interchangeably with salmon or tuna in recipes. <b>Jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> is {{considered}} safer to consume than tuna {{because it is a}} smaller fish, and not a top predator, thus avoiding accumulation of heavy metals such as mercury.|$|E

50|$|Trachurus lathami is {{a species}} of fish in the family Carangidae and the genus Trachurus, the <b>jack</b> <b>{{mackerel}}s.</b> Common names include rough scad and horse mackerel in English, as well as chinchard frappeur (French), chicharro garretón (Spanish), jurel (in Argentina and Uruguay), and carapau, garaçuma, surel, and xixarro (in Brazil). It is native to parts of the western Atlantic Ocean, including seas off the eastern coasts of North and South America and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerels</b> started flourishing {{along the west}} coast of South America, and became {{important}} as a commercial species. The mackerel then expanded in a westward movement out into and across the open ocean, eventually reaching the coastal waters around New Zealand and Australia. During 1997 and 1998, a precipitous decline occurred in the catch (see the graph on the right), which can be attributed to changes in the sea surface temperature that accompanied the 1997-98 El Niño.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefits}} of these reefs include tourism, fisheries, and coastline protection. They bring in {{billions of dollars}} for the government each year. They give protection to the shorelines by absorbing wave energy and each year approximately six million tons of fish are {{taken out of the}} reeds. They also add biodiversity to oceans. They shelter various marine life and provide recreational activities for locals and tourists. They even provide potential medicines. They house species such as the barracudas, <b>jacks,</b> <b>mackerel,</b> night fishes, urchins, and various invertebrates.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{a number}} of species with mackerel-like {{characteristics}} in the families Carangidae, Hexagrammidae and Gempylidae are {{commonly referred to as}} mackerel. There has been some confusion between the Pacific <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus) and the heavily harvested Chilean <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus murphyi).

50|$|The high {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen results in the rich aquatic life of the Sea of Japan - {{there are more than}} 800 species of aquatic plants and more than 3,500 animal species, including more than 900 species of crustaceans, about 1,000 of fish and 26 of mammals. The coastal areas contain several kg/m2 of biomass. Pelagic (oceanic) fishes include saury, <b>mackerel,</b> <b>Jack</b> <b>mackerels,</b> sardines, anchovies, herring, sea bream, squid and various species of salmon and trout. The demersal (sea-bottom) fishes include cod, pollock and Atka mackerel.|$|R
