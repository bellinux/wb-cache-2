5|$|Around 66 BC, a {{movement}} to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The movement was based {{in the town of}} Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed <b>by</b> <b>authorisation</b> (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.|$|R

40|$|Predictions of {{the mass}} {{movement}} of workers from the CEEC 10 states to the EU 15 countries were common in the popular press during {{the run-up to the}} former 2 ̆ 7 s accession to the EU in 2004 and 2007. These forecasts induced many EU 15 politicians {{to take advantage of a}} CEEC 10 worker mobility derogation that was included in each of the latter 2 ̆ 7 s EU accession treaties. That action created considerable tension within the organization and clashed with the EU 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to the free movement of all factors of production. It also ignored much of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s own research on the question of the predicted magnitude of this phenomenon. So, was invoking that derogation actually necessary? In the continuation of an on-going project dealing with this subject, I argue that it probably was not. This paper utilizes an underused method in political science, systems modeling, to contend that, given certain assumptions about the economic conditions in both regions, the predicted volume of CEEC 10 worker movement should have been fairly modest. It also suggests that economic factors (GDP differences) matter more than political ones (use or disuse of the worker migration <b>derogation</b> <b>by</b> different EU 15 member states) in determining worker movement...|$|R
