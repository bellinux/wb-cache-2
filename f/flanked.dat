40|$|Vernier {{alignment}} thresholds {{are strongly}} compromised when the vernier {{is embedded in}} an array of equal-length <b>flanking</b> lines. Here, we show that these contextual interactions can be diminished by giving the <b>flanks</b> the opposite contrast polarity, e. g., white <b>flanks</b> surrounding a black vernier. Similar results are obtained for red verniers and equiluminant green <b>flanks</b> and when vernier and <b>flanks</b> have different binocular disparity. Using special <b>flank</b> configurations, we can eliminate location uncertainty as an important factor for this kind of contextual interactions. We interpret these results as evidence that perceptual grouping of the vernier and the <b>flanks</b> {{plays an important role in}} the vernier threshold elevation caused by contextual <b>flanks.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe study {{measured}} {{the shift in}} apparent position of a color-defined target boundary {{as a function of}} the distance, luminance polarity and amount of contrast of a nearby luminance-defined <b>flanking</b> boundary. In general, the position of the target boundary shifted towards the <b>flank</b> with the attraction being somewhat greater for negative than positive polarity <b>flanks,</b> and for high compared to low contrast <b>flanks.</b> High contrast, negative polarity <b>flanks</b> resulted in greater attraction at 3. 69 min arc separation. For low contrast <b>flanks,</b> the apparent shift in position of the target boundary depended on the polarity and position of the <b>flank</b> relative to the target. For example, for small separations (< 3 min arc) <b>flank</b> polarity had little influence, while for larger separations (⩾ 3. 69 min arc), negative polarity <b>flanks</b> exhibited attraction while positive polarity <b>flanks</b> began to show repulsion. The results support the notion that luminance and color processing may share a common representation for the localization of boundaries. Position judgments based on this representation appear to be influenced by the amount of luminance contrast in a nearby boundary...|$|R
40|$|The intronic {{sequences}} <b>flanking</b> exon–intron junctions (i. e., exon <b>flanks)</b> {{are important}} for splice site recognition and pre-mRNA splicing. Recent studies show {{a higher degree of}} sequence conservation at <b>flanks</b> of alternative exons, compared to <b>flanks</b> of constitutive exons. In this article we performed a detailed analysis on the evolutionary divergence of exon <b>flanks</b> between human and chimpanzee, aiming to dissect the impact of mutability and selection on their evolution. Inside exon <b>flanks,</b> sites that might reside in ancestral CpG dinucleotides evolved significantly faster than sites outside of ancestral CpG dinucleotides. This result reflects a systematic variation of mutation rates (mutability) at exon <b>flanks,</b> depending on the local CpG contexts. Remarkably, we observed a significant reduction of the nucleotide substitution rate in <b>flanks</b> of alternatively spliced exons, independent of the site-by-site variation in mutability due to different CpG contexts. Our data provide concrete evidence for increased purifying selection at exon <b>flanks</b> associated with regulation of alternative splicing...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} a patient with right neglect (M. A. H.) across various manipulations of the <b>flanker</b> paradigm. When required to identify a central target {{in the presence of a}} unilateral <b>flanker,</b> M. A. H. responded to the <b>flanking</b> distractor on the left (ipsilesional) side as if it were the target, even when the <b>flanker</b> appeared at left peripheral locations. A right (contralesional) <b>flanker</b> did not affect central identification performance (Experiment 1). The "ipsilesional capture" effect persisted when pretrial location markers were introduced to make the <b>flanker</b> and target locations more clearly defined (Experiment 2). However, when the ipsilesional <b>flanker</b> appeared simultaneously with a contralesional <b>flanker,</b> central target detection improved to ceiling (Experiment 3). Interestingly, with these three-stimulus displays, congruency effects in reaction time only occurred in relation to the <b>flanker</b> on the contralesional side (Experiment 3), suggesting impaired response selectivity to ipsilesional stimuli. Congruency effects were produced on both sides only when the two <b>flanking</b> distractors grouped together (by both onset and offset, Experiment 4) and when the ipsilesional <b>flanking</b> distractor grouped with the target by onset (lone contra offset, Experiment 4). The results are attributed to ipsilesional capture in central target detection, which is offset by temporal grouping processes when another stimulus appears on the contralateral side...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>flanking</b> targets can impair depth discrimination, presumably through {{a form of}} lateral interaction or visual crowding. This study investigates how stereoscopic crowding interferes with foveal depth discrimination when tests and <b>flanking</b> stimuli of different spatial configuration are located {{on and off the}} horopter in normal subjects by using psychophysical means. The magnitude of crowding increased when the <b>flanking</b> bars were in close spatial proximity to the test, between 1 to 2 arc min, and returned to unflanked levels for wider separations of 4 arc min and beyond. The magnitude of crowding depended {{on the extent to which}} the test and the <b>flanking</b> bars width matched. When flankers were placed at the optimum crowding distance (OCD) and displaced off the horopter, crowding reduced but the <b>flanker</b> effect was restored at greater <b>flanker</b> disparity. On the contrary, flankers positioned at the least crowding distance (LCD) at the onset generally showed an increase in thresholds from the fixation plane with increasing <b>flanker</b> disparity. Crowding was produced at similar small test- <b>flanker</b> separation for the range of 0. 5 to 4 cpd <b>flanker</b> spatial frequency composition used. The magnitude of crowding was greater for test and <b>flanker</b> of similar spatial frequency, though some crowding was produced when their spatial frequency differed. Overall, the results confirm previous reports showing that depth discrimination thresholds increase in the {{presence of}} <b>flanking</b> contours, but in addition suggest that disparity integration relative to the fixation demonstrates a dichotomy of fine and coarse mechanisms driven by salience attraction. Additionally, the results show that the crowding effect can be reduced by depth cues related to the width, and disparity of <b>flanking</b> stimuli. The crowding effect may be attributed to the action of local disparity interactions, but suggest the involvement of Gestalt factors (for larger <b>flanker</b> widths) and luminance flux (for thinner <b>flanker</b> widths) factors...|$|R
