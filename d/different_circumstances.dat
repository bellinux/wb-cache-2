5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in <b>different</b> <b>circumstances,</b> depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of <b>different</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in <b>different</b> <b>circumstances.</b> The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{influence}} of surface modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on CNT’s dispersion among epoxy resin, mechanical properties and electrical conductivities of CNTs has been observed. On account of above-mentioned effects, that CNTs treated with oxidizing in organic acids, a kind of surface modification, generates functional groups {{on the surface of}} CNTs is a major investigation in this study to enhance mechanical properties and electrical conductivities of CNTs. In this study, CNTs dispersed among epoxy resin well by adopting ultrasonication method and then the nano-prepreg was fabricated by mixing CNTs/Epoxy resin into carbon fiber. The influence of the different proportion contents of CNTs added into Epoxy resin on mechanical properties and electrical conductivities of composites is investigated. The strength of material tested under <b>different</b> <b>circumstance</b> is also observed. Furthermore, the creep behavior of carbon fiber/epoxy resin thermosetting composites tested under <b>different</b> <b>circumstance</b> and stress is also concerned to be analyzed...|$|R

5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which bears no consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the intellect. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in <b>different</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the very}} <b>different</b> <b>circumstances</b> from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues {{produced}} by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E
5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in <b>different</b> <b>circumstances,</b> may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a review of}} the literature concerning memory abilities and human senses performance under <b>different</b> environmental <b>circumstances.</b> A number of studies indicated that environment has a significant impact on human senses functioning. It can affect it in a mechanical way, by a chronic exposure to potentially harmful substances or processes in different work environments. Also, some cognitive abilities that have evolved to perform evolutionary essential functions lost their importance because of the change of environment impact. Moreover, training can be a source of improvement of both human senses and cognitive abilities, as well. That might suggest that, while using, under <b>different</b> environmental <b>circumstances</b> <b>different</b> cognitive abilities develop.

We also show how the evolved robots are able to generalize their ability in rather <b>different</b> <b>circumstance</b> by: (a) producing coordinated movements in teams with varying size, topology, and type of links; (b) displaying individual or collective obstacle avoidance behaviors when placed in an environment with obstacles; (c) displaying object pushing/pulling behavior when connected to or around a given object. ...|$|R
