In this paper we are mainly concerned with the lower bound on the constant of the Diophantine condition required by the theorem. From the existing proofs in the literature, this lower bound turns to be of O(ε 1 / 4), where ε {{is the size of}} the perturbation. In this paper, by means of careful (but involved) estimates on Kolmogorov’smethod, we show that this lower bound can be weakened to be of O(ε 1 / 2).

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} devoted to {{a review of the}} {{analysis}} tools which have been developed for the the mathematical study of cell centred finite volume schemes in the past years. We first recall the general principle of the method and give some simple examples. We then explain how the analysis is performed for elliptic equations and relate it to the analysis of the continuous problem; the lack of regularity of the approximate solutions is overcome by an estimate on the translates, which allows the use of the <b>Kolmogorov</b> <b>theorem</b> in order to get compactness. The parabolic case is treated with the same technique. Next we introduce a co-located scheme for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which requires the definition of some discrete derivatives. Here again, we explain how the continuous estimates can guide us for the discrete estimates. We then give the basic ideas of the convergence analysis for non linear hyperbolic conservation laws, and conclude with an overview of the recent domains of application. 1...|$|E

The second part is devoted to the regularity of solutions of Lipschitz SDE with respect to initial data. It is shown that the solution is differentiable in a slightly weakened sense. That gives for example the following simple result: under these hypotheses, if the initial variable Xo has a density, then X(t) has a density for all t.
