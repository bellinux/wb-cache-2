5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense with him as <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
25|$|De Villiers has a {{reputation}} as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who {{was also one of the}} finest fielders of his generation.|$|E
2500|$|Winston Churchill {{addressed}} a large {{audience at the}} Gardens in March 1932; when the arena's loudspeaker system broke down <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> microphone to one side, declared [...] "Now that we have exhausted the resources of science we shall fall back upon Mother Nature and do our best", and continued.|$|E

50|$|Porky {{repeatedly}} stutters {{the word}} so, and the silkworm in Porky's pocket begins sewing garment after garment. As garments come from underneath Porky's jacket, he notices they are women's underwear and brassieres; he hides them guiltily. <b>He</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> silkworm away.|$|R
25|$|Aragorn's parley is not featured. However, he and Gimli (whose {{height is}} used for comedic effect {{at the start of}} the battle) share a scene where they sneak through a side-door and <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> dwarf into a group of enemies who are {{battering}} down the doors to the keep.|$|R
2500|$|His ventriloquist act {{included}} a dummy named Danny [...] "Hooch" [...] Matador. In a TV Guide {{interview in the}} 1970s, {{he said that he}} had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> dummy overboard off a ship in the South Pacific. [...] He [...] swore that he could hear the dummy calling for help as the ship sailed on, leaving him bobbing helplessly in the waves.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a fit of}} jealousy, Wanger {{walked up}} and twice shot and wounded the unsuspecting agent. One bullet hit Jennings in the right thigh, near the hip, and the other {{penetrated}} his groin. Bennett {{said she did not}} see Wanger at first. She said she suddenly saw two livid flashes, then Lang slumped to the ground. As soon as she recognized who had fired the shots, she told Wanger, [...] "Get away and leave us alone." [...] <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> pistol into his wife's car.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{returned}} to his parents' home in Harlem in 1923 with {{no idea what he}} was going to do next. He considered returning to music, but an old school friend suggested that he try boxing. At one amateur match, fight announcer Joe Humphries saw the name [...] "Canagata, Lee" [...] on the card he was using. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> card aside and instead announced [...] "Canada Lee"—a name that Lee liked and adopted. In the amateur ring he won 90 out of 100 bouts and the national amateur lightweight title.|$|E
50|$|A local crowd gathers at a {{baseball}} park {{for a game}} between the Droops and the Drips. A lone policeman stands at the park gate discouraging spectators who have not paid to see the game. Woody notices that kids returning baseballs can get in for free, so <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> policeman a cannonball and enters the park.|$|R
50|$|Late {{one night}} in Los Angeles, Sgt. Fred Matthews (Frank Harding) and Officer Lynn Donahue (Slate Harlow) arrest a pusher who is {{carrying}} two pounds of uncut heroin. They are ambushed by gangsters Mitch Swadurski (Herman Rudin) and Lenny Potter (Philip Mansour), who kill Matthews and wound Donahue, then kill <b>the</b> pusher after <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> briefcase containing the heroin into the underbrush.|$|R
60|$|He stopped short. The sparks {{flew from}} the red end of his cigar, which <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> into <b>the</b> sea. <b>He</b> hastened towards her.|$|R
2500|$|I hadn't {{witnessed}} the full, frightening pace of Jeff Thomson until the First Test of the 1974–75 series against England. Rod Marsh, playing for W.A., had. 'He's bloody quick!' was Rod's verdict...There was a stiff breeze and I thought Max might {{use the new}} ball better. Maybe curiosity influenced me, but I gave the ball to Thommo. His first over was quick...I was standing beside Marsh as the ball thudded into his gloves. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> ball to Greg Chappell at second slip – [...] and wrung his hands. 'Something wrong, pal?' I asked. 'Christ, that hurt,' said Marsh. 'But I love it.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} magazine Sports Illustrated, {{as part of}} a 12-page {{article that}} appeared the following fall ("The Anatomy of a Miracle," [...] September 1, 1983), found no mistakes in officiating. Cal's only error was having four men in the restraining area before kickoff, an issue that did not result in a penalty. In the article, Garner said that his knee was parallel to the ground when <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> third lateral. Of the fifth lateral, SI determined that it was [...] "clearly thrown backwards" [...] and would have hit the 27 had Moen not caught it.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 February 2009, Voges made a {{stunning}} catch in a Twenty20 game against New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground to catch Brendon McCullum out for 61 in the penultimate over. Catching {{the ball on}} the boundary line, but not in full control (as the rules for a catch demand) <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> ball forwards into the air as he tumbled backwards over the boundary rope. [...] He then scrambled back into the field of play and took a diving catch low to the ground. [...] The 3rd umpire confirmed a valid catch and centre umpire Paul Reiffel (former Australian bowler) gave McCullum out. [...] Australia {{went on to win the}} match by one run.|$|E

5000|$|... (Same setting {{as in the}} Prologue). After an interlude, out at sea Pierre reads Chrysanthème's {{letter in}} which she wrote that {{although}} she was smiling when they parted, he should remember, when far away, that in Japan that there are women who love, and cry. <b>He</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> lotus flowers {{she had given him}} into the sea and asks to forget his Japanese marriage.|$|R
60|$|She poured wine {{again for}} the captain, and Marius coming {{up to the table}} filled himself a glass, which <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> off. <b>The</b> Marquise was {{speaking}} to Tressan.|$|R
2500|$|The 1903 Tigers {{went on to}} play in the South's first conference {{championship}} game, tying Cumberland 1111. The tying score came after Cumberland muffed a punt. Cumberland expected a trick play when Fritz Furtick simply ran up the middle for a touchdown. One account of the play reads [...] "Heisman saw his chance to exploit a weakness in the Cumberland defense: run the ball where the ubiquitous Red Smith wasn't. So the next time Sitton started out on one of his slashing end runs, at the last second <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> ball back to the fullback who charges straight over center (where Smith would have been except that he was zeroing in on the elusive Sitton) and went all the way for the tying touchdown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bobby Flay: Flay {{entered into}} {{a bit of a}} rivalry with Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto during the show's special New York Battle. Flay complained that his side of the kitchen was poorly laid out (it was noted in an Iron Chef America [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] episode that the kitchen was hastily set up in the {{provided}} forum). [...] At one point Flay received an electric shock, transmitted by a wet floor and faulty wiring, when he grabbed a metal pan on the range. When Flay stood on his cutting board {{at the end of the}} battle, Morimoto declared that Flay was [...] "not a chef" [...] for disregarding the cleanliness of one's cutting board. Morimoto won, but Flay was offered a rematch. He accepted, and got his revenge, in the 21st Century Battle in Japan, where, at battle's end, <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> cutting board off the counter before climbing on it, so as not to offend Morimoto again. [...] Flay is now an Iron Chef alongside Morimoto on Iron Chef America. This rivalry was revisited for a third time with Morimoto defeating Flay during the Holiday Ice Battle (November 2009- Iron Chef America) ...|$|E

50|$|At the end, Joaz {{surveys the}} ruins of his home. He picks up a small round object, a semi-precious stone carved to be a globe of Eden or Tempe or even Earth, the mythical home of humans. He plans to find the other worlds where humans live, if he can repair the alien ship. For now, he must rebuild the homes of his people. <b>He</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> globe back on the rockpile and walks away.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} half an hour, <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> twig {{from him}} with a grunt.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> {{loosened}} badge to the mayor, {{who caught}} it deftly, protesting: [...] "Oh, don't quit, Ed. You've just about won the fight. Stay with it." ...|$|E

50|$|He next {{meets the}} Third Doctor, who himself has just fought the Master and the Sea Devils; and has saved {{humanity}} by blowing up a Sea Devil base. He, blaming his Eighth self for his exile to Earth {{and for the}} Master's concurrent escape, threatens him with the Master's Tissue Compression Eliminator. But <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> weapon to him instead. The Master has again escaped to fight another day, and the Eighth Doctor leaves.|$|R
60|$|The captain's eyes narrowed. He scented business. There was {{something}} plaguily odd about this young gentleman's manner. <b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> off <b>the</b> {{remains of his}} sack, slapped down the pot and rose.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Ah!" [...] {{cried the}} goblin, whose cheeks and throat were transparent, as <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> down <b>the</b> flame, [...] "this warms one, indeed! Bring a bumper of the same, for Mr. Grub." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> still lighted pipe {{into the}} sea. The fire hissed in the waves; {{the same instant}} the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.|$|E
60|$|Standing at {{the head}} of the broad steps, <b>he</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> pretty {{creature}} outward and upward. She caught herself with a quick beat of wings, fluttered about undecidedly for a space, then rose in the air.|$|E
60|$|The urchin {{held out}} his dirty hand, and I put the coin into it. <b>He</b> smiled, <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> sixpence, caught it deftly, and {{transferred}} it to his right trousers pocket.|$|R
5000|$|In San Francisco, Krusty informs all the Ribheads {{that the}} Ribwich {{can no longer}} be made, as the animal from which it is made is now extinct. <b>He</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> last one into the crowd.

He agrees to the trade and takes off in the car.|$|R
