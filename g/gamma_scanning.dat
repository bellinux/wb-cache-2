40|$|A gamma {{counting}} {{system has}} been assembled that can profile the breakthrough fronts of gamma-emitting radioisotopes longitudinally and axially along a loaded column. This profiling technique has been particularly useful in columns studies such as those performed with IONSP IE- 911, a crystalline silicotitanate (CST) manufactured by UOP, in which unusually long operating times are required to observe cesium breakthrough in column effluent. The length of the mass transfer zone and extent of column saturation can be detected early in a column study by viewing the relative emission of gamma emitters along I {{the length of the}} column. In this study, <b>gamma</b> <b>scans</b> were used to analyze loaded CST and zeolite columns used in the treatment of process wastewater simulant and actual groundwater. Results indicate good run-to-run reproductibility in acquiring the <b>scans.</b> The longitudinal <b>gamma</b> <b>scans</b> for both {sup 90 }Sr and {sup 137 }Cs conformed with breakthrough results reported on the basis of column effluent activity. Although not obvious from data obtained by monitoring effluent activity, the <b>gamma</b> <b>scans</b> indicated that both cesium and strontium in the saturated zone of the CST column are slowly displaced by the higher levels of groundwater cations and are then resorbed further down the column. This displacement phenomenon identified by <b>gamma</b> <b>scans</b> was verified using data from a zeolite column, in which both the <b>gamma</b> <b>scan</b> and column effluent data exhibited radionuclide displacement by groundwater cations.

40|$|Requirements for {{effective}} safeguards {{during the transition}} to environmental management at nuclear material production facilities within the DOE complex are deriving improvements in the accuracy of nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques. An {{important aspect of the}} transition is the need for facilities to terminate safeguards on waste materials, thus reducing the cost for safeguards at the facility. Requirements for the termination of safeguards on candidate waste material have been established by DOE to minimize the potential for diversion or theft of nuclear material. Because heterogenous waste and residue materials are stored in large containers such as 208 -L drums, conventional assay techniques such as segmented <b>gamma</b> <b>scanning</b> (SGS) that were developed to assay small samples cannot always provide accurate measurements. Consequently, facilities using the conventional NDA instrumentation may be limited in their ability to discard waste materials in compliance with DOE requirements. One technique being applied to improve the accuracy of assays of waste in large containers is computerized tomography (CT). Research on the application of CT to improve both neutron and gamma-ray assays of waste is being carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
