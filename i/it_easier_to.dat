5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} line operated {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and to make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> expand into the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Before filming began Dorff, Fanning, and Lala Sloatman (who plays Marco's ex-wife) improvised {{meals and}} fights to {{understand}} the family's dynamic. Dorff also collected Fanning from school and they spent an afternoon together to bond. Dorff stayed in the Chateau Marmont during principal photography, making <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> get to the set and understand the character. Coppola also showed Dorff Paper Moon (1973) during production.|$|E
5|$|Harrison became {{chairman}} of the Committee on Public Lands and successfully promoted passage of the Land Act of 1800, which made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> buy land in the Northwest Territory in smaller tracts at a low cost. The sale price for public lands was set at $2 per acre. This became an important contributor to rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.|$|E
5|$|Kings Cross {{came into}} the {{ownership}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921. The LNER made improvements to various amenities, including toilets and dressing rooms underneath what is now platform 8. The lines through the Gas Works tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> manage {{the increasing number of}} local trains.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Interim Report of the Digital Radio Working Group {{published in}} 2008 specified that the 50% threshold for listening figures {{should be based}} on those for DAB.

5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as it would make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he found <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but {{producers}} {{were never}} satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge {{after he had}} an affair, but the producers and Gatiss found <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> mention he died because he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas. The ending also changed; the final scene had originally involved Moriarty entering the Tower of London but that was held back for the following episode.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{the state}} {{legislature}} began to reform the laws that governed the production of alcoholic beverages. With {{the passing of the}} New Jersey Farm Winery Act in 1981, and laws providing for licenses for brewpubs and microbreweries in the 1990s, these two industries have grown significantly and the number of wineries and breweries have steadily increased. In February 2013, New Jersey issued the first new distillery license since before Prohibition, and legislation has been proposed to make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> establish craft distilleries in New Jersey. , New Jersey currently has 48 wineries, 28 breweries, and 2 distilleries.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people {{more likely to engage in}} unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made {{it long enough}} to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing {{to make him look}} younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword to make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E

5|$|Literature {{in early}} modern Scotland is {{literature}} written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance {{in the early}} sixteenth century and {{the beginnings of the}} Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid-eighteenth century. By the beginning of this era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands, but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. Middle Scots became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of a printing press in 1507 made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.|$|E
