50|$|More {{specifically}} J.R. Edwards (2013) explained: Matheson {{was one of}} {{the first}} writers to distinguish properly between depreciation (from shortening of the working life of an asset, through physical deterioration), obsolescence (from external causes, such as supersession by improved machines), and <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> (through changes in market prices). He regarded depreciation much as modern accountants do —- as a measure of consumption of capital, rather than as a revaluation of the asset, and hence as a cost of production, not a voluntary appropriation of profits for replacement. Obsolescence, he thought, should be covered by acceleration of the rate of depreciation. Fluctuation was to be ignored until a revaluation was necessary, for example, on a change of partners.|$|E

Thus, if we address the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> B <b>values</b> by considering the local condition of heterogeneities, the estimation of epicentral distances becomes more accurate, which in turn improves {{the accuracy of the}} EEW system.|$|R
40|$|Background Fraction of exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (Feno), {{a marker of}} airway inflammation, has been {{proposed}} to be useful for asthma management, but conclusions are inconsistent. This {{might be due to}} the failure of mean statistics to characterize individual variability <b>in</b> Feno <b>values,</b> which is possibly a better indicator of asthma control than single measurements. Objective We characterized fractal <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> daily Feno <b>values</b> over time and the relationship between Feno values and symptom scores. We investigated whether these are associated with asthma severity, control, and exacerbation risk. Methods Daily Feno values and symptom scores over 192 days in 41 atopic asthmatic children from the Childhood Asthma Respiratory Inflammatory Status Monitoring study were analyzed. Two methods of time-series analysis were used: detrended fluctuation analysis to quantify fractal patterns <b>in</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> daily Feno <b>values</b> (α value) and cross-correlation to quantify the strength of the relationship between daily Feno values and symptom scores. The associations of α values and cross-correlation with markers of asthma severity and control were assessed by means of regression analysis. Results Daily <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> Feno <b>values</b> exhibited fractal-type long-range correlations. Those subjects receiving higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids at study entry had a significantly lower α value, corresponding to more random <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> Feno <b>values</b> <b>in</b> those with greater inhaled corticosteroid need. The cross-correlation between Feno values and symptom scores was significantly higher in those subjects who had exacerbations. Conclusions <b>Fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> Feno <b>values</b> and their cross-correlation to symptom scores contains information on asthma severity and control. Methods that quantify the complexity of asthma over time might assist in identifying asthmatic subjects with concordance between eosinophilic inflammation and symptoms and thus increased exacerbation risk...|$|R

In response, predicting the market price of a virtual currency is an important task for all involved, {{but it has not}} yet attracted much attention from researchers. This paper presents user opinions from online forums in a massive multiplayer online game (MMOG) setting widely used around the world. We propose a method for predicting the next-day {{rise and fall of the}} currency used in an MMOG environment. Based on analysis of online forum users’ opinions, we predict daily fluctuations in the price of a currency used in an MMOG setting.

50|$|For example, a {{household}} {{in possession of}} an $800,000 house, $5,000 in mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000. Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household's assets (900,000 − $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of the underlying assets.|$|R

40|$|While {{outsourcing}} {{of production}} from the U.

This paper is among {{the first in the}} trade literature to study the second moment properties of outsourcing. We begin by documenting a new stylized fact: the maquiladora outsourcing industries <b>in</b> Mexico experience <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> added that are roughly twice as volatile as the corresponding industries in the U. S. A difference-in-difference method is extended to second moments to verify the statistical significance of this finding. We then develop a stochastic model of outsourcing with heterogeneous firms that can explain this volatility. The model employs two novel mechanisms: an extensive margin in outsourcing which responds endogenously to transmit shocks internationally, and translog preferences which modulate firm entry. ...|$|R

5000|$|The key {{provision}} in Hamilton ’s fiscal reform, termed “assumption”, {{called for the}} thirteen states to consolidate their outstanding debt of $25 million [...] and transfer it to the central government for servicing under the general funding plan. [...] Hamilton’s chief objectives were both economic and political. Economically, state securities were vulnerable to local <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>value,</b> and consequently, to speculative buying and selling - activities that would threaten the integrity of a national credit system. Furthermore, with each state legislature formulating separate repayment plans, {{the federal government would}} be forced to compete with states for sources of tax revenue. Hamilton’s “assumption” promised to obviate these conflicts. [...] Politically, Hamilton sought to [...] "tie the creditors to the new central government" [...] by linking their financial fortunes to the success of his economic nationalism. This, in turn, would gradually cause decline in state authority, and a relative increase in Federal influence.|$|R

The things most liable to <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>value,</b> those directly influenced by the seasons, and especially food, were seldom carried to any great distances. In most years, accordingly, there was, in some part or other of any large country, a real dearth; while a deficiency at all considerable, extending to the whole world, is [now] a thing almost unknown.
