40|$|Housing is {{essential}} to the wellbeing and development of most societies. It is a complex asset, with links to livelihoods, health, education, security and social and family stability.

Housing interventions face significant challenges that cannot simply be wished away. But if agencies are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> housing reconstruction in the aftermath of conflict and disaster, then there is a clear need to find ways of doing it better. This paper reviews experiences in housing reconstruction in the aftermath of natural disaster and conflict.
