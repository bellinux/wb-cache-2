40|$|The use of {{lighting}} simulation tools {{has been growing}} {{over the past years}} which has improved lighting analysis. While computer simulations have proven to be a viable tool for analyzing lighting in physical environments, they have difficulty in assessing the effects of light on occupant’s perception.

40|$|The “new {{evidence}} scholarship”, {{which has}} revitalised evidence {{research and teaching}} in North America in the last thirty years, still {{seems to have had}} very little impact in Australia. The key feature of this new scholarship is a transformation of evidence “from a field concerned with the articulation of rules to a field concerned with the process of proof”, “a shift away from the rules of evidence towards the process of proof and the way inferences should be drawn from a mass of evidence”. In Australia one can point to scholars such as Richard Eggleston, David Hodgson, David Hamer, and Andrew Ligertwood, as having published work which falls somewhere on a spectrum that ranges from actively engaging with the new evidence scholarship, to applying its insights, to sharing its concerns.

40|$|An {{evidence-based}} methodology {{was adopted}} {{in this research}} to establish strategies to increase lead recovery and recycling via a systematic review and critical appraisal of the published literature. In particular, the research examines pollution prevention and waste minimization practices and technologies that meet the following criteria: (a) reduce/recover/recycle the largest quantities of lead currently being disposed of as waste, (b) technically and economically viable, that is, ready to be diffused and easily transferable, and (c) strong industry interest (i. e., industry would consider implementing projects with higher payback periods). The following specific aims are designed to achieve the study objectives: Aim 1 – To describe the recycling process of recovering refined lead from scrap; Aim 2 – To document pollution prevention and waste management technologies and practices adopted by US stakeholders along the trajectory of LAB and lead product life cycle; Aim 3 – To explore improved practices and technologies which are employed by other organizations {{with an emphasis on}} the aforementioned criteria; Aim 4 – To demonstrate the economic and environmental costs and benefits of applying improved technologies and practices to existing US smelting operations; and Aim 5 – To evaluate improved environmental technologies and practices using an algorithm that integrates quantitative and qualitative criteria. The process of identifying relevant articles and reports was documented. The <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> was presented for current practices and technologies used by US smelters as well as improved practices and technologies. Options for integrated environmental solutions for secondary smelters were introduced and rank ordered on the basis of costs (i. e., capital investment) and benefits (i. e., production increases, energy and flux savings, and reduction of SO 2 and slag). An example was provided to demonstrate the utility of the algorithm by detailing the costs and benefits associated with different combinations of practices and technologies. The evidence-based methodology documented in this research reveals that it is technically and economically feasible to implement integrated environmental solutions to increase lead recovery and recycling among US smelters.

We asked whether there was a radiographic cor-relation between intraoperative long-cassette scoliosis film and postoperative standing radiographs of adolescent idi-opathic scoliosis with pedicle screw instrumentation. We retrospectively reviewed 44 patients with adolescent idio-pathic scoliosis who underwent posterior instrumentation with pedicle screws. We made preoperative, intraoperative (after instrumentation and correction), and standing postoperative radiographic measurements (eg, curve mag-nitudes, coronal and sagittal balance, disc angles) and compared those for the intra- and postoperative radio-graphs. The intraoperative long-cassette scoliosis film correlated with the immediate postoperative standing film for all curve correction and balance parameters. The rou-tine use of a long-cassette intraoperative scoliosis film provides the surgeon with a valuable tool to guide intra-operative decision-making and foreshadows the correction and balance obtained on the immediate postoperative film.

These cases are technically difficult and add considerable {{burden on the}} healthcare system. Many patients have concomitant low back pain that may interfere with functional outcome. We asked whether having low back pain at baseline would influence amount and rate of improvement on standardized outcomes measures after rev-TKA. We retrospectively reviewed 308 patients from prospectively collected data in a multicenter study. A minimum 24 -month followup was available for 221 patients (71. 8 %). Patients with low back pain at baseline had worse scores on most instruments than their counterparts at baseline, 12 months postsurgery, and 24 months postsurgery. The data suggest concomitant back pain in patients undergoing rev-TKA affects their out-comes as measured by standardized instruments. Orthopaedic surgeons should counsel their patients with back pain regarding the possibility of slower or less com-plete recovery. Level of Evidence: Level II, prognostic study.

40|$|Developmental {{dysplasia}} {{of the hip}} (DDH) is a neonatal {{condition with}} various causes. Neuromuscular dysplasia of the hip (NDH) is a sequel of neuromuscular disease, and generally presents later in childhood than DDH. Some evidence, however, supports a concept of a neuromuscular etiology of DDH: (1) a high prevalence of spinal dysraphism in DDH; and (2) abnormal sensory evoked potentials in 31 % of DDH patients. To explore this suggestion we ascertained the presence of neuromuscular disease within a cohort of DDH patients, and asked whether the neuromuscular condition is the initial etiology of the dysplasia or a coincidental finding. We retrospectively reviewed patients presenting with DDH. Only those with an initial diagnosis of DDH and a subsequent diagnosis of a neuromuscular condition were assessed. Fifteen of 560 patients fulfilled the criteria, however the presence of true DDH within this group was minimal, as several cases emerged as early presenting NDH. We therefore believe it unlikely DDH has a substantial neurological etiology. Level of evidence: Level III, prognostic study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sarcomas in or contaminating {{the knee}} are rare but {{extremely}} challenging to treat. Complete resection {{of the joint}} is necessary, and often the entire extensor mechanism is removed as well. Reconstruction of the knee is challenging, and the resulting function may be compromised. <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> TECHNIQUE: We describe a surgical technique of extraarticular resection of the knee while preserving the extensor mechanism combined with prosthetic reconstruction. The medial and lateral retinaculum is prepared such that it allows extraarticular placement of K-wires that are driven through the patella and the proximal tibia, serving as in situ guides for the osteotomies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 11 patients with sarcomas contaminating the knee. The minimum followup was 14 months (mean, 38 months; range, 14 - 80 months). RESULTS: At last followup patients had a mean flexion of 88 ° (range, 65 °- 120 °). We observed no complications related to the extensor mechanism, {{and there was one}} local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We believe extraarticular resection of the knee with preservation of the extensor mechanism is a reasonable treatment option for intraarticular sarcomas with functional scores comparable to those for patients having intraarticular resections.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgical {{treatment}} options for sternoclavicular joint luxations {{described in the}} literature are numerous, although all have limitations. Therefore, there is no favorable surgical treatment for sternoclavicular luxations when nonoperative treatment has failed. <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> TECHNIQUE: We developed the polydioxanone (PDS) envelope plasty, a modification of the figure-of-eight technique, using a PDS ligament. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 39 patients (40 joints), treated with a PDS envelope plasty for invalidating sternoclavicular luxations. The minimum followup was 10 months (average, 52 months; range, 10 - 171 months). The Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant-Murley shoulder score, and subjective categorical results were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: In most patients, postoperative functional shoulder scores were excellent (mean Constant-Murley score, 90, range, 52 - 100; mean SST, 10; range, 2 - 12). Ninety percent of patients had an improvement of shoulder function at followup. Only minor complications occurred. Thirteen percent of patients had spontaneous postoperative subluxations. However, the postoperative shoulder function improved in all these patients. CONCLUSIONS: The PDS envelope plasty is a simple procedure, a modification of the best-reported technique. We have promising results with high shoulder scores. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

The present updated study shows the results after fifteen to twenty years. One stem was revised again for mechanical reasons during a rerevision of an acetabular cup. The probability of survival at seventeen years was 96 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 72 % to 99 %) with a femoral rerevision for any reason as the end point and 100 % (95 % one-sided CI, 69 % to 100 %) with rerevision for aseptic loosening as the end point. The average subsidence was 3 mm and stable relative to our previous report. Although three early femoral fractures occurred after this surgery, in this update no additional fractures were seen.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests performing total knee arthroplasty using computer navigation {{can lead to}} more accurate surgical positioning of the components and knee alignment compared to a conventional operating technique without computer assistance. The use of robotic technology could theoretically take this accuracy one level further because it uses navigation in combination with ultimate mechanical precision, which could eliminate or reduce the inevitable margin of error during mechanical preparation of the bony cuts of total knee arthroplasty by the surgeon. We prospectively followed 25 consecutive cases using an active surgical robot. The minimum followup was 5. 1 years (mean, 5. 5 years; range, 5. 1 - 5. 8 years). Our results demonstrate excellent implant positioning and alignment was achieved within the 1 degree error of neutral alignment in all three planes in all cases. Despite this technical precision, the excessive operating time required for the robotic implantation, the technical complexity of the system, and the extremely high operational costs have led us to abandon this procedure and direct our interest more toward smart semiactive robotic systems.

40|$|Prior {{studies suggest}} {{the cost of}} {{allograft}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is less than that for autograft reconstruction. Charges in these studies were influenced by patients requiring inpatient hospitalization. We therefore determined if allograft ACL reconstruction would still be less costly if all procedures were performed in a completely outpatient setting. We retrospectively reviewed 155 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction in an ambulatory surgery center between 2001 and 2004; 105 had an autograft and 50 had an allograft. Charges were extracted from itemized billing records, standardized to eliminate cost increases, and categorized for comparison. Surgeon and anesthesiologist fees {{were not included in}} the analysis. Groups were compared for age, gender, mean total cost, mean cost of implants, and several other cost categories. The mean total cost was $ 5465 for allograft ACL reconstruction and $ 4872 for autograft ACL reconstruction. There were no differences in complications between the two groups. Allograft ACL reconstruction was more costly than autograft ACL reconstruction in the outpatient setting. The cost of the allograft outweighs the increased surgical time needed for harvesting an autograft. Level II, economic and decision analyses.

40|$|Abstract Recurrent or {{persistent}} infection after two-stage exchange arthroplasty for previously infected total knee replacement is {{a challenging}} clinical situation. We asked whether a second two-stage procedure could eradicate the infection and preserve knee function. We evaluated 18 selected patients with failed two-stage total knee arthro-plasty implantation {{treated with a}} second two-stage reimplantation between 1999 and 2005. Failure of treat-ment was defined as recurrence or persistence of infection. The minimum followup was 24 months (mean, 40 months; range, 24 – 83 months). Recurrent or persistent infection was diagnosed in four of 18 patients, two of whom were successfully treated with a third two-stage exchange arthroplasty. Knee Society score questionnaires adminis-tered at the last followup showed an average Knee Society knee score of 73 points (range, 24 – 100 points) and an average functional score of 49 points (range, 20 – 90 points). The data suggest repeat two-stage exchange arthroplasty is a reasonable option for eradicating periprosthetic infection, relieving pain, and achieving a satisfactory level of func-tion for some patients.
