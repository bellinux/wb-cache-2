Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>my</b> little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how lucky he was to have me and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really sweet little story actually. Very touching".|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>my</b> drunk scenes. I {{know that}} may sound very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E

[...] Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name [...] "Leelah", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding [...] "We don't support that, religiously."

In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death. We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ... I simply do not wish our words to be used against us." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{suffering}} {{ill health}} {{for several years}} and bouts of diarrhoea, Hopkins died of typhoid fever in 1889 and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, following his funeral in Saint Francis Xavier Church on Gardiner Street, located in Georgian Dublin.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Augustine {{was sent}} to school at Madaurus (now M'Daourouch), a small Numidian city about [...] south of Thagaste. There he became {{familiar}} with Latin literature, as well as pagan beliefs and practices. His first insight {{into the nature of}} sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography, The Confessions. He remembers that he did not steal the fruit because he was hungry, but because [...] "it was not permitted." [...] His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, and I loved it. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>my</b> own error—not that for which I erred, but the error itself." [...] From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ.|$|E
