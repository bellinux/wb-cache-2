We show that to gain accord with the <b>Fine-tuning</b> Rule, then both Higgs mass and the traditional Δ_BG <b>fine-tuning</b> measures reduce to the model-independent electroweak <b>fine-tuning</b> measure Δ_EW. This occurs by combining dependent contributions to m(Z) or m(h) into independent units. Then, using Δ_EW, we evaluate EW <b>fine-tuning</b> for a variety of SUSY models including mSUGRA, NUHM 1, NUHM 2, mGMSB, mAMSB, hyper-charged AMSB and nine cases of mixed moduli-anomaly (mirage) mediated SUSY breaking models (MMAMSB) whilst respecting LHC Higgs mass and B-decay constraints (we do not impose LHC 8 sparticle mass constraints due to the possibility of compressed spectra within many of these models). We find mSUGRA, mGMSB, mAMSB and MMAMSB models all to be highly <b>fine-tuned.</b> The NUHM 1 model is moderately <b>fine-tuned</b> while NUHM 2 which allows for radiatively-driven naturalness (RNS) allows for <b>fine-tuning</b> at a meager 10...|$|R

5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to <b>fine-tune</b> the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors.

He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down.

5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to <b>fine-tune</b> his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

40|$|Our laws {{of nature}} and our cosmos appear to be delicately <b>fine-tuned</b> for life to emerge, {{in a way that}} seems hard to {{attribute}} to chance. In view of this, some have taken the opportunity to revive the scholastic Argument from Design, whereas others have felt the need to explain this apparent <b>fine-tuning</b> of the clockwork of the Universe by proposing the existence of a `Multiverse'. We analyze this issue from a sober perspective. Having reviewed the literature and having added several observations of our own, we conclude that cosmic <b>fine-tuning</b> supports neither Design nor a Multiverse, since both of these fail at an explanatory level as well as in a more quantitative context of Bayesian confirmation theory (although there might be other reasons to believe in these ideas, to be found in religion and in inflation and/or string theory, respectively). In fact, <b>fine-tuning</b> and Design even seem to be at odds with each other, whereas the inference from <b>fine-tuning</b> to a Multiverse only works if the latter is underwritten by an additional metaphysical hypothesis we consider unwarranted. Instead, we suggest that <b>fine-tuning</b> requires no special explanation at all, since it is not the Universe that is <b>fine-tuned</b> for life, but life that has been <b>fine-tuned</b> to the Universe.

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} <b>fine-tuning</b> {{associated}} to electroweak breaking in Little Higgs scenarios {{and find it}} to be always substantial and, generically, much higher than suggested by the rough estimates usually made. This is due to implicit tunings between parameters that can be overlooked at first glance but show up in a more systematic analysis. Focusing on four popular and representative Little Higgs scenarios, {{we find that the}} <b>fine-tuning</b> is essentially comparable to that of the Little Hierarchy problem of the Standard Model (that these scenarios attempt to solve) and higher than in supersymmetric models. This does not demonstrate that all Little Higgs models are <b>fine-tuned,</b> but stresses the need of a careful analysis of this issue in model-building before claiming that a particular model is not <b>fine-tuned.</b> In this respect we identify the main sources of potential <b>fine-tuning</b> that should be watched out for, in order to construct a successful Little Higgs model, whic...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} discuss the {{definition}} of modularity (Q) used as a metric for community quality and then we review the modularity maximization approaches which were used for community detection in the last decade. Then, we discuss two opposite yet coexisting problems of modularity optimization: in some cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in others, large communities over small ones (so called the resolution limit problem). Next, we overview several community quality metrics proposed to solve the resolution limit problem and discuss Modularity Density (Qds) which simultaneously avoids the two problems of modularity. Finally, we introduce two novel <b>fine-tuned</b> community detection algorithms that iteratively attempt to improve the community quality measurements by splitting and merging the given network community structure. The first of them, referred to as <b>Fine-tuned</b> Q, is based on modularity (Q) while the second one is based on Modularity Density (Qds) and denoted as <b>Fine-tuned</b> Qds.
