This paper proposes a mechanism for prebiotic chemistry in clouds that answers Scherer's concerns and supports Woese's hypothesis. According to this mechanism, rapid prebiotic chemical evolution was facilitated on the primordial earth by cycles of condensation and evaporation of cloud <b>drops</b> containing clay <b>condensation</b> nuclei and nonvolatile monomers.

40|$|Aircraft {{observations}} of clouds and aerosols were {{conducted during the}} Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) executed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology over the Indian subcontinent {{during the period of}} May–September 2009. Existence of aerosol layer with large concentrations of cloud <b>drop</b> <b>condensation</b> nuclei extended up to heights of 4 to 5 km was observed over the rain shadow areas to the east of the Western Ghats over central India. The thick aerosol layers were observed to suppress the formation of warm rain in convective clouds up to heights of about 7 km, where mixed phase precipitation formed. This prevented clouds that did not exceed this height from precipitating significantly. This might invigorate the very deep clouds on expense of the smaller clouds. The aerosol radiative effects are suspected to decrease the surface heating and hence the available energy for propelling the convection. The net effect of the aerosols on the rainfall amounts is unknown due to the complexity of the effect, but it is suspected to be detrimental in an area where the rainfall is critical to the livelihood of the inhabitants.

40|$|Abstract: After lightning, {{precipitation}} formed, these lightning phenomena {{occur in}} the atmosphere by high power laser pulse. After striking the laser pulse, <b>condensation</b> and water <b>drop</b> formation {{take place in the}} atmosphere. It is well known that, for water <b>drop</b> formation, <b>condensation</b> must occurred (condensation is the basic need for water <b>drops</b> formation). <b>Condensation</b> means, heat energy subtraction. Heat energy subtraction take place by only endothermic reaction in the atmosphere. Recently M. Petrarca et al and other scientist also proved that, condensation in air could be induced by laser pulse. NO and ozone found after inducing laser pulse is evidence of endothermic reaction. Lightning or laser shot creates high temp breaking bonds of Nitrogen (N 2) and Oxygen (O 2) to formed excited N * and O * consequently NO & Ozone formation. At that time endothermic process starts. In these endothermic reactions heat energy get absorbed from surrounding atmospheric water vapor, catalyzing <b>condensation</b> and water <b>drop</b> formation by dissociation in the atmosphere. Also other processes responsible for <b>condensation</b> and water <b>drop</b> formation are dissociation, ionization and natural seeding process creates (CCN) which may be useful for Artificial Rainmaking in the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{present study}} explores {{condensation}} of FC- 72 through a microchannel heat sink cooled by a counterflow {{of water in}} tubes that are soldered to {{the underside of the}} heat sink. The microchannels were formed by machining 10 of 1 mm square grooves across the 20. 1 mm width of a 300. 0 mm long copper plate, which was topped with a transparent plastic plate. Experiments were performed with the FC- 72 spanning the following conditions: inlet pressure of 104. 0 - 133. 0 kPa (15. 09 - 19. 29 psi), flow rate of 0. 682 - 3. 665 g/s, inlet quality of 1. 0 - 1. 1, and with water flow rates of 2. 97 - 5. 95 g/s. Both pressure drop and temperature drop were measured in the FC- 72 across the heat sink. In addition, temperatures were measured at many locations within the copper plate. These measurements were used to explore trends in both the pressure <b>drop</b> and <b>condensation</b> heat transfer coefficient. Measured pressure <b>drop</b> and <b>condensation</b> heat transfer coefficient values ranged from 0. 547 to 24. 832 kPa (0. 08 to 3. 60 psi) and 176. 08 to 11, 448 W/m 2 -K, respectively. Pressure drop was found to increase with increasing flow rate of FC- 72. The condensation heat transfer coefficient was highest at the channel inlet and increased with increasing flow rate of FC- 72 and/or deceasing flow rate of water. In addition to the measurements, high-speed and close-up photographic techniques were used to map dominant two-phase flow regimes and determine operating conditions that yield the annular flow regime responsible for netting the highest heat transfer coefficients. A new turbulent annular film model recently developed at the Boiling and Two-Phase Flow Laboratory (BTPFL) is shown to predict both the pressure <b>drop</b> and the <b>condensation</b> heat transfer coefficient for the annular regime with high degrees of accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Water {{droplets}} condensing on solidified {{phase change}} {{materials such as}} benzene and cyclohexane near their melting point show in-plane jumping and continuous ``crawling'' motion. The jumping drop motion has been tentatively explained as an outcome of melting and refreezing of the materials surface beneath the droplets and can be thus considered as an inverted Leidenfrost-like effect (in the classical case vapor is generated from a droplet on a hot substrate). We present here a detailed investigation of jumping movements using high-speed imaging and static crosssectional cryogenic focused ion beam scanning electron microscope imaging. Our results show that drop motion is induced by a thermocapillary (Marangoni) effect. The in-plane jumping motion can be delineated to occur in two stages. The first stage occurs on a millisecond time scale and comprises melting the substrate due to <b>drop</b> <b>condensation.</b> This results in droplet depinning, partial spreading, and thermocapillary movement until freezing of the cyclohexane film. The second stage occurs on a second time scale and comprises relaxation motion of the drop contact line (change in drop contact radius and contact angle) after substrate freezing. When the cyclohexane film cannot freeze, the droplet continuously glides on the surface, resulting in the crawling motion...|$|E
40|$|Effects of evaporation/condensation on {{spreading}} {{and contact}} angle were experimentally studied. A sessile drop of R- 113 was tested at different vapor environments {{to determine the}} effects of evaporation/condensation on the evolution of contact diameter and contact angle of the <b>drop.</b> <b>Condensation</b> on the drop surface occurs at both the saturated and a nonsaturated vapor environments and promotes the spreading. When the drop is placed in the saturated vapor environment it tends to completely wetting and spreads rapidly. In a nonsaturated vapor environment, the evolution of the sessile drop is divided three stages: condensation-spreading stage, evaporation-retracting stage and rapid contracting stage. In the first stage the drop behaves as in the saturated environment. In the evaporation -retracting stage, the competition between spreading and evaporation of the drop determines the evolution characteristics of the contact diameter and the contact angle. A lower evaporation rate struggles against the spreading power to turn the drop from spreading to retracting with a continuous increase of the contact angle. The drop placed in open air has a much higher evaporation rate. The strong evaporation suppresses the spreading and accelerates the retraction of the drop with a linear decrease of the contact diameter. The contraction of the evaporating drops is gradually accelerated when the contact diameter decreases to 3 min and less till drying up, though the evaporation rate is gradually slowing down...|$|E
40|$|Thermoelectric power {{generation}} {{accounts for a}} significant portion of the fresh water demand, with the majority of the water being used for steam condensation. Currently, many thermoelectric power plants use wet-cooled condenser technology, which tends to lose water to evaporation or thermally pollute the water such that it is unfit to return to its source. An alternate method for the steam condensation process is to use dry-cooled technologies where air is the cooling fluid. These air-cooled systems are beneficial where water is unavailable or uneconomical. However, dry-cooled systems do not perform as well and are not as economical as wet-cooled systems. The purpose of this research is to model and design an optimized A-frame air-cooled condenser with air-side heat transfer performance and overall efficiency at the levels achieved by wet-cooled plants. A segmented condenser model was developed in EES to predict stand-alone condenser performance as well as the efficiency of a representative 500 MW thermoelectric plant. Two-phase pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>condensation,</b> and fin performance correlations were implemented into the code to predict condenser performance using conservation of energy and momentum equations.

40|$|Wetting and {{dewetting}} {{are both}} fundamental modes of motion of liquids on solid surfaces. They are critically important for processes in biology, chemistry and engineering, such as drying, coating and lubrication. However, recent progress in wetting, {{which has led}} to new fields such as superhydrophobicity and liquid marbles, has not been matched by dewetting. A significant problem has been the inability to study the model system of a uniform film dewetting from a non-wetting surface to a single macroscopic droplet – a barrier which does not exist for the reverse wetting process of a droplet spreading into a film. Here, we report the dewetting of a dielectrophoresis-induced film into a single equilibrium droplet. The emergent picture of the full dewetting dynamics is of an initial regime, where a liquid rim recedes at constant speed and constant dynamic contact angle, followed by a relatively short exponential relaxation of a spherical-cap shape. This sharply contrasts with the reverse wetting process, where a spreading droplet follows a smooth sequence of spherical-cap shapes. Complementary numerical simulations and a hydrodynamic model reveal a local dewetting mechanism driven by the equilibrium contact angle, where contact-line slip dominates the dewetting dynamics. Our conclusions can be used to understand a wide variety of processes involving liquid dewetting, such as <b>drop</b> rebound, <b>condensation</b> and evaporation. In overcoming the barrier to studying single film-to-droplet dewetting our results provide new ways of fluid manipulation and use of dewetting, such as inducing films of prescribed initial shapes and slip-controlled liquid retraction...|$|R

This thesis addresses {{the design and}} fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with hierarchical micro/nano roughness, and the dynamic wetting characterization in <b>drop</b> impact and <b>condensation</b> experiments. Our experimental observations indicate {{the hierarchical}} superhydrophobic surfaces possess robust water-repellence properties and can potentially enhance dropwise condensation heat transfer. We developed a modified deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) method {{that is capable of}} realizing uniform nanopillars with no need of mask. The nanoscale features can be tailored by controlling RF power and gas flow rate in the DRIE process. Moreover, dual-scaled roughness surfaces can be obtained by photolithographily patterning microstructured surfaces, followed by the etching of uniform nanopillar arrays. Applying this fabrication technique, we firstly designed a novel hybrid micro/nano roughness surface. Uniform nanopillar arrays were etched on the base of micropillar array, which is responsible for the improved water repellence properties. This hybrid surface exhibits similar static superhydrophobicity as the micropillar counterparts but dramatic improvement in <b>drop</b> impact and <b>condensation</b> dynamics, which suggest the nanopillars prevent water from penetrating {{into the bottom of the}} surface and therefore result in robust dynamic water-repellence. Secondly, we designed and fabricated dual-scaled superhydrophobic surfaces to study dropwise condensation. Pyramid microstructures are integrated into a nanostructured matrix to mimic two-tier roughness of a locus leaf. Visualization of condensation dynamics were conducted using both environmental scanning electron microscopy (E-SEM) and optical microscopy. On the dual-scaled superhydrophobic surfaces, condensed droplets remain spherical and are more readily movable with little external force or via coalescence with neighboring drops, hence resulting in a highly increased droplet number fluctuation (> 170 %). During over 1 hr experiments, a low surface coverage of drops (20 %) remains indicating such surfaces can potentially enhanced dropwise condensation heat transfer for prolonged duration. Also, an increase of accumulative volume of departure droplets could be enhanced by 500 %, showing a dramatic improvement of both condensation heat transfer and droplet removal...|$|R

In the forced convection condensation region the heat transfer coefficients show a 32 %– 35 % enhancement for a doubling of the refrigerant mass flux. The condensation heat transfer coefficients of super-heated vapour are from 8 % to 11 % {{higher than those of}} saturated vapour. HFO 1234 ze(E) exhibits lower (4 %– 6 %) heat transfer coefficients and higher (10 %) frictional pressure drops than those of HFC 134 a...|$|R
