5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
5|$|Selfe's {{contempt}} for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos– indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion... Selfe may <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E

5|$|Guillory {{was to be}} a lead in the {{television}} series The Oaks, expected to begin airing in 2008. She joined Bahar Soomekh, Matt Lanter, Romy Rosemont, Jeremy Renner, Michael Rispoli and Shannon Lucio in the series, which follows the intertwining stories of three families—a young couple in 1968 who <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> child, a family of four in 1998, and a pregnant couple in 2008—who are haunted by the same spirit in their house. The television series began filming on 5 November 2007 on location in Pasadena, California. Guillory will play Jessica, the 2008 couple's neighbour, a woman who has Asperger syndrome who went to school with the husband (and father-to-be) and shares a secret with him.|$|E
5|$|The club's widest victory {{margin in}} the league was 12–0, a {{scoreline}} which they achieved once in the Football Alliance, against Nottingham Forest in 1899, and twice in the Second Division, against Walsall Town Swifts in 1892 and Doncaster Rovers in 1903. They <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> league match by an eight-goal margin on eight occasions: twice in the Football Alliance and five times in the First Division, all away from home, and once at home, beaten 8–0 by AFC Bournemouth in the Championship in 2014. Their record FA Cup win was 10–0 against Druids in the fourth qualifying round of the 1899 competition; their record FA Cup defeat was 7–0 at home to Liverpool in the 2006 quarter final.|$|E
5|$|The game restarted, {{but many}} Bayern players were {{overwhelmed}} with despair, virtually unable {{to continue and}} needed the assistance of referee Pierluigi Collina to drag themselves off the ground. They were stunned to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> game they had thought won just minutes before (several celebratory flares had already been ignited by the Munich fans moments before United equalised, and Bayern Munich ribbons had already been secured to the trophy itself {{in preparation for the}} presentation ceremony). United held onto their lead to record their second European Cup title. Samuel Kuffour broke down in tears after the game, beating the floor in despair, and even the giant Carsten Jancker had collapsed in anguish. Matthäus had captained Bayern in the 1987 European Cup Final and lost in similar circumstances to two late Porto goals. He had been substituted with 10 minutes remaining, with victory seemingly assured, and the European Cup was the only major trophy he had failed to win during his career.|$|E

5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Though not aggressive, {{the common}} {{stingray}} can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its spine {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that the touch of stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules was said to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> finger to the bite of a stingray, and Circe {{was said to have}} armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates have {{segmented}} {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma, except that mites <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as {{the oldest and most}} primitive group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.|$|E

25|$|The Double was {{followed}} by a dismal period in the club's history. The club was relegated in 1969, and even though the team was promoted back after one year and reached the cup final in 1970, the club was again relegated in 1973. During the next 30 years, Lyn was swiftly relegated and promoted between the first and the third tier and the club was never playing in the top division for more than three consecutive seasons. During this period the fan base eroded and Lyn is said to <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> generation of supporters.|$|E

25|$|On 27 July Actives boats {{attacked}} a convoy {{in the port}} of Rogoznica on the Dalmatian coast that was carrying grain to the garrison at Ragusa.

25|$|Belugas {{also show}} {{a great degree}} of curiosity towards humans in the wild, and {{frequently}} swim alongside boats. They also play with objects they find in the water; in the wild, they do this with wood, plants, dead fish, and bubbles they have created. During the breeding season, adults have been observed carrying objects such as plants, nets, and even the skeleton of a dead reindeer on their heads and backs. Captive females have also been observed displaying this behaviour, carrying items such as floats and buoys, after they <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> calf; experts consider this interaction with the objects could be acting as a substitute behaviour.|$|E

After the female lays the egg, she transfers it to {{the feet of the}} waiting male with minimal exposure to the elements, as the intense cold could kill the developing embryo. The male tends to the egg when the female returns to the sea, now even farther away, both to feed herself and to obtain extra food for feeding her chick when she returns.
