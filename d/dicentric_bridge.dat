40|$|Knobbed {{regions of}} the regular maize {{complement}} frequently are eliminated at the second microspore division in spores which have two or more B chromosomes. Evidence is presented that no or little loss occurs in spores with one B and that the rate is not increased in spores with more than two B's. —The B chromosomes from an unrelated strain proved as effective in inducing loss as did the B's of the original high loss stock. —Chromatin loss induced by B's is restricted to knobbed A chromosomes and occurs only at the second microspore division. Knobbed chromosomes 3, 5, and 9 have been tested and all interact with B's to give loss. Chromosomes with large knobs are more frequently broken than are those with smaller knobs and knobless chromosomes show negligible loss. —Although knobs and B's are essential for chromatin elimination, modifying genes can markedly affect the rate of loss. ——Two knobbed heterologous chromosomes undergo simultaneous loss more frequently than expected from independent events. The data indicate that joint loss occurs in competent cells and that preferential assortment of the two deficient chromosomes to specific poles is unlikely. —B chromosomes and deficient chromosomes assort independently at the second microspore anaphase. —Genetic data from crosses with marker genes in both arms of chromosome 3 show that breakage of the postulated <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridge</b> does not occur solely at the centric region since a variety of deficient chromosomes were recovered. —Nondisjunction of B chromosomes and elimination of knobbed chromatin take place during the second microspore mitosis. The argument is advanced that the two phenomena result from faulty replication of heterochromatic segments. The position of the nonreplicating segment in the two kinds of chromosomes determines whether nondisjunction or breakage takes place. —Finally, {{it is suggested that}} all of the reported effects of the B chromosome can be accounted for if the B is a parasitic entity having no genetic function other than controlling the replication of its proximal heterochromatic knob and increasing the ability of B-containing sperm cells to compete successfully for fertilization of the egg...|$|E
40|$|Many therapeutic, {{diagnostic}} and prophylactic procedures used in hospitals are of potential genetic risk. An evaluation {{was made of}} genotoxic occupational risk in 42 workers from the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, who had been occupationally exposed to lead (solder), ethylene oxide (sterilization area), antineoplastic drugs (nurses and pharmacists) or ionizing radiation. They were compared with 42 unexposed individuals. There {{was an increase in}} the frequency of binucleated cytochalasin-blocked lymphocytes with micronuclei, though it was not significant (P = 0. 058). The groups exposed to antineoplastic drugs and radiation had a significant increase in micronuclei frequency (P = 0. 038 and P = 0. 022, respectively). The high frequencies of <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridges</b> suggest the action of clastogenics in these two groups. These results suggest that the safety procedures adopted were very important to protect workers from exposure to mutagenic agents and should be improved in the radiological and chemotherapeutical areas...|$|R
40|$|Somaclonal {{variation}} in plants regenerated by organogenesis from long-term cultured calluses of two diploid staminate genotypes of Asparagus officinalis cv. Argenteuil {{was characterized by}} plant phenotype, ploidy, meiotic behavior, pollen viability, fruit and seed set, and AFLP profiles. Phenotypic deviations from the donors were detected in foliage color, flower size, and cladode and flower morphology. Ploidy changes were observed in 37. 8 % of the 37 regenerants studied. Meiotic alterations in 12 out of 21 regenerants included laggards, <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridges,</b> micronuclei, restitution nuclei and polyads. Of the 408 AFLP markers screened in 43 regenerants and the donors, 2. 94 % showed polymorphism. High pollen viability was observed in the 22 regenerants analyzed. All crosses between one pistillate plant and 35 regenerants, {{as well as the}} controls, produced fruits and seeds; however, no plump seeds resulted in 35. 3 % of the crosses with regenerants, and no seeds germinated in 12. 5 % of those with apparently normal seeds. Fruit and seed set was similar in crosses with diploid regenerants with normal meiosis and the controls but was lower in crosses with diploid and polyploid regenerants with abnormal meiosis. Our results show that the regenerated plants exhibited conspicuous somaclonal variation that could be eventually exploited for in vitro selection systems...|$|R
40|$|When a {{dicentric}} chromosome breaks in mitosis, the broken ends {{cannot be repaired}} by normal mechanisms that join two broken ends since each end is in a separate daughter cell. However, in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster, a broken end may be healed by de novo telomere addition. We find that Chk 2 (encoded by lok) and P 53, major mediators of the DNA damage response, have strong and opposite influences on the transmission of broken-and-healed chromosomes: lok mutants exhibit a large increase in the recovery of healed chromosomes relative to wildtype control males, but p 53 mutants show a strong reduction. This contrasts with the soma, where mutations in lok and p 53 have the nearly identical effect of allowing survival and proliferation of cells with irreparable DNA damage. Examination of testes revealed a transient depletion of germline cells after {{dicentric chromosome}} induction in the wildtype controls, and further showed that P 53 {{is required for the}} germline to recover. Although lok mutant males transmit healed chromosomes at a high rate, broken chromosome ends can also persist through spermatogonial divisions without healing in lok mutants, giving rise to frequent <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridges</b> in Meiosis II. Cytological and genetic analyses show that spermatid nuclei derived from such meiotic divisions are eliminated during spermiogenesis, resulting in strong meiotic drive. We conclude that the primary responsibility for maintaining genome integrity in the male germline lies with Chk 2, and that P 53 is required to reconstitute the germline when cells are eliminated owing to unrepaired DNA damage...|$|R
40|$|Mitotic {{recombination}} {{has been}} induced with X-rays in Drosophila melanogaster larvae and assayed later as twin mosaic {{spots on the}} adult tergites. With {{the use of the}} In(1) sc 4 L sc 8 R chromosome which lacks the nucleolar organizer and is marked with yellow (y) indirect evidence was obtained that mitotic recombination between ring and rod chromosomes results, in a majority of cases, in XO spots, bearing the rod-X only. This was concluded from the relative scarcity and small sizes of y NO- spots (uncovering the sc 4 sc 8 chromosome), compared to control sisters bearing an extra Y chromosome with its NO locus. Thus, <b>dicentric</b> chromatid <b>bridges</b> formed by mitotic recombination between the ring and rod chromosomes are probably eliminated at the next division. In In(1) sc 4 sc 8 /f 36 a (rod/rod) females, no effect of the Y chromosome on the frequency and sizes of cross-over spots was observed. Either any <b>dicentric</b> chromatid <b>bridges</b> formed by recombination between inverted rod chromosomes fragment at division, with a centromeric piece going to each pole, or such bridges are not usually formed by recombination. The latter case would indicate that somatic pairing of homologues is not accurate in X chromosome inversion heterozygotes and consequently, that recombination yields aneuploid cells. Additional studies are cited which indicate that X chromosome heterozygotes for entire arm inversions may not pair in the typical loop at the time of mitotic recombination. Supported in part by U. S.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. 					 Among the progeny of males carrying the inverted I chromosome, [ [...] . ], individuals are found which {{have lost the}} terminal euchromatic segment of the inversion. This has been interpreted in the past (Sidorov 1940, 1941) {{as the result of}} exchange between the distal heterochromatin of the inversion and the short arm of the Y chromosome, and, indeed, the reciprocal recombinant type may be recovered, i. e. a Y with its short arm replaced by the terminal euchromatin of [ [...] . ]. The fact that such derivatives occur in clusters and represent recombination which has occurred in males indicate that the events in question are mitotic rather than meiotic in origin. An analysis of 44 such recombinant X chromosomes recovered from 273, 721 offspring of males carrying the distal heterochromatin of [ [...] . ] reveals that previous notions represent an oversimplification of the actual case. When the chromosome carries large heterochromatic segments at its base, the distal heterochromatin many tend to pair with its own base in preference to pairing with the Y. Such pairing may occur in either direction, i. e., eucentrically or dyscentrically, as may pairing between the X and Y. Reversal of ordinary pairing relationships may result in the formation of <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridges,</b> and the evidence indicates that such bridges break at anaphase. It has been possible to demonstrate exchange between the distal heterochromatin of [ [...] . ] and all other sex linked heterochromatic blocks except [ [...] . ], and indications are that this event may not occur. No evidence has been found favoring any sort of fusion circle subsequent to bridge breakage, but the experimental arrangement favored detection of only a chromatid and not a chromosome type of cycle...|$|R
40|$|An {{inbred line}} (OK 1) of Drosophila melanogaster, {{recently}} {{derived from a}} natural population in Oklahoma, has been found by Woodruff and Thompson to exhibit a low frequency of spontaneous male recombination when outcrossed to marker stocks. There is also a reciprocal-cross effect, such that recombination is found only if OK 1 males {{are used in the}} initial cross. When OK 1 females are used, however, male recombination is again found if their male progeny are used for a subsequent cross. —In the present cytological analysis, chromosome behavior at male meiosis was studied in reciprocal crosses between the OK 1 line and both a marker gene stock and an inversion stock. If the recombination events were "conventional" and premeiotic (gonial) in origin, no chromosome aberrations would be expected during meiosis. If they were "conventional" and meiotic, some <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridges</b> with free fragments would be expected in the inversion heterozygote, but none should be present in the marker gene cross. —The results demonstrated that the occurrence of recombination in males is most likely a meiotic event, though the occurrence of some limited premeiotic recombination can not be disproven. Meiosis was found to be perfectly normal in all crosses lacking male recombination. In all of the inversion stock and noninversion marker stock crosses that showed male recombination, however, anaphase bridges were found at both first and second meiotic divisions. These were often accompanied by more than the single fragment expected from a conventional inversion bridge and fragment situation. In extreme cases, almost complete pulverization of one or more autosomes was found. —All metaphase I stages were perfectly normal, suggesting that no comparable breakage occurs in premeiotic gonial mitoses. The form of chromosome damage is similar in many ways to that produced by some DNA synthesis inhibitors, or by some viral or mycoplasma infections. This possibility is discussed, and some of the evolutionary implications of the system are briefly considered...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The present {{investigation}} with the chromosomes of Zea mays {{was conducted to}} determine: (1) the effects of chelating agents {{on the process of}} cytological exchange, and (2) the effects of chelating agents on genetic recombination. To ascertain the influence of chelating agents on cytological exchange, four known heterozygolis paracentric inversion stocks of Zea mays were treated with several concentrations of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) singly and in combination prior to meiosis. The four chromosomes with known inverted segments were: (1) chromosome two with an inversion involving 19 map units, (2) chromosome three with an inverted segment of 28 map units, (3) chromosome seven with a large inversion in most of the long arm, and (4) chromosome nine with an inverted segment of approximately 33 map units. Pollen mother cells were utilized for chromosome analysis after fixing in Carnoy's solution and staining with propionic carmine. Cytological exchanges produced by the different treatments were measured by counting the number of <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridges</b> and acentric fragments observed in anaphase I and II. Depending upon the concentration used, both EDTA and DMSO singly or in combination were found to produce significant increases in cytological exchanges in the four inversion stocks. Zea mays stocks, heterozygous for four known linkage groups involving seed and seedling characteristics, were treated with EDTA and DMSO and were crossed with untreated homozygous plants by means of hand pollination. The effects of the two chelating agents on genetic recombination were then determined by scoring the progeny from the testcrosses. Genetic recombination in the testcross stocks was significantly increased by EDTA and DMSO, singly or in combination, in all the testcrosses. In some instances genetic recombination and cytological exchange were both increased significantly in the same chromosome, whereas in other cases no such relationship was observed. The study may provide valuable clues as to the specific effects that chelating agents exert on genetic recombination and cytological exchange. Furthermore, through the utilization of both cytological and genetic techniques, {{a better understanding of the}} entire process of crossing over may be obtained...|$|R
40|$|In strain T(I→II) 39311 a long {{interstitial}} {{segment is}} transposed from IL to IIR, {{where it is}} inserted in reversed order {{with respect to the}} centromere. In crosses of T x T essentially all asci have eight viable, black spores, and all progeny are phenotypically normal. When T(I→II) 39311 is crossed by Normal sequence (N), the expected duplication class is viable while the corresponding deficiency is lethal; 44 % of the asci have 8 Black (viable) spores and 0 White (inviable) spores, 41 % have 4 Black: 4 White, and 10 % have 6 Black: 2 White. These are the ascus types expected from normal centromere disjunction without crossing over (8 B: 0 W and 4 B: 4 W equally probable), and with crossing over between centromere and break point (6 B: 2 W). On germination, 8 B: 0 W asci give rise to only parental types— 4 T and 4 N; 4 B: 4 W asci usually give four duplication (Dup) progeny; and 6 B: 2 W asci usually give 2 T, 2 N, 2 Dup. Thus one third of all viable, black ascospores contain duplications. —Recessive markers in the donor chromosome which contributes the translocated segment can be mapped by duplication coverage. Ratios of 2 Dominant: 1 Recessive vs. 1 Dominant: 2 Recessive distinguish location in or outside the transposed segment. Eleven loci including mating type have been shown to lie within the segment, and markers at four loci have been transferred into the segment by meiotic recombination. The frequency of marker transfer indicates that the inserted segment usually pairs with its homologue. Ascus types that would result from single exchanges within the insertion are infrequent, as expected if asci containing <b>dicentric</b> <b>bridges</b> usually do not survive. —Duplication ascospores germinate to produce distinctive inhibited colonies. Later these "escape" to grow like wild type, and genes that were initially heterozygous in the duplication segregate when escape occurs. As with duplications from pericentric inversion In(IL→IR) H 4250 (Newmeyer and Taylor 1967), the initial inhibition is attributed to mating-type heterozygosity, and escape to a somatic event that makes mating type homoor hemizygous. —Twenty additional duplication-generating Neurospora rearrangements are listed and described briefly in an Appendix...|$|R
40|$|Replication fork {{inactivation}} can {{be overcome}} by homologous recombination, but this can cause gross chromosomal rearrangements that subsequently missegregate at mitosis, driving further chromosome instability. It is unclear when the chromosome rearrangements are generated and whether individual replication problems or the resulting recombination intermediates delay the cell cycle. Here we have investigated checkpoint activation during HR-dependent replication restart using a site-specific replication fork-arrest system. Analysis during a single cell cycle shows that HR-dependent replication intermediates arise in S phase, shortly after replication arrest, and are resolved into acentric and dicentric chromosomes in G 2. Despite this, cells progress into mitosis without delay. Neither the DNA damage nor the intra-S phase checkpoints are activated in the first cell cycle, demonstrating that these checkpoints are blind to replication and recombination intermediates {{as well as to}} rearranged chromosomes.

40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinomas {{are characterized by}} complex, often near-triploid karyotypes with structural and numerical variations superimposed on the initial clonal chromosomal alterations. We used immunohistochemistry combined with classical cytogenetic analysis and spectral karyotyping to investigate the chromosomal segregation defects in cultured oral {{squamous cell}} carcinoma cells. During division, these cells frequently exhibit lagging chromosomes at both metaphase and anaphase, suggesting defects in the mitotic apparatus or kinetochore. <b>Dicentric</b> anaphase chromatin <b>bridges</b> and structurally altered chromosomes with consistent long arms and variable short arms, {{as well as the}} presence of gene amplification, suggested the occurrence of breakage–fusion–bridge cycles. Some anaphase bridges were observed to persist into telophase, resulting in chromosomal exclusion from the reforming nucleus and micronucleus formation. Multipolar spindles were found to various degrees in the oral squamous cell carcinoma lines. In the multipolar spindles, the poles demonstrated different levels of chromosomal capture and alignment, indicating functional differences between the poles. Some spindle poles showed premature splitting of centrosomal material, a precursor to full separation of the microtubule organizing centers. These results indicate that some of the chromosomal instability observed within these cancer cells might be the result of cytoskeletal defects and breakage–fusion–bridge cycles...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a great interest in}} delayed chromosomal and other damaging effects of low-dose exposure to a variety of pollutants which appear collectively to act through induction of stress-response pathways related to oxidative stress and ageing. These have been studied mostly in the radiation field but evidence is accumulating that the mechanisms can also be triggered by chemicals, especially heavy metals. Humans are exposed to metals, including chromium (Cr) (VI) and vanadium (V) (V), from the environment, industry and surgical implants. Thus, the impact of low-dose stress responses may be larger than expected from individual toxicity projections. In this study, a short (24 h) exposure of human fibroblasts to low doses of Cr (VI) and V (V) caused both acute chromosome damage and genomic instability in the progeny of exposed cells for at least 30 days after exposure. Acutely, Cr (VI) caused chromatid breaks without aneuploidy while V (V) caused aneuploidy without chromatid breaks. The longer-term genomic instability was similar but depended on hTERT positivity. In telomerase-negative hTERT- cells, Cr (VI) and V (V) caused a long lasting and transmissible induction of <b>dicentric</b> chromosomes, nucleoplasmic <b>bridges,</b> micronuclei and aneuploidy. There was also a long term and transmissible reduction of clonogenic survival, with an increased beta-galactosidase staining and apoptosis. This instability was not present in telomerase-positive hTERT+ cells. In contrast, in hTERT+ cells the metals caused a persistent induction of tetraploidy, which was not noted in hTERT- cells. The growth and survival of both metal-exposed hTERT+ and hTERT- cells differed if they were cultured at subconfluent levels or plated out as colonies. Genomic instability {{is considered to be a}} driving force towards cancer. This study suggests that the type of genomic instability in human cells may depend critically on whether they are telomerase-positive or -negative and that their sensitivities to metals could depend on whether they are clustered or diffuse...|$|R
