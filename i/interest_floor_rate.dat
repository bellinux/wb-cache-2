40|$|An {{economy is}} in a {{liquidity}} trap when monetary policy cannot influence either real or nominal variables of interest. A necessary condition {{for this is that}} the short nominal interest rate is constrained by its lower bound, typically zero. The paper develops a small analytical model to show how an economy can get into a liquidity trap, how it can avoid getting into one and how it can get out. The empirical likelihood of the UK economy hitting the zero nominal rate bound is considered by investigating the relationship between the level of the short nominal interest rate and its volatility. The empirical evidence on this issue is mixed. To reduce the risk of falling into a liquidity trap, the authorities have two options. The first is to raise the inflation target. The second is to lower the zero nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor.</b> This second option involves paying negative interest on government 'bearer bonds' - coin and currency - ie 'taxing money', as advocated by Gesell. Once in a liquidity trap, there are two means of escape. The first is to use expansionary fiscal policy. The second is, again, to lower the zero nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor.</b> There are likely to be significant shoe leather costs associated with any scheme to tax currency. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} ways {{of avoiding}} a liquidity trap and ways {{of getting out of}} one. Unless lower short nominal interest rates are associated with significantly lower interest volatility, a lower average rate of inflation, which will be associated with lower expected nominal interest rates, increases the odds that the zero nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor</b> will become a binding constraint. The empirical evidence on this issue is mixed. Once in a liquidity trap, there are two means of escape. The first is to use expansionary fiscal policy. The second is to lower the zero nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor.</b> This second option involves paying negative interest on government 'bearer bonds' [...] coin and currency, that is 'taxing money', as advocated by Gesell. This would also reduce the likelihood of ending up in a liquidity trap. Taxing currency amounts to having periodic 'currency reforms', that is, compulsory conversions of 'old' currency into 'new' currency, say by stamping currency. The terms of the conversion can be set to achieve any positive or negative interest rate on currency. There are likely to be significant shoe leather costs associated with such schemes. The policy question then becomes how much shoe leather it takes to fill an output gap? Finally the paper develops a simple analytical model showing how the economy can get into a liquidity trap and how Gesell money is one way of avoiding it or escaping from it. ...|$|R

40|$|The 1970 s {{witnessed}} {{a backlash against}} inflation. However, Japan’s prolonged stagnation and the global economy’s recent flirtation with deflation, have revived the case for low inflation. Low inflation acts as grease in labor markets, helping the process of adjustment and lowering equilibrium unemployment. It also has beneficial effects on financial markets. There is a “disequilibrium ” role for inflation in reducing debt burdens resulting from asset price bubbles. There is also an “equilibrium ” role. Low inflation helps avoid the trap of nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floors</b> and creates room to reduce real interest rates in recessions. It also reduces the real cost of capital by inducing portfolio substitution away from money, and by lowering the bankruptcy risk associated with deflation.

50|$|Consider an {{investor}} A {{who has an}} obligation to pay floating 6 month LIBOR annually on a notional N and which (when invested) earns 6%. A rise in LIBOR above 6% will hurt the investor while a drop will benefit her. Thus it is desirable for her to purchase an interest rate cap which will pay her back if the LIBOR rises above her level of comfort. Figuring that she is comfortable paying up to 7%, she enters into an Interest Rate Cap with counterparty B wherein B will pay her the difference between 6 mo LIBOR and 7% when the LIBOR exceeds 7% for a premium of 0.08*N. To offset this premium, she sells an <b>Interest</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Floor</b> to counterparty C wherein she will pay them the difference between 6 mo LIBOR and 5% when the LIBOR falls below 5%. For this she receives 0.075*N premium, thus offsetting what she paid for the Cap.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the macroeconomic transmission of demand and supply shocks {{in an open}} economy under alternative assumptions about whether the zero <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor</b> (ZIF) is binding. It uses a two-country general-equilibrium simulation model calibrated to the Japanese economy relative {{to the rest of}} the world. Negative demand shocks have more prolonged and conspicuous effects on the economy when the ZIF is binding than when it is not binding. Positive supply shocks can actually extend the period of time over which the ZIF may be expected to bind. Economies that are more open hit the ZIF for a shorter period of time, and with less harmful effects. The implications of deflationary supply shocks depend on whether the shocks are concentrated in the tradables or the nontradables sector. Price-level-path targeting rules are likely to provide better guidelines for monetary policy in a deflationary environment, and have desirable properties in normal times when the ZIF is not binding.

40|$|Recent {{treatments}} {{of the issue}} of a zero <b>floor</b> on nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> have been subject to some important methodological limitations. These include the assumption of perfect foresight or the introduction of the zero lower bound as an initial condition or a constraint on the variance of the interest rate, rather than an occasionally binding non-negativity constraint. This paper addresses these issues offering a global solution to a standard dynamic stochastic sticky price model with an explicit occasionally binding non-negativity constraint on the nominal interest rate. It turns out that the dynamics and sometimes the unconditional means of the nominal rate, inflation and the output gap are strongly affected by uncertainty {{in the presence of the}} zero lower bound. Commitment to the optimal rule reduces unconditional welfare losses to around one-tenth of those achievable under discretionary policy, while constant price level targeting delivers losses which are only 60 % larger than under the optimal rule. Even though the unconditional performance of simple instrument rules is almost unaffected by the presence of the zero lower bound, conditional on a strong deflationary shock simple instrument rules perform substantially worse than the optimal policy. monetary policy, zero <b>floor,</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{economy is}} in a {{liquidity}} trap when monetary policy cannot influence either real or nominal variables of interest. A necessary condition {{for this is that}} the short nominal interest rate is constrained by its lower bound, typically zero. The paper considers two small analytical models, one Old-Keynesian, the other New-Keynesian possessing equilibria where not only the short nominal interest rate, but nominal interest rates at all maturities can be stuck at their zero lower bound. When the authorities remove the zero nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor</b> by adopting an augmented monetary rule that systematically keeps the nominal interest rate on base money (including currency) at or below the nominal interest rate on non-monetary instruments, the lower bound equilibria are eliminated, thus allowing an economic system to avoid the trap or to escape from it. This rule will involve paying negative interest on currency, that is, imposing a ‘carry tax’ on currency, an idea first promoted by Gesell. The administration costs associated with a currency carry tax must be set against the benefits of potentially lower shoe-leather costs and lower menu costs which are made possible by the its introduction. There are also output-gap avoidance benefits from eliminating the zero lower bound trap. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} rules for central bank {{policy has been}} a subject of {{increasing}} interest to many monetary economists. The purpose of this essay is first to present an analytical structure in which a policymaker is presumed to formulate a rule based on the solution to an optimal control problem, and then to examine {{a number of issues}} that are germane to the current debate on the nature of such rules. These issues include the implication for policymaking of the slope of the output-inflation variability frontier, the importance of various types of uncertainty, the consequences of a zero nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor,</b> and the possible reasons for interest rate smoothing. Although this essay is intended to raise, rather than resolve, key questions concerning policy rules, it does offer fairly compelling evidence on one point. This concerns the potential consequences of the move by many central banks toward some form of price-level or inflation targeting. In adopting this approach, central banks are implicitly changing the relative importance of output and inflation variability in their objective function. The robustness of the policy rule, however, may depend on the shape of the output-inflation variability trade-off. The data indicate that this trade-off is extremely steep: small decreases in inflation variability are associated with very large increases in output variability. This finding suggests that pure inflation targeting may have very undesirable side effects. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, Black, Coletti, and Monnier seek to {{determine}} the plausible range of net welfare outcomes associated with a permanent reduction in inflation. They estimate the welfare costs of disinflation by simulating the Bank of Canada’s Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). The costs of disinflation are temporary in the base-case version of QPM; however, they consider several modifications that imply permanent costs of disinflation. These include labour-market hysteresis, induced permanent government debt increases, and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floors.</b> To evaluate the benefits of disinflation the authors survey the econometric and model-based litera-ture and transform the reported effects into welfare measures that can be compared with costs estimated using QPM. This discussion focusses {{on the role of}} the QPM structure and its modifications in determining the cost estimates, and on how alternative model assumptions and modifications might affect both cost and benefit estimates. It concludes with some suggestions regarding how the net welfare benefits could be judged. The model assumptions underlying the base-case disinflation cost estimate seem reasonable. The key assumption is a sacrifice ratio of 3 embodied in the QPM Phillips curve. The authors recognize the difficulties in measuring the sacrifice ratio as well as its probably unstable character. The authors find that introducing some small degree of labour-market hysteresis into the model increases the welfare loss. This is not surprising, as disinflation then generates permanent as well as temporary costs. The range of welfare losses would be considerably increased if long-run trade-off...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study whether price level or {{inflation}} targeting would be appropriate monetary policy regimes for Japan. A necessary condition for such regimes is that the rate of interest remain a positive tool of monetary policy. Using VAR and SVAR approaches, we investigate whether changes in the real ex ante and the nominal interest rate are able to stimulate an economy with a low inflation rate or deflation. Both with perfect foresight and using backward-looking schemes to predict the future price level, monetary policy remains potent even with declining inflation rates. This is confirmed by the stability of the estimated system throughout the examination period. A tax on currency, or ’Gesell money’ would be a possible alternative for Japan in order to lower the zero <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>floor.</b> We also find that monetary expansion in terms of broad money, broadly defined liquidity and M 2 +CDs, can bring Japan back to positive inflation rates. This must be supported by a higher interest rate differential between components of broad and narrow money. Moreover, expansion of direct funding in terms of corporate bonds could be beneficial for output growth while the non-performing loans problem in the economy is being tackled. Importantly, these results indicate that monetary policy alone is not able to pull Japan out of deflation and that fiscal measures need to be implemented in unison with monetary policy. disinflation, deflation, price level targeting, inflation targeting...|$|R

A Markov regime-switching approach is also used to determine whether the more recent response of money demand to interest rates can be characterized as a separate regime. In general, we do not find any support for the liquidity trap hypothesis. Moreover, we cannot conclude that the response of the demand for money to changes in interest rates was significantly different than in the past. However, we do find that through history the magnitude of the response of money demand to changes in interest rates has been relatively smaller in Japan, suggesting that traditional money demand relationships may not hold.
