2500|$|The pilot {{observed}} a ferry depart the East Bank landing, heading upriver. He called twice on his hand-held transceiver, waiting ample time between transmissions for a reply, but receiving none. He blew the ship's horn twice, indicating {{his desire to}} pass {{in front of the}} ferry. While the two-blast signal had no standing or meaning according to the [...] "Western River Rules of the Road", it was commonly understood at the time for the ferry to give way and allow the ship to pass. At the time of the <b>horn</b> <b>signal,</b> the ferry had already turned to port, beginning to cross the river, and was less than a quarter-mile away.|$|E

50|$|In Sweden, {{a whistle}} board {{is a black}} {{triangle}} with a white border, pointing downwards. Whistle boards before level crossings has an additional sign, a yellow square with a black V. If the trains are supposed to sound the horn at daytime only (between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.) there is another additional sign, rectangular and black/white. For a level crossing, the <b>horn</b> <b>signal</b> is a three-second blast at the whistle board and a three-second blast between the board and the crossing.|$|E

5000|$|Train {{whistles}} {{are used}} to communicate with other railroad workers on a train or in the yard. Different combinations of long and short whistles each have their own meaning. They {{are used to}} pass instructions, as a safety signal, and to warn of impending movements of a train. Despite the advent of modern radio communication, many of these whistle signals are still used today. (See also Train <b>horn</b> (Common <b>horn</b> <b>signals).)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} reduce stress on the driver, speeds are {{displayed}} over several blocks ahead of the train. When a block {{is followed by a}} more restrictive (slower) block, the display for that block flashes so the driver can better anticipate the speed change without releasing the brake. Restrictive indications can only be updated at block boundaries, except in emergencies. They are accompanied by an audible in-cab <b>horn</b> <b>signal.</b> Restrictions can however be lifted at any time within a block.|$|E

50|$|In the baroque and {{classical}} periods, composers typically had the double bass double the cello part in orchestral passages. A notable exception is Haydn, who composed solo passages for the double bass in his Symphonies No. 6 Le Matin, No. 7 Le midi, No. 8 Le Soir, No. 31 <b>Horn</b> <b>Signal,</b> and No. 45 Farewell—but who otherwise grouped bass and cello parts together. Beethoven {{paved the way}} for separate double bass parts, which became more common in the romantic era. The scherzo and trio from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony are famous orchestral excerpts, as is the recitative {{at the beginning of the}} fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In many nineteenth century symphonies and concertos, the typical impact of separate bass and cello parts was that bass parts became simpler and cello parts got the melodic lines and rapid passage work.|$|E

5000|$|An {{imitation}} of the post horn's fanfare was a common device in music describing, or referring to, the post coach or travel in general. Notable examples include Bach's Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother, which includes an [...] "Aria di postiglione" [...] and a [...] "Fuga all'imitazione della cornetta di postiglione", both containing the characteristic octave jump typical for the instrument. Handel's Belshazzar includes, in the second act, a [...] "Sinofonia" [...] that uses a similar motif (subtitled Allegro postilions) depicting Belshazzar's messengers leaving on a mission. A very similar movement {{is included in the}} third [...] "Production" [...] of Telemann's Tafelmusik. Beethoven's Les adieux piano sonata is centered on a horn-like motif, again signifying the departure of a loved-one. Schubert's Winterreise includes the song [...] "Die Post", of which the piano part prominently features a <b>horn</b> <b>signal</b> motif.|$|E
50|$|Biród, today called Óbiród (where it {{operates}} two hunting lodges), {{had been a}} popular holiday resort for numerous distinguished guests and politicians. Gyulaj Plc itself operates two hunting lodges at Óbiród. Each and every hunt began and ended at 6 p.m. with a hunting <b>horn</b> <b>signal.</b> There were many dogs involved in drive hunts, too. An amazing amount of game was moving {{in front of the}} beaters in groups of often 300-400 games. Many a game was wounded in course of these hunts. At the end of the hunt, both guests and driving bondmen could take their shares from the enormous amount of game, free of charge. Trophies and the buckskin were transported to the centre in Tamási. The remaining huge quantities of game meat were interred ´with the most possible care´ into deep pits. Such pits were to be found in a collecting point, today known as ´Fleischbank´ (meat bank, meat store). Hunting was a passion in those times. As the duke´s stables caught fire in the Fire of Ozora in 1821, the Duke was more shaken by the loss of his linen fence destroyed by the fire than by the loss of his 1,100 horses that died in the stables.|$|E
5000|$|A devastating fatal wreck {{occurred}} in July 1942 in East Norriton Township, north of Norristown. The motorman of northbound lightweight 1003 {{was waiting at}} Brush siding near Germantown Pike and had dispatcher's orders to wait for both a southbound passenger car followed by a southbound freight motor, but he proceeded from the siding, violating the horizontal [...] "stop" [...] semaphore signal, and moved onto the main line after only the first passenger car had passed. He may have misinterpreted the [...] "one-long and two-short" [...] <b>horn</b> <b>signal,</b> indicating a following section, for the usual [...] "two-toot" [...] greeting that passing cars often signaled to each other. Alternatively, {{he may have been}} preoccupied in conversation with people in the front vestibule. Alongside DeKalb Pike (US 202), the 1003 accelerated and rounded a curve where visibility was limited by track-side vegetation. 1003 rammed head-on into moving freight motor C14. The heavier C14 [...] "telescoped" [...] into the lightweight and twelve people ultimately died, including the motorman of 1003. The motorman of C14 ran into the interior of his freight car, thus surviving, and had {{the presence of mind to}} first grab from the cab clipboard his train order authorizing his presence as the second southbound section. The wreck forced dispatching changes and a reduction in operating speeds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [133] In this paper, {{we present}} an Automatic Noise Recognition (ANR) {{system that has}} been {{developed}} for detecting and identifying noise acoustic events in urban environments. The proposed system is based on Artificial Neural Networks coupled with Hidden Markov Models. We consider two types of noise events that are generally seen as a nuisance in urban areas, namely scooter engines and <b>horn</b> <b>signals.</b> A sizeable database has been built up and counts up to 1, 000 sound samples, from which the ANR system has been developed and tested. Results show good performances as for both detection and identification of noise events. ...|$|R

In the 1950s and 1960s, Walt Disney used the song in the opening {{sequences}} of all the editions of the Walt Disney anthology television series. It has also been used to accompany the Walt Disney Pictures opening logos - including the present-day logo - since the 1980s. The ships of the Disney Cruise Line use the first seven notes of the song's melody as their <b>horn</b> <b>signals.</b> Additionally, many productions at Disney theme parks - particularly fireworks shows and parades - employ the song.|$|R
50|$|In January 1904, {{the steamer}} Clallam and 50 of her {{passengers}} were lost {{en route to}} Victoria crossing the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Clallam carried no distress rockets, which in those days before radio, might have saved {{some or all of}} her people. Steamship inspectors cracked down and fined a large number of steamers, including Athlon, $500 and more for operating without fog <b>horns,</b> <b>signal</b> flares or rockets, fire axes or proper life-saving equipment. Some measure of the severity of the fine can be judged {{by the fact that it}} was almost exactly 10% of the cost of Athlon’s construction.|$|R

50|$|Gadelha next faced Joanna Jędrzejczyk at on December 13, 2014 at UFC on Fox 13. She {{lost the}} fight via split decision. After the <b>horn</b> <b>signaled</b> {{the end of}} the third and final round, Gadelha punched Jędrzejczyk after the referee had {{separated}} the two fighters. Gadelha immediately apologetically approached Jędrzejczyk and claimed she didn't hear the bell, despite being separated by the referee. Dana White later stated in the UFC on Fox 13 post fight press conference that the UFC wouldn't take any disciplinary actions towards Gadelha, due to her immediate regret shown towards Jędrzejczyk. The judges' decision caused controversies afterwards as the majority of the MMA media and the viewers scored the bout in favor of Gadelha.|$|R

Canonical and imitation developments illustrate the growing of a crowd. The central section is an extended choral fugue, framed by two sections with the voices embedded in {{a repeat of the}} instrumental introduction. John Eliot Gardiner remarked in connection with his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage that the instrumentation resembles Near Eastern music, the recorders representing [...] "the high pitches often associated with oriental music and the oboes da caccia (in tenor register) to evoke the shawm-like double-reed instruments (salamiya and zurna) of the Near East".|$|R
5000|$|There are few entirely {{credible}} {{accounts of}} the battle, but the oral history has two Norwegians on horseback following the Scottish troops, possibly {{on the other side}} of the valley. One was a woman by the name of Guri, known as Prillar-Guri to posterity; the other was an unnamed man. The man rode his horse facing backward, providing a distraction for the marching troops. When the Scots reached the narrowest section of the Gudbrandsdal at Kringen, Guri blew her <b>horn,</b> <b>signaling</b> the ambush. The chosen place of assault is fairly steep, and the river runs close to what would be considered the only passable road at the time. Thus, the Scots would be trapped between the river and the mountain side, which they could not possibly scale.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and accuracy of}} several state-of-the-art algorithms for real-time sound classification on a NAO robot are evaluated, to determine how accurate they are at distinguishing horn and whistle sounds in both optimal conditions, and a noisy environment. Each approach uses a distinct combination of an audio analysis method and a machine learning algorithm, to recognize audio signals captured by NAO’s four microphones. A short summary of three audio analysis preprocessing methods is provided, {{as well as a}} description four machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost-SAMME) which could be used to train classifiers which would distinguish whistle and <b>horn</b> <b>signals</b> from background noise. Experimental results show that for each of the acquired data sets, there are multiple high-accuracy solutions available. Actually, the accuracy and precision results were all so high, that a more challenging dataset is needed to determination which method is optimal for this application...|$|R
