[...] In an interview with MTV News on 29 August 2012, Goulding elaborated on the sound of the album, saying, [...] "I've moved on quite a bit since the first album, because I've discovered so much; I've learned a lot more and I've grown up a lot more. I've gained more influences and different influences and people have influenced it; I suppose just circumstances. It's a bit more tribal and anthemic; a bit more piano and vocal than anything. The last album was very electronic, but it was tied in with my voice; this one, to me, is way more of a pop record." [...] Goulding revealed to The Sun that her former relationship with BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James provided inspiration for the album, stating, [...] "The last record I felt like I was singing about stuff like that and I thought it was really sincere but I listen back and I think, God that was really naive, that was nothing. This time it's the real deal. There's stuff about Greg. I played it to him because I felt that was better than him hearing it randomly somewhere." ...|$|E

With hindsight, the old debate, Big Bang vs. gradualism, is more a question of feasibility even though many of the arguments in favor of Big Bang have now been proven right. Once more inflation has <b>been</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incompatible with growth and the importance of a good microeconomic structure – especially an effective banking system – is confirmed.
