[...] Captain Pratt told Luther: “My boy, you are going away from us to work for this school. [...] Go and do your best. [...] The {{majority}} of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. [...] They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. [...] Now {{you are going to}} prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man. [...] If John Wanamaker gives you the job of blacking his shoes, see that you make them shine. [...] Then he will give you a better job. [...] If you are put into the office to clean, don’t forget to sweep up under the chairs and in the corners. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> well, he will give you better work to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When the {{surprise}} {{attack on the}} Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the Battle of the Bulge, {{the front of the}} US 12th Army Group was split, with the bulk of the US First Army being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The 12th Army Group commander, General Omar Bradley, was located south of the penetration at Luxembourg and command of the US First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in Versailles in France) temporarily transferred Courtney Hodges' US First Army and William Simpson's US Ninth Army to Montgomery's 21st Army Group until the [...] "bulge" [...] could be reduced and a simpler line of communications restored, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds. When Bradley learned that Montgomery had been given command of two American armies totalling some 200,000 men, he phoned Eisenhower to say: [...] "I cannot be responsible to the American people <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> I resign!" [...] Eisenhower sharply responded that Bradley was in fact responsible to him and [...] "Your resignation means absolutely nothing...Well, Brad, these are my orders." [...] Montgomery grasped the situation quickly, visiting all divisional, corps, and field army commanders himself and instituting his 'Phantom' network of liaison officers. He grouped the British XXX Corps as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of St Vith. The German commander of the 5th Panzer Army, Hasso von Manteuffel said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker. Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. Now you are going to prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man.

If you are put into the office to clean, don’t forget to sweep up under the chairs and in the corners. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> well, he will give you better work to do." [...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E
