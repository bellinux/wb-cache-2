5|$|The train {{doors were}} {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|Isabella {{is accused}} of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other {{survivors}} reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning <b>elevator</b> <b>doors,</b> the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 they would all be dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E

25|$|The <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> open {{to reveal}} the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol sitting {{on a table in}} the center. Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, {{blasting}} him backwards past open <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> {{at the opposite end of}} the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.|$|E
25|$|As {{the ride}} begins, {{the lights of}} the {{elevator}} turn off as Hightower's voice explains the significance of the idol. The elevator is pulled backwards, away from the still-visible service <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> as the walls of the basement disappear and turn into a star field. The glowing green eyes of the idol appear in the darkness as the elevator enters the drop shaft. The elevator begins its ascent, stopping at the first scene.|$|E

50|$|Lance, Sasha, and T.C. {{eventually}} find Matt in a room, {{wearing a}} hospital gown and mentally unstable. As the group leaves the room, T.C. tries to bring Matt with them, but is {{attacked by a}} demonic being who drags him into a blood-filled bathtub in which they both disappear. With Matt in tow, Lance and Sasha find an elevator, and Lance goes alone {{to find something to}} wedge to <b>elevator</b> <b>door</b> open. After taking a pipe from an old hospital gurney he encounters a demonic patient. Lance panics, flees to the elevator, and pries the <b>elevator</b> <b>door</b> open. He is then attacked by the patient, but Sasha rescues him.|$|R
25|$|Manhole covers in the {{sidewalks}} and streets nearby {{were made of}} bronze, to avoid unsightly rust stains from traditional iron manhole covers (the usual material). The interior <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> were also cast in bronze, and areas in the floors in suites, meeting rooms, and some public areas had removable panels and built-in tubing which allowed for the easy replacement or upgrading of electrical, telecommunications, and computer wiring. The cafeteria beneath the Dirksen Senate Office Building was doubled in size and extended beneath the Hart building, which allowed the public to use {{for the first time}} during lunch hours.|$|E
25|$|Like the Chrysler Building, One Liberty Place has {{a square}} shape with {{recessed}} corners. The facade is also {{inspired by the}} Chrysler Building, using glass and aluminum to invoke the Chrysler Building's horizontal and vertical shapes along the building's core. The facade's color ranges between grays, silver, and metallic blues and uses horizontal bands of granite and glass to de-emphasize the visual impact of {{the height of the}} tower. The building's lobby features white and gray marble imported from Italy. The elevator lobby and the elevator cabs echo the shape of the building's spire while the <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> feature abstraction of One Liberty Place itself.|$|E
25|$|Valley Craftsmen, of Baltimore, Maryland, {{restored}} the elaborate Art Deco lobby. They re-stenciled the beamed ceiling in a geometric Art Deco design using gold leaf, and hand-painted {{the walls to}} resemble the original veneer panels. The Saul Company replaced the missing Art Deco chandeliers and wall sconces and {{restored the}} handsome inlaid Art Deco <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> on the second, third, and fourth floors. On {{each side of the}} lobby is a lounge. The south lounge was restored to its original design and the north lounge was converted to a piano-bar, which is open to residents. On the second floor, there is ballroom with fine Art Deco detailing. The ballroom was a popular venue for events of all kinds, and many of the best known big bands of the era played there. It has been closed for many years, but current plans (2011) call for it to be restored and reopened as an event space.|$|E

25|$|Frasier's {{apartment}} {{was designed to}} be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show's signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment's design which included elements such as a slightly split-level design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture pieces (such as a replica of Coco Chanel's sofa, and both Eames and Wassily Chairs) and a notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept living area with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the rear upper level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> was built, as was a powder room near the front entrance. Two corridors off the living area ostensibly led to the apartment's three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.|$|E
25|$|The Medical Treatment and Care Building {{included}} a basement level that was exposed (above grade) {{on the east}} and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade {{on the north side}} of the building, due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external stairways, could be considered five separate buildings, since the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building's second through fifth floors consisted of shear walls, but a rarely used slip joint technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor level excluded them from being used with that system. Damage to the building (including ceiling tiles, telephone equipment, and <b>elevator</b> <b>doors)</b> was described as excessive at the basement and first floor levels, with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. As a result of the first floor nearly collapsing, the building was leaning to the north by nearly two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of opening in 1910, the {{addition}} was of French Renaissance design, carried out {{in a general way}} in the interior though there was a slight leaning toward the Spanish in the exterior details. The addition and the older structure were connected with a large courtyard between the two buildings, forming an angle at this point. The ground floor contained a large lobby. To its right was the main dining room and to the left, the Broadway Cafe. Just underneath the Broadway Cafe, down a flight of marble stairs, was the Grill. The Broadway Cafe contained walls of light, artificial stone and its ceiling was treated in the Italian Renaissance style, ornamented in low relief. The corridor walls were of Greek Skyros marble in gray and yellow with a slight veining of purple. The coffered ceiling carried out this color scheme. The large dining room was modelled after the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. The first floor contained a foyer in Louis XIV style, with carved, dark oak woodwork and walls completely covered in tapestries of the period. From this foyer opened out the Tea Room whose walls of artificial stone were covered with wooden grillage, painted green while the skylight over the entire room was concealed by rafters and grillage with entwined vines. Adjoining this was a Flemish-style Banquet Room in dark oak. Carved wooden doors were set with panelled mirrors in the foyer hall. <b>Elevator</b> <b>doors</b> were of bronze.|$|E
40|$|Design and {{analysis}} of a double sided linear switched reluctance motor driver for <b>elevator</b> <b>door</b> Abstract. In this study, an electromagnetic design of double sided linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) is presented. It has been designed for driving an <b>elevator</b> <b>door.</b> The motor has tree phase and 6 / 4 poles. The motor’s magnetic analysis was done as a 3 dimensional model.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{different}} procedures for reducing elevator energy use were assessed using a multiple-baseline design. In the first procedure, feedback {{about the amount of}} energy consumed by the elevators each week was posted on each <b>elevator</b> <b>door.</b> Later, signs advocating the use of stairs to save energy and improve health were posted next to the feedback signs. In the second procedure, the time required to travel between floors was increased by adding a delay to the <b>elevator</b> <b>door</b> closing mechanisms. Results indicated that neither feedback alone nor feedback plus educational signs reduced the amount of energy consumed by the elevators. However, use of the door delay reduced consumption by one-third in all elevators...|$|R

500|$|Gates {{maintained}} a {{suite at the}} Waldorf-Astoria of New City from 1894 onwards. Though he paid US$30,000 yearly for it, his visits pained the hotel's manager, George Boldt, at times. [...] Gates and his guests were often loud and boisterous. [...] He had a private entrance and elevator, but Gates {{had a habit of}} banging on the <b>elevator</b> <b>doors</b> and shouting for service. Boldt instructed his elevator operators to take their time when serving his floor, as it allowed Gates to make as much noise as he wished for a few minutes. Gates' suite was often home to high-stakes poker parties and Baccarat games. Many poker games began on the train from Chicago to New York and were continued at the Waldorf. One poker game lasted for five days and nights; when it was done at least US$2 million had changed hands. Dellora Gates had long since resigned herself to her husband's all-night poker games, but many times became upset about them. [...] Gates made it a practice to keep some unset diamonds in his vest pocket for the times when Dellora became angry about the late hours at cards. He would then present a gem to his wife, who would suddenly forget her anger with him. [...] Dellora would take the diamond to Tiffany & Co. to be set in a piece of jewelry of her choice.|$|E
