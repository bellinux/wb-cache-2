5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

[...] After several meetings with fellow writers John Shiban, Vince Gilligan, and Frank Spotnitz—who provided storyboard support—Minear was allowed to begin work on the episode.|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

Lennon {{thought it would be a}} <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the musicians to live under one roof to ensure they would get to the studio on time, so Pang rented a beach house in Santa Monica, for her, Lennon, Nilsson, Ringo Starr and Keith Moon to live in. At this time, Pang encouraged Lennon to reach out to family and friends. He and Paul McCartney mended fences and played together for the first and only time after the breakup of The Beatles (see A Toot and a Snore in '74). Pang also arranged for Julian Lennon to visit his father for the first time in almost four years.|$|E

They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we put it into a song.

500|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{became the}} first {{full-length}} feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were [...] "psychedelic" [...] or [...] "unnatural", others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while colourising was not a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> most black-and-white classics, it was perfect in this particular instance. He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement, [...] "the fake colours tend to look flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur's elegantly composed shots." [...] The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was [...] "restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound", considered it a [...] "cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben-Hur".

500|$|The {{development}} {{phases of}} the Age of Empires games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research. However, the research was not in depth, which, according to Age of Empires designer Bruce Shelley, is [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> most entertainment products." [...] Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at libraries. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, [...] "not [...] designers or researchers." [...] At the Games Convention Developers Conference in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained {{that the success of}} the series laid in [...] "making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer." [...] Shelley also remarked the Age of Empires games were not about history in itself, but rather [...] "about the human experience;" [...] they focused not simply on what humans had done but on what they could do in the future such as [...] "going into space." [...] Ensemble Studios developed Age of Mythology in a different way than the previous two games. The team had worried they [...] "couldn't get away" [...] with a third historical-based game, and chose mythology as the setting after they had discussed several options.|$|E

500|$|A link {{developed}} during the war with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent—numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions—was the largest on the Western Front. The connection with this particular corps began {{as the result of}} a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from Cape Town to Southampton in late 1914. The 16th Marquess of Winchester, who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain John Banks Brady, the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it might be a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep an eye on them through his connections with the Winchester-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC.

[...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, {{if it wants to}} say something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film, so you've got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war.
