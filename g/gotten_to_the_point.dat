500|$|Soon after {{completing}} [...] "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final {{song on the}} set list, [...] "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson. After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming {{to the tune of}} [...] "Can't Let Go", leading Carey to present [...] "another final" [...] song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist. I'll always go over the raw stuff, and now I've <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where I understand the raw stuff is usually better." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{recording}} for Off the Deep End officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with [...] "Airline Amy". These recording sessions {{marked the first}} time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. [...] The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: [...] "We [...] had a great run with Rick, he’s a terrific guybut I had become more and more of a control freak over the years, and I’d finally <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> in my recording career where I felt that I could capably hold the reins all by myself." [...] By late 1990 five originals—"Airline Amy," [...] "Trigger Happy", [...] "When I Was Your Age", [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore," [...] and [...] "Waffle King"—were recorded.|$|E
500|$|While Augusta National Golf Club has {{consistently}} chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, {{it has done}} so in successive one-year contracts. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson stated that their relationship had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where they [...] "could do our deal in hours". Due {{to the lack of}} long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least performs some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast. Despite this, announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and Gary McCord, and there also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests.|$|E

500|$|Morris' {{performance}} in Britney/Brittany attracted critical praise; Lisa de Moraes called [...] "Britney/Brittany" [...] a [...] "great showcase" [...] for the actress, and praised her [...] "spectacular dance moves" [...] and [...] "deadpan flare". In his otherwise negative review, Todd VanDerWerff deemed Morris [...] "hysterical throughout" [...] and the cast's best dancer. He stated, [...] "Murphy seems intent on running this character into the ground, but Morris isn't {{going to have}} her stop being funny without a fight." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online observed, [...] "When Ryan Murphy said this episode was a celebration of Heather, he wasn't kidding", and commended her musical performances. Robert Canning of IGN was initially concerned that the episode would diminish Morris' appeal by elevating her from a background role, but was ultimately pleased that it managed to retain her [...] "fan favorite" [...] secondary character status. While Poniewozik asked [...] "have we <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> as a society where it's unremarkable that the most popular scripted TV show in the 18 to 49 demographic is also—almost without comment or controversy—the gayest show on broadcast TV?", Ann Oldenburg of USA Today questioned whether Glee {{had gone too far}} by its depiction of Brittany and Santana kissing and their reference to the sexual act called [...] "scissoring". Christie Keith, in writing for the lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com, suggested that [...] "Duets" [...] was the [...] "queerest episode of any series that's ever been on television", and stated that she was moved to tears by the final scene of Brittany forlorn without Santana.

2500|$|Many of the {{interviewees}} also expressed {{a level of}} disillusionment with Japanese society and its emphasis on the material, often {{at the expense of}} the spiritual or moral side of the society. One interviewee assessed the situation, saying, [...] "we've lost any sense of crisis and material things are all that matters. The idea that it's wrong to harm other has gradually disappeared." [...] Another interviewee, a subway worker, said, [...] "I already knew society had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where something like Aum had to happen... It's a question of morals." [...] Several interviewees also voiced criticism of the media, namely due to the way it misrepresented and sensationalized the sarin attacks.

2500|$|On November 3, Mike Garafolo {{reported}} on Fox Sports 1 that Incognito {{is alleged to}} have sent Martin threatening and racially charged messages. He also reported that the team and league—rather than the players' association—has been asked to investigate. That same day, Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports reported that Incognito [...] "has had to be reprimanded in the past for his actions toward team employees," [...] citing an unnamed source. La Canfora and Schefter subsequently reported statements from an unnamed source that the team and the league are now in possession of highly disturbing texts and voicemails in which Incognito used a racial slur against Martin, and disturbing text and voice exchanges including [...] "a reference to tracking down members of Martin's family and harming them" [...] and even threatening to kill Martin.

2500|$|Garner {{reunited with}} Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which {{received}} positive reviews {{and was a}} box office success. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as [...] "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity" [...] while Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post remarked: [...] "McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles, but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive, straightforward performance." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor.

[...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: [...] "It’s not a well-shaped role, but I’ve <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where I’m happy to see Garner in anything.

2500|$|Jonathan Tobin {{wrote in}} The Jewish World Review that [...] "Rosenfeld {{is careful to}} specify that {{questioning}} policies of Israeli governments {{is not the same}} as being anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. But he has the bad manners to point out that those who aggressively question Israel's right to have any government or to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it are, at best, unwitting allies of a growing anti-Jewish movement.... For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to know where we are headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it has <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E
