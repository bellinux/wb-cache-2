50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Dresden-Schöna section was electrified. The {{electric}} train service began on 29 May 1976. In 1987, electric overhead line was {{installed on the}} section of the line within Czechoslovakia between Děčín hl. n. (Bodenbach) and Děčín vychod (Tetschen). Nevertheless, scheduled electric trains did not begin operating across the border until 1992. The problem was the different electrical systems in use. The German section is electrified at the German standard of 15 kV AC at 16.7 Hz. In the north of the Czech Republic, lines are electrified with the 3000-volt DC system. In order to operate the route continuously using electrical traction, a dual-system locomotive (class 180) was developed. 50 m of the contact wire between Schöna and Dolní Žleb carries no current. In this section of the line the driver lowers the pantograph and coasts through the neutral section while changing the locomotive's <b>electrical</b> <b>setting.</b> Afterwards, the pantograph is raised again.|$|E
5000|$|Response time {{compensation}} {{is also known}} as [...] "Overdrive". LCDs moderate light flow by rotating liquid crystal molecules to various alignments where they transmit more or less light depending on the <b>electrical</b> <b>setting</b> at each individual pixel. The speed at which these liquid crystal molecules rotate is relatively slow, below the image refresh rate. As a consequence, when a scene is changing fast or there is a fast moving image being displayed (such as a golf ball flying off the head of a club) the object is at best blurry and can disappear from the image entirely. Overdrive attempts to compensate for this by, instead of sending the desired voltage to each pixel, it sends a higher initial voltage and then moderates that voltage in order to drive the rotation of the liquid crystal faster. Electrically it [...] "steps on the gas" [...] {{in order to get to}} the right speed quickly, then eases off as it approaches the desired performance level.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{is widely}} used to treat motor symptoms in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the anatomical aspects of the electric field in relation to effects on speech and movement during DBS in the subthalamic nucleus. Methods: Patient-specific finite element models of DBS were developed for simulation of the electric field in 10 patients. In each patient, speech intelligibility and movement were assessed during 2 electrical settings, i. e. 4 V (high) and 2 V (low). The electric field was simulated for each <b>electrical</b> <b>setting.</b> Results: Movement was improved in all patients for both high and low electrical settings. In general, high-amplitude stimulation was more consistent in improving the motor scores than low-amplitude stimulation. In 6 cases, speech intelligibility was impaired during high-amplitude electrical settings. Stimulation of part of the fasciculus cerebellothalamicus from electrodes positioned medial and/or posterior to the center of the subthalamic nucleus was recognized as a possible cause of the stimulation-induced dysarthria. Conclusion: Special attention to stimulation-induced speech impairments should be taken in cases when active electrodes are positioned medial and/or posterior to the center of the subthalamic nucleus.

40|$|Pulsed <b>electrical</b> <b>set</b> and reset inputs {{are used}} to {{simulate}} the temporal action of a finite state machine in a three terminal configuration {{for a variety of}} arrangements. The gate electrode is necessary only if it is of interest to tune the tunneling rate and to compensate for background charges. When the output is the current, a source and drain electrodes are required. If the output is determined by measuring charge occupancy, then a single junction suffices. The electron transfer rates are computed from the free energy change for a single electron transfer to or from a quantum dot of size such that only charge quantization matters. For a small enough dot the device could operate at room temperature. An asymmetric configuration of the source and drain favors a longer term time preservation of the memory of the device. An alternative design that operates with the same energetics and kinetic parameters is to pulse the resistance rather than the voltage. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Not only {{in common}} life, {{but also in}} the {{technical}} area the usage of gels presents some kind of standard. Gels offer a unique possibility of usage in numerous areas. The gel structure itself is a very interesting material however it’s hard to specify its characteristics. The gel system presents a huge macromolecular network which enables to observe its different characteristics in comparison to other materials. In some circumstances gels act almost as conventional materials, in other circumstances, however, they act significantly otherwise. Therefore this bachelor thesis deals with a description and summarization of single characteristics of gels in chosen branches of the mechanical engineering industry where gels are used on a daily basis, such as sealant of pipeline systems, wires or electronic components. The thesis also describes principles of gel formation, with the emphasis to building of gel substance and with respect to its mechanical and physical features.
