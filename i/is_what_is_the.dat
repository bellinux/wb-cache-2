Because there's a difference between the characters in [...] "Civil War", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [...] There isn't a Robert Downey, Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character so {{we need to make sure}} that that template gets adjusted". Joe Russo added that the [...] "essence" [...] of [...] "Civil War" [...] was used, such as [...] "the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary" [...] being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, [...] "in a lot of ways [...] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other." [...] Executive producer Nate Moore added that [...] "it felt like it was kind of the right time" [...] to adapt [...] "Civil War" [...] given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films ( [...] , The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with [...] "world-ending experiences.

2500|$|A related {{problem is}} the {{partition}} problem, {{a variant of the}} knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one metric ton). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible? ...|$|E

60|$|He observes,(213) {{that many}} of the controversies which have had an {{important}} share {{in the formation of the}} existing body of science, have “assumed the form of a battle of Definitions. For example, the inquiry concerning the laws of falling bodies led to the question whether the proper definition of a uniform force is that it generates a velocity proportional to the space from rest, or to the time. The controversy of the vis viva was what was the proper definition of the measure of force. A principal question in the classification of minerals <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> definition of a mineral species. Physiologists have endeavored to throw light on their subject by defining organization, or some similar term.” Questions of the same nature were long open and are not yet completely closed, respecting the definitions of Specific Heat, Latent Heat, Chemical Combination, and Solution.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was a very}} {{pleasant}} trait in Stevenson's character which, perhaps, does not display itself in most of his writings; his great affection for children. In [...] "A Child's Garden of Verse," [...] delightful as it is, {{and not to be}} read without [...] "a great inclination to cry," [...] the child is himself, the child [...] "that is gone." [...] But, in an early letter, he writes: [...] "Kids <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> matter with me ... Children are too good to be true." [...] He had a natural infatuation, so to say, for children as children, which many men of the pen overcome with no apparent difficulty. He could not overcome it; little boys and girls were his delight, and he was theirs. At Molokai, the Leper Island, he played croquet with the little girls; refusing to wear gloves, lest he should remind them of their condition. Sensitive and weak in body as he was, Nelson was not more fearless. It was equally characteristic of another quality of his, the open hand, that he gave a grand piano to these leper children.|$|E
