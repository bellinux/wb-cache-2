40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{technical}} and economic potential of tokamak power plants which utilize superconducting coil (SC) or normal conducting coil (NC) designs {{as a function of}} aspect ratio (A). Based on the results from plasma equilibrium calculations, the key physics design parameters of βN, βp, βT, and κ were fitted to parametric equations covering A in the range of 1. 2 to 6. By using ARIES-RS and ARIES-ST as reference design points, a fusion reactor system code was used to project the performance and cost of electricity (COE) of SC and NC reactor designs over the same range of A. The principle difference between the SC and the NC designs are the inboard standoff distance between the coil and the inboard first wall, and the maximum central column current density used for respective coil types. Results show that at an output power of 2 GWe both SC and NC designs can project COE in the respectable range of 62 to 64 mill/kWh at <b>gross</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 46 %, with neutron wall loading (Γn) ~ 7 MW/m 2.

Tokamak design points can then be selected and optimized for testing or commercial devices as a function of output power, A, and Γn for both SC and NC design options.

40|$|The use of {{methanol}} as {{a medium}} for transporting hydrogen-based energy offers the possibility of establishing a global system for obtaining and transporting unlimited quantities of sustainable, clean energy. Using various sources of renewable energy (hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, wind), hydrogen can be produced through an efficient electrolytic process. This hydrogen can be combined with CO 2 obtained from power plants {{in various parts of}} the world to produce methanol, which can then be transported to areas with high energy consumption for use as fuel in power plants. However, the cost of the methanol synthesized from hydrogen and CO 2 will be nearly four times as high as that of the present commercial methanol. The authors examined a method for the production of methanol or dimethyl ether by a solar thermochemical process using concentrated solar energy. The concentrated solar thermal energy is absorbed by methane reforming and coal gasification, both of which are endothermic reactions that produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Th ese gases are then consumed to produce methanol or dimethyl ether. The authors evaluated the amount of CO 2 emission when the methanol or di methyl ether was used and the cost of the methanol produced by this process. The amount of CO 2 emission using hybridized dimethyl ether (methanol) was estimated to be 60 to 80 % of the amount emitted using coal or natural gas. The cost of the hybridised methanol was estimated to be 2. 45 /kWh, which is about 20 % of the cost of the liquid hydrogen produced using renewable energy.

Firstly, a simple correlation is developed to provide an accurate and rapid prediction of the absorbed heat in the radiant section of a fired heater, expressed as a fraction of the total net heat liberation, in terms of the average heat flux to the tubes, the arrangement of the tubes (circumferential), and the air to fuel mass ratio. Secondly, another simple correlation is developed to approximate external heat transfer coefficients for 75, 100, and 150 Â mm nominal pipe size (NPS) steel pipes arranged in staggered rows and surrounded by combustion gases.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Currently {{there are a number}} of Generation IV SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactor (SCWR) concepts under development worldwide. The main objectives for developing and utilizing SCWRs are: 1) Increase <b>gross</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of current Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) from 33 – 35 % to approximately 45 – 50 %, and 2) Decrease the capital and operational costs and, in doing so, decrease electrical-energy costs (~$ 1000 US/kW or even less). SCW NPPs will have much higher operating parameters compared to current NPPs (i. e., pressures of about 25 MPa and outlet temperatures up to 625 °C). Additionally, SCWRs will have a simplified flow circuit in which steam generators, steam dryers, steam separators, etc. will be eliminated. Furthermore, SCWRs operating at higher temperatures can facilitate an economical co-generation of hydrogen through thermo-chemical cycles (particularly, the copper-chlorine cycle) or direct high-temperature electrolysis. To decrease significantly the development costs of a SCW NPP, to increase its reliability, and to achieve similar high thermal efficiencies as the advanced fossil steam cycles it should be determined whether SCW NPPs can be designed with a steam-cycle arrangement that closely matches that of mature SuperCritical (SC) fossil power plants (including their SC turbine technology). The state-of-the-art SC steam cycles in fossil power plants are designed with a single-steam reheat and regenerative feedwater heating and reach thermal steamcycle efficiencies up to 54 % (i. e., net plant efficiencies of up to 43 % on a Higher Heating Value (HHV) Basis). Therefore, simplified no-reheat, single-reheat, and double-reheat cycles without heat regeneration and a singlereheat cycle with heat regeneration based on the expected steam parameters of future SCW NPPs were analyzed in terms of their thermal efficiencies. On this basis, several conceptual steam-cycle arrangements of pressure-tube SCWRs, their corresponding T–s diagrams and steam-cycle thermal efficiencies (based on constant isentropic turbine and polytropic pump efficiencies) are presented in this paper. vk 201...|$|E

40|$|The Early Flight Fission Test Facility (EFF-TF) was {{established}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to provide a capability for performing hardware-directed activities to support multiple in-space nuclear reactor concepts by using a non-nuclear test methodology. This includes fabrication and testing at both the module/component level and near prototypic reactor configurations. The EFF-TF is currently supporting an effort to develop an affordable fission surface power (AFSP) system that could be deployed on the Lunar surface. The AFSP system is presently based on a pumped liquid metal-cooled (Sodium-Potassium eutectic, NaK- 78) reactor design. This design {{was derived from the}} only fission system that the United States has deployed for space operation, the Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) 10 A reactor, which was launched in 1965. Two prototypical components recently tested at MSFC were a pair of Stirling power conversion units that would be used in a reactor system to convert heat to electricity, and an annular linear induction pump (ALIP) that uses travelling electromagnetic fields to pump the liquid metal coolant through the reactor loop. First ever tests were conducted at MSFC to determine baseline performance of a pair of 1 kW Stirling convertors using NaK as the hot side working fluid. A special test rig was designed and constructed and testing was conducted inside a vacuum chamber at MSFC. This test rig delivered pumped NaK for the hot end temperature to the Stirlings and water as the working fluid on the cold end temperature. These test were conducted through a hot end temperature range between 400 to 550 C in increments of 50 C and a cold end temperature range from 30 to 70 C in 20 C increments. Piston amplitudes were varied from 6 to 1 1 mm in. 5 mm increments. A maximum of 2240 Watts electric was produced at the design point of 550 hot end, 40 C cold end with a piston amplitude of 10. 5 mm. This power level was reached at a <b>gross</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 28 %. A baseline performance map {{was established}} for the pair of 1 kW Stirling convertors. The performance data will then be used for design modification to the Stirling convertors. The ALIP tested at MSFC has no moving parts and no direct electrical connections to the liquid metal containing components. Pressure is developed by the interaction of the magnetic field produced by the stator and the current which flows {{as a result of the}} voltage induced in the liquid metal contained in the pump duct. Flow is controlled by variation of the voltage supplied to the pump windings. Under steady-state conditions, pump performance is measured for flow rates from 0. 5 - 4. 3 kg/s. The pressure rise developed by the pump to support these flow rates is roughly 5 - 65 kPa. The RMS input voltage (phase-to-phase voltage) ranges from 5 - 120 V, while the frequency can be varied arbitrarily up to 60 Hz. Performance is quantified at different loop temperature levels from 50 C up to 650 C, which is the peak operating temperature of the proposed AFSP reactor. The transient response of the pump is also evaluated to determine its behavior during startup and shut-down procedures...|$|E
