Asset-liability matrix is a sector-by-sector square matrix, so theadvantage is that we can apply the tremendous asset that the input-output analysis hasaccumulated {{since the early days of}} its development. However, input-output andasset-liability matrices are not necessarily identical twins. One of the leadingpeculiarities of the asset-liability matrix is that two distinct sector-by-sector matricesare derived from a set of balance sheets. The first one describes the propagation processof fund-raising while the other one depicts that of fund-employment. When there arediscrepancies in the valuation of assets and liabilities, the magnitude of the dispersioncould be different in one system from another. This will give us a clue to the generationmechanism of financial bubbles...|$|E

40|$|As Copeland (1947; 1952) {{demonstrated}} {{with his}} money-flows accounts {{more than half}} a century ago, the balance sheets of economic entities are closely interrelated through a lender-borrower relationship. This paper is an attempt to describe the US subprime mortgage crisis in the framework of 'balance sheet economics', which was originally proposed by Stone (1966) and Klein (1977; 1983). Since it is almost impossible to collect all the balance sheets of economic entities, we use <b>flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounts</b> instead to simulate the negative consequences resulting from home mortgage delinquencies. We show that the pass-through sequence converges when the original delinquency is made up by loss of net worth in any of the economic entities. Most of the eventual loss is incurred by 'Households and Nonprofit Organizations' and 'Rest of the World'. A portion of pass-through loss is eventually incurred by foreign countries with excess external assets, such as Japan, Ireland, etc. <b>Flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounts,</b> Leontief inverse, Lender-borrower relationship,...|$|R

These show inter-sectoral financial flows, capture balance sheet positions and all financial transactions by instrument, type and economic sector. In this paper we explain the methodology for the construction of <b>flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounts</b> and we exemplify their use for two source cases of study: the Mexican Crisis (1994 - 1995) and the Asian Crisis (1997 - 1998). Using similar sources of data, the same methodology and approach for the construction of all the flow-of-funds matrices allow comparisons among countries relating to the impact, manifestations of these crisis episodes and policy reactions to confront their effects. The use of homogeneous data and methodology also permits to trace contagion effects between countries. Abstract. [...] Introduction. [...] I. Flow-of-funds: a brief introduction. [...] II.

40|$|Compiling the <b>flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounts</b> (FFA) {{requires}} careful verification {{and validation}} of all primitive data and basic sources.

This paper presents the Bank of Japan’s framework of incorporating such new financial products into Japan’s FFA.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{application}} of Flow-of-Funds analysis {{to the case of}} Thailand during the 1996 - 97 Asian crisis. It begins with a background historical sketch of the financial crisis in East Asia, emphasizing the central role of weak financial systems and foreign debt. The paper then presents a method of estimating quarterly <b>Flow-of-Funds</b> <b>accounts</b> using Thailand as an example. This simple method is available from data published by the I. M. F. for most of the countries of the world. The Thai data are then used in a Flow-of-Funds analysis of the crisis in Thailand. This analysis contrasts with the opening historical sketch in quantitatively tracing the significant financial flows and, particularly, the finances of the private sector. The paper closes by emphasizing the need for current reporting of data to facilitate such analyses. Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

While the Federal Reserve System compiles a farm business sector sources-and-uses-of-funds statement consistent with {{and part of the}} national How-of-funds accounts, the statement is not definitionally and conceptually consistent with published farm income and balance sheet accounts. An alternative farm sector sources-and-uses-of-funds statement is pro-posed that contains these features, and its potential applications and extensions are delineated. POLICY AND PREDICTIVE questions facingagricultural economists today increasinglyinvolve a financial dimension. These ques-tions require analysts to relate farm income streams and other sources of funds to changes in balance sheet items. Often comparisons are needed on a sector or subsector basis as well as for national aggregates.

40|$|Copyright: Anne Mayhew, 2010 Bear with {{me while}} I summon {{the spirit of}} a too-often {{forgotten}} economist, one Morris Copeland, who did more than any other to create the <b>flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounts</b> that inform so much of modern economic macro analysis of the real world economy (Copeland 1952). 1 This summons from the dusty peace of library stacks seems essential In the face of the currently wildly misleading and ill-informed public debate over the perils of deficit spending by governments, a debate that threatens the world with more years of economic hardship and worse. Before turning to Copeland, consider again the need for better information and understanding. Readers of this journal will certainly agree that public debate over the role of government finance in combating recessionary forces in our global economic has been seriously impoverished by the way in which textbooks and some financial journalists simplify or, to put it more accurately, talk down and obfuscate when describing processes of intersectoral finance in modern economies.

40|$|The {{decline of}} the U. S. saving rate during the 1980 s and its {{potential}} impact on future economic growth {{has been the subject}} of considerable concern. The National Income Accounts (NIA) measures of saving are the empirical basis for the concern. However, the economics literature has soundly criticized the NIA concepts of saving and investment. Moreover, little evidence exists that the United States suffered a capital shortage during the 1980 s, when it enjoyed its second longest peacetime economic expansion. This paper examines the relation of NIA and other saving measures to future real GDP. Findings indicate that no measurable relation exists between the lagged NIA saving measures and real GDP. However, findings also indicate a significant relation does exist between real GDP and the sum of personal saving from the <b>flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounts</b> plus an approximation of government saving for infrastructure purposes. Unlike the NIA saving rate, this constructed saving rate did not decline precipitously in the 1980 s. Since the saving rate relevant to economic growth did not fall, the future of the U. S. economy might not be nearly so bleak as many assume. Copyright 1993 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R
40|$|Three major, interrelated {{accounting}} statements, at {{the frontiers}} of quantitative economic analysis, are three interrelated systems, namely: (1) National income and product accounts (NIPA), (2) The input-output tableaux, (IO), and (3) flow-of- funds accounts (FF). The third-mentioned system is somewhat less available and used in only limited areas of macroeconomic analysis. This paper is mainly concerned with use of FF accounting systems. This system shows where financial resources originate, and where they go in support of real capital formation. In this respect, interest rates and other market-based financial rates are of key importance. While much macroeconomic analysis {{is based on the}} rates that fit the yield curve, showing the interest rate structure over various maturities of debt associated with a given degree of risk. In contrast, the FF accounts throw light on the whole spectrum of interest rates, across maturities and debt qualities. For example, in analysis of the real estate market and funding of capital formation there, {{it is important to have}} a full understanding of the course of mortgage rates of different maturities and qualities. In short, it is necessary to develop a full appreciation of supply and demand forces in the mortgage market, which often is not obviously related to movements of the operative rate for monetary policy, such as very short-term inter bank rates or call money rates. This paper attempts to provide material from the <b>flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounts</b> that would make it possible to analyze the movement of relevant mortgage rates or whatever other rates are needed to understand the financing of capital formation in real estate.

40|$|Subject of {{the present}} study is the {{agent-based}} computer simulation of Agent Island. Agent Island is a macroeconomic model, which belongs to the field of monetary theory. Agent-based modeling is an innovative tool that made much progress in other scientific fields like medicine or logistics. In economics this tool is quite new, and in monetary theory to this date virtual no agent-based simulation model has been developed. It is therefore the topic of this study to close this gap to some extend. Hence, the model integrates in a straightforward way next to the common private sectors (i. e. households, consumer goods firms and capital goods firms) and as an innovation a banking system, a central bank and a monetary circuit. Thereby, the central bank controls the business cycle via an interest rate policy; the according mechanism builds on the seminal idea of Knut Wicksell (natural rate of interest vs. money rate of interest). In addition, the model contains also many Keynesian features and a <b>flow-of-funds</b> <b>accounting</b> system in the tradition of Wolfgang Stützel. Importantly, one objective of the study is the validation of Agent Island, which means that the individual agents (i. e. their rules, variables and parameters) are adjusted {{in such a way that}} on the aggregate level certain phenomena emerge. The crucial aspect of the modeling and the validation is therefore the relation between the micro and macro level: Every phenomenon on the aggregate level (e. g. some stylized facts of the business cycle, the monetary transmission mechanism, the Phillips curve relationship, the Keynesian paradox of thrift or the course of the business cycle) emerges out of individual actions and interactions of the many thousand agents on Agent Island. In contrast to models comprising a representative agent, we do not apply a modeling on the aggregate level; and in contrast to orthodox GE models, true interaction between heterogeneous agents takes place (e. g. by face-to-face-trading). ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{compilation}} procedure of the Asset- Liability-Matrix (ALM) from the <b>Flow-of-Funds</b> (FOF) <b>accounts</b> in the balance sheet format that is widely available in IMF member countries. The introduction of ALM into the framework of FOF analysis enables us to utilize the affluent assets of input-output analysis, notably the concept of Leontief inverse. The second {{purpose of this}} article is to demonstrate the application of ALM to the examination of the quantitative monetary policy introduced by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in March 2001. It can be said, as a conclusion, that there was a tactical error in the quantitative monetary policy adopted by BOJ in terms of the combination of money market operations. We believe that the ALM framework of FOF analysis is a powerful and practical device to fulfil this kind of examination.

30|$|<b>Flow-of-funds</b> (FOF) <b>accounts</b> {{indicate}} the interrelations {{between the various}} institutional sectors of each nation, including overseas sectors, in a systematic and coherent manner. The FOF system adopts a quadruple-entry system proposed by Copeland (1952), wherein each transaction is recorded with a double entry. On the other hand, the input–output (I–O) table, which indicates production in the real economy, is composed of various industries. Transactions of production always involve funds transactions. Klein (2003) indicated a need for the “from-whom-to-whom” basis FOF table’s construction, which corresponds to tables and techniques of I–O analysis. However, {{it is difficult to}} link the I–O table and FOF accounts. The economic agents in the I–O table are separated into hundreds of industries. Though the FOF accounts comprise all economic agents in one country, data on only two types of institutional sectors, namely nonfinancial public corporations and nonfinancial private corporations, are announced in the FOF accounts. In other words, most economic agents in the I–O table are aggregated in the FOF accounts.|$|R
30|$|This study mainly aims {{to provide}} an inter-industry {{analysis}} through the subdivision of various industries in <b>flow-of-funds</b> (FOF) <b>accounts.</b> Combined with the Financial Statement Analysis data from 2004 and 2005, the Korean FOF accounts are reconstructed to form “from-whom-to-whom” basis FOF tables, which are composed of 115 institutional sectors and correspond to tables and techniques of input–output (I–O) analysis. First, power of dispersion indices are obtained by applying the I–O analysis method. Most service and IT industries, construction, and light industries in manufacturing {{are included in the}} first-quadrant group, whereas heavy and chemical industries are placed in the fourth quadrant since their power indices in the asset-oriented system are comparatively smaller than those of other institutional sectors. Second, investments and savings, which are induced by the central bank, are calculated for monetary policy evaluations. Industries are bifurcated into two groups to compare their features. The first group refers to industries whose power of dispersion in the asset-oriented system is greater than 1, mainly light industries, IT, and service. On the other hand, the second group indicates that their index is less than 1, mostly heavy and chemical industries. We found that the net induced investments (NII)–total liabilities ratios of the first group show levels half those of the second group since the former’s induced savings are obviously greater than the latter.|$|R
3000|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the chaebol using <b>flow-of-funds</b> (FOF) <b>accounts.</b> The FOF accounts consist {{of the balance}} sheets of all institutional sectors in a country, including the foreign sector. The FOF table shows the interrelations between various institutional sectors. In this analysis, we integrate the chaebol into FOF accounts. Applying the input–output analysis method to FOF accounts, Y and [...] Y^* matrices (asset–liability matrix of institutional sector-by-institutional sector) are obtained. Furthermore, using a Leontief inverse matrix, four kinds of indices (the power-of-dispersion index and the sensitivity-of-dispersion index) are estimated. Some previous studies attempted to subdivide the corporate sector of the FOF accounts into various industries. For example, Nishiyama (1991) used the balance sheets and income statements of each industry in Japan to subdivide non-financial corporations in FOF accounts into 37 industries. In this paper, the power indices of 44 institutional sectors are reported. Kim (2016) used this method to disaggregate the Korean FOF accounts into 115 institutional sectors, including 95 types of inter-industries, combined with the Financial Statement Analysis data. According to these studies, using balance sheets and income statement data for each industry, {{it is possible to}} generate expanded FOF accounts that indicate the financial transactions of each industry. Therefore, if the financial statements of the chaebol are obtained, then {{it will be possible to}} add the chaebol sector to the FOF account. This research aims to find and identify the characteristics and roles of the chaebol in the financial system of Korea. This paper consists of four sections. The first section is the introduction. The second section explains the data and the analytical method adopted in this study. The third section describes the results of our research in three parts. Conclusions are drawn in the last section.|$|R
