5000|$|A <b>gilgai</b> is a small, ephemeral lake {{formed from}} a {{depression}} in the soil surface in expanding clay soils. Additionally, the term [...] "gilgai" [...] is {{used to refer to}} the overall micro-relief in such areas, consisting of mounds and depressions, not just the lakes themselves. The name comes from an Australian Aboriginal word meaning small water hole. These pools are commonly a few metres across and less than 30 cm deep, however in some instances they may be several metres deep and up to 100 m across. Gilgais are found worldwide wherever cracking clay soils and pronounced wet and dry seasons are present. Gilgais are also called melonholes, crabholes, hogwallows or puff and shelf formations.Gilgais are thought to form in vertisols through repeated cycles of swelling of the clay when wet and subsequent shrinkage upon drying. This action, known as argilliturbation, causes the soil to crack when dry and loose soil material then fills these cracks. When the soil swells upon subsequent re-wetting the soil pressure cannot be dispersed into the now-full cracks and the soil is forced sideways causing a mound to form between cracks and a depression to form at the location of the crack. The process is then further exaggerated by the depressions holding water and thus becoming wetter and swelling more than the mounds, causing even greater shrinkage and cracking. In addition, the cracks channel water deeply into the soil causing even greater swelling and subsequent cracking of the depression areas. Each cycle of swelling, shrinkage and cracking becomes more exaggerated and the landscape eventually becomes covered by a repeated pattern of mounds and depressions. The depressions hold surface water during the wet seasons.|$|E
40|$|There is the {{specific}} {{form of a}} microrelief of swelling clay soils, called <b>gilgai.</b> The relief consists of mounds, depressions, and even sections of the surface.

The objective of this work is to propose a quantitative model of possible interconnections between the formation of shrinkage cracks, vertical and horizontal, and the <b>gilgai</b> microrelief. Preliminarily, a summary is given of available models of the vertical and horizontal shrinkage cracks in soils. A proposed mechanism of the <b>gilgai</b> formation is based on a width increase of the air-filled horizontal cracks during a wetting season. Some simple relations are considered between the <b>gilgai</b> microrelief and vertical and horizontal shrinkage cracking.

40|$|Expansive {{soils are}} those that expand and {{contract}} significantly when subjected to changes in moisture. The presence of such soils can accelerate the deterioration rate of pavements due to increased cracking and roughness, especially when <b>Gilgai</b> relief is allowed to manifest beneath the pavement structure. <b>Gilgai</b> relief is a naturally occurring topographical feature that results in a unique undulating ground surface. These undulations develop from deep seated swelling pressures within the underlying expansive soil layers. At present, current road roughness indices cannot isolate the roughness caused by <b>Gilgai</b> relief and the detection of <b>Gilgai</b> in the field can be difficult.

40|$|Crack orientations are an {{important}} soil physical property that affects water flow, particularly in vertic soils.

40|$|Spatial {{diversity}} is {{a characteristic of}} all soils, but in Vertisols with high physical activity remarkable close-interval microvariability corresponds to <b>gilgai</b> microrelief, oscillatory subsoil horizonation, contorted or interrupted soil layers, diverse vegetative communities, and complex hydrology. In Soil Taxonomy the pedon was established to accommodate such cyclic spatial diversity and interrupted horizons which occurred within lateral distances of 7 m or less; the dominant soil condition within 1 / 2 of the cycle (3. 5 m) is called a consociation representing a single taxon. However, when the cycle was > 7 m, then a soil complex {{of two or more}} taxa is recognized. This rather arbitrary concept of the pedon has not fostered comprehensive soil investigations, enhanced understanding of pedogenesis, nor elucidated better interpretations of soil behavior, use and management. A common question is which component of the pedon should be sampled and characterized to represent the soil body. The concept of a pedon as the sampling unit should be reappraised and revised to encompass the variability within a constant area, e. g. 1 m. Such a revision would provide a sampling design for Vertisols similar to other soils that are less spatially variable. Present understanding of pedogenesis and soil behavior in Vertisols demonstrates the importance of verifying spatial variability in physical, chemical, and biological attributes over short lateral distances. If the pedon were redefined as a constant-area sampling unit, then mapping and classification of Vertisols would be based on the distribution and composition of contrasting soils within the <b>gilgai</b> cycle, independent of periodicity.

40|$|Dr. Michael John KnightThe profile characteristics, {{geographical}} {{extent and}} general environmental relationships of duplex soils are described. They are {{shown to be}} an important group in Australia and particularly in Victoria. The variety of approaches and definitions employed by investigators of soil structure are discussed. These are contrasted with the definition used in this thesis which incorporates the concepts of spatial distribution and orientation of vectorial fabric elements in the soil. The importance of describing structural features at a number of scales is emphasized. At each scale an attempt is made to quantitatively describe (where possible) the three or two-dimensional geometrical properties of the soil components. A structural classification of duplex soils that incorporates a number of descriptive geometrical elements is proposed. A detailed study is made of the structure and related chemical, physical and mineralogical properties at an undisturbed site (Boorook) in Western Victoria. The ground surface at the Boorook site is described as being deformed into <b>gilgai</b> microrelief. It is demonstrated that soil structural analysis can be usefully employed to develop a swelling mechanism that explains how the Boorook <b>gilgai</b> probably formed. The data and subsequent analysis tends to place some doubt on mechanisms proposed by past workers. A detailed study is also reported from a site (Hartwell) near Melbourne. The site is described as being illustrative of profiles that show little or no internal and ground surface deformation. An unfolded stoneline is considered to be the principal structural feature. The mechanism for the formation of the stoneline is shown to probably involve gravitational settling of the grains in a fluid-like medium. Regional investigations of profiles throughout Western and Central Victoria and New Guinea are also described. It has been found that the principles and techniques of soil structural analysis can also be applied to buried soil structures. By these means it has been possible to establish that buried fold-like structures seen in section in a road cutting at Terang, are in fact relics of <b>gilgai.</b> Experimental models have assisted the investigations into the structure of duplex soils and have provided additional information on the dynamic interaction of moisture with the soil components. The main processes and sequences in the genetic development of structure of duplex soils as discussed in the light of observations of natural structures and experimental results. Attention is drawn to the differences between the dominant structural processes in the two main horizons of the profile. The approach of soil structural analysis is formalized for profile studies into the discipline of Structural Pedology. The principles of Structural Pedology threaded through the body of the thesis are summarized and shown to be very similar to those of Rock Fabric Analysis. The need for an interdisciplinary approach in this field is emphasized. It is shown that soil structural analysis is not limited to Pedology but rather can be applied to a number of academic and applied problems in a variety of disciplines that include Engineering (Soil Mechanics), Earth Sciences, Agriculture, Soil Erosion and Conservation.

40|$|In this dissertation, I examine {{several issues}} related to the pre-hispanic {{utilization}} of wetlands by the Maya. Fourteen hypotheses associated with one model of wetland utilization, the Pohl-Bloom model are tested in this dissertation. The Pohl-Bloom model views the use of wetlands as being restricted in time and space, with wetlands only being utilized in the Preclassic along the Rio Hondo drainage. Rising sea levels caused a rise in the freshwater table, which ultimately forced the Maya to abandon their wetland fields {{at the end of the}} Preclassic. Patterns observed in wetlands outside of the Rio Hondo drainage are, according to this model, the remnant of natural features called <b>gilgai.</b> Before examining the Pohl-Bloom model several related aspects of tropical ecology and wetland ecology were examined, including deforestation and climatic change. Though deforestation can influence regional water tables, the deforestation in the Maya area appears to be to have been too early to have had any significant impact on wetland agriculture. Climate change is currently a major topic in Maya studies, with drought conceivably having an influence on wetland agriculture. The present examination of the climatic data, however, that there is not a good correlation between the timing of droughts and the timing of significant changes in Maya culture. Evidence is also presented that questions the reliability of the isotopic data that has been used to study climatic change in the Maya Lowlands. Examination of the Pohl-Bloom model resulted in rejection of all fourteen hypotheses. The available evidence on sea level changes indicates that water levels in the Preclassic were dropping, not rising, while there is no evidence for changes in the water table during the Preclassic. The environmental factors present in the Maya Lowlands are simply not capable of creating large rectilinear <b>gilgai.</b> Similarly, the shallow slopes and absence of the sorting of sediments by size can be used to rule erosion as a major factor in the creation of the wetland stratigraphies. Based upon the available evidence, it is argued that raised fields were utilized throughout northern Belize, having their most widespread distribution in the Late Classic Period...|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{replacement process}} is described {{to explain the}} way in which soft calcic horizons become 'mobile' and actively penetrate the soil. This model implies that the horizons are pedogenetic features which may be very old since they can escape exposure in a landscape subject to erosion. The lime they contain can be derived from the weathering strata through which they have passed in the course of time. The process is initiated by subterranean <b>gilgaï</b> formation which introduces soil material into {{the lower part of the}} calcic horizon which subsequently moves this material upward and expels it from the top. The transport process was re-created in the laboratory and monitored by stereo radiography. Its driving force is derived from air enclosure which occurs upon wetting of crystalline powdery lime. Field data from the study area have yielded evidence of the replacement process and indicate the main controlling factors. Rates of downward movement of the calcic horizons have been calculated to be of the same order of magnitude as representative erosion rates for the area.

40|$|Anastomosing river {{plains of}} the Channel Country, central Australia, have aggraded slowly {{over the past}} 100 ka. Channel sediments {{accumulate}} mainly as accretionary benches of mud and sand, sandy channel-base sheets and vegetation-shadow deposits. The channels are laterally stable and the sediments have aggraded locally against erosional banks of tough floodplain muds. Channel sediments are profoundly affected by desiccation during dry periods and by bioturbation caused by within-channel trees and burrowing invertebrates, especially crayfish. Excavations show that mud-dominated channel bodies of low width:thickness ratio are generated {{by a combination of}} vertical and lateral accretion. Levees and braided surfaces, composed mainly of mud aggregates, border the channels and are activated during valley-wide floods which lay down distal mud sheets. Floodplain muds are converted to vertisols with <b>gilgai,</b> deep desiccation cracks, and impregnations of carbonate and gypsum. A fixed-channel facies model is applicable to the Channel Country river deposits. Anastomosis apparently results from the need for the system to move large volumes of water and moderate sediment loads across low-gradient interior basins. Channels distant from upland source areas receive an abundant supply of pedogenic, sand-sized mud aggregates generated on adjacent floodplains and reworked into braid bars during valley-wide floods.
