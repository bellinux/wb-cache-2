2500|$|Thernstrom's stance {{has been}} sharply criticized by other conservatives, such as federal {{prosecutor}} Andrew C. McCarthy, {{who wrote a}} response to Thernstrom in a later issue of National Review. He points out that a year earlier Thernstrom had been among those criticizing the Obama administration's decision to dismiss the case, {{and that she had}} not explained the reason for her reversal of opinion. McCarthy referred to the comment by Bartle Bull, who witnessed the incident, that it was the most blatant form of voter intimidation he had ever encountered in his life, as well as {{the fact that it was}} highly unusual for the case to be dismissed after a default judgment against the defendants had already been won. In reply to McCarthy, Thernstrom clarified her opinion by stating that [...] "I still <b>have</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> DOJ's conduct, and I remain interested in knowing more about why the department declined to pursue the case." [...] However, she added that as she learned more about the case, she became doubtful it was as severe an example of voter intimidation as it first appeared to be, and was of the opinion that [...] "the incident was not of sufficient importance to be the primary focus of our yearlong project." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{political}} science professors questioned whether Obama's speech {{would have the}} effect he hoped for in terms of distancing himself from the controversial comments made by Wright and allaying the concerns {{of a number of}} white voters. Michael Munger—head of the {{political science}} department at Duke University, and a Libertarian candidate for Governor of North Carolina in 2008—called the speech [...] "brave", but said that Obama was [...] "being naive". Munger argued that [...] " [...] black candidate named Barack Hussein Obama can't <b>have</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> his patriotism, and commitment to America, not if he is going to beat a genuine war hero" [...] (a reference to John McCain and the general election). He argued that Obama [...] "had to distance himself far from Wright. Instead, he was brave." [...] Susan B. Hansen of the University of Pittsburgh noted that [...] "the dilemma for Obama is that the more he talks about race being unimportant or transcended, the more important it will become to the media and voters' perceptions." [...] She suggested Obama did not put the Wright issue to rest and that, if Obama became the nominee, Wright's comments would no doubt {{play a role in the}} general election as fodder for Republican attacks against him. Similarly, Eric Plutzer of Penn State argued that Obama's speech [...] "did not put the Rev. Wright controversy behind him. Those skeptical of Obama are likely to continue to distribute video clips, and quotes of Obama's own words, to argue that his reaction was not sufficiently strong..." ...|$|E
