40|$|It is {{well known}} that the inverse {{function}} of y = x with the derivative y' = 1 is x = y, the inverse function of y = c with the derivative y' = 0 is inexistent, and so on. Hence, {{on the assumption that the}} noninvertibility of the univariate increasing function y = f(x) with x > 0 is in direct proportion to the growth rate reflected by its derivative, the authors put forward a method of comparing difficulties in inverting two functions on a continuous or discrete interval called asymptotic granularity reduction (AGR) which integrates asymptotic analysis with logarithmic granularities, and is an extension and a complement to polynomial time (Turing) reduction (PTR). Prove by AGR that <b>inverting</b> <b>y</b> = x ^ x (mod p) is computationally harder than <b>inverting</b> <b>y</b> = g ^ x (mod p), and <b>inverting</b> <b>y</b> = g ^ (x ^ n) (mod p) is computationally equivalent to <b>inverting</b> <b>y</b> = g ^ x (mod p), which are compatible with the results from PTR. Besides, apply AGR to the comparison of <b>inverting</b> <b>y</b> = x ^ n (mod p) with y = g ^ x (mod p), y = g ^ (g 1 ^ x) (mod p) with y = g ^ x (mod p), and y = x ^ n + x + 1 (mod p) with y = x ^ n (mod p) in difficulty, and observe that the results are consistent with existing facts, which further illustrates that AGR is suitable for comparison of inversion problems in difficulty. Last, prove by AGR that <b>inverting</b> <b>y</b> = (x ^ n) (g ^ x) (mod p) is computationally equivalent to <b>inverting</b> <b>y</b> = g ^ x (mod p) when PTR can not be utilized expediently. AGR with the assumption partitions the complexities of problems more detailedly, and finds out some new evidence for the security of cryptosystems. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

40|$|Summary. -Reproductive and {{endocrine}} {{function was}} investigated in 22 women with Hodgkin's disease who had bilateral mid-line oophoropexies performed at staging laparotomy. The operation was followed in 12 cases by " <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> " pelvic lymph node irradiation and in 4 cases by para-aortic lymph node irradiation. Pregnancies occurred after the operation in 4 of the 6 patients subsequently found not to require irradiation below the diaphragm. In the other 2 patients in this group the menstrual history was unaffected and normal gonadotrophin concentra-tions indicated intact ovarian function. In the group receiving para-aortic irradia-tion, in whom the ovarian irradiation dose was small (about 150 rad to each ovary) menstrual function and gonadotrophin concentrations were normal {{at the time of}} review and one patient has subsequently become pregnant. In the group receiving <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> irradiation, in whom the ovaries were shielded from the radiation beam by a rectangular lead block, the ovarian dose was much higher (lowest dose 600 rad, highest dose 3500 rad).

25|$|Historically the European {{medicinal}} leech, another invertebrate parasite, {{has been}} used in medicine to remove blood from patients. They have three jaws (tripartite) that look like little saws, and on them are about 100 sharp teeth used to incise the host. The incision leaves a mark that is an <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> inside of a circle. After piercing the skin and injecting anticoagulants (hirudin) and anaesthetics, they suck out blood, consuming up to ten times their body weight in a single meal.|$|R

By building a cable-stayed bridge a large excavation for an anchorage would not be needed, thereby lessening the environmental impact on the surrounding area. The steel towers are 220 m high and shaped like an <b>inverted</b> <b>Y.</b> The side-spans are 164.5 m and 257.5 m respectively, {{and there are also}} three very small cable spans.|$|R

40|$|Four {{males with}} ectopic {{ureteral}} opening are reported herein. Case 1 was a 17 year old who complained of miction pain and macroscopic hematuria. Cystoscopy and radiological examinations showed left ectopic ureteral opening into the seminal vesicle associated with left renal agenesis. The left ureter and seminal vesicle were extirpated. Case 2 was a 21 year old who complained of lower abdominal pain. On physical examination, a child's head sized mass was palpable in the midline {{of the lower}} abdomen. Operation was performed under diagnosis of intrapelvic tumor, but the mass was cystic dilatation of left ureter which opened into the seminal vesicle. Case 3 was a 19 year old who complained of right CVA colic pain. On cystoscopy, the right ureteral orifice was absent. During the operation, right ureter was found to open into the posterior urethra. Case 4 was a 57 year old who complained of fever. Plain X-ray on the pelvic cavity showed a 82 X 10 mm calcified shadow. CT revealed a right ectopic ureteral opening into the posterior urethra with a ureteral stone in it. On cystoscopy, the right ureteral orifice was identified and pus discharge was observed to flow out of it. Operative exploration demonstrated that the right ureter was <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> duplication; one opened into the posterior urethra and the other into the trigone.

40|$|Pericentric {{inversion}} {{of the human}} Y chromo-some has been reported infrequently but it {{is known to be}} an inherited anomaly.

40|$|Purpose: Prior {{structural}} {{studies of}} posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) development in Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats suggest that migration of basal fiber ends was disrupted, ultimately {{resulting in a}} PSC. Therefore {{the goal of this}} study was to assess the overall migration patterns as well as changes to the structure and cytoskeleton of basal fiber ends during PSC development. Methods: Lenses from 48 RCS dystrophic rats (RCS/Lav) and 24 genetically matched control animals (RCS-rdy + /Lav) from 2 to 8 weeks old were examined. Equatorial diameters were measured and suture patterns were photographed immediately following enucleation/dissection. Right eye lenses were fixed and processed to visualize the actin cytoskeleton via laser scanning confocal microcopy (LSCM), left eye lenses were decapsulated, fixed and processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Scaled 3 D-computer assisted drawings (CADs) and animations were constructed from the data to depict the changes in suture patterns and fiber end architecture. Results: At 2 weeks, dystrophic lenses displayed an <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> suture on the posterior, and by 3 weeks most lenses had at least one sub-branch. Additional sub-branches were observed with time, opacities being visible as early as 4 weeks and progressing into PSC plaques by 6 weeks. Control lenses displayed <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> sutures at all ages and were transparent. SEM of dystrophic lenses revealed fiber ends with normal size, shape, arrangement, and filopodia at 2 weeks; scattered areas of dome-shaped fiber ends and small filopodia were present at 3 weeks.

40|$|Involved field (IF) {{radiation}} {{was compared}} with extended field (EF) radiation in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) {{to ascertain whether}} reduced radiation fields would reduce the late sequelae of radiation without compromising disease control and survival. A total of 603 patients with stage I or II HL were entered into this trial; laparotomy {{was carried out in}} 380 (63 %) patients. Stage I or IIA disease patients were randomised to receive IF or EF comprising a mantle or <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> fields alone. Stage I and IIB patients were randomised between mantle or <b>inverted</b> <b>Y</b> fields and total nodal irradiation (TNI). The dose was 35 Gy to uninvolved sites and 40 Gy to involved sites. The median followup of surviving patients was 25. 2 years with only 3. 3 % lost to follow-up. The treatment failure rate at 25 years in stage IA and IIA was 44 % after EF and 54 % after IF (P = 0. 01); in stage I and IIB this was 80 % (EF) and 82 % (TNI) at 25 years. No difference in overall survival between the randomised groups was seen. The incidence of second malignancies was 21 % after IF and 20 % after EF with a slight excess of lung cancer in the EF group. No significant differences in the causes of death between the randomised arms have emerged. In conclusion, IF radiotherapy for stage I and IIA HL results in a 11 % greater risk of relapse compared with EF but has no effect on overall survival, risk of second malignancy or cause of death at 25 years...|$|R
