40|$|We {{present a}} haptic {{rendering}} technique that uses directional constraints to facilitate enhanced exploration modes for volumetric datasets. The algorithm restricts user motion in certain directions by incrementally moving a proxy point along the axes {{of a local}} reference frame. Reaction forces are generated by a <b>spring</b> <b>coupler</b> between the proxy and the data probe, which can be tuned to {{the capabilities of the}} haptic interface. Secondary haptic effects including field forces, friction, and texture can be easily incorporated to convey information about additional characteristics of the data. We illustrate the technique with two examples: displaying fiber orientation in heart muscle layers and exploring diffusion tensor fiber tracts in brain white matter tissue. Initial evaluation of the approach indicates that haptic constraints provide an intuitive means for displaying directional information in volume data...|$|R
50|$|Engine no. 3 had its <b>spring</b> buffers-and-chain <b>couplers</b> {{replaced}} with the CGR's standard Johnston link-and-pin couplers. The locomotive was probably never classified or renumbered in CGR service and became generally known as the Coffee Pot. It served as construction locomotive while a temporary rail bridge was being constructed across the Orange River at Norvalspont, later {{to be replaced by}} a permanent bridge. In 1889, the Coffee Pot became the first locomotive to steam across the border between the Cape of Good Hope and the Orange Free State.|$|R

50|$|The second {{release of}} the Proto 2000 BL2 came in a Blue-Green box and {{featured}} an updated motor, that was also insulated from the frame, better, cut down, flywheels, more traditional kadee type cupler pockets. The drive wheels were now updated to nickel silver, vastly improving power pickup. This version came with the, now usual, no <b>spring,</b> knuckle <b>couplers,</b> that were also based on the kadee couplers. these units were also equipped with a DCC-ready socket from the factory making DCC conversion easy. The dummy plug board, that was installed by the factory and allowed the locomotive to run with stranded direct current control, replaced the complex wiring for the directional headlights.|$|R

5|$|Scarification had {{its origins}} in Nri mythology. Nri, the son of Eri who {{established}} the town of Nri, {{was said to have}} pleaded to Chukwu (the Great God) because of hunger. Chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son's and daughter's heads and plant them, creating a 'blood bond' between the Igbo and the earth deity, Ana. Before doing so, Nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads. Coco yam, a crop managed by <b>females,</b> <b>sprang</b> from his daughter's head, and yam, the Igbo peoples' staple crop, sprung from his son's head; Chukwu had taught Nri plant domestication. From this, the eze Nri's first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification's seven days after birth, with the eze Nri's daughter being the only female to receive ichi. Nri, the son of Eri, also gained knowledge of the yam medicine (ogwu ji). People from other Igbo communities made pilgrimages to Nri in order to receive this knowledge received in exchange for annual tributes.|$|R

40|$|Climatic and biotic {{circumstances}} vary as seasons shift, {{and different}} cohorts of multivoltine species are likely subjected to different selection regimes. The bivoltine butterfly Leptidea reali (Réal’s wood white; Lepidoptera: Pieridae) appears during May and June in central Sweden {{and has a}} partial second generation in late July. We manipulated both generations to appear simultaneously and performed laboratory mating experiments that showed {{the presence of a}} behavioral polyphenism in mating propensity, which is induced during the developmental stages. Females of the summer generation expressed higher mating propensities than <b>spring</b> generation <b>females.</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>females</b> showed an increase in mating propensity with increasing age, whereas summer females accepted most matings already when they were only 1 or 2 days old. It is likely that larval time constraints, a lower abundance of males and a lower risk of accepting a male of their univoltine sister species Leptidea sinapis (wood white), have relaxed selection on mate discrimination among summer generation females. A major challenge for future research is to further investigate the developmental pathways causing the polyphenism and the adaptive implications of cohort...|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{and general}} {{design for a}} high {{frequency}} vibrating screen consists of mainframe, screen web, eccentric bock, electric motor, rub <b>spring</b> and <b>coupler.</b> The two most common types of vibrators which induce the high frequency vibrations are hydraulic or electric vibrators, these electric vibrators are either electric motors or solenoids. Common designs for screening decks are either single or double deck. In addition, another feature of high frequency vibrating screens are the static side plates which provide benefits such as smaller support structure, less noise, longer life, and hence less maintenance. In industry, the screens are operated at a tiled angle up till 40 º. The high frequency (1500 - 7200 rpm) and low amplitude (1.2 - 2.0 mm) characteristics leads to the vertical-elliptical movement that rapidly transports oversized particles down the screen. Creating a thin bed of particles, this improves the efficiency and capacity of the screen.|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} snow skink, Niveoscincus microlepidotus, has {{a protracted}} gestation, lasting approximately one year. Ovulation occurs in spring (November) and embryonic development is completed by early autumn (March); however, birth {{does not occur}} until the following spring. Previous {{studies have shown that}} plasma progesterone concentration peaks in preovulatory <b>females</b> (<b>spring,</b> October), remains high during early gestation, and decreases to basal by autumn. In vitro progesterone production by corpora lutea, non-luteal ovary, anterior oviduct, placental tissues, muscle, and embryonic adrenal-gonads from N. microlepidotus was assessed throughout gestation. Tissues were incubated with or without the precursor pregnenolone for 3 h at 24 C; the resulting media were analysed for progesterone using radioimmunoassay. In vitro progesterone production by corpora lutea in media only was high during early gestation, dropping to basal by autumn. Maternal adrenal glands produced progesterone in vitro in media only throughout gestation; however, the pattern of production did not correlate with plasma concentrations and may represent steroid that is normally converted to corticosterone. Non-luteal ovary, anterior oviduct, placental tissues, muscle, and embryonic adrenal-gonads produced minimal progesterone in media only, but were able to convert pregnenolone to progesterone; this suggests steroid metabolic capability within these tissues. Further research is needed to address the possible endocrine role(s) of placental and embryonic tissues during gestation in viviparous squamates...|$|R
