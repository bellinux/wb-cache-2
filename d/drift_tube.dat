25|$|The {{floating}} <b>drift</b> <b>tube</b> klystron has {{a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the <b>drift</b> <b>tube</b> and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The <b>drift</b> <b>tube</b> is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the <b>drift</b> <b>tube</b> may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|E
25|$|The <b>drift</b> <b>tube</b> (DT) system {{measures}} muon {{positions in}} the barrel part of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the electric field ending up at the positively charged wire. By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires are going into the page) {{as well as by}} calculating the muon's original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon’s position. Each DT chamber, on average 2m x 2.5m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.|$|E

40|$|The muon {{spectrometer}} of the ATLAS detector at CERN uses <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> {{as basic}} detection elements {{over most of}} the solid angle. The performance of these monitored <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> (MDTs), in particular their spatial resolution of 80 µm, determines the precision of the spectrometer. If ageing effects occur, the precision of the <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> will be degraded. Hence ageing effects have to be minimized or avoided altogether if possible. Even with a gas mixture of Ar:CO 2 (93 : 7), which was selected for its good ageing properties, ageing effects were observed in test systems. They were caused by small amounts of impurities, in particular volatile silicon compounds. Systematic studies revealed the required impurity levels deteriorating the <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> to be well below 1 ppm. Many components of the ATLAS MDT gas system are supplied by industry. In a newly designed ageing experiment in Freiburg these components were validated for their use in ATLAS. With a fully assembled ATLAS gas distribution rack as test component ageing effects were observed. It was therefore decided to install gas filters in the gas distribution lines to remove volatile silicon compounds efficiently from the gas mixture. Finally a filter was designed that can adsorb up to 5. 5 g of volatile silicon compounds, hereby reducing the impurities in the outlet gas mixture to less than 30 ppb...|$|R
50|$|Reduced {{pressure}} <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> operate {{using the}} same principles as their atmospheric pressure counterparts, but at drift gas pressure {{of only a few}} torr. Due to the vastly reduced number of ion-neutral interactions, much longer <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> or much faster ion shutters are necessary to achieve the same resolving power. However, the reduced pressure operation offers several advantages. First, it eases interfacing the IMS with mass spectrometry. Second, at lower pressures, ions can be stored for injection from an ion trap and re-focussed radially during and after the separation. Third, high values of E/N can be achieved, allowing for direct measurement of K(E/N) over a wide range.|$|R
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, an IMS system measures {{how long}} a given ion takes to traverse a given length in a uniform electric field through a given atmosphere.

For precise control of the ion pulse width admitted to the <b>drift</b> <b>tube,</b> more complex gating systems such as a Bradbury-Nielsen or a Field Switching Shutter are employed. Once in the <b>drift</b> <b>tube,</b> ions are subjected to a homogeneous electric field ranging from a few volts per centimeter up to many hundreds of volts per centimeter. This electric field then drives the ions through the <b>drift</b> <b>tube</b> where they interact with the neutral drift molecules contained within the system and separate based on the ion mobility, arriving at the detector for measurement. Ions are recorded at the detector in order from the fastest to the slowest, generating a response signal characteristic for the chemical composition of the measured sample.|$|E

[...] With the flowing afterglow Langmuir probe the electron density within the reaction region of the <b>drift</b> <b>tube</b> can be studied. With the VT-FLAP version of flowing afterglow the reactions temperature dependence could be studied. [...] Now in the 2000's the ambient version of flowing afterglow mass spectrometry is flowing atmospheric pressure afterglow mass spectrometry (FAPA-MS).The FAPA allows for simple or no sample preparations but the humidity of the instrument's environment may have an effect on an sample fragmentation pattern.Since the cost of helium is steady rising some have started to use alternative methods with ambient flowing afterglow to conserve resources. Instead of using continuously flowing afterglow helium some use interrupted helium flow to conserve gas and Schlieren imaging to maximize the molecular ions produced and the instrument step-up.|$|E
40|$|Four {{perennial}} rheocrene springs {{located between}} 919 and 1252 m a. s. l. on substrata characterized by different lithologies were studied. Water samples and invertebrates were collected seasonally for one year. The crenic fauna was collected using three sampling techniques: moss washing, <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> and benthic traps. Each sampling technique was particularly efficient for collecting specific taxa {{typical of the}} different habitats (crenophilous crustaceans and crenoxenic benthic insects were dominant in benthic traps and moss; crenophilic, stygophilic and stygobiotic crustaceans in <b>drift</b> <b>tubes).</b> A total of 3, 284 invertebrates belonging to 54 taxa were collected. Ostracoda, Harpacticoida, and Diptera were the most abundant taxa. Species assemblages collected at each spring, in each season, in traps and mosses, differed among springs, and, based on invertebrate assemblages, the ordination of the investigated springs did not correspond to that based on environmental parameters. Of the environmental variables only pH and temperature explained the diversity pattern. Assemblages collected from different habitats also differed: benthic traps collected mainly Chironomidae, Ostracoda, other Diptera, crenophilous Harpacticoida, and Gastropoda; in moss assemblages, the fauna was mostly represented by crenophilic Harpacticoida, Ostracoda, Plecoptera, Chironomidae. Finally, the groundwater assemblages, collected with <b>drift</b> <b>tubes,</b> were dominated by crenophilous Harpacticoida, Chironomidae and Plecoptera. Variation in number of taxa over time was observed in traps and moss samples, whereas <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> showed no seasonality. Meiofauna (i. e., permanent meiofauna, represented by Nematoda, Copepoda, Ostracoda, and Hydrachnidia, and temporary meiofauna, represented by early instars of insect larvae) dominated all habitats, probably because of constant flow and favourable habitats such as moss. The presence of mosses was a factor that increased the species diversity of the investigated springs; <b>drift</b> <b>tubes</b> allowed most of the stygobiotic taxa to be collected, although this technique did not necessarily increase {{the total number of}} taxa collected. In addition to the array of habitats, other factors, such as geology, might influence the structure of invertebrate communities.
