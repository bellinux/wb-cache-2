Responding sheriff's deputies and nearby pedestrians ran to the victims and tried to tend to their wounds before ambulances arrived.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Garrido kidnapped 25-year-old Katherine Callaway in South Lake Tahoe, California. He {{took her}} to a Reno, Nevada {{warehouse}}, where he raped her for five and a half hours. When a police officer noticed a car parked outside the unit and then the broken lock on the warehouse door, <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door and was greeted by Garrido. Callaway then emerged and asked for help. Garrido was promptly arrested. He was charged and convicted of crimes in both federal and state courts. In a 1976 court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Garrido was diagnosed as a [...] "sexual deviant and chronic drug abuser." [...] The psychiatrist recommended that a neurological examination be conducted because Garrido's chronic drug use could be [...] "responsible in part" [...] for his [...] "mixed" [...] or [...] "multiple" [...] sexual deviation. He was then evaluated by a neurologist. The diagnostic impression was: [...] "normal neurological examination." [...] In court, Garrido testified that he masturbated in his car by the side of elementary and high schools while watching girls. He was convicted on March 9, 1977 and began serving a 50-year federal sentence on June 30, 1977, at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas.|$|E
2500|$|Another time, Manley was {{photographing the}} Roman Forum. [...] Manley noticed an {{apartment}} building nearby, selected a second-story window from which {{he could get a}} good photograph and went into the building. [...] <b>He</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door of an apartment and a woman who spoke only Italian opened it, saw his camera and started to close the door. Manley stuck his foot in the doorway and pushed a handful of cash through the opening. [...] Despite language difficulties, an agreement was reached and Manley remained at the window of the apartment {{for more than an hour}} until the light was right.|$|E

When there he {{attempts}} to make a donation to [...] "save the dolphins" [...] but is met with mockery from the [...] "Ecological Man" [...] (played by David Dixon, Ford Prefect from the television series. There is a brief allusion to the TV series as Arthur asks if they've met before). The next door <b>he</b> <b>knocks</b> <b>on</b> is Fenchurch's. She is surprised that he didn't call first, shows him his misplaced copy of the Guide, and notes {{that they need to}} talk.|$|R

Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, Geico's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence, and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an [...] "extraordinary man" [...] after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street; however, both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Patrolman Merle Colver {{arrived at}} the hotel. He had been {{assigned}} to check Wichita hotels for suspicious guests and went to their room to question them. When <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door, Wilbur Underhill shot him 3 times in the head killing him instantly Fleeing on foot, Underhill became involved in a running gunfight with police. A 2-year-old boy was killed in the crossfire when police fired at Underhill. He was eventually stopped by a lucky shot to the neck. Wilbur Underhill was convicted with murder, earning him another life sentence, and was imprisoned in Lansing state prison on September 4, 1931. Frank Underhill was not charged and, apparently [...] "scared straight" [...] from his experience, never committed another criminal offense {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|Seven cruiser tanks {{from the}} 2nd RTR arrived {{north of the}} hussars and {{destroyed}} the anti-aircraft battery from Benina airfield {{by the light of}} burning vehicles. As dark fell the attacks were stopped despite the Italian disarray, because the 4th Armoured Brigade had been reduced to syphoning the petrol from artillery vehicles and looting Italian supplies to keep going. A better organised and supported Italian breakthrough attempt had to be anticipated for the morning and the tanks disengaged and moved about [...] east of the road to refuel and rearm. Italian vehicle movements around Ghemines and air reconnaissance reports showed that the Italians had achieved a measure of co-ordination and that reinforcements were arriving from the north. Two tanks were seen in the gloom but the crews surrendered to a British soldier, when <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> their hatches. Further south, a Rifle Brigade patrol escorting two RHA anti-tank guns moved along the column, firing from different points to give the impression of a larger force and to keep the Italians pinned down, as Combeforce dug in deeper and sowed more mines.|$|E

2500|$|After his father's death, {{he started}} {{thinking}} seriously about the priesthood. In October 1942, while the war continued, <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> {{the door of}} the Bishop's Palace in Kraków and asked to study for the priesthood. Soon after, he began courses in the clandestine underground seminary run by the Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Cardinal Sapieha. On 29 February 1944, Wojtyła was hit by a German truck. German Wehrmacht officers tended to him and sent him to a hospital. He spent two weeks there recovering from a severe concussion and a shoulder injury. It seemed to him that this accident and his survival was a confirmation of his vocation. On 6 August 1944, a day known as [...] "Black Sunday", the Gestapo rounded up young men in Kraków to curtail the uprising there, [...] similar to the recent uprising in Warsaw. Wojtyła escaped by hiding in the basement of his uncle's house at 10 Tyniecka Street, while the German troops searched above. More than eight thousand men and boys were taken that day, while Wojtyła escaped to the Archbishop's Palace, where he remained until after the Germans had left.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Bader made himself a thorn {{in the side of}} the Germans. He often practised what the RAF {{personnel}} called [...] "goon-baiting". He considered it his duty to cause as much trouble to the enemy as possible, much of which included escape attempts. He made so many escape attempts that the Germans threatened to take away his legs. In August 1942, Bader escaped with Johnny Palmer and three others from the camp at Stalag Luft III B in Sagan. Unluckily, a Luftwaffe officer of Jagdgeschwader 26 was in the area. Keen to meet the Tangmere wing leader, he dropped by to see Bader, but when <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> his door, there was no answer. Soon the alarm was raised, and a few days later, Bader was recaptured. During the escape attempt, the Germans produced a poster of Bader and Palmer asking for information. It described Bader's disability and said he [...] "walks well with stick". Twenty years later, Bader was sent a copy of it by a Belgian civilian prisoner, who had worked in a Gestapo office in Leipzig. Bader found this amusing, as he had never used a stick. He was finally dispatched to the [...] "escape-proof" [...] Colditz Castle Oflag IV-C on 18 August 1942, where he remained until 15 April 1945 when it was liberated by the First United States Army.|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll try {{the nearest}} place," [...] said Gif, and, {{going up to}} it, <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> sharply <b>on</b> the door. He waited for fully a minute, {{but there was no}} reply.|$|R

60|$|The lower {{stories were}} used as a {{warehouse}} {{and he came to}} the top landing before he saw a name that seemed to be Danish or Scandinavian painted on a door. Going in, <b>he</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the counter.
