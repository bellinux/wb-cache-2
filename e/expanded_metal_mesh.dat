Previous results have demonstrated the useful application of this design in coupling beams of medium span-to-depth ratios (l/h) under both inelastic seismic and elastic wind loading. This paper presents further experimental studies on five PRC coupling beams, which investigated the importance of shear connectors on plate/reinforced concrete composite action. Three medium-length (l/h= 2. 5) and two short (l/h= 1. 17) PRC coupling beams, each containing a vertically embedded steel plate, were tested under reversed cyclic loading. While one short beam was welded with <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> on the plate surfaces, others were welded with shear studs on the plates in the wall regions and/or the beam spans. Results showed that the <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> did not work effectively, and while the shear studs in the beam span only slightly increased the beam capacity, those in the wall regions contributed considerably in improving inelastic beam performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, computational simulations are used to correlate the drag coefficient of a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> {{in terms of its}} porosity and the Reynolds number for 10 ≤ Re ≤ 1000. A benchmarking exercise suggests that the computational simulations may be in error by up to 13 % error for the level of discretization that could be achieved due to computer memory limitations.

However, {{it is difficult to}} make <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surfaces with sufficient radio-frequency (RF) performance for frequencies higher than millimeter waves. In this paper, we present the RF performance of <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surfaces at 43 GHz. For this purpose, we developed an apparatus to measure the reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient, and radiative coefficient of the mesh surface. The reflection coefficient increases as a function of <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surface tension, whereas the radiative coefficient decreases. The anisotropic aspects of the reflection coefficient and the radiative coefficient are also clearly seen. They depend on the front and back sides of the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surface and the rotation angle. The transmission coefficient was measured to be almost constant. The measured radiative coefficients and transmission coefficients would cause significant degradation of the system noise temperature. In addition, we carried out an astronomical observation of a well-known SiO maser source, R Cas, by using a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> mirror on the NRO 45 -m radio telescope Coude system. The <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> mirror considerably increases the system noise temperature and slightly decreases the peak antenna temperature. These results are consistent with laboratory measurements.

5000|$|Lime plaster was {{a common}} {{building}} material for wall surfaces in {{a process known as}} lath and plaster, whereby a series of wooden strips on a studwork frame was covered with a semi-dry plaster that hardened into a surface. The plaster used in most lath and plaster construction was mainly lime plaster, with a cure time of about a month. To stabilize the lime plaster during curing, small amounts of plaster of Paris were incorporated into the mix. Because plaster of Paris sets quickly, [...] "retardants" [...] were used to slow setting time enough to allow workers to mix large working quantities of lime putty plaster. A modern form of this method uses <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> over wood or metal structures, which allows a great freedom of design as it is adaptable to both simple and compound curves. Today this building method has been partly replaced with drywall, also composed mostly of gypsum plaster.

40|$|Bridges with {{orthotropic}} steel decks {{have been}} built across the world over the past 60 years because they provide high strength and stiffness at a relatively low cost. However, {{a number of these}} bridges have sustained fatigue fractures. The investigation described in this thesis was carried out in order to identify cost-effective fatigue crack mitigation techniques by using the deck surfacing to reduce the stresses in the steel deck. Epoxy asphalt with an <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> was investigated with small- and large-scale laboratory tests. Finite element analyses were also performed. The small scale tests conducted at different temperatures and loading frequencies showed that asphalt stiffness increased with decreasing temperature and faster loading. The <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> in the epoxy asphalt layer noticeably increased asphalt stiffness. In the large scale tests and finite element analyses, critical loading positions to cause stress concentrations at the fatigue prone rib-to-deck welded connections were determined with different tyre configurations. The stress reduction due to the deck surfacing was estimated for the critical loading positions. The full scale test specimen was subjected to actual truck tyres. With the effectiveness of mitigation techniques for fatigue cracks on orthotropic steel bridge decks known, a probability-based fatigue lifetime evaluation methodology using Monte Carlo simulation was developed. The deck surfacing effects with seasonal and hourly temperature variations were considered. The fatigue lifetime extension using the epoxy asphalt was quantified. For a particular bridge, cost-effective maintenance scenarios were investigated. A simple calculation method for fatigue lifetime was introduced for engineers or bridge owners to assist understanding of decision support tool concepts...|$|E

This seal design is a combination of the pocket damper seal and a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> element. The <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> element not only reduces the leakage but it also provides damping. Early in its development, the tested <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> hybrid pocket damper seal induced a gripping force on the shaft that increased with upstream pressure. The resulting friction torque was beyond acceptable limits. The target after that was to develop an experimentally verified design of a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> hybrid seal that has low leakage and positive damping, and to determine rotordynamic effects and leakage. The hybrid seal design was revised to eliminate the gripping effect. The inner diameter of the retaining ring was increased and holes were provided at the periphery of the ring. With this revised design, tests were carried out on the non-rotating rig. Results showed a considerable decrease in stiffness of the seal. This indicated that the stiffness of the seal is dependent on the press fit interference of the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> doughnut. Tests were carried out on the rotating rig using a grooved journal, which allowed a low press fit interference. <b>Metal</b> <b>mesh</b> was placed at the exit blade in these experiments. The results showed negative damping and positive stiffness. Results also showed appearance of instability at 58 Psig, which increased with increase of pressure. Next, the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> was moved to the inlet blade. This modification required design and fabrication of a complete new seal. The experiments were repeated on the rotating rig. This time positive damping and positive stiffness was achieved with no sign of instability. The pocket depth of the hybrid seal was decreased to achieve more damping as predicted by the pocket damper seal code. However experimental results did not show any improvement in damping from this modification. Finally, the Bode plots from rotating tests were curve fitted using XLTRC to obtain damping, stiffness and force coefficients...|$|R

This material has been tested in the Turbomachinery Laboratory at Texas A&M University (TAMU) as a bearing damper in a rotordynamic test rig. The test facility was originally used to support the design of a turboprop engine at TAMU, developing squirrel cage bearing supports and squeeze film dampers for both the gas generator and power turbine rotors. To design the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> damper, static stiffness and dynamic rap test measurements were first made on <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> samples in a specially designed non-rotating test fixture. These property tests were performed on samples of various densities and press fits. One sample was also tested in an Instron machine as an ancillary and redundant way to determine the stiffness. Using the stiffness test results and equations derived by a previous investigator, a spreadsheet program was written and used to size <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> donuts that have the radial stiffness value required to replace the squirrel cage in the power turbine. The squirrel cage and squeeze-film bearing damper developed for the power turbine rotor was then replaced by a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> donut sized by the computer code. Coast-down tests were conducted through the first critical speed of the power turbine. The results of the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> tests were compared with those obtained from previous testing with the squeeze film damper. The results show that the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> damper has the same damping as the squeeze film at room temperature but does not lose its damping at elevated temperatures up to 210 F?. Experiments were run under several different conditions including balanced rotor hot oil soaked, unbalanced rotor hot oil soaked, balanced dry, and unbalanced dry. Over all, <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers appear to be a viable and attractive substitute for squeeze film dampers in gas turbine engines. The advantages shown to date include less variation of damping with temperature, ability to handle large rotor unbalance, and the ability (if required) to operate effectively in an oil free environment...|$|R
