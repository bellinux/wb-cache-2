25|$|A new {{option for}} all senior Oldsmobiles (88, Ninety-Eight {{and the new}} front-drive Toronado) was GM's {{automatic}} Comfortron Air Conditioning system first introduced by Cadillac in 1964. Comfortron permitted the driver to automatically set a year-round temperature at a constant level. The basic Frigidaire air conditioning unit offered in previous years continued as before and becoming an increasingly popular option on full-sized Oldsmobiles. Another new option for 1966 was a Tilt-and-Telescopic steering wheel that could be vertically adjusted to six different positions as well as telescoped outward from the instrument panel to improve <b>driver</b> <b>comfort.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{deliberate}} attempt to introduce [...] "modern car lines", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both {{to improve the}} resilience {{of the car and}} to allow full-height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures. Further strength was obtained by separating the bonnet from the front grill, allowing the grill frame to add rigidity {{to the front of the}} car. Track and overall width of the car were the same as the Mark D, but the wheelbase was extended by [...] Though not appreciated at the time, this fundamentally affected the car's stability and made it liable to overturn. Weather protection was more sophisticated, the hood now including a front section that could be rolled back as a sunroof while the detachable side screens incorporate sliding windows. The seat was still a single bench, but the backrest was now split, one third allowing for adjustment to suit <b>driver</b> <b>comfort,</b> whilst the remainder hinged forward to allow access to the boot. Lighting was improved with larger headlamps, flashing indicators and rear number plate light. The fuel tank was increased in size to , but the car retained the Villiers 9E/3 engine with three-speed gearbox. Deliveries of the new car were expected to begin in May 1957.|$|E

40|$|Ergonomic {{design of}} {{automotive}} seat {{is a very}} challenging task whose results may directly influence <b>driver’s</b> <b>comfort</b> and safety. Seat comfort can be improved by identifying car-packaging solutions that allow an optimal driver’s posture. In {{order to reduce the}} time and cost for testing, ergonomic analysis is car- ried out in virtual reality (VR) environment with digital human models (DHM) {{that can be used to}} simulate the anthropometric variability of a target population of users and thus verify the robustness of design solutions with respect to the an- thropometrical noise factor. In this paper we illustrate a case study concerning the comfort improvement of a minicar packaging set up via robust ergonomic design (RED) with digital human models. The aim is the identification of the optimum levels for the seat control parameters that minimize the <b>driver’s</b> <b>comfort</b> loss with respect to a preferred posture. The approach adopted for the analysis of data ob- tained from the virtual experiments is based on the joint generalized linear model- ing of mean and dispersion of the <b>driver’s</b> postural <b>comfort</b> loss (i. e. the ergonom- ic response of interest) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Semi-active {{cabin air}} {{suspension}} system improves <b>driver's</b> <b>comfort</b> by controlling the damping characteristics {{in accordance with}} driving situation. For the <b>driver's</b> <b>comfort</b> evaluation, test procedure has the two methodologies which are filed test and lab test. A field test method has a drawback. It {{requires a lot of}} time and money on repetitive test, due to the sensitivity of field test. On the other hand, the test with six axes simulation table at laboratory can obtain the repeatability of test, better than the field test method. In this paper, the procedures of ride performance test and control logic tuning with the table are presented. Drive files of the table can be represented with the almost same input condition as field test data. According to the result from the comparative test using six axes simulation table between passive and semi-active system by making ECU logic tuning, the RMS acceleration of semi-active cabin air suspension system was reduced by 29. 6 % compared with passive system.

50|$|Originally {{built by}} Berliet, the truck became the top-of-the-line {{offering}} in Renault's new heavy commercial vehicle line. Sold as the R-series, it offered {{a range of}} engines in models from the original R310 up to the V8-engined R420. Most models were inline-sixes. The R-series overlapped the more compact, more utilitarian G-series, and was meant for longer distance journeys where <b>driver</b> <b>comfort</b> is of more importance.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to present recent {{knowledge}} about the assessment and evaluation of low frequency noise and infrasound close to the threshold of hearing and the potential effects on human health. Low frequency noise generated by air flowing over a moving car with the open window is chosen as a source of noise. The noise within the interior of the car and its effects on a <b>driver’s</b> <b>comfort</b> at different velocities is analyzed. An open window at high velocity behaves as a source of specifically strong tonal low frequency noise which is annoying. The interior noise of a passenger car was measured under different conditions; while driving on normal highway and roadways. First, an octave-band analysis was used to assess the noise level and its impact on the <b>driver’s</b> <b>comfort.</b> Second, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis was used for the detection of tonal low frequency noise. Finally, the paper suggests possibilities for scientifically assessing and evaluating low frequency noise but not only for the presented source of the sound...|$|R
25|$|No {{suitable}} engines {{were available}} to give a sufficient advantage over the British Napier Lion, so the simplest possible chassis was constructed and three war-surplus Liberty aero engines were squeezed into it. The vehicle was simple, with no clutch or gearbox and only a single fixed ratio. Once running by a push start, it had to keep rolling. <b>Driver</b> <b>comforts</b> were minimal: the forward engine was sheathed in a crude attempt at streamlining, the two side-by-side behind it were bare, with the driver perched {{between them and the}} one in front.|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} number of traffic {{accidents}} and to increase the <b>drivers</b> <b>comfort,</b> the thought of designing driver assistance systems arose in the past years. Fully or partly autonomously guided vehicles, particularly for road traffic, pose high demands on the development of reliable algorithms. Principal problems are caused by having a moving observer in predominantly natural environments.

5000|$|Group 7 {{cars were}} defined as [...] "two-seater {{competition}} vehicles built exclusively for speed races on closed circuit". There was no minimum production requirement necessary to earn homologation. As such, the regulations allowed manufacturers and teams freedom to create unique racing cars with no limitations on engines, tires, aerodynamics, or dimensions, such that the car had room for two seats and was enclosed in bodywork. Races for Group 7 cars were generally short sprints, with few accommodations made for <b>driver</b> <b>comfort.</b>|$|E
