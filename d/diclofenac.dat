5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug <b>diclofenac.</b> Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian vulture {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{in most parts}} of its range. In Europe and most of the Middle East, populations in 2001 were half of those from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% decrease each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked {{with the use of the}} NSAID <b>Diclofenac,</b> which has been known to cause death in Gyps vultures.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent <b>diclofenac,</b> {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} {{including}} treepies, bulbuls, babblers, mynahs and crows were noted. In 2010, {{the first ever}} bird survey was conducted in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded in the survey. In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were sighted and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults. Last sighted in {{the region in the}} 1970s, the rediscovery of the vulture, a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant. <b>Diclofenac,</b> which caused the decline of vulture population was banned in 2006 and since then, vulture numbers have started to grow back.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> is also {{available}} over-the-counter in some countries: 12.5mg <b>diclofenac</b> as potassium salt in Switzerland (Voltaren dolo), the Netherlands (Voltaren K), and preparations containing 25mg <b>diclofenac</b> as the potassium salt in Germany (various trade names), New Zealand, Australia, Japan, (Voltaren Rapid), and Sweden (Voltaren T and <b>Diclofenac</b> T). <b>Diclofenac</b> as potassium salt can be found throughout the Middle East in 25-mg and 50-mg doses (Cataflam).|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> {{consumption}} {{has been}} associated with significantly increased vascular and coronary risk in a study including coxib, <b>diclofenac,</b> ibuprofen and naproxen. Upper gastrointestinal complications were also reported. Major vascular events were increased by about a third by <b>diclofenac,</b> chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to <b>diclofenac</b> for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death was increased significantly by <b>diclofenac.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> {{is often}} used to treat chronic pain {{associated}} with cancer, in particular if inflammation is also present (Step I of the World Health Organization (WHO) scheme for treatment of chronic pain). <b>Diclofenac</b> can be combined with opioids if needed such as a fixed combination of <b>diclofenac</b> and codeine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> {{is similar}} in COX-2 {{selectivity}} to celecoxib. A review by FDA Medical Officer David Graham concluded <b>diclofenac</b> does {{increase the risk of}} myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|Use of <b>diclofenac</b> {{in animals}} has been {{reported}} to have led to a sharp decline in the vulture population in the Indian subcontinent – a 95% decline by 2003 and a 99.9% decline by 2008. The mechanism is presumed to be renal failure, however toxicity may be due to direct inhibition of uric acid secretion in vultures. Vultures eat the carcasses of livestock that have been administered veterinary <b>diclofenac,</b> and are poisoned by the accumulated chemical, as vultures do not have a particular enzyme to break down <b>diclofenac.</b> At a meeting of the National Wildlife Board in March 2005, the Government of India announced it intended to phase out the veterinary use of <b>diclofenac.</b> Meloxicam is a safer candidate to replace use of <b>diclofenac.</b> It is more expensive than <b>diclofenac,</b> but the price is coming down as more drug companies begin to manufacture it.|$|E
25|$|Physicians should measure transaminases {{periodically}} {{in patients}} receiving long-term therapy with <b>diclofenac.</b> Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 week after initiating treatment with <b>diclofenac.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> {{formulations}} {{are available}} worldwide under many different trade names.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> is used {{to treat}} pain, {{inflammatory}} disorders, and dysmenorrhea.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, a study {{funded by}} core {{grants from the}} UK Medical Research Council and the British Heart Foundations, and {{collaboration}} coordinated by the Clinical Trial Service Unit & Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU) at the University of Oxford, UK; major vascular events were increased by about a third by <b>diclofenac</b> (rate ratio 1·41,95% CI 1·12–1·78; p=0·0036), chiefly due {{to an increase in}} major coronary events (1·70, 1·19–2·41; p=0·0032). Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to <b>diclofenac</b> for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death was increased significantly by <b>diclofenac</b> (1·65, 0·95–2·85, p=0·0187).|$|E
25|$|Inhibition of COX also {{decreases}} prostaglandins in the epithelium of the stomach, {{making it}} more sensitive to corrosion by gastric acid. This is also the main side effect of <b>diclofenac.</b> <b>Diclofenac</b> has a low to moderate preference to block the COX2-isoenzyme (approximately 10-fold) and is said to have, therefore, a somewhat lower incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than noted with indomethacin and aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Parazone-DP is {{combination}} of <b>diclofenac</b> potassium and paracetamol, manufactured and supplied by Ozone Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals, Gujarat, India.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} NSAIDs {{available}} for topical use, including <b>diclofenac.</b> A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence {{is available only}} for use of topical <b>diclofenac</b> and ketoprofen in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. Transdermal opioid pain medications are not typically recommended {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis. The use of topical capsaicin to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit while others did not.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> is also {{available}} in topical forms and {{has been found to}} be useful for osteoarthritis but not other types of long-term musculoskeletal pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} is symptomatic and largely {{the same as}} with <b>diclofenac.</b> However, the possibility of severe GI tract symptoms should be particularly noted.|$|E
25|$|Solaraze (3% <b>diclofenac</b> sodium gel) is topically applied, {{twice a day}} {{for three}} months, to manage the skin {{condition}} known as actinic or solar keratosis.|$|E
25|$|Pennsaid is a {{minimally}} systemic prescription topical lotion {{formulation of}} 1.5% w/w <b>diclofenac</b> sodium, which is approved in the US, Canada {{and other countries}} for osteoarthritis of the knee.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{evaluation}} {{from the}} European Medicines Agency (EMA) {{concluded that the}} overall benefit/risk profile of nimesulide is favourable and in line {{with that of the}} other NSAIDs such as <b>diclofenac,</b> ibuprofen, and naproxen.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, eye drops {{are sold}} to treat acute and chronic nonbacterial {{inflammation}} of the anterior part of the eyes (e.g., postoperative states). <b>Diclofenac</b> eye drops have also been used to manage pain for traumatic corneal abrasion.|$|E
25|$|As of December 2009, Endo, Novartis, and the US FDA {{notified}} {{healthcare professionals}} to add new {{warnings and precautions}} {{about the potential for}} elevation in liver function tests during treatment with all products containing <b>diclofenac</b> sodium.|$|E
25|$|Flector Patch, a {{minimally}} systemic topical patch {{formulation of}} <b>diclofenac,</b> is indicated for acute pain due to minor sprains, strains, and contusions. The patch {{has been approved}} in many other countries outside the US under different brand names.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> is {{available}} in stomach acid-resistant formulations (25 and 50mg), fast-disintegrating oral formulations (25 and 50mg), powder for oral solution (50mg), slow- and controlled-release forms (75, 100 or 150mg), suppositories (50 and 100mg), and injectable forms (50 and 75mg).|$|E
25|$|Studies in Pakistan showed <b>diclofenac</b> caused acute {{kidney failure}} in {{vultures}} when they ate the carcasses of animals that had recently been treated with it. Drug-sensitive species and individual humans are initially assumed to lack genes expressing specific drug detoxification enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{complaints}} {{are most often}} noted. The development of ulceration and/or bleeding requires immediate termination of treatment with <b>diclofenac.</b> Most patients receive a gastro-protective drug as prophylaxis during long-term treatment (misoprostol, ranitidine 150mg at bedtime or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime).|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> (sold under {{a number}} of trade names) is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) taken or applied to reduce inflammation and as an analgesic reducing pain in certain conditions. It is supplied as or contained in medications {{under a variety of}} trade names.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies of}} other coxibs have also shown {{increase}} {{in the risk of}} cardiovascular events, while others have not. For instance, the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib study (APC) showed a dose-related increase in risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure when taking celecoxib compared to placebo; and the Successive Celecoxib Efficacy and Safety Study I (SUCCESS-I) showed increased risk of myocardial infarction when taking 100nbsp&mg twice a day of celecoxib compared to <b>diclofenac</b> and naproxen; but taking 200nbsp&mg twice a day had lower incidence of myocardial infarction compared to <b>diclofenac</b> and naproxen. Nussmeier et al. (2005) showed in a study increase in incidence of cardiovascular events when taking parecoxib and valdecoxib (compared to placebo) after coronary artery bypass surgery.|$|E
25|$|Cases of drug-induced {{hepatotoxicity}} {{have been}} reported in the first month, but can occur at any time during treatment with <b>diclofenac.</b> Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diclofenac</b> {{may also}} be a unique member of the NSAIDs. Some {{evidence}} indicates it inhibits the lipoxygenase pathways, thus reducing formation of the leukotrienes (also pro-inflammatory autacoids). It also may inhibit phospholipase A2 as part of its mechanism of action. These additional actions may explain its high potency - it is the most potent NSAID on a broad basis.|$|E
25|$|After {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} the COX-2 inhibitors, {{it was discovered that}} most of the drugs in this class increase the risk of cardiovascular events by 40% on average. This led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib, and warnings on others. Etoricoxib seems relatively safe, with the risk of thrombotic events similar to that of non-coxib NSAID <b>diclofenac.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another patient, in whom POIS was {{suspected}} {{to be caused}} by cytokine release, was successfully treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) just prior to and {{for a day or two}} after ejaculation. The patient took <b>diclofenac</b> 75mg 1 to 2 hours prior to sexual activity with orgasm, and continued twice daily for 24 to 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|Since a large {{percentage}} of people with SLE have varying amounts of chronic pain, stronger prescription analgesics (painkillers) may be used if over-the-counter drugs (mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) do not provide effective relief. Potent NSAIDs such as indomethacin and <b>diclofenac</b> are relatively contraindicated for people with SLE because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Liver damage occurs infrequently, and {{is usually}} reversible. Hepatitis may occur rarely without any warning {{symptoms}} and may be fatal. Patients with osteoarthritis more often develop symptomatic liver disease than patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Liver function should be monitored regularly during long-term treatment. If used for the short-term treatment of pain or fever, <b>diclofenac</b> has not been found more hepatotoxic than other NSAIDs.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is also {{commonly}} marketed {{in products}} containing codeine with other pain killers or muscle relaxers, {{as well as}} codeine mixed with phenacetin (Emprazil with codeine No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), naproxen, indomethacin, <b>diclofenac,</b> and others, {{as well as more}} complex mixtures, including such mixtures as aspirin + paracetamol + codeine ± caffeine ± antihistamines and other agents, such as those mentioned above.|$|E
