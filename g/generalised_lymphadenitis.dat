40|$|Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D {{syndrome}} (HIDS) {{is defined}} as recurrent fever, <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenitis,</b> abdominal pain, arthritis and raised polyclonal serum IgD > 100 IU/ml. The cause is a mutation in the mevalonate kinase gene. Other periodic fever syndromes are known. We report a new patient and describe orbital tendonitis as a hitherto unreported symptom CONCLUSION: Without any underlying cause, the tendonitis {{must be seen as}} new symptom of variant hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D syndrome. We speculate that the inflammation of the Tenon spatium is similar to the process of inflammation of the connective tissue in the joint in hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D syndrome where deposits of C 3 and IgM are present. Variant hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D syndrome can be present in one family...|$|E
40|$|From a {{total of}} 32 717 cattle slaughtered, 183 whole carcass condemnations were {{attributable}} to 9 diseases and conditions, namely, tuberculosis (TB), cysticercosis, emaciation, <b>generalised</b> <b>lymphadenitis,</b> jaundice, abscesses, moribund, sarcosporidiosis and odour. Bovine TB {{was the most important}} cause of condemnations (152 / 183, 83. 1 %). Bovine cysticercosis and sarcosporidiosis accounted for 5 / 183 (2. 7 %) and 8 / 183 (4. 4 %), respectively, while each of the remaining conditions contributed less. Among the many conditions responsible for offal / organ condemnations were fascioliasis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, hydatidosis and TB. In terms of number and weight, Fasciola gigantica infections made livers and lungs the most condemned offals (20. 1 % and 0. 7 %, respectively). Hydatidosis was the cause of 0. 9 %lung and 0. 1 %liver losses. Cysticercus bovis contributed to only 0. 05 %of all inspected tongues, hearts, and heads. TB was very rare in heads (0. 01 %). The financial impact of whole carcasses and offals condemned during the study period was enormous and deprived livestock farmers of the much needed revenue and consumers of protein sources. Much or all of the condemned material that could have been useful was wasted by not being retrieved for conversion to processed meat, bone meal or pet food. Failure to detect lesions of potential zoonotic diseases at slaughter poses a health risk to consumers especially when meat is eaten undercooked...|$|E
