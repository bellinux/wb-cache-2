5000|$|Signalling {{protocol}} {{responsible for}} communications between RNCs is called RNSAP (Radio Network Subsystem Application Part) and {{is carried on}} the <b>Iur</b> <b>interface.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This set of {{procedure}} used to handle dedicated channel traffic(it includes DCH,DSCH and TDD USCH) between two RNCs.Unlike the basic mobility procedures {{which is used}} only for signalling,this set {{of procedure}}s provides support for data transfer over the Iur interface.The data transfer takes place using a frame protocol.The procedures belonging to this set include establishment,modification and release of dedicated channel in the DRNC due to hard and soft handover,set-up/release of dedicated transport connections over <b>Iur</b> <b>interface</b> and data transfer for dedicated channels.|$|E
50|$|The logical {{connections}} between the network elements are known as interfaces. The interface between the RNC and the Circuit Switched Core Network (CS-CN) is called Iu-CS and between the RNC and the Packet Switched Core Network is called Iu-PS. Other interfaces include Iub (between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same network). Iu interfaces carry user traffic (such as voice or data) as well as control information (see Protocols), and <b>Iur</b> <b>interface</b> is mainly needed for soft handovers involving 2 RNCs though not required as the absence of Iur will cause these handovers to become hard handovers.|$|E
50|$|For Iub and <b>Iur</b> <b>interfaces,</b> ALCAP is {{specified}} in 3GPP TS 25.426. For Iu interface, ALCAP is {{specified in}} 3GPP TS 25.414.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{interfaces}} connecting the UTRAN internally or externally to other functional entities: Iu, Uu, Iub and Iur. The Iu interface is an external interface {{that connects the}} RNC to the Core Network (CN). The Uu is also external, connecting the Node B with the User Equipment (UE). The Iub is an internal interface connecting the RNC with the Node B. And at last there is the <b>Iur</b> <b>interface</b> which is an internal interface most of the time, but can, exceptionally be an external interface too for some network architectures. The Iur connects two RNCs with each other.|$|E
