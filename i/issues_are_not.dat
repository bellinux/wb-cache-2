Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this.

25|$|However, Sperlich {{notes that}} Chomsky has been vilified by {{corporate}} interests, {{particularly in the}} mainstream press. University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading. Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, {{regardless of whether they}} have been academically trained to do so or not.|$|E
25|$|The {{stories in}} the Buffy comics take place in between episodes of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series, and {{continue}} after the series ended. Issues 1 to 63 take place during the period that the series was still on air, and none are written by Joss Whedon himself. The earlier <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> very easy to place in the series other than the season they are set in. The stories get more specific later on, however; for example, the Oz Buffy comics fill in the story line of Oz's character after he leaves the TV series, and the Death of Buffy comics clearly take place between Seasons 5 and 6 of the series.|$|E

25|$|As one of {{the largest}} growing {{concerns}} American adults have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in the debate surrounding privacy online. A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> the only prevalent concerns our society has. Though some may call it a modern-day version of McCarthyism, another prevalent issue also remains members of our own society sending disconcerting emails to one another. It is for this reason in 2001 that for {{one of the}} first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.|$|E
25|$|These {{issues have}} been tied to {{grammatical}} processing performance by testing native speakers of English on the same tasks under stressful conditions: there is shown to be difficulty in grammatical agreement when memory capacity is curtailed, important cues in the language when given noisy input, and processing important structures when not given enough time to process input. This shows that knowledge cannot always be automatically and consistently applied under stressful situations without having processing difficulties. However, these <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> necessarily independent of each other, as low decoding ability of structure could affect processing speed. Overall, individual differences in L2 working memory and decoding ability are correlated to grammaticality judgment accuracy and latencies. However, there is no correlation between speed of processing measure and grammaticality judgment performance, age of arrival correlates with syntactic mastery, and knowledge of vocabulary probably drives grammaticality performance.|$|E

500|$|In September 2015, Image's {{solicitations}} for upcoming comics {{revealed that}} The Fade Out would end with issue twelve, which {{was released on}} January 6, 2016. Like the first issue, it had twice as many pages as a standard comic book. It sold an estimated 16,500 copies and was the 136th-best selling issue of the month. Brubaker has said that The Fade Out was, at the time, his most complex story and that it ended [...] "exactly the way [...] pictured it in the beginning". The creators had already begun work on their next collaboration, Kill or Be Killed, before the final issue of The Fade Out had been published. The series was collected into three trade paperback volumes during publication and one oversized hardcover in October 2016. The articles and essays found in the single <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> included in the collections.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} intense debates within the Indian women's {{movements}} {{about the relationship}} between Western and Indian feminisms. [...] Many Indian feminists simultaneously claim a specific [...] "Indian" [...] sensitivity as well as an international feminist solidarity with groups and individuals worldwide. The rise of liberal feminism in the West in the 1970s focused deeply on demands for equal opportunities in education and employment, as well as ending violence against women. [...] To a large extent, the emerging feminist movement in India was influenced by Western ideals. These called for education and equal rights, but also adapted their appeals to local issues and concerns, such as dowry-related violence against women, Sati, sex selective abortion and custodial rape. [...] Some Indian feminists have suggested that these <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> specifically [...] "Indian" [...] in nature but rather a reflection of a wider trend of patriarchal oppression of women.|$|E
500|$|Overmars {{was subject}} to {{transfer}} speculation in early 2002 because of his limited role in the first team, but he revealed {{he was happy to}} stay at Barcelona: [...] "My priority now is that the team wins. Personal <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> important. I'm here for whatever you need me." [...] In the Champions League, he started in the semi-final first leg against Real Madrid; the team lost 2–0 and were defeated 3–1 on aggregate. In May 2002, Rexach was dismissed and replaced by Louis van Gaal, who was managing the club for a second time. Overmars was wary of the appointment beforehand, saying, [...] "Van Gaal is a good manager, but I do not know if his return would be good for Barcelona." [...] He underwent surgery on his right knee {{at the end of the}} season and was out of action for six months.|$|E
