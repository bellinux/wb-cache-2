50|$|<b>Dimethylphosphite</b> is an organophosphorus {{compound}} with the formula (CH3O)2P(O)H. It is a reagent for generating other {{organophosphorus compound}}s, exploiting the high reactivity of the P-H bond. The molecule is tetrahedral. It is a colorless liquid.

50|$|In {{chemistry}} a phosphite ester or organophosphite usually {{refers to}} an organophosphorous compound with the formula P(OR)3. They {{can be considered as}} esters of an unobserved tautomer phosphorous acid, H3PO3, with the simplest example being trimethylphosphite, P(OCH3)3. Some phosphites can be considered esters of the dominant tautomer of phosphorous acid (HP(O)(OH)2). The simplest representative is <b>dimethylphosphite</b> with the formula HP(O)(OCH3)2. Both classes of phosphites are usually colorless liquids.|$|E
40|$|A {{convenient}} and efficient one-pot reaction has been employed for {{the synthesis of}} new -aminophosphonates 4 a- 4 k via Kabachnik-Fields reaction in 65 - 82 % yields. In the procedure developed, equimolar quantities of 2 -amino- 4 -methylphenol 1, various aromatic aldehydes 2 a- 2 k and <b>dimethylphosphite</b> 3 in dry toluene were reacted under reflux for 4 - 6 h. The products were characterized by IR, 1 H, 13 C and 31 P NMR spectra and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium) and antifungal activity (Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger). 4 a showed potent activity with lowest MIC value...|$|E
40|$|Modernization of {{horizontal}} low pressure deposition {{system has been}} performed. The liquid source delivery system using the bubblers has been developed. The PSG and BPSG film deposition processes and film properties using TEOS-Dimethylphosphite-TEB system have been studied. It is shown {{that the use of}} <b>dimethylphosphite</b> allows varying the phosphorus concentration in the wide range. It is found that the optimal range of the total boron and phosphorus concentration ensuring the acceptable topology planarity and resistance to defect formation during storage is 8. 7 ? 0. 3 wt% when the phosphorus concentration is 3. 0 — 3. 8 wt%. It is found that at use of the TEOS-DMP-TEB system the depletion of the phosphorus concentration along reaction zone does not occur, and the total dopant concentration is practically constant. At the same time the deposition rate of BPSG films is 9. 0 — 10. 0 nm/min and the good film thickness uniformity are ensured. The as-deposited films have “mirror-like surface” that is proof of minimal surface roughness. The BPSG films with optimal composition are characterized by the reduced reaction capability against atmospheric moisture...|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquid (IL) {{pretreatment}} of lignocellulose {{materials is}} a promising process in biomass conversion to renewable biofuel. More in-depth research involving environment-friendly IL is much needed to explore pretreatment green route. In our case, IL 1 -methyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>dimethylphosphite</b> ([Mmim]DMP) {{was chosen as}} an environment-friendly solvent to pretreat corn cob in view of its biocompatibility with both lignocellulose solubility and cellulase activity. The pretreatment/saccharification process and in situ saccharification process involving [Mmim]DMP were efficiently performed in bioconversion of corn cob to sugars, and more than 70 % saccharification rates were obtained. Furthermore, the fermentability of reducing sugars obtained from the hydrolyzates was evaluated using   Rhodococcus opacus   strain ACCC 41043 (R.   opacus). High lipid production 41 – 43 % of cell dry matter was obtained after 30  h of cultivation. GC/MS analysis indicated that lipids from   R.   opacus   contained mainly long-chain fatty acids with four major constituent/oleic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid which are good candidates for biodiesel. These elucidated that corn cob pretreated by IL [Mmim]DMP did not bring negative effects on saccharification, cell growth, and accumulation of lipid of   R.   opacus. In conclusion, the IL [Mmim]DMP shows promise as green pretreatment solvent for cellulosic materials. </span...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis of {{compounds}} {{based on the}} structurally rigid bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane and the dibenzobicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane frameworks and also their application as ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis are described. For the synthesis of 1, 3 -diols based on the bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane framework, an improved synthesis of the starting material bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octan- 2, 6 -dione was developed and performed at 0. 5 kg scale, {{as well as an}} effective synthetic route to the target diols. A genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was used for the preparation of key intermediates for the synthesis of 1, 4 -diols based on the bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane framework. The 1, 3 - and 1, 4 -diols, together with Ti(OiPr) 4, were tested as catalysts in the asymmetric reduction of acetophenone with catecholborane and in the asymmetric addition of <b>dimethylphosphite</b> to aldehydes. Several chiral cleft molecules (diols, amino alcohols and diamines) based on the dibenzobicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane framework were synthesized and applied as organocatalysts in an asymmetric hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. A primary diamine based on the dibenzobicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane framework was used as the rigid central part for the synthesis of two chiral selectors with different length of their achiral spacers. These selectors were used for the preparation of two new chiral stationary phases, which were evaluated by chromatography (HPLC) ...|$|E
40|$|A one-pot {{reaction}} between di-n-butyl/diethyl/dimethyltin dichloride and <b>dimethylphosphite</b> (MeO) 2 P(O) H in a solvent free medium (120 °C, 18 h) proceeds smoothly to yield the corresponding diorganotinbis(O-methylphosphite) s, [R 2 Sn(OP(O) (OMe) H) 2]n [R = n-Bu (1), Et (2), Me (3) ]. The identity of 1 – 3 {{has been established}} by IR, multinuclear (1 H, 13 C, 31 P, 119 Sn) NMR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray crystallography. The coordination framework in each case adopts a one-dimensional structural motif comprising an infinite array of eight-membered [Sn–O–P–O] 2 cyclic rings, with the phosphite ligands acting in a bridging bidentate mode. The structures are extended to two- (for 1) and three-dimensional (for 2, 3) assemblies by virtue of C–H***O hydrogen bonding interactions. The stability and bulk properties of 1 – 3 have been investigated upon exposure to humid laboratory conditions using 1 H NMR, PXRD and SEM studies. The results conform to a unique chemical modification of 1 – 3 involving selective de-esterification of P–OMe bonds {{and the formation of}} corresponding diorganotinbis(phosphite) s, [R 2 Sn(OP(O) (OH) H) 2]n(1 a– 3 a), as insoluble solids. The results obtained from impedance studies (σ = 10 − 4 – 10 − 6 S cm− 1; Ea = 0. 33 – 0. 42 eV) reveal potential application of 1 a– 3 a as proton conducting materials...|$|E
40|$|Tin {{and lead}} are metals of {{considerable}} commercial importance {{and are used}} in many forms in the environment. Heat and light stabilization of polyvinylchloride polymer by organotins is now a principle application of that metal. The spectroscopic properties and crystal structures are determined for some estertin precursors of these stabilizers: mono and bis-(beta-carbomethoxyethyl) tin chlorides, {{as well as the}} bis-(beta-carbomethoxyethyl) tin dichloride analogue. The feasibility of using Mössbauer spectroscopy to determine the fate of the organotin species within the PVC is also assessed. The INDOR technique is used to obtain tin- 119 n. m. r. data for a series of trimethyl and dimethyltin(IV) compounds and the results interpreted in a manner illustrating the use of this method as a structural probe for the solution chemistry of organotin systems. In the case of lead, attention is given to the effects of use of that metal in petrol by examining its overall distribution pattern in the dust, soil, grasses, plants and fruit of a roadside environment. Additionally a new aetiology of lead poisoning involving some traditional Asian medicines and cosmetics is also described and a route for gastrointestinal absorption of lead sulphide from this source proposed. The effect of particle size on uptake rate is established. A chemical model for interaction between body-phosphate systems and lead derived from such sources as those studied is designed. The reactions found to occur between lead acetate, lead nitrate and <b>dimethylphosphite</b> and trimethylphosphate are interpreted. Preliminary studies show reaction between lead and adenosine di- and triphosphate and the data obtained from the model systems are used to elucidate the reaction pathway with these body-phosphate systems...|$|E
