5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E

This paper describes our experiences in working with Multi-Centre Research <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> on a research proposal designed to assess the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy for men with intellectual disabilities {{who are at risk}} of sexual offending. After submitting to three Multi-Centre Research <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> and spending a year trying to get ethical approval, we questioned whether: •   the issue of study design {{should be part of the}} Multi-Centre Research <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> remit; •   Multi-Centre Research <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> were sufficiently responsive to concerns raised by researchers; •   Multi-Centre Research <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> always understood the research; and •   the Central Office for Research <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> should disallow re-submission after rejection by two Multi-Centre Research <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> (‘two strikes and you’re out') ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEthics committee's are {{committees}} which {{reviews and}} evaluates ethics related situations and events, {{and consists of}} members specialized in the field. Nowadays, <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> hold an important place in ensuring scientists conduct accurate studies and help construct a better future, and ensuring universities are of high quality and efficiency in terms of scientific study. In this regard, analyzing <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> in universities will be both helpful scientifically and also in in giving {{a description of the}} current state of university <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> Consequently, in this study, the number, variety and structure of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> in 108 government and 71 foundation universities across Turkey were examined through their web sites. The result of such examination found that there was no set universal standard in <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> and that there were a huge variety of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> Starting from this point of view, university <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> need to be improved through both quantitative and qualitative research and a standard in regards to the scientific field they provide services to ought to be set...|$|R
5|$|The Senate <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
5|$|The Senate <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{ruled that}} Cranston had acted {{improperly}} by {{interfering with the}} investigation by the FHLBB.

40|$|International audienceAIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the new European paediatric regulatory framework on the activities of <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> operating in Europe and to assess their involvement and interest in paediatric research. METHODS: Task-force in Europe for Drug Development for the Young Network of Excellence and Relating Expectations and Needs to the Participation and Empowerment of Children in Clinical Trials project set up an inventory of <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> existing in Europe and conducted a survey on their approach to paediatric trials. RESULTS: <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> operating in 22 European Countries participated in this survey. Results showed a high lack of knowledge, understanding and awareness of the current European paediatric regulatory framework and a lack of involvement of <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> in paediatric research, especially in terms of training and education, demonstrated also by the decreasing number of <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> answering exhaustively to the whole questionnaire. The majority of participating <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> expressed interest in future initiatives related to paediatric research. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a limited knowledge and understanding of the current paediatric regulatory framework, a significant number of <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> operating in Europe show interest in initiatives related to paediatric research. Networking may be an essential tool to be used to enhance <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> role in supporting paediatric research.

5|$|The Nikkatsu Company {{made three}} popular Sun Tribe films in 1956, a genre {{based on a}} {{contemporary}} youth subculture whose interests revolved around beach life, jazz music and their progressive attitudes towards sex. The films met with moral public outcries and a fourth production was shut down {{at the behest of}} Eirin (The Motion Picture Code of <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee).</b> However, the genre later experienced a resurgence which included The Warped Ones. The film marked director Koreyoshi Kurahara's first collaboration with screenwriter Nobuo Yamada. They reused many elements of Kurahara's earlier Sun Tribe film The Time of Youth (1959), including abortion, a near fatality via an opened gas cock and a criminal act near water, an explosion beside a stream in the former and the rape on the beach in the latter.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: In Croatia, <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> {{are legally}} {{required}} in all healthcare institutions by the Law on the Health Protection. This paper explores {{for the first}} time the structure and function of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> in the healthcare institutions in Croatia. [...] - Design: Cross-sectional survey of the healthcare institutions (excluding pharmacies and homecare institutions) to identify all <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> [...] - Setting: Croatia six years after the implementation of the Law on the Health Protection. [...] - Main measurements: Structure and function of <b>ethic</b> <b>committees</b> in the healthcare institutions. [...] - Results: 46 % of the healthcare institutions in Croatia (excluding pharmacies and homecare institutions) have an ethics committee; 89 % of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> have 5 members 3 of whom are from medical professions and 2 come from other fields; 49 % of those committees stated that their main function is the analysis of research protocols. Only a small fraction of those <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> sent in standing orders, working guidelines or other documents that are connected with their work. [...] - Conclusions: Although there are legal provisions for <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> in the healthcare institutions in Croatia, there is an evidence of discrepancies between the practice and the “Law on the Health Protection,” suggesting the need for revision of the law. There is a need for creating separate networks of HECs and IRBs in Croatia. In comparison with other countries, the development of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> in Croatia has some similarities with other transitional societies in Europe. Additional research should be undertaken in the work of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> in Croatia in order to understand committees’ group dynamics, attitudes, and knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ethics</b> <b>committees</b> {{and their}} system of {{research}} protocol peer-review are currently used worldwide. To ensure an international standard for research ethics and safety, however, data is {{needed on the}} quality and function of each nation's <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the characteristics and developments of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> established at medical schools and general hospitals in Japan. Methods This study consisted of four national surveys sent twice over a period of eight years to two separate samples. The first target was the <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> of all 80 medical schools and the second target was all general hospitals with over 300 beds in Japan (n = 1457 in 1996 and n = 1491 in 2002). Instruments contained four sections: (1) committee structure, (2) frequency of annual meetings, (3) committee function, and (4) existence of a set of guidelines for the refusal of blood transfusion by Jehovah's Witnesses. Results Committee structure was overall interdisciplinary. Frequency of annual meetings increased significantly for both medical school and hospital <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> over the eight years. The primary activities for medical school and hospital <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> were research protocol reviews and policy making. Results also showed a significant increase in the use of ethical guidelines, particularly those related to the refusal of blood transfusion by Jehovah's Witnesses, among both medical school and hospital <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> Conclusion Overall findings indicated a greater recognized degree of responsibilities and an increase in workload for Japanese <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical ethics {{gave birth}} to {{different}} kinds of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> which pursue essentially {{a better understanding of}} the multidisciplinary problems it raises. The present thesis will first elucidate the legal implications related to the emergence of those committees. These preliminary considerations will show the topicality of those legal aspects as to hospital <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> The author will then focus on the potential civil liability of all actors evolving within the hospital setting for the participation of those committees in the medical decision making process. In theory, this participation could arguably entail rather easily the liability of the health care providers and of the hospitals. The <b>ethics</b> <b>committees,</b> on the contrary, seem to be more protected. This thesis suggests nonetheless that the obligations related to the participation of the <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> to the medical decision making process are significant. Hence, it stands to reason that the creation of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> should be evaluated with care. The conviction that the <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> will protect the health care providers from malpractice suits appears to be incorrect in any event...|$|R
