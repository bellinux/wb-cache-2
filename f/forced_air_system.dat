40|$|Background: Maintaining normothermia during porcine {{surgery is}} {{critical}} in ensuring subject welfare and recovery, {{reducing the risk of}} immune system compromise and surgical-site infection that can result from hypothermia. In humans, various methods of patient heating have been demonstrated to be useful, but less evaluation has been performed in techniques to prevent hypothermia perioperatively in pigs. Methods: We compared body temperature regulation during surgery before and after modification of the ambient temperature of the operating laboratories. Three different methods of heating were then compared; a standard circulating water mattress, a resistive fabric blanket, and a forced hot air system. The primary measure was percentage of temperature readings outside a specification range of 36. 7 – 40. 0 °C. Results: Tighter control of the ambient temperature while using a circulating water mattress reduced the occurrence of out-of-specification body temperature readings from 20. 8 % to 5. 0 %, with most of these the result of hypothermia. Use of a resistive fabric blanket further reduced out-of-specification readings to 1. 5 %, with a slight increase in the occurrence of hyperthermia. Use of a <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> reduced out-of-specification readings to less 0. 1 %. Conclusions: Maintenance of normothermia perioperatively in pig can be improved by tightly controlling ambient temperatures. Use of a resistive blanket or a <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> can lead to better control than a circulating water mattress, with the <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> providing a faster response to temperature variations and less chance of hyperthermia...|$|E

The DeltaQ test combines a model of the house and duct system with the results of house pressurization tests with the air handler on and off to determine the duct leakage air flows to outside conditioned space at operating conditions. The key advantage of the DeltaQ test over other methods is that it determines the air leakage flows directly, rather than requiring interpretation of indirect measurements. The results from over 200 field and laboratory tests are presented. The laboratory tests have shown that the DeltaQ repeatability uncertainties are typically 1 % or less of system fan flow and that the accuracy of the test is between 1. 3 % and 2. 5 % of fan flow (or 13 cfm to 25 cfm (6 to 12 l/s) for this system) ...|$|E
40|$|For {{residential}} {{forced air}} {{heating and cooling}} systems conventional thinking is that air supply registers should be located under exterior windows. There were good reasons for this in the past (primarily to counteract the cold downdraught from the window) but new construction standards (well-insulated walls, better glazing and air tight wall/window interface) mean that there is now less downdraught. Positioning the supply air register away from a window could have a large impact for new construction as duct lengths could be shortened (saving materials and construction time). This could also allow greater architectural freedom as the <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> would {{not need to be}} ducted to the building perimeter. This paper presents results from experiments conducted in a new, well-constructed building to evaluate whether the supply registers can be moved away from the traditional location without impacting indoor air quality or predicted thermal comfort. The physical experiments showed that in both traditional and non-traditional placement: (1) there are minimal changes in predicted thermal comfort (a measure of thermal discomfort - vertical air temperature difference much lower than 3 K), and (2) contaminant-removal effectiveness (a measure of indoor air quality) values were in the same range.

40|$|The DeltaQ test is {{a method}} of {{estimating}} the air leakage from forced air duct systems. Developed primarily for residential and small commercial applications it uses the changes in blower door test results due to <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> operation. Previous studies established the principles behind DeltaQ testing, but raised issues of precision of the test, particularly for leaky homes on windy days. Details of the measurement technique are available in an ASTM Standard (ASTM E 1554 - 2007). In order to ease adoption of the test method, this study answers questions regarding the uncertainty due to changing weather during the test (particularly changes in wind speed) and the applicability to low leakage systems. The first question arises because the building envelope air flows and pressures used in the DeltaQ test are influenced by weather induced pressures. Variability in wind induced pressures rather than temperature difference induced pressures dominates this effect because the wind pressures change rapidly over the time period of a test. The second question needs to answered so that DeltaQ testing {{can be used in}} programs requiring or giving credit for tight ducts (e. g., California's Building Energy Code (CEC 2005)). DeltaQ modeling biases have been previously investigated in laboratory studies where there was no weather induced changes in envelope flows and pressures. Laboratory work by Andrews (2002) and Walker et al. (2004) found biases of about 0. 5 % of <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> blower flow and individual test uncertainty of about 2 % of <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> blower flow. The laboratory tests were repeated by Walker and Dickerhoff (2006 and 2008) using a new ramping technique that continuously varied envelope pressures and air flows rather than taking data at pre-selected pressure stations (as used in ASTM E 1554 - 2003 and other previous studies). The biases and individual test uncertainties for ramping were found to be very close (less than 0. 5 % of air handler flow) to those found in for the pressure station approach. Walker and Dickerhoff also included estimates of DeltaQ test repeatability {{based on the results of}} field tests where two houses were tested multiple times. The two houses were quite leaky (20 - 25 Air Changes per Hour at 50 Pa (0. 2 in. water) (ACH 50)) and were located in the San Francisco Bay area. One house was tested on a calm day and the other on a very windy day. Results were also presented for two additional houses that were tested by other researchers in Minneapolis, MN and Madison, WI, that had very tight envelopes (1. 8 and 2. 5 ACH 50). These tight houses had internal duct systems and were tested without operating the central blower [...] sometimes referred to as control tests. The standard deviations between the multiple tests for all four houses were found to be about 1 % of the envelope air flow at 50 Pa (0. 2 in. water) (Q 50) that led to the suggestion of this as a rule of thumb for estimating DeltaQ uncertainty. Because DeltaQ is based on measuring envelope air flows it makes sense for uncertainty to scale with envelope leakage. However, these tests were on a limited data set and one of the objectives of the current study is to increase the number of tested houses. This study focuses on answering two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty associated with changes in weather (primarily wind) conditions during DeltaQ testing? (2) How can these uncertainties be reduced? The first question is addressing issues of repeatability. To study this five houses were tested as many times as possible over a day. Weather data was recorded on-site [...] including the local windspeed. The result from these five houses were combined with the two Bay Area homes from the previous studies. The variability of the tests (represented by the standard deviation) is the repeatability of the test method for that house under the prevailing weather conditions. Because the testing was performed over a day a wide range of wind speeds was achieved following typical diurnal variations of low wind in the early morning and greatest winds in the late afternoon/early evening. Typically about ten tests were performed in each house. To answer the second question, different data analysis techniques were investigated that looked at averaging techniques, elimination of outliers, limiting leak pressures, etc. in order to minimize the influence of changing wind conditions during the test. The objective was to find a reasonable compromise between test precision and robustness [...] because many of the changes to the analysis to make the test more robust limit its ability to examine wide ranges of pressures and leakage flows. A secondary goal of this study is to show that DeltaQ uncertainties are acceptable for testing low leakage systems. Therefore houses with low duct leakage were deliberately chosen to be tested...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{analysis}} methods/tools {{and assessment}} indicators {{appear to be}} essential in the design process, {{in order to improve}} the energy performance of buildings. With respect to HVAC system, which contributes to a major fraction of the building energy use and CO 2 emissions, the second law analysis is an appropriate tool to evaluate its performance. This thesis presents the second law analysis of 20 design alternatives of the HVAC-DHW system of a house located in Montreal. The following design alternatives were considered: (1) heating system: (a) electric or hot water baseboard heaters, (b) <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system,</b> and (c) radiant heating floor; (2) heating equipment: (a) electric or gas-fired boiler, (b) ground-source-heat-pump, and (c) air-to-air heat pump; (3) heat recovery: (a) air-to-air heat exchanger, (b) earth-tube heat exchanger, and (c) boiler economizer. Engineering Equation Solver (EES) program was used to perform the second law analysis for both peak design conditions and annual operating conditions. The results show that the HVAC-DHW system using electric baseboard heater and separate electric air ventilation heater has the lowest exergy efficiencies of 7. 4 % and 4. 1 %, respectively, under the above two conditions, while its energy efficiencies are 64. 2 % and 61. 6 % respectively under the same conditions. The HVAC-DHW system with the highest exergy efficiency of 23. 2 % (at peak design conditions) and 10. 9 % (at annual operating conditions) is composed of: radiant floor heating system; ground source heat pump; air-to-air heat exchanger; earth tube heat exchanger; gas-fired DHW heater...|$|E
40|$|MicroCHP {{involves}} the coproduction of both heat and electric power in (typically) residential heating systems. A range of different energy conversion technologies are currently receiving attention for this application including Stirling engines, internal combustion engines, fuel cells, and Rankine cycles with steam or organic compounds as working fluids. In this work {{the use of}} ThermoPhotoVoltaic (TPV) and ThermoElectric (TE) conversion devices either alone or in combination for power production in an oil-fired heating system have been explored. The focus of this work to date has been on sufficient electric power output to achieve self-powering of the appliance with the consideration that reliability of the heating system during power outages may provide the greatest value to the consumer. Also explored {{is the potential for}} producing larger power output levels, to 1 kW. Low cost, currently available TE devices, based on bismuth telluride, have very low thermal to electric power conversion efficiencies. The use of these in self-powered heating appliances for other applications is established art. Further for simply self-powering, a low conversion efficiency is all that is required to produce the 100 watts needed to power the system. Advanced TE materials under development offer strong potential for increased efficiency in the future. TPV, while currently at an earlier state of development offers the potential for higher conversion efficiencies. This work will report the production of power with both TE and TPV integrated with a residential boiler. A hydronic system was selected relative to a <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> because of the lower electric power requirements. Using a novel pressure atomized oil burner in combination with very low power circulating pumps, the total running power demand has been reduced to 72 watts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the architectual thesis {{is to give the}} student the {{opportunity}} to experience an abstraction of an actual design experience to help develop his or her abilities as an architect. The selection of doing a project such as, the Fine Arts Facility for Indiana - Purdue University, Ft. Wayne, Indiana, enables me to develop a large scale project in an area that interests me. This project also benefits me in a new type of university building. Many Universities are now combining a number of colleges in one facility. Fine arts buildings head a large number of these types of construction. This "supermarket syndrome" of everything under one roof is a common problem of integrating different functions in one building. Indiana - Purdue University, Ft. Wayne is a commuter campus located in a semi-rural area in the northeast section of the city. Need for a convocation space and other classrooms have sparked interest in a new building. The visual arts facility downtown is in bad need of new facilities. The campus would benefit the university with a cultural center as well as the community. The site occupies a section of land near two new constructions on the campus of brick and concrete, the library, and the student union. Other buildings near the site are the physical plant and Neff Hall housing present musical facilities and other classes. An Inlet penetratess the site from the St. Joseph River to the west. The stream there flows to the inlets from underneath the plaza between the library and the student union. Trees mass {{along the banks of the}} inlet and St. Joseph River. The Fine arts facility would contain a theater and auditorium along with classrooms and studios for visual arts, music, and theater. Offices for the faculty also were included as well as all support spaces such as a library, lounges, galleries and so on. Conceptually, the building relates strongly to the plaza which is important as a space because of the activity that would generate there through the relation between Library, Student Union, and the Fine Arts Facility. The Fine arts building also develops close harmony between the front facade and the linear pedestrian circulation path that would be the link to the future campus to the north as it now is to the allow for only minimal construction over it. This bridge also is framed by the plaza and connects the plaza to a central court created by the building. This court developed by the zoning of visual arts studios' to the north and placement of the performing arts to the south. Both areas are connected by the bridge in the middle. The central courtyard unifies the two zones. This space also is a link between the formality of the architecture and the informality of the water and natural setting toward which views are directed. Materials are steel structure with a brick exterior. Metal panel is also used as an exterior element in relation to glass areas. Mechanical systems are aided by hot and cold water from the chiller plant located to the north of campus. Distribution would be from corridors for horizontal passage into the spaces from the mechanical rooms. This would also be a mixture of a radiator and <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> for quietness in music areas. Simplification of design is important at all phases of the development. It is important for the understanding of a concept and an idea. This project could have still been simplified in a number of ways through some development of auditorium - central court relationships. Design of the building became much like designing for two different facilities. Their unification by use of the bridge and the central court developed tough problems. Turning the corner off of the bridge was also difficult. Perhaps a more linear scheme would benefit the project. But, the building does frame well between the library and the student union. I am convinced that a strong heart in the campus could and would exist there. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. Arch. ...|$|E
