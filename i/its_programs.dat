5|$|DuMont {{survived the}} early 1950s {{only because of}} WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone {{commercial}} VHF station {{in what was then}} the sixth-largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Wheeling, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get <b>its</b> <b>programs</b> cleared in other large markets.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in <b>its</b> <b>programs</b> to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis drives a Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{struggled}} to get <b>its</b> <b>programs</b> aired {{in many parts of}} the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by the telephone company AT Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links which were owned by AT The service provider did not have enough cable lines and microwave circuits to provide signal relay service from all four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT allocated times when each network could offer live programs to their affiliates. In 1950, AT allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time network service, but gave ABC only 53 hours, and DuMont just 37. AT also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, but was forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT's actions with the Federal Communications Commission, and eventually received a compromise.|$|E
5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of <b>its</b> <b>programs</b> for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E

5|$|The UK {{had been}} a home for music video pioneers. When the music video cable channel MTV started {{broadcasting}} in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled <b>its</b> <b>programs</b> with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal of a band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable {{to follow up on}} their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.|$|E

5|$|Through intrigue, Thảo {{also helped}} destabilise and {{ultimately}} unseat two South Vietnamese regimes—Diem's {{and the military}} junta of Khánh. As the Diệm regime began to unravel in 1963, Thảo {{was one of the}} officers planning a coup. His plot was ultimately integrated into the successful plot and his activities promoted infighting which weakened the government and distracted the military from fighting the Viet Cong insurgency. Throughout 1964 and 1965, as South Vietnam was struggling to establish a stable state after the ouster of Diệm, Thảo was involved in several intrigues and coup plots which diverted the government from implementing <b>its</b> <b>programs.</b> In 1965, he went into hiding after a failed attempt to seize power from Khánh and was sentenced to death in absentia. Although this coup also failed, the subsequent chaos forced Khánh's junta to collapse. Thảo died the same year he was forced into hiding; it is believed that he was murdered after a bounty was placed on his head. After Vietnam was reunified {{at the end of the}} Vietnam War, the victorious communists claimed Thảo as one of their own and posthumously made him a one-star general.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded <b>its</b> <b>programs</b> by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and <b>its</b> <b>programs</b> was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E
