As there was little information available to explain the difference in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use rates, the main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate why there is a lower rate of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads. A number of perceptions, beliefs and expectancies about <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined to identify variables that discriminated between <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> users and non-users on urban roads. The subjects were 398 undergraduate students (aged 17 - 47) studying at the University of Girona, Spain. On the urban roads reported discomfort from using the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> was higher, while perceptions of risk (for non-users), safety perceptions (for those using a <b>seat</b> <b>belt),</b> beliefs about the seriousness of a crash or the effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> were all lower than on the highway. Perceptions of safety, discomfort, and social influence predicted <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads.

The results of this research suggest that in order to increase <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use on urban roads, the issue of discomfort must be addressed. In addition, prevention campaigns should include information about the effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> in preventing/reducing injuries or deaths on urban roads.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws and public {{education}} campaigns on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for rear seat passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among rear seat passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, was calculated by gender before and after the rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> legislation came into effect. Results Among rear seat passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4. We registered no statistically significant changes over time in the over-reporting factor, nor any major differences between genders. Conclusion Self-reported <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage by rear passengers represents an efficient alternative to observational studies for tracking changes in actual behavior, although the reported figures need to be adjusted using an appropriate over-reporting factor in order to gain an idea of genuine <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} Selective Traffic Enforcement Programs (STEPs) on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and motor vehicle {{accident}} casualties is evaluated. The following research questions are addressed: (a) Will <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after a STEP be above the pre-STEP level? (b) Will repeated STEPs {{be as effective as}} an initial STEP in increasing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use? (c) Does the increase in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use induced by a STEP result in a reduction of accident casualties? A series of six <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use surveys (N = 32, 660) was conducted at the roadside in the Ottawa area where three STEPs were implemented during a 12 -month period, and in a control community. Archival data were used to examine the impact of the STEPs on accident casualties. It was found that <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after an initial STEP was still significantly (p <. 001) above baseline usage, that three subsequent STEPs signif-icantly (p <. 001) increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use from 66 % to 84 %, and that driver casualties declined by 14 % subsequent to the STEPs. Periodic STEPs are effective in affecting long-term increases in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and consequently reducing traffic accident casualties. In Canada, compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use leg-islation has increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> wearing in legislated provinces and hence has resulted in some reduction of occupant casualties (Jonah & Lawson, 1984).

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare trend of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use rate during 4 years, from 2007 to 2010, in Golestan province (northern Iran). Materials and Methods: This was a population-based cross-sectional study that enrolled 3999 subjects aged 15 - 65 years during four years (2007 = 1000 cases, 2008 = 1000 cases, 2009 = 999 cases and 2010 = 1000 cases) using stratified cluster sampling.
