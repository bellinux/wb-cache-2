The whole organisation becomes slightly plastic. Although each modification must have its own exciting cause, and though each is subjected to law, yet we can so rarely trace the precise relation between cause and effect, that we are tempted to speak of variations as if they arose spontaneously. We may even call them accidental, but this must be only in the sense in which we say that a fragment of rock dropped from a height owes its shape to accident.|$|E

6000|$|... 910. I {{have already}} {{expressed}} the view which I take of the decomposition {{in the experimental}} place, as being the direct consequence of the superior exertion at some other spot {{of the same kind}} of power as that to be overcome, and therefore as the result of an antagonism of forces of the same nature (891. 904.). Those at the place of decomposition have a re-action upon, and a power over, the exerting or determining set proportionate to what is needful to overcome their own power; and hence a curious result of resistance offered by decompositions to the original determining force, and consequently to the current. This is well shown in the cases where such bodies as chloride of lead, iodide of lead, and water would not decompose with the current produced by a single pair of zinc and platina plates in sulphuric acid (903.), although they would with a current of higher intensity produced by stronger chemical powers. In such cases no sensible portion of the current passes (967.); the action is stopped; and I am now of opinion {{that in the case of}} the law of conduction which I described in the Fourth Series of these Researches (413.), the bodies which are electrolytes in the fluid state cease to be such in the solid form, because the attractions of the particles by which they are retained in combination and in their relative position, are then too powerful for the electric current[A]. The particles retain their places; and as decomposition is prevented, the transmission of the electricity is prevented also; and although a battery of many plates may be used, yet if it be of that perfect kind which allows of no extraneous or <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> (1000.), the whole of the affinities concerned in the activity of that battery are at the same time also suspended and counteracted.|$|E
6000|$|Impelled {{towards the}} {{hypothesis}} of the transmutation of species, partly by his general cosmological and geological views; partly by the conception of a graduated, though irregularly branching, scale of being, which had arisen out of his profound study of plants and of the lower forms of animal life, Lamarck, whose general line of thought often closely resembles that of De Maillet, made a great advance upon the crude and merely speculative manner in which that writer deals {{with the question of}} the origin of living beings, by endeavouring to find physical causes competent to effect that change of one species into another, which De Maillet had only supposed to occur. And Lamarck conceived that he had found in Nature such causes, amply sufficient for the purpose in view. It is a physiological fact, he says, that organs are increased in size by action, atrophied by inaction; it is another physiological fact that modifications produced are transmissible to offspring. Change the actions of an animal, therefore, and you will change its structure, by increasing the development of the parts newly brought into use and by the diminution of those less used; but by altering the circumstances which surround it you will alter its actions, and hence, in the long run, change of circumstance must produce change of organization. All the species of animals, therefore, are, in Lamarck's view, the result of the <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> of changes of circumstance, upon those primitive germs which he considered to have originally arisen, by spontaneous generation, within the waters of the globe. It is curious, however, that Lamarck should insist so strongly* as he has done, that circumstances never in any degree directly modify the form or the organization of animals, but only operate by changing their wants and consequently their actions; for he thereby brings upon himself the obvious question, how, then, do plants, which cannot be said to have wants or actions, become modified? To this he replies, that they are modified by the changes in their nutritive processes, which are effected by changing circumstances; and {{it does not seem to}} have occurred to him that such changes might be as well supposed to take place among animals.

40|$|Available {{epidemiologic}} {{data suggest}} {{the possibility that}} the use of oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0. 625 mg/day as a first-choice dose could be associated with a very limited (if any) breast cancer risk increase. Some biological peculiarities of oral CEE back the possi-bility of a limited detrimental effect on breast tissue, due to either direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>actions.</b> Direct actions. Some experimental findings suggest that the 17 a-dihydroderivatives of equilenin and equilin (15 % of the CEE components) have a non-estrogenic or even an anti-estrogenic effect on breast tissue. This could partially counterbalance the stimulatory action of the other CEE components. <b>Indirect</b> <b>actions.</b> Oral estrogens, through their meta-bolic and hepatocellular effects (emphasized by the first liver passage) cause a sharp increase in sex hormone bind-ing globulin (SHBG) level which is followed by a lower quantity of both estrogen and androgen in the free, bioavailable, form. More importantly, they cause a decrease in circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) activity, due to both a reduction in IGF-I synthesis by the liver and an increase in IGF-binding protein- 1 level. A strong relationship between breast cancer risk and the con-centration of circulating IGF-I in premenopausal women has been recently found. Actually, estrogens and IGF-I have a synergistic effect on cell proliferation, and IGF-I is necessary for maximum estrogen-receptor activation in breast cancer cell lines. The possibility does exist that the SHBG level increase and the IGF-I bioavailability decrease, caused by oral CEE, balance the increased estrogen stimulation on breast tissue...|$|R
