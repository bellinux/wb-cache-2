He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands <b>in</b> <b>silhouette,</b> accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E

For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of gliding.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964 Government led by Harold Wilson, Benn was Postmaster General, {{where he}} oversaw {{the opening of}} the Post Office Tower, then the UK's tallest building, and the creations of the Post Bus service and Girobank. He {{proposed}} issuing stamps without the Sovereign's head, but this met with private opposition from the Queen. Instead, the portrait was reduced to a small profile <b>in</b> <b>silhouette,</b> a format that is still used on commemorative stamps.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{automatic}} removal of artifacts and errors that can appear <b>in</b> <b>silhouettes</b> extracted from polygonal meshes is presented and evaluated. These errors typically appear <b>in</b> polygonal <b>silhouettes</b> {{due to the}} discrete nature of meshes and numerical instabilities. The approach presented works in object space on silhouette curves made by chaining together silhouette edges and uses multiresolution techniques based on reverse subdivision. Two hidden line removal methods along with a traditional method to render strokes as 3 D triangle strips in object space are also presented...|$|R

To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. <b>In</b> <b>silhouette,</b> they {{were similar to}} the larger s that immediately preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is mostly}} in English, {{but also has}} some subtitled Yiddish and Hebrew. The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and {{includes}} interviews with rabbis and psychotherapists about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality. During the film's six-year production, DuBowski met hundreds of homosexual Jews, but only a handful agreed to be filmed due to fear of being ostracized from their communities. Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only <b>in</b> <b>silhouette</b> or with their faces pixelized. The {{majority of the participants}} are American Jews, with one British and one Israeli Jew also featured. The film was successful at the box office, grossing over $788,896 on eight screens by its close date.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} the {{courtroom}} where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton {{is seen as a}} reference to the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, which dealt with issues of {{separation of church and state}} and the debate between creationism and evolution. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown Man. When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a Pottery Barn in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers <b>in</b> <b>silhouette</b> against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).|$|E

5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable <b>in</b> <b>silhouette.</b> The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1950s, Sun Ra and Abraham {{formed an}} {{independent}} record label that was generally known as El Saturn Records. (It had several name variations.) Initially focused on 45 rpm singles by Sun Ra and artists related to him, Saturn Records issued two full-length albums during the 1950s: Super-Sonic Jazz (1957) and Jazz <b>In</b> <b>Silhouette</b> (1959). Producer Tom Wilson {{was the first}} to release a Sun Ra album, through his independent label Transition Records in 1957, entitled Jazz by Sun Ra. During this era, Sun Ra recorded the first of dozens of singles as a band-for-hire backing a range of doo wop and R singers; several dozen of these were reissued in a two-CD set, The Singles, by Evidence Records.|$|E
25|$|The early 1880s was {{a period}} of stylistic confusion. On one hand, there is the over-ornamented {{silhouette}} with contrasting texture and frivolous accessories. On the other hand, the growing popularity of tailoring gave rise to an alternative, severe style. Some credited the change <b>in</b> <b>silhouette</b> to the Victorian dress reform, which consisted of a few movements including the Aesthetic Costume Movement and the Rational Dress Movement in the mid-to-late Victorian Era advocating natural silhouette, lightweight underwear, and rejecting tightlacing. However, these movements did not gain widespread support. Others noted the growth in cycling and tennis as acceptable feminine pursuits that demanded a greater ease of movement in women's clothing. Still others argued that the growing popularity of tailored semi-masculine suits was simply a fashionable style, and indicated neither advanced views nor the need for practical clothes. Nonetheless, the diversification in options and adoption of what was considered menswear at that time coincided with growing power and social status of women towards the late-Victorian period.|$|E
25|$|In 1940 Mickey {{appeared}} in his first feature-length film, Fantasia. His screen role as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, set to the symphonic poem {{of the same name}} by Paul Dukas, is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's most iconic roles. The segment features no dialogue at all, only the music. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen <b>in</b> <b>silhouette</b> shaking hands with Leopold Stokowski, who conducts all the music heard in Fantasia. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic!, an attraction at the Disney theme parks.|$|E

25|$|The show {{initially}} starred Hodgson as Joel Robinson, {{a janitor}} trapped {{against his will}} by two mad scientists on the Satellite of Love and forced to watch a series of B movies {{as a part of}} the scientists' plot to take over the world. To keep his sanity, Joel crafts a number of robot companions—including Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy—to keep him company and help him humorously comment on each movie as it plays, a process known as riffing. Each two-hour episode would feature a single movie in its entirety along with associated public domain films, with Joel, Tom, and Crow watching <b>in</b> <b>silhouette</b> from a row of theater seats at the bottom of the screen. These scenes were framed with interstitial sketches. The show's cast changed over its duration; most notably, the character of Joel was replaced by Mike Nelson (played by Michael J. Nelson) in the show's fifth season. Other cast members, most of whom were also writers for the show, include Trace Beaulieu, Josh Weinstein, Jim Mallon, Kevin Murphy, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, Bill Corbett, Paul Chaplin, and Bridget Jones Nelson. The revival features a primarily new cast, including Jonah Ray as the new human test subject, along with Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt.|$|E
25|$|Since police detectives {{initially}} {{seemed to}} be unhelpful to Lieberman and assumed that Philip had died with the other victims, he hired Gallant, who found two pieces of evidence suggesting {{that she may have}} returned to the apartment building early on the morning of September 11. The first was the call from the home phone to Lieberman's cell; the second was some videotape from the security cameras in the lobby. Timestamped at 8:43a.m., just 3 minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 was crashed into the North Tower, and within the 7-9 a.m. timeframe during which, Lieberman later testified, Philip always returned after her nights out, it shows a woman entering the building, waiting near the elevator and leaving after a few minutes. Due to the poor contrast from the sunlight in the lobby, she was visible only <b>in</b> <b>silhouette,</b> but her hair and dress are consistent with Philip as seen in the Century 21 tape from the previous evening. Her family also says the woman exhibits similar mannerisms. She is, however, not carrying any of the bags that she would have had from her shopping trip, and again she is apparently unaccompanied. Lieberman could not positively identify her as his wife, but a city police investigator believes it was her.|$|E
