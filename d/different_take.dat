It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{the lead}} roles of Duck, You Sucker! {{proved to be}} a {{difficult}} process. The role of John Mallory was written for Jason Robards, who had played Cheyenne in Once Upon a Time in the West. However, the studio wanted a bigger name for his character. Clint Eastwood was then approached by Leone for the role, but he saw it as just a <b>different</b> <b>take</b> of the same character he had already played in the Dollars Trilogy, and he also wanted to end his association with the Italian film industry. As a result, he declined the offer and starred in Hang 'Em High instead. George Lazenby was then approached to play John, but he declined. A young Malcolm McDowell, then mostly known for his performance in if...., was considered for both John and Nolan, John’s Irish friend, but Leone eventually settled on James Coburn to play John. Coburn had previously been considered for other Leone projects, including A Fistful of Dollars and Once Upon a Time in the West. He had also previously been considered for a role in another United Artists-financed Zapata Western, Sergio Corbucci's The Mercenary, but Franco Nero was later cast in what was originally his role.|$|E

The first known recording {{is with the}} Miracles on August 6, 1966, though there {{may also have been}} a recording with the Isley Brothers, or at least Whitfield intended to record it with them; however a track has not turned up – some Motown historians believe that a session may have been scheduled but cancelled. The Miracles' version was not released as a single due to Berry Gordy's veto during Motown's weekly quality control meetings; Gordy advised Whitfield and Strong to create a stronger single. The Miracles version later appeared on their 1968 Special Occasion album, and a slightly <b>different</b> <b>take,</b> possibly from the same session but unreleased, appeared on the 1998 compilation album, Motown Sings Motown Treasures.|$|E

VanDerWerff called it [...] "way too self-indulgent" [...] and Kubicek characterized it as [...] "shameless self promotion". Gonzalez said the song [...] "isn't half bad" [...] and gave it a [...] "B−", while Benigno was more generous with a [...] "B+", despite his belief that it did not belong in the episode. Futterman called it [...] "a generic-sounding pop melody". The use of [...] "Bella Notte", by contrast, was generally approved of, though Kubicek thought it was [...] "kind of weird that they weren't really there", and Berk gave both of its two stars out of five solely due to the [...] "spectral singers". VanDerWerff thought the song was [...] "well-performed", and Benigno gave it a [...] "B+"; he had a very <b>different</b> <b>take</b> from Kubicek, as he found the imaginary appearance by the male club members hilarious.|$|E

However, they elected to wear no stars at all the following season. Juventus won their 30th title in 2013–14 and thus {{earned the right to}} wear their third star, but club president Andrea Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, thus having the right to wear two stars, [...] "to emphasise Juventus' superiority". However, for the 2015–16 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas, in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth Coppa Italia the previous season.

Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin.

Towards {{the end of the}} track, this version also contains a clip of Lennon stating the phrase [...] "turned out nice again" [...] played forward—which was played backwards in the original mix of the song.

[...] Exactly why Crosby insisted on resurrecting the song, when there was newer original material in reserve, remains a mystery, although the Byrds' roadie, Jimmi Seiter, has speculated {{that it was an}} attempt to increase Crosby's share of the songwriting on the album. [...] Author Peter Lavezzoli has commented that [...] "Why" [...] features verses with a chord structure reminiscent of [...] "(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave" [...] by Martha and the Vandellas and a raga-flavored lead guitar solo inspired by the music of sitarist Ravi Shankar. [...] However, Rogan has noted that the song's Indian classical music influences were considerably watered down on the re-recorded version that appeared on Younger Than Yesterday when compared to the earlier B-side recording.|$|E
500|$|His lessened {{involvement}} with the plot compared to protagonists from preceding Final Fantasy titles was met with mixed reception. Destructoid editor Aaron Linde described him as [...] "arguably the most uninspiring character in the game". Play.tm editor Andrew Macarthy described Vaan as an [...] "undescribing figure". Eurogamer editor Rob Fahey stated that while [...] "players may initially be somewhat dismayed to find themselves largely following around the cheerful prettyboy Vaan", the game introduces new characters who [...] "fill out the cast superbly". PSX Extreme editor Cavin Smith commented that due to the game not focusing on just one character, Vaan [...] "spends the entire game as an observer of the events unfolding in front of him", adding {{that it is a}} [...] "far <b>different</b> <b>take</b> on the protagonist compared to Nomura's egocentric tendencies". PALGN editor Phil Larsen called him a [...] "rogue-ish bad boy with a heart of gold", adding that [...] "while this may seem clichéd at first, Vaan is always presented as extremely young and never tries to control every situation", citing Tidus as an example of someone who does. Worthplaying editor Agustin described the set-up as being [...] "Dragon Quest-like", and that while he acts as a vehicle for players to view the plot through, he compared him to critically acclaimed characters Crono and Link from the Chrono Trigger and The Legend of Zelda series respectively.|$|E

500|$|Titanic {{held the}} record for box office gross for twelve years. Cameron's {{follow-up}} film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, [...] "Two-thirds of Titanic haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them" [...] and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. [...] "Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, [...] "I don't think it's realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch. Some pretty good movies have {{come out in the}} last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord." [...] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a <b>different</b> <b>take</b> on the matter once Avatar performance was easier to predict. [...] "It's gonna happen.

500|$|English {{publications}} {{have given}} Kingdom Hearts 3D moderately positive reviews, with lower scores than Japanese review outlets, generally praising the gameplay while criticizing the plot. It received an aggregated score of 78.70% on GameRankings and 75/100 on Metacritic. Game Informer writer Bryan Vore praised the new gameplay elements and, unlike other reviewers, {{how well the}} story handles the franchise's plot, especially as it was set after that of Kingdom Hearts II, unlike {{many of the other}} newer titles in the series. Audrey Drake from IGN echoed similar comments about the gameplay, but felt that the story was sometimes not very interesting. Mark Walton from GameSpot praised the combat systems and environment design, though he wished that the game didn't force the player through the levels linearly and dismissed the plot as [...] "labyrinth-like" [...] with poor dialogue and confusing motivations. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com was harsher on the game than other reviewers; while he too found the plot incomprehensible, he also felt that the numerous game mechanics combined together to form a confusing and frustrating system. The reviewer for GameTrailers had a <b>different</b> <b>take,</b> finding the combination of mechanics to form [...] "the best battle system in the series to date" [...] and was not as dismissive of the plot, though they did note that it required a lot of knowledge of previous games in the series to follow. Leah Jackson of G4 had one of the highest reviews for the game out of the major English review outlets; though she had similar praises and criticisms as other reviewers, she felt that the gameplay and graphics more than made up for the sometimes confusing plot.|$|E

Subsequent to Ameen's departure, the role of Capheus was recast to Toby Onwumere after a seven-day auditioning process. Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not seen it before. The actor said about his approach to the character: [...] "My duty [...] not to emulate exactly what [...] has done, ... but just to give it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a <b>different</b> <b>take</b> on it." [...] Earlier in April, Kick Gurry, who had played parts in the Wachowskis' Speed Racer and Jupiter Ascending in the past, revealed he had been cast in the second season, after Lana called to inform him that they had a written a role specifically for him. In May, Deadline reported Ben Cole had been cast as Todd, a sensate who would rather be [...] "normal". In September, Sylvester McCoy reportedly revealed he filmed three or four episodes of the second season of a Netflix show, later identified to be Sense8, and has signed to appear in further seasons if he is wanted.
