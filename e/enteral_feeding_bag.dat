40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>bag</b> {{composition}} and freezing and thawing upon {{the stability of}} riboflavin and vitamins A and E in an enteral feeding solution was tested. Feeding bags composed of either polyvinyl chloride or polyeth-ylene were filled with an enteral feeding solution. The samples were frozen for 3 months, thawed in warm water, and allowed to stand in room temperature for 12 hr. Samples for vitamin analysis were obtained prior to freezing, upon thawing, and at 12 hr after thawing. No significant differences in vitamin stability due to bag composition or time were seen. These results support {{the viability of the}} concept of mixing large batches of enteral feeding solution, and freezing aliquots in individual feeding bags for later use.

However, poor handling in <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> can lead to bacterial contaminations and severe consequences resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. At present, there are no definite guidelines on the handling of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in local setting, therefore developing evidence based guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> is critically important to eliminate inconsistent practices and prevent nosocomial infections related to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding.</b> This dissertation is a translational nursing research that aims at developing evidence based guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants. The objectives of this thesis are to search for existing literatures on enteral feeding; perform a critical appraisal on the literatures; develop guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants; assess the implementation potential of the proposed guidelines, and develop the implementation and evaluation plans. The {{ultimate goal is to}} reduce the nosocomial infections in infants with <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in an acute hospital. A systemic search for relevant and valid evidence was performed using three electronic databases and nine relevant studies were retrieved. Critical appraisals on the nine studies were performed and the level of evidence for each study was graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). By synthesizing the data from nine studies, it is concluded that optimal hang time and proper hand hygiene appeared to have significant effect in reducing nosocomial infections related to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding.</b> The implementation potential of the innovation was assessed in terms of the transferability, feasibility and cost benefit ratio. After assessing the implementation potential, it is found that the evidence is transferable and feasible to implement the proposed guideline in the target paeditaric setting. An evidence based guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants was developed. An implementation plan of the new guideline included a comprehensive communication plan with both administration and nurses and a pilot test were developed to ensure a smooth implementation and optimize the transferability and effectiveness of the evidence based guideline in the target population.

40|$|Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) is {{a common}} cause of morbidity in critically ill patients. Appropriate <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> {{is the most important}} factor associated with the prevention of VAP. However, the standardization of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> methods needs clarification. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the factors associated with <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in order to prevent VAP and to describe the characteristics of these factors. A comprehensive search was undertaken involving all major databases from their inception to September 2008 using medical subject heading terms associated with <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in relation to VAP. The overall reference list of identified studies was audited, and eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after (pre–post) studies and meta-analyses. To generate the characteristics of the factors associated with VAP, the reported components of these trials were pinpointed and categorized. A total of 14 papers were found that had investigated the factors linking <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> and VAP. For these, 11 were randomized controlled trials, 1 was a meta-analysis and 2 were case-controlled analyses. Twelve of these 14 studies were conducted at a single institute and 2 were conducted at multiple institutes. The sample sizes varied from 10 to 2, 528 subjects. Three major issues were identified based on the purpose of study interventions, and these were the effects of feeding method (continuous vs. intermittent), feeding site on aspiration (gastric vs. small bowel), and the timing of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> (early vs. late). The evidence suggests that a correct choice of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> method can effectively reduce complications due to aspiration. Furthermore, intermittent <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> and with a small residual volume feed can reduce gastroesophageal reflux, and increased total intake volume and early feeding can reduce ICU mortality.

40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} whether serial Doppler measurements of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow velocity {{after the first}} <b>enteral</b> <b>feed</b> could predict early tolerance to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in preterm infants.  METHODS—When clinicians decided to start <b>enteral</b> <b>feeds,</b> Doppler ultrasound blood flow velocity in the SMA was determined before and after a test feed of 0. 5 ml milk. The number of days taken for infants to tolerate full <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> (150 ml/kg/day) was recorded.  RESULTS—Fourteen infants (group 1) achieved full <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> within seven days. Thirty infants (group 2) took 8 - 30 days. There {{was no difference in}} the preprandial time averaged mean velocity (TAMV) between the groups at a median age of 3 (2 - 30) days. In group 1, there was a significant increase in TAMV (p< 0. 01) above the preprandial level at 45 and 60 minutes, but this did not occur in group 2.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{structure}} and function of the small intestine before and after <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> given via a percutaneous feeding gastrostomy (PEG). It is not known whether this method of feeding provides a good luminal drive to the small intestine. Methods: Studies were performed of patients at the time of PEG placement, in a cross-sectional group after a period of feeding and in a smaller longitudinal subgroup. <b>Enteral</b> <b>feeds</b> were adjusted in volume and caloric content for each patient. Duodenal biopsies were taken during endoscopy for quantitative morphometry, and lactulose-rhamnose permeability tests were performed during the next day. Duodenal fluid was cultured quantitatively in the first study, and disaccharidases determined in the second study. Results: The first study of 15 patients, who had <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> for a median (range) period of 13 (8 to 104) weeks, showed partial villous atrophy with normal crypt length, no increase in duodenal bacteriology, and abnormal lactulose-rhamnose sugar permeability due to rhamnose malabsorption. These changes were also present in 38 similar patients before <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding.</b> A second study before <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> showed lowered maltase activity (24 patients), and similar intestinal permeability findings (22 patients). Twelve of these patients were followed longitudinally for 3 months of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> that maintained but did not improve nutrition, as assessed by body mass index and mid-arm muscle circumference, and there was no change in duodenal morphometry (11 patients), rhamnose malabsorption (4 patients), or disaccharidases (11 patients).

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the adequacy of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding,</b> and the reason and prevalence of under-nutrition, and to determine the relationships between caloric intake and resulting nutritional parameters among neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients. MethodsThe participants for this descriptive study were 47 neurosurgical ICU patients who had <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> initiated after ICU admission. Data were collected from the initial day of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> for 7 days. Data related to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding,</b> feeding interruptions or delay, prealbumin, and transferrin were collected. ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 56. 62 years. Twenty-six patients did not receive their feeding formula more than once during 7 days, and 11 had interruptions more than 6 times. The mean number of feeding interruptions was 3. 23 (SD = 4. 47). On the average, only 76. 44 % of the estimated energy requirement was provided by <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> to the patients. The frequency of underfeeding was 52. 17 % with respect to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding.</b> The most frequent reason for the feeding interruption was observation before and after intubation and extubation, which was unavoidable. The next most common reason was gastrointestinal bleeding, mostly due to old clots or trace, followed by residual volume less than 100 mL.

Despite recognition {{of the importance of}} nutrition within the modern health agenda, evaluation of the efficacy of how such feeds are delivered is more limited. The accuracy, safety, and consistency with which <b>enteral</b> <b>feed</b> pump systems dispense nutritional formulae are important determinants of their use and acceptability. <b>Enteral</b> <b>feed</b> pump safety has received increased interest in recent years as enteral pumps are used across hospital and home settings. Four areas of <b>enteral</b> <b>feed</b> pump safety have emerged: the consistent and accurate delivery of formula; the minimization of errors associated with tube misconnection; the impact of continuous feed delivery itself (via an <b>enteral</b> <b>feed</b> pump); and the chemical composition of the casing used in <b>enteral</b> <b>feed</b> pump manufacture. The daily use of pumps in delivery of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeds</b> in a home setting predominantly falls to the hands of parents and caregivers.
