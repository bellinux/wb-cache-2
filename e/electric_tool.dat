50|$|Currently an {{electric}} motor {{is the most popular}} choice to power stationary tools, though in the past they were powered by windmills, water wheels and steam. Some museums and hobbyists still maintain and operate stationary tools powered these older power sources. Portable <b>electric</b> <b>tools</b> may be either corded or battery-powered. Compressed air is the customary power source for nailers and paint sprayers. A few tools (called powder-actuated tools) are powered by explosive cartridges. Tools that run on gasoline or gasoline-oil mixes are made for outdoor use; typical examples include most chainsaws and string trimmers. Other tools like blowtorches will burn their fuel externally to generate heat. Compressed air is universally used where there is a possibility of fuel or vapor ignition - such as automotive workshops. Professional level <b>electric</b> <b>tools</b> differ from DIY or 'consumer' tools by being double insulated and not earthed - in fact they must not be earthed for safety reasons.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the 1930s, {{power tools}} were often housed in cast metal {{housings}}. The cast metal housings were heavy, contributing to repetitive use injuries, {{as well as}} conductive - often shocking the user. As Henry Ford adapted to the manufacturing needs of World War II, he requested that A. H. Peterson, a tool manufacturer, create a lighter electric drill that was more portable for his assembly line workers. [...] At this point, the Hole-Shooter, a drill that weighed 5 lbs. was created by A. H. Peterson. The Peterson Company eventually went bankrupt after a devastating fire and recession, but the company was auctioned off to A. F.
