500|$|Beyond his {{religious}} beliefs, Gandhi stated another motivation for his experiments with diet.

His experiments with food began in 1890s and continued for several decades. For some of these experiments, Gandhi combined his own ideas with those found on diet in Indian yoga texts. He believed that each vegetarian should experiment with his or <b>her</b> <b>diet</b> because, in his studies at his ashram he saw [...] "one man's food may be poison for another".|$|E
