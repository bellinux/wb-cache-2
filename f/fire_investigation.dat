40|$|This report {{provides}} a {{detailed study of}} attic fires {{that have occurred in}} Swedish apartment buildings in order to determine if there are specific technical or organizational factors that influence them. The study has been carried out by a combined analysis of rescue service statistics with case studies based on detailed <b>fire</b> <b>investigations.</b> In the case study a total of 27 <b>fire</b> <b>investigations</b> were studied. The analysis of statistics and <b>fire</b> <b>investigations</b> are complementary since conclusions can be drawn that cannot be found when only one of the sources are used. The analysis of statistics provides general pattern for a greater number of fires with varying degrees while the <b>fire</b> <b>investigations,</b> provide more detailed information on specific cases. From the analysis several conclusions can be drawn on why the attic fires become more extensive than fires in other spaces. A couple of measures to avoid severe attic fires have also been identified. Although there are gaps in the statistics and the <b>fire</b> <b>investigations</b> they still constitute a good base to gather experience from past events. It is not sure that statistics is appropriate to use for anything more than to see trends in individual factors such as fire causes or first item of ignition. To obtain a deeper understanding of fire development and the function of fire protection measures, it is necessary to study <b>fire</b> <b>investigations</b> as well as statistics...|$|R

GC-MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it can identify trace elements in materials that were previously thought to have disintegrated beyond identification.

40|$|In recent years, {{criticism}} {{has been raised}} against the Swedish fire brigades both from their own staff and from researchers regarding deficiencies in learning and experience feedback within the organizations. Among other things, they {{have been criticized for}} that the documentation is only proliferating paper work because there is no system available for deriving advantage from the experience. A researcher who has studied the area is Anna-Karin Lindberg, who reviewed the learning from the fire brigades operating reports. She concludes, among other things, that the spreading of knowledge and lessons learned from the operating reports do not work particularly well. At the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade there were suspicions that the same problems regarding the operating reports also applied to the <b>fire</b> <b>investigations.</b> We have in this thesis reviewed parts of the process of <b>fire</b> <b>investigations</b> to identify deficiencies, mainly with regard to experience feedback from the suggestions for improvement put forward in <b>fire</b> <b>investigations.</b> The work was conducted in three steps encompassing: 1) analyzing various theoretical models to be used in fire/accident <b>investigations,</b> 2) reviewing <b>fire</b> <b>investigations</b> to examine their coherence with theory, and, 3) reviewing the content, quality and extent of the suggestions for improvement contained in <b>fire</b> <b>investigations.</b> The completed study covers a total of 130 <b>fire</b> <b>investigations,</b> written by Stockholm / the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade in the years 2006 to 2010. <b>Fire</b> <b>investigations</b> have been reviewed and the various suggestions for improvement have then been indexed in a database. From this database, and through interviews and literature studies, we note that there are deficiencies in the process of experience feedback from <b>fire</b> <b>investigations,</b> mainly referring to the suggestions for improvement which only reach out to a small number of people, both internally and externally. The external distribution is more or less exclusive to the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency (MSB) and the suggestions for improvement that primarily should be handled locally may not be carried out. There are also uncertainties regarding whom or what part of the organization that is responsible for passing on the suggestions for improvement and {{there is a lack of}} effective channels for disseminating the information to the most crucial recipients. In conclusion, it is recommended that the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade: - develops a system for how the suggestions for improvement and experiences best should be handled and pin down which part of the organization that is responsible for communicating them. - customizes the report template so that it aims at concrete suggestions for improvement and introduces a mailing list or something equivalent. - initiate contacts with the most frequent recipients of suggestions for improvement and examines how these should be performed.

5000|$|Contrary to the {{allegations}} of staff misconduct and detrimental agency policies, the U.S. Forest Service <b>fire</b> <b>investigations</b> in the Angora <b>fire</b> <b>Investigations</b> confirmed {{that most of the}} structures caught fire from “firebrands”—pieces of burning wood—carried in the smoke column either from neighboring structures or from nearby burning vegetation.

In many cases, winter fire wood and kindling supplies were piled too close to homes. The study did state that dead and dying vegetation along Angora Creek [...] "likely contributed" [...] to the fire's rapid spread.
