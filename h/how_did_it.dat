Fidelio is shaken; Rocco tries to discourage Fidelio from coming, but Fidelio insists. As they prepare to leave, Jaquino and Marzelline rush in and tell Rocco to run, as Pizarro has learned that the prisoners were allowed to roam, and is furious (Ach, Vater, Vater, eilt!—"O, father, father, hurry!").|$|E
500|$|After being criticised for omitting any {{coverage}} of a Madison Square Garden benefit in April 1983, The New York Times increased its {{coverage of}} AIDS, setting the tone for an increase across print media. One of the most high-profile early pieces introducing AIDS to the heterosexual community was the cover article of the August 8, 1983, edition of Newsweek, showing Campbell and his lover Bobby Hilliard and headlined [...] "EPIDEMIC: The Mysterious and Deadly Disease Called AIDS May Be the Public Health Threat of the Century. <b>How</b> <b>Did</b> <b>it</b> Start? Can it Be Stopped?" [...] — {{only the second time}} an openly gay man had appeared on the cover of a mass-market news magazine, albeit with Hilliard identified as Campbell's [...] "friend." [...] The following week, with Callen, Berkowitz, Felson and Turner, he met with Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Reagan administration. They found Heckler to be receptive to suggestions and, when Campbell pushed the issue of delays in people with AIDS's claims for Social Security, she promised to raise it with her counterpart at the Social Security Administration.|$|E

500|$|According to Greil Marcus, Martin Scorsese {{said that}} the first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film Taxi Driver was based on Astral Weeks. Marcus {{referred}} {{to the impact of}} the album, calling it a [...] "common language", and relates that [...] "I was so shocked when I was teaching a seminar at Princeton just a couple years ago, and out of 16 students, four of them said their favorite album was Astral Weeks." [...] Marcus goes on to say, [...] "Now, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> enter their lives? We're talking about an album that was recorded well before they were born, and yet it spoke to them. They understood its language as soon as they heard it." [...] Elvis Costello described Astral Weeks as [...] "still the most adventurous record made in the rock medium, and there hasn't been a record with that amount of daring made since". Johnny Depp, in a Rolling Stone interview in 2008, recalled how when he was a preteen his older brother (by ten years), tiring of Johnny's favourite music of the time said, [...] "'Try this.' And he put on Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. And it stirred me. I'd never heard anything like it." [...] Joan Armatrading has said that Astral Weeks was the first album she purchased as a teenager and that it opened her up musically. In August 2010, director and choreographer, Jessica Wallenfels, staged a production in Portland, Oregon of a rock opera/story ballet of Astral Weeks called [...] "Find me Beside You".|$|E
