The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, {{and if there is}} a <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.|$|E

As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E

Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E

Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> between East and West.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} causes and {{consequences}} of growing flexibility in gender <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in Kitwe, Zambia. It examines the relationship between four contemporary trends (1990 - 2011) : worsening economic security, growing flexibility in gender <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in the form <b>of</b> increasing female <b>labour</b> force participation and occupational desegregation, and the weakening of gender stereotypes. The evidence for these trends comes from census data, earlier ethnographies and my own qualitative research (April 2010 − March 2011). The analysis draws upon a theoretical framework that interprets sex-differentiated practices as resulting from internalised gender stereotypes, cultural expectations and patterns of resource access. The substantive chapters of the thesis consider alternative hypotheses. Did worsening economic security trigger flexibility in gender <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> which then weakened gender stereotypes (Chapter 4) ? Alternatively, was such flexibility actually contingent upon a prior rejection of gender stereotypes, due to particular formative experiences (Chapter 5) or gender sensitisation (Chapter 6) ? This thesis argues that worsening economic security led many families to sacrifice the social gains accrued by complying with cultural expectations <b>of</b> gender <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> {{in exchange for the}} financial benefits <b>of</b> female <b>labour</b> force participation. But occupational desegregation is partly attributed to a prior rejection of gender stereotypes. Flexibility in gender <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> seems to undermine gender stereotypes and related status inequalities, by enabling exposure to a critical mass of women performing roles that they were previously presumed to be incapable and that are valorised because they were historically performed by men. Common forms of gender sensitisation in Zambia were rarely said to be independently persuasive; impact generally appears contingent upon exposure to a critical mass of women in socially valued domains. Sensitisation also seems more effective when it enables participants to see that others also endorse gender equality. This can increase confidence in the objective validity of one’s own egalitarian beliefs and also shift cultural expectations...|$|R

By forced <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore a {{theoretical}} framework that can assist in understanding the extent to which the increased integration of macro-regional economies (such as the European and North American) and the global economy is leading to divergence and/or convergence in the pattern of economic activity and the distribution of value-added and wealth. In particular, the paper focuses on the extent to which changing <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> the production, appropriation and allocation of value, and economic organization underpin these processes of convergence/divergence. We focus on developing an understanding <b>of</b> the changing <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> across space in increasingly integrated macro-regional economies such as Europe and North America, and the (unequal) flows of value between places that underpin mosaics of territorial inequality.

In particular, we argue that the focus on the commodity, while initially helpful, is misplaced because commodities embody and carry with them relations of value. Consequently, our attention should be focused on the organization of the production, appropriation and realization of value flows and the various forces that structure these processes, such as state governance, labour organization, corporate practices and so on, that are fundamental to understanding the (re) configuration of economic activity in macro-regional economies...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{historical}} causes and consequences <b>of</b> gender <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in the Zambian Copperbelt. Male breadwinner and female housewife stereotypes {{appear to have}} emerged {{as a product of}} imported Christian ideologies, colonial–capitalist concerns and an economic climate that largely enabled men to financially provide for their families. Reliant upon husbands for status and economic support, many urban women had little conjugal bargaining power. Gender <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> also meant that people lacked first-hand evidence of women’s equal competence in employment and politics, who they thus often underrated and overlooked. Such perceptions seem to have perpetuated women’s exclusion from prestigious positions – a pattern sustained by macro-economic circumstances {{in the early decades of}} Independence. Compliance with the gender status inequalities promoted in pre-marital traditional initiation thus became necessary to marital and economic security, as well as respectability, which was not previously the case. While there were exceptions to these trends, the historical record illustrates the interplay between patterns of resource access, internalised gender stereotypes and cultural expectations...|$|R

In practice, there was little <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills.

The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels and maintain the fungal growth, probably never reproducing. Cooperative brood care is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested faeces of the adults.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores gender {{relations}} in the City of London advertising industry. It argues that the gender imbalance in the highest ranking positions and the stifled career progression {{of women in the}} industry are a result of social, structural and institutional factors rather than individual choice, lack of ‘talent’ or the absence of mentors or appropriate role models. We discuss the organization and spatiality of the advertising industry in London, the significance of social networking within and beyond the firm, and problematise the notion that female childbearing and caring are the primary determinants of women’s truncated career trajectories in advertising. The research reveals that whilst age, gender and domestic <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> combine to reinforce occupational sexual <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in the advertising industry in London, these inequality regimes (Acker 2006) are amplified by the industry’s precariousness, informality and requirements for flexibility. Attempting to explain away gendered <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> {{solely on the basis of}} women’s role in social reproduction deflects attention away from other key determinants of inequality, most notably the pace of advertising work and the geographical concentration of the industry within London. These are further accentuated by deep-rooted forms of homophily and homosociality – those unspeakable inequalities that call into question the dominant post- feminist rhetoric that ‘all the battles have been won’ (Gill, 2008). We analyse the ways in which homosociality has been crucial in maintaining insidious sexism which has made it very difficult for female creatives to obtain the most prestigious roles at work. Taken together, the organisation and geography of the sector, the rhetoric of buzz and egalitarianism, the ‘motherhood myth’ and the homophilic practices at work within advertising combine to create deep and enduring gendered inequalities...|$|R

This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically.

40|$|The {{current study}} is a {{longitudinal}} investigation into changes in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour</b> across transitions to marriage and parenthood in the UK. Previous research has noted a more traditional <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour,</b> with women performing the majority of housework, amongst spouses and couples with children. However, the bulk of this work has been cross-sectional in nature. The few longitudinal {{studies that have been}} carried out have been rather ambiguous about the effect of marriage and parenthood on the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> housework. Theoretically, this study draws on gender construction theory. The key premise of this theory is that gender is something that is performed and created in interaction, and, as a result, something fluid and flexible rather than fixed and stable. The idea that couples ‘do gender’ through housework has been a major theoretical breakthrough. Gender-neutral explanations <b>of</b> the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour,</b> positing rational acting individuals, have failed to explicate why women continue to perform an unequal share of housework, regardless of socio-economic status. Contrastingly, gender construction theory situates gender as the key process in dividing household labour. By performing and avoiding certain housework chores, couples fulfill social norms {{of what it means to}} be a man and a woman although, given the emphasis on human agency in producing and contesting gender, couples are able to negotiate alternative gender roles which, in turn, feed back into the structure of social norms in an ever-changing societal landscape. This study adds extra depth to the doing gender approach by testing whether or not couples negotiate specific conjugal and parent roles in terms <b>of</b> the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour.</b> Both transitions hypothesise a more traditional <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour.</b> Data comes from the British Household Panel Survey, a large, nationally representative quantitative survey that has been carried out annually since 1991. Here, data tracks the same 776 couples at two separate time points – 1996 and 2005. OLS regression is used to test whether or not transitions to marriage and parenthood have a significant impact on the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour</b> whilst controlling for host of relevant socio-economic factors. Results indicate that marriage has no significant effect on how couples partition housework. Those couples making the transition from cohabitation to marriage do not show significant changes in housework arrangements from those couples who remain cohabiting in both waves. On the other hand, becoming parents does lead to a more traditional <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour</b> whilst controlling for socio-economic factors which accompany the move to parenthood. There is then some evidence that couples use the site <b>of</b> household <b>labour</b> to ‘do parenthood’ and generate identities which both use and inform socially prescribed notions of what it means to be a mother and a father.
