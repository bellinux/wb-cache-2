5|$|He {{intends to}} feed Alec the carrot, but {{realizes that he}} is late for the show and rushes off to the stage without doing so, much to Alec's chagrin. Presto tries to start the performance, but Alec becomes {{reluctant}} to cooperate until he is given the carrot. After Alec hits his master's hand on the podium <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> on, Presto then spends {{the rest of the}} show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat.|$|E
5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> still.|$|E
25|$|The popular {{landmark}} Siwash Rock, {{located near}} present-day Third Beach, was once called Slahkayulsh meaning <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> up. In the oral history, a fisherman {{was transformed into}} this rock by three powerful brothers as punishment for his immorality.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, one of {{the last}} {{photographs}} ever taken of Mannock was discovered in Northern France. The photograph was found in an old album belonging to a French farmer whose land had been used by the Royal Air Force during the summer of 1918. The photograph shows Mannock in RAF uniform. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> on a farm track holding a walking stick and gloves with his right hand. His left hand rests on the shoulder of a dark-haired young French girl.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} passage preserved, Encolpius is in a Greek town in Campania, perhaps Puteoli, where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> outside a school, railing against the Asiatic style and false taste in literature, which he blames on the {{prevailing}} system of declamatory education (1–2). His adversary {{in this debate}} is Agamemnon, a sophist, who shifts the blame from the teachers to the parents (3–5). Encolpius discovers that his companion Ascyltos has left and breaks away from Agamemnon {{when a group of}} students arrive (6).|$|E
25|$|The Ninnion Tablet, {{found in}} the same museum, depicts Demeter, {{followed}} by Persephone and Iacchus, and then the procession of initiates. Then, Demeter {{is sitting on the}} kiste inside the Telesterion, with Persephone holding a torch and introducing the initiates. The initiates each hold a bacchoi. The second row of initiates were led by Iakchos, a priest who held torches for the ceremonies. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> near the omphalos while an unknown female (probably a priestess of Demeter) sat nearby on the kiste, holding a scepter and a vessel filled with kykeon. Pannychis is also represented.|$|E

25|$|He {{could also}} alter his {{personal}} mono-directional gravity field beneath himself {{to make himself}} virtually immovable {{as long as he}} was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the Hulk, Juggernaut, and Strong Guy (powered-up near his limit by absorbing kinetic energy), although Colossus has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability. Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes. Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.|$|E
500|$|Ned Flanders calls Marge for help. Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney {{are hanging}} around outside the Leftorium, making Ned {{worried that they}} will start causing trouble. Marge {{suggests}} that he shoo them away. The trio are about to leave, but when he goes and asks them to, they decide to harass him instead. Ned calls Marge again, whilst <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> on a chair with the three boys circling him on their minibikes, so she suggests that he [...] "lay down the law", and {{when one of the}} boys snips the phone cord, Marge assumes that Ned has hung up and that everything is fine.|$|E
500|$|A {{digitally}} rejuvenated Patrick Stewart {{also makes}} an uncredited cameo as a younger Charles Xavier {{who appeared to}} not yet lose {{the use of his}} legs. However, with timeline and story inconsistencies within the film series, Singer developed an idea to tie all the films together and fix the continuity. In [...] Xavier loses the use of his legs at a much younger age, than he appears in Origins. As an explanation, Xavier can be seen walking in [...] (which chronologically takes place prior to the events of this film), by creating the illusion that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> in various scenes, when in reality the character is only present by telepathic projection.|$|E

500|$|A {{segment of}} [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was {{inspired}} by a controversy over the growing Islamic influence in the city of Dearborn, Michigan, which, according to Bill Gallagher of WJBK, has [...] "a significant Muslim community". The biggest mosque in the United States is also located there. During the segment in question, set in Milhouse and Lisa's future home, Milhouse tells Lisa that he has started to feel the symptoms of his seasonal allergies now that Christmas has arrived. He is apparently allergic to Christmas-related things such as holly, mistletoe, and the red part of candy cane. Lisa advises Milhouse to go and stay in Michigan over the holidays, where Christmas is not celebrated because it is [...] "still under sharia law." [...] Milhouse agrees to do this, but complains that they always make him wear a veil there, pointing to a photo on the wall in which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> outside of the University of Michigan–Dearborn dressed in a burqa.|$|E
500|$|As noted {{at the end}} of {{the article}} on him in the Dictionary of National Biography, there is a rich {{collection}} of Bewick portraits, beginning with that of Newcastle painter George Gray (1758-1819), from about 1780 and long owned by Bewick's family, that is now in the Laing Art Gallery. Several are by James Ramsay, including the one at the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, in which he sits holding spectacles, one in middle-age, held by the Natural History Society of Northumbria, and one in old age in the National Portrait Gallery. Bewick also appears among the figures on the left in Ramsay's [...] "The Lost Child" [...] (1823), where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> next to Ramsay and his wife in the street leading up to St Nicholas' Church. John Henry Frederick Bacon was to draw on this small figure to create his 1852 print of Bewick, in which he has been transferred from the urban to a rural setting, with the city and the Tyne in the background.|$|E
500|$|The {{gatefold}} {{cover of}} the vinyl LP features the band posing nude in a brook. The shot was original manager Phil Walden's idea, and the brook was on his brother Alan's property. Alan later recalled, [...] "The [...] photo was taken in Round Oak, Georgia, down behind my log cabin there, {{which is also the}} back of Otis Redding's Big O Ranch". Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner was present with Boz Scaggs, whom he was producing at the time. They brought bubbles to cover themselves up, but the bubbles were washed away by the stream. Trucks had sliced his leg open earlier that day, requiring thirteen stitches, and was unable to get in the water; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> behind Oakley in the shot. Walden suggested the band take a few shots standing full-frontal; the band was reluctant but he assured them they would never see the light of day. At their first performance at the Fillmore East that December, Trucks discovered the full-frontal shots were printed in a broadsheet alternative newspaper.|$|E

500|$|The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is {{a fantasy}} action-adventure game with {{role-playing}} and puzzle elements {{set in a}} large open-world environment. The player controls series protagonist Link from a third-person perspective, in a three-dimensional world. Link primarily fights with a sword and shield, but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles, bombs, and magic spells. The control scheme introduced techniques such as context-sensitive actions and a targeting system called [...] "Z-targeting". In combat, Z-targeting allows the player to have Link focus and latch onto an enemy or other objects. When using this technique, the camera follows the target and Link constantly faces it. Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming. Context-sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button, simplifying the control scheme. The on-screen display shows {{what will happen when}} the button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing. For example, the same button that causes Link to push a box if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it.|$|E
500|$|Before Lois {{prepares to}} undergo in vitro fertilization, Dr. Hartman shows her several photos of babies {{conceived}} by celebrity couples, including actress Shelley Duvall and singer-songwriter James Blunt; actress Hilary Swank and actor Gary Busey; Olympic medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner and physicist Stephen Hawking; and actress, writer and comedian Tina Fey and actor Joaquin Phoenix. Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, [...] "Well, {{perhaps you could}} tell them—if only you spoke Hovitos," [...] a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Later, {{in an attempt to}} cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of Grey's Anatomy DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the [...] "Acme Miscarriage Kit", a boxing glove attached to a crossbow. In a reference to the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Peter ultimately ends up missing with the crossbow, causing the glove to bounce and hit a large rock and land inches in front of him as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> on a narrow cliff. The ground then drops out from underneath his feet, causing him to fall like Wile E. Coyote.|$|E
500|$|To defeat enemies, {{players can}} {{make use of}} various {{offensive}} and defensive abilities. Jack can find four types of firearms: pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and carbine rifles. He also possesses several types of time manipulating powers, which increase his efficiency in combat. [...] "Time Stop" [...] freezes time around enemies with a time bubble. If the player shoots an opponent trapped in the bubble, its power amplifies, and the bullets will kill the enemy when the bubble vanishes after {{a short period of}} time. [...] "Time Rush" [...] allows Jack to dash next to an enemy and perform an immediate melee takedown. He can also use this power to speed up time and dodge between cover to confuse unaware enemies as to his location. [...] "Time Blast" [...] levitates enemies and freezes them. The defensive ability [...] "Time Shield" [...] deflects all incoming damage, while [...] "Time Dodge" [...] allows players to dash quickly to evade attacks. Most of these time manipulating powers have a short cooldown period after use. In combat, Jack automatically takes cover when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> next to environmental objects. However, the artificial intelligence in the game is designed to push the player out of cover by coordinating with each other.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{cartoons}} are of Bryan illustrated as a snake, representing Populism, swallowing a donkey, symbolizing the Democratic Party.
