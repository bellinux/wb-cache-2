5|$|The next {{largest group}} of victims were non-Jewish Poles, who {{accounted}} for 70,000 to 75,000 deaths. Twenty-one thousand Roma and Sinti were killed, along with 15,000 Soviet POWs and 10,000 to 15,000 peoples of other nations. Around 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts between men) were detained <b>in</b> <b>concentration</b> camps of which an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.|$|E
5|$|Additional SS {{trials and}} {{convictions}} followed. Many defendants attempted to exculpate themselves using the excuse {{that they were}} merely following superior orders, which they had to obey unconditionally {{as part of their}} sworn oath and duty. The courts did not find this to be a legitimate defense. A trial of 40 SS officers and guards from Auschwitz took place in Kraków in November 1947. Most were found guilty, and 23 received the death penalty. In addition to those tried by the Western allies, an estimated 37,000 members of the SS were tried and convicted in Soviet courts. Sentences included hangings and long terms of hard labor. Piotr Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, estimates that of the 70,000 members of the SS involved in crimes <b>in</b> <b>concentration</b> camps, only about 1,650 to 1,700 were tried after the war.

5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), {{assisted}} by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, {{was responsible for}} the deaths of at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. Deaths took place <b>in</b> <b>concentration</b> and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union. These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3million civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Guest {{joined up}} again, enlisting in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901. He {{was given the}} rank of Sergeant, chasing Boer commandoes without success.

Returning to Klerksdorp, Guest learned that the Bechuanaland Rifles were recruiting experienced officers; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit, with whom he served {{until the end of the}} war. The Rifles were part of a mobile force, the Divisional Scouting Corps, whose function was to round up Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener's scorched earth policy, destroying Boer farm buildings and crops, and detaining women and children <b>in</b> <b>concentration</b> camps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died <b>in</b> <b>concentration</b> camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E

5|$|Janet {{made its}} final {{landfall}} in the Mexican state of Veracruz between {{the cities of}} Nautla and Veracruz as a Category2 hurricane at 2200UTC on September29. In Nautla, communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane. The strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash, causing five deaths. Heavy rains in the Tampico, Tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year. The resulting flood was reported by the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans {{to be one of}} the worst natural disasters in Mexican history. In Tampico, 16in (410mm) of rain was reported. The floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak, causing over 1,000people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases. An additional 36,000people were being cared for <b>in</b> <b>concentration</b> centers. Although located south of where Janet made landfall, areas of Veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge, including the city's main streets and port. Operations along a railroad stretching from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City were stopped, after having just reopened due to Hurricane Hilda.|$|E

5|$|Lenin's Bolshevik {{government}} initially shared {{power with}} the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, elected soviets, and a multi-party Constituent Assembly, although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a treaty with the Central Powers and promoted world revolution through the Communist International. Opponents were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned <b>in</b> <b>concentration</b> camps. His administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Responding to wartime devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the market-orientated New Economic Policy. Several non-Russian nations secured independence after 1917, but three re-united with Russia through {{the formation of the}} Soviet Union in 1922. In increasingly poor health, Lenin expressed opposition to the growing power of his successor, Joseph Stalin, before dying at his dacha in Gorki.|$|E

40|$|The {{isolated}} {{vas deferens}} of the guinea-pig contracted when stimulated transmurally with parallel wire electrodes. These contractions persisted <b>in</b> <b>concentrations</b> of hexamethonium, pentolinium, nicotine and mecamylamine {{which at the}} same time abolished the responses to hypogastric nerve stimulation. Procaine and lignocaine <b>in</b> local anaesthetic <b>concentrations</b> abolished the responses to transmural stimulation but potentiated the contractions produced by added noradrenaline. Guanethidine and bretylium <b>in</b> <b>concentrations</b> specific for adrenergic neurone blockade abolished the contractions due to transmural stimulation without impairing the responses of the muscle to added noradrenaline or acetylcholine. <b>In</b> contrast, high <b>concentrations</b> of the adrenergic-blocking agents phentolamine and dihydroergotamine were needed to block the contractions due to transmural stimulation; these concentrations also blocked the response to added noradrenaline but simultaneously reduced the responses to added acetylcholine or potassium chloride. Preparations from guinea-pigs previously treated with reserpine at first responded normally to transmural stimulation; thereafter the contractions diminished progressively but were never abolished. Hyoscine and atropine produced a small decrease in the response to transmural stimulation when present <b>in</b> <b>concentrations</b> up to 1 × 10 - 5 and a larger decrease only <b>in</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 1 × 10 - 4 or greater. Hemicholinium produced a small decrease of the contractions due to transmural stimulation <b>in</b> <b>concentrations</b> up to 1 × 10 - 4; concentrations of 5 × 10 - 4 present for 1 hr produced only a slightly greater reduction in response. These experiments show that when the guinea-pig vas deferens is removed without the hypogastric nerve and stimulated transmurally by the method described, contractions are produced mainly by excitation of postganglionic adrenergic nerves...|$|R
