40|$|This study {{examined}} the frequency of E-cadherin expression in endometrial biopsy or hysterectomy specimens from patients diagnosed with endometrial adeno-carcinoma and in normal endometrial tissue specimens. E-cadherin expression was detected by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody to E-cadherin. Specimens were classified as positive when ≥ 5 % of the tumour cells showed staining for E-cadherin, irrespective of the pattern of staining. Twenty-three <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and nine non-endometrioid (four papillary serous and five clear cell) carcinomas were studied, along with 10 normal endometrial tissue specimens as controls. E-cadherin expression was significantly less frequent in non-endometrioid <b>carcinomas</b> compared with <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and controls. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the frequency of E-cadherin expression between <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and controls. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that uterine non-endometrioid (papillary serous and clear cell) carcinomas were less likely to express E-cadherin compared with <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and normal endometrial tissue. This may help to explain the more aggressive behaviour of non-endometrioid carcinomas...|$|R

Recently, it has been observed that tumor-associated macrophages stimulate angiogenesis and promote cancer dissemination. Tumor macrophages (CD 163), microvessel density (CD 31), and hypoxia inducible factor 1 α subunit (HIF 1 A) were investigated in 64 primary <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with (50 cases) and without (14 cases) myometrial invasion {{as well as in the}} corresponding regional lymph nodes metastases of 20 of the myoinvasive tumors. <b>Endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with myometrial invasion showed higher number of CD 163 -tumor macrophages and greater microvessel density than <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> without myometrial invasion (P= 0. 000 and P= 0. 000, respectively). In carcinomas confined to the corpus uteri (stage I), expression of HIF 1 A was associated with deep myoinvasion (stage IC) (P= 0. 006). There was a significant relationship between microvessel density and CD 163 -macrophages both in the myoinvasive and nonmyoinvasive tumors. On the other hand, high-grade <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> had more macrophage infiltrates and microvessels than low-grade tumors (P= 0. 03 and P= 0. 07). Also, there was a positive correlation between CD 163 -macrophages and microvessel density in the primary tumors and their corresponding regional lymph node metastases. These findings link increased microvessel proliferation to stromal macrophage infiltrate and suggest that enhanced tumor angiogenesis, triggered by stromal macrophages, regulates the progression of <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The identical stroma microenvironment found in the primary and the corresponding metastatic tumor suggests that tumor stroma response is determined by the intrinsic biology of the tumor...|$|R

Four serous and two clear cell carcinomas were also examined. In glandular cells, CRBP- 1 positivity was mainly cytoplasmic and rarely in the nuclei. CRBP- 1 immunodetection was weakly positive in proliferative and low and focal in secretory endometrium and higher in atypical as compared to simple and complex hyperplasias. CRBP- 1 expression in G 1 <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> was similar to that in atypical hyperplasias. In the latter, the highest CRBP- 1 expression was observed in areas of squamous differentiation. Semiquantitative evaluation revealed a significant decrease of cytoplasmic CRBP- 1 immunoreactivity with the increase of tumor grade. Among G 3 <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 60 % were CRBP- 1 negative, whereas the remaining cases showed a very low and focal positivity. Serous carcinomas were also CRBP- 1 negative. When areas of different grading were present within the same tumor, less differentiated areas retained a lower CRBP- 1 immunoreaction. The progressive decrease of CRBP- 1 paralleled that of ER and PR immunodetection. RT-PCR in eight <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> suggested a decrease of CRBP- 1 with the increase of tumor grade also at transcriptional level. Our results indicate that CRBP- 1 immunodetection may constitute an additional tool for histological grading of endometrial carcinoma.

Microsatellite instability is another important genetic event {{in this type of}} tumor. In contrast, p 53 mutations or Her 2 /neu overexpression are more frequent in non-endometrioid tumors. On the other hand, {{it is possible that the}} clear cell type may arise from a unique pathway which appears similar to the ovarian clear cell carcinoma. K-ras mutations are detected in approximately 15 %– 30 % of <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> are unrelated to the existence of endometrial hyperplasia. A β-catenin mutation was detected in about 20 % of <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> but is rare in serous carcinoma. Telomere shortening is another important type of genomic instability observed in endometrial cancer. Only non-endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors were significantly associated with critical telomere shortening in the adjacent morphologically normal epithelium. Lynch syndrome, which is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of cancer susceptibility and is characterized by a MSH 2 /MSH 6 protein complex deficiency, is associated with the development of non-endometrioid carcinomas. 1...|$|R
50|$|Endometrioid tumors {{account for}} {{approximately}} 20% of all ovarian cancers and are mostly malignant (endometroid carcinomas). They {{are made of}} tubular glands bearing a close resemblance to benign or malignant endometrium. 15-30% of <b>endometrioid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> occur in individuals with carcinoma of the endometrium, and these patients have a better prognosis. They appear similar to other surface epithelial-stromal tumors, with solid and cystic areas. 40% of these tumors are bilateral, when bilateral, metastases is often present.|$|R
