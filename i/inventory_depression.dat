40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the direct and indirect – mediated by job burnout – effects of job demands on mental and physical health problems. The Job Demands–Resources model was the theoretical framework of the study. Three job demands were taken into account – interpersonal conflicts at work, organizational constraints and workload. Indicators of mental and physical health problems included depression and physical symptoms, respectively. Material and Methods: Three hundred and sixteen Polish teachers from 8 schools participated in the study. The hypotheses were tested with the use of tools measuring job demands (Interpersonal Conflicts at Work, Organizational Constraints, Quantitative Workload), job burnout (the Oldenburg Burnout <b>Inventory),</b> <b>depression</b> (the Beck Hopelessness Scale), and physical symptoms (the Physical Symptoms Inventory). The regression analysis with bootstrapping, using the PROCESS macros of Hayes was applied. Results: The results support the hypotheses partially. The indirect effect and to some extent the direct effect of job demands turned out to be statistically important. The negative impact of 3 job demands on mental (hypothesis 1 – H 1) and physical (hypothesis 2 – H 2) health were mediated by the increasing job burnout. Only organizational constraints were directly associated with mental (and not physical) health. Conclusions: The results partially support the notion of the Job Demands-Resources model and provide further insight into processes leading to the low well-being of teachers in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alexithymia is a {{personality}} trait characterized by deficits in regulating, experiencing and verbalizing emotions {{and has been}} assumed {{to be associated with}} a tendency to express emotional arousal through somatization. Although such a tendency is often observed in patients with dizziness, the exact relationship of alexithymia to dizziness is not yet known. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine alexithymic characteristics in patients with dizziness and its relation to health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Sampling and Methods: We assessed 208 patients from an interdisciplinary center for vertigo and balance disorders for characteristics of alexithymia (20 -item Toronto Alexithymia Scale), HRQoL (Short-Form 12 Health Survey, SF- 12), dizziness (Dizziness Handicap <b>Inventory),</b> <b>depression</b> and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Hierarchical regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between alexithymia, dizziness and HRQoL. Results: We found that difficulties in identifying and describing feelings, two important factors of alexithymia, were significantly related to more severe symptoms of dizziness. More pronounced alexithymic characteristics were associated with lower HRQoL, especially in the mental dimension of the SF- 12. The results remained significant after controlling for possibly confounding variables such as socioeconomic status and depression. Conclusions: These findings contribute to a better understanding of affect regulation in patients with dizziness, which is important for the development of psychotherapeutic interventions suitable for alexithymic patients with dizziness...|$|E

40|$|Treatment of alcohol-dependent {{patients}} was primarily focused on inpatient settings {{in the past}} decades. The efficacy of these treatment programs has been evaluated in several studies and proven to be sufficient. However, {{with regard to the}} increasing costs in public healthcare systems, questions about alternative treatment strategies have been raised. Meanwhile, there is growing evidence that outpatient treatment might be comparably effective as inpatient treatment, at least for subgroups of alcohol dependents. On that background, the present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a high-structured outpatient treatment program in 103 alcohol-dependent patients. 74 patients (72 %) terminated the outpatient treatment regularly. At 6 months' follow-up, 95 % patients were successfully located and personally re-interviewed. Analyses revealed that 65 patients (64 %) were abstinent at the 6 -month follow-up evaluation and 37 patients (36 %) were judged to be non-abstinent. Pretreatment variables which were found to have a negative impact (non-abstinence) on the 6 -month outcome after treatment were a higher severity of alcohol dependence measured by a longer duration of alcohol dependence, a higher number of prior treatments and a stronger alcohol craving (measured by the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale). Further patients with a higher degree of psychopathology measured by the Beck Depression <b>Inventory</b> (<b>depression)</b> and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (anxiety) relapsed more often. In summary, results of this study indicate a favorable outcome of socially stable alcohol-dependent patients and patients with a lower degree of depression, anxiety and craving in an intensive outpatient rehabilitation program. ...|$|E

Methods: Data from the Cache County Study on Memory, Health and Aging were used to estimate the frequency of apathy in groups of elders defined by demographic, cognitive, and functional status and to examine the associations of apathy with impairments of cognition and day-to-day functioning. Results: Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Clinical apathy (Neuropsychiatric Inventory score ≥ 4) was found in 1. 4 % of individuals classified as cognitively normal, 3. 1 % of those with a mild cognitive syndrome, and 17. 3 % of those with dementia. Apathy status was associated with cognitive and functional impairments and higher levels of stress experienced by caregivers. Among participants with normal cognition, apathy was associated with worse performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Boston Naming and Animal Fluency tests, and the Trail Making Test-Part B. The association of apathy with cognitive impairment was independent of its association with Neuropsychiatric <b>Inventory</b> <b>depression.</b> Conclusions: In a cohort of community-based older adults, the frequency and severity of apathy is positively correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment.

40|$|Objective : We {{explored}} {{the extent to}} which changes in emotional states following exposure to images of idealized bodies predict unhealthy body change attitudes and behaviors in women and men, and whether particular psychological traits mediate these effects. Method : One hundred thirty-three women and 93 men were assessed for unhealthy attitudes and behaviors related to body weight and muscles using the Eating Disorder Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2), the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire, and the strategies to increase muscles subscale of the Body Change Inventory. Psychological traits assessed included body dissatisfaction (EDI- 2), internalization of the thin/athletic ideal (Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire- 3), body comparison (Body Comparison Scale), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem <b>Inventory),</b> <b>depression</b> (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and identity confusion (Self-Concept Clarity Scale). Participants were then exposed to photographs of thin female models and muscular male models, and visual analogue scales were used to measure changes in postexposure state body dissatisfaction, anger, anxiety, and depression. Results : Postexposure increases in state anger, anxiety, depression, and body dissatisfaction correlated with drive for thinness and disordered eating symptomatology in women, while postexposure increases in state body dissatisfaction correlated with muscle development in men. Analyses revealed that internalization and body comparison mediated these relationships, with trait body dissatisfaction, trait depression, self-esteem, and self-concept/identity confusion serving as mediators for women only.
