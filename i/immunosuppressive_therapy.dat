25|$|Chronic {{graft-versus-host disease}} may also develop after {{allogeneic}} transplant. It {{is the major}} source of late treatment-related complications, although it less often results in death. In addition to inflammation, chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of fibrosis, or scar tissue, similar to scleroderma; it may cause functional disability and require prolonged <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Decreasing {{doses of}} <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapy</b> then allows donor T-cells to {{eradicate}} the remaining recipient HSC and to induce the graft-versus-tumor effect. This effect is often accompanied by mild graft-versus-host disease, the appearance of which is often a surrogate marker {{for the emergence of}} the desirable graft versus tumor effect, and also serves as a signal to establish an appropriate dosage level for sustained treatment with low levels of immunosuppressive agents.|$|E

30|$|Knowledge {{of the use}} of {{immunosuppressive}} agents for i-CNVs is increasing with passing time. However, there are no clear guidelines on the use of these agents, nor on the choice of agents for managing i-CNVs. The exact mechanisms by which <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies</b> act on the CNV is not yet clear. Therefore, further studies that evaluate the efficacy of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies</b> (systemic and/or local) that highlight the choice of the agent, timing and number of injections, and outcome measures are necessary.|$|R
50|$|<b>Immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies,</b> {{encompassing}} corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate {{and more}} recently, rituximab, are {{the mainstay of}} therapy.

25|$|It was {{not until}} June 17, 1950, when a {{successful}} transplant could be performed on Ruth Tucker, a 44-year-old woman with polycystic kidney disease, at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, Illinois. Although the donated kidney was rejected ten months later because no <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapy</b> was available at the time—the development of effective antirejection drugs was years away—the intervening time gave Tucker's remaining kidney time to recover and she lived another five years.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is used {{alone or}} in {{combination}} with other <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapy</b> to prevent rejection following organ transplantation, and to treat an array of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, and other forms of vasculitis, autoimmune hepatitis, atopic dermatitis, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease), restrictive lung disease, and others. It is also an important therapy and steroid-sparing agent for inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|For {{women who}} are {{pregnant}} and already have MG, in a third of cases, they {{have been known to}} experience an exacerbation of their symptoms, and in those cases it usually occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy. Signs and symptoms in pregnant mothers tend to improve during the second and third trimesters. Complete remission can occur in some mothers. <b>Immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapy</b> should be maintained throughout pregnancy, as this reduces the chance of neonatal muscle weakness, and controls the mother's myasthenia.|$|E
40|$|This review first {{addresses}} several {{general aspects}} of the immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis. Next, two approved immunomodulatory treatments, interferon-beta and copolymer- 1 (glatiramer acetate), are reviewed in more detail.

50|$|Other {{adverse effects}} include leucopenia, {{as well as}} an {{increased}} risk for severe infections and malignancies typical of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies.</b> Neurological side effects like aseptic meningitis and encephalopathy have been observed.

40|$|Introduction. Pneumocystis {{pneumonia}} (PCP) {{is rising}} in the non-HIV population and associates with higher morbidity and mortality. The aggressive immunosuppressive regimens, {{as well as the}} lack of stablished guidelines for chemoprophylaxis, are likely contributors to this increased incidence. Herein, we have explored the underlying conditions, <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies,</b> and clinical outcomes of PCP in HIV-negative patients. Methods. Retrospective analysis of PCP in HIV-negative patients at Mayo Clinic from 2006 – 2010. The underlying condition, <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies,</b> coinfection, and clinical course were determined. PCP diagnosis required symptoms of pneumonia and identification of the organisms by visualization or by a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. A total of 128 cases of PCP were identified during the study period. Hematological malignancies were the predisposing condition for 50 % of the patients. While 87 % had received corticosteroids or other <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies</b> for > 4 weeks prior to the diagnosis, only 7 were receiving PCP prophylaxis. Up to 43 % of patients were not on daily steroids. Sixty-seven patients needed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 53 received mechanical ventilation. The mortality for those patients requiring ICU was 40 %. Conclusions. PCP diagnosis in the HIV-negative population requires a high level of suspicion even if patients are not receiving daily corticosteroids. Mortality remains high despite adequate treatment...|$|R
2500|$|A {{study from}} Mayo Clinic did show that long term {{treatment}} with {{omega-3 fatty acids}} results in reduction of progression to kidney failure, without, however, reducing proteinuria in a subset of patients with high risk of worsening kidney function. [...] However, these results have not been reproduced by other study groups and in two subsequent meta-analyses.

50|$|Relapses are common. Relapse {{following}} ATG/ciclosporin use {{can sometimes}} be treated with a repeated course of therapy. In addition, 10-15% of severe aplastic anemia cases evolve into MDS and leukemia.

40|$|The {{responsiveness}} of AA to immunosuppression {{remains the}} best evidence for an underlying immune pathophysiology. Majority of patients of AA show hematologic response after T-cell depletion with antithymocyte globulins (ATG). However, not all patients of AA show response to <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies.</b> Failure to respond to immunosuppression has been interpreted as either due to an alternative pathophysiologic mechanism operating in these nonresponder patients or due to immunological mechanisms that are not susceptible to current <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies.</b> It has been well-documented in experimental studies that removal of lymphocytes from AA marrows improved colony numbers in tissue culture and their addition to normal marrow inhibited hematopoiesis in vitro. These effector cells are activated cytotoxic T-cells expressing Th 1 cytokines especially gamma interferon. Why T-cells are activated in AA remains unclear. 2 HLA-DR 2 is overexpressed among patients...|$|R

30|$|There was no {{difference}} in immunosuppressive regimen between patients developing or not infections after HT. However, the high rate of infections in our cohort was also a direct consequence of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>therapies.</b> In the current era of HT, those results enlighten the need of personalized immunosuppression, adjusted on patient’s risk factors for acute rejection and early infections [36, 37].|$|R
