40|$|It is {{estimated}} that more than 3 million Australian adults and children are obese. Obesity has various negative health outcomes, and an estimated annual economic cost of $ 58 billion. In an attempt to promote healthier food choices at fast-food restaurants, policy makers have implemented point-of-purchase labelling, in which fast-food restaurants are required to present the energy content of food numerically in <b>kilojoules</b> on menu boards. However, research investigating the effects of point-of-purchase menu labelling in {{reducing the amount of}} <b>kilojoules</b> consumers order have found no efficacy. One reason for the lack of efficacy {{may be due to the}} way in which individuals process information. Menu labelling in the form of <b>kilojoules</b> requires an individual to engage in a series of cognitively effortful calculations, they must have the knowledge of their daily energy requirements, how many <b>kilojoules</b> they have consumed, are about to consume, and are likely to consume later. Researchers have investigated more intuitive ways in which to present the energy content of food on menus. A small number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of supplementing numeric <b>kilojoules</b> information with more intuitive menu labelling, such as physical activity (PA) based menu labels, in which energy content of food is converted to the amount of time in minutes an average adult would need to walk in order to burn off a food item. However, more research in this area is needed to evaluate the efficacy of PA based menu labels in reducing the amount of <b>kilojoules</b> ordered by consumers. The aim of the present study is to add to the literature, and address several limitations of previous research. The study is an online survey in which participants are randomly assigned to one of four mock fast-food restaurant menus. The main question being, can alternative menu labelling such as PA based labelling prompt consumers to order fewer <b>kilojoules</b> than the current menu labelling systems?Winner of Best Honours Presentation - Faculty of Science, Health, Education and Engineering...|$|R

5000|$|After {{the success}} of Cyclops in beam smoothing, {{the next step was}} to further {{increase}} the energy and power in the resulting beams. Argus used a series of five groups of amplifiers and spatial filters arranged along the beamlines, each one boosting power until it reached a total of about 1 <b>kilojoule</b> and 1-2 terawatts per beam. These intensities would have been impossible to achieve without the use of spatial filtering. Argus was designed primarily to characterize large laser beamlines and laser-target interactions, there was no attempt to actually achieve the fusion ignition state in the device as this was understood to be impossible at the energies Argus was capable of delivering. Argus however, was used to further explore higher yields of the so-called [...] "exploding pusher" [...] type targets and to develop x-ray diagnostic cameras to view the hot plasma in such targets, a technique crucial to characterization of target performance on later ICF lasers.|$|E

Whole grains should be consumed daily as they are high in fiber and low in saturated fats.

50|$|In other {{scientific}} contexts, {{the term}} calorie almost always {{refers to the}} small calorie. Even {{though it is not}} an SI unit, it is still used in chemistry. For example, the energy released in a chemical reaction per mole of reagent is occasionally expressed in kilocalories per mole. Typically, this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions, especially in aqueous solution: a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution, with concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter weighing 1 kg), will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent, and these quantities (volume, molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole. It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy, such as enthalpy of formation and the size of activation barriers. However, its use is being superseded by the SI unit, the joule, and multiples thereof such as the <b>kilojoule.</b>|$|E
5000|$|LLNL was, in particular, {{very well}} funded {{and started a}} major laser fusion {{development}} program. Their Janus laser started operation in 1974, and validated the approach of using Nd:glass lasers to generate very high power devices. Focusing problems were explored in the Long path laser and Cyclops laser, {{which led to the}} larger Argus laser. None of these were intended to be practical ICF devices, but each one advanced {{the state of the art}} to the point where there was some confidence the basic approach was valid. At the time it was believed that making a much larger device of the Cyclops type could both compress and heat the ICF targets, leading to ignition in the [...] "short term". This was a misconception based on extrapolation of the fusion yields seen from experiments utilizing the so-called [...] "exploding pusher" [...] type of fuel capsules. During the period spanning the years of the late '70s and early '80s the estimates for laser energy on target needed to achieve ignition doubled almost yearly as the various plasma instabilities and laser-plasma energy coupling loss modes were gradually understood. The realization that the simple exploding pusher target designs and mere few <b>kilojoule</b> (kJ) laser irradiation intensities would never scale to high gain fusion yields led to the effort to increase laser energies to the 100 kJ level in the UV and to the production of advanced ablator and cryogenic DT ice target designs.|$|E
