The novel alternates between these storylines, and also <b>jumps</b> <b>back</b> and forth from 1961 to 1996, with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in Trujillo's regime.|$|E
5|$|In the teaser, a couple, the Van De Kamps (Adam Nelson and Shannon Hile), adopt Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) infant son, William (James and Travis Riker). The episode then <b>jumps</b> <b>back</b> a week. Scully takes William {{out of her}} {{car while}} an unknown man (Chris Owens) watches them. Later, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) is {{attacked}} in the X-Files office by the same man. After a struggle, Doggett subdues him. His face is revealed to be horribly scarred.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} medias res with Walker, Adams, and Lugo flying in a {{helicopter}} past the skyscrapers of Dubai, shooting down several pursuing helicopters until a sudden sandstorm forms, causing one of the pursuers to spin {{out of control and}} crash into the trio.

After coming across refugees being rounded up by the 33rd and engaging in a firefight, Walker elects to disobey orders and find Konrad.|$|E

5|$|With {{the ship}} sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack {{encourage}} her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and <b>jumps</b> <b>back</b> on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He <b>jumps</b> <b>back</b> in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and <b>jumps</b> <b>back</b> to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

[...] James Dinh of MTV noted that the song [...] "features an uplifting country/pop melody and a big chorus" [...] and it talks about [...] "the wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past." [...] Priya Elan of The Guardian believed that [...] "Mine" [...] depicts [...] "a stop-start relationship between a normal guy and girl". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly interpreted the song's message to be about [...] "young love blossoming — in this specific case, young college love." ...|$|E
500|$|Described by the {{developers}} {{as a modern}} version of Gauntlet, The Return of the King is a hack and slash action game played from a third-person perspective. The game {{is very similar to}} its [...] in basic gameplay. Each character has a quick attack which does minimal damage and can be easily blocked, and a fierce attack, which does more damage, but is slower and leaves the player vulnerable to attack. Only fierce attacks can break enemy shields. Each character also has a ranged attack, a [...] "killing move" [...] (which can be used to instantly kill downed enemies), a parry (which can deflect enemy attacks), a knock back (which pushes nearby enemies away), a jump back (in which the player character <b>jumps</b> <b>back</b> away from the enemy), a devastating attack (a charged fierce attack) and a special ability. Playable characters in the console and PC versions are Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo and Sam, with Faramir, Pippin and Merry available as unlockable characters. Playable characters in the GBA version are Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo, Gandalf, and Éowyn, with Gollum and Sam available as unlockable characters.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{all three}} {{characters}} have different weapons and combos, their basic fighting style is the same. Each character has a quick attack which does minimal damage {{and can be}} easily blocked, and a fierce attack, which does more damage, but is slower and leaves the player vulnerable to attack. Only fierce attacks can break enemy shields. Each character also has a ranged attack, a [...] "killing move" [...] (which {{can be used to}} instantly kill downed enemies), a parry (which can deflect enemy attacks), a knock back (which pushes nearby enemies away), a jump back (in which the player character <b>jumps</b> <b>back</b> away from the enemy) and a devastating attack (a charged fierce attack). Combos {{are an important part of}} combat, with each character having access to a unique list of combos, which are achieved by stringing specific button presses together. Additionally, each character is more skilled at a particular type of combat; Aragorn is the strongest and most balanced character, Legolas is better at ranged combat, and Gimli has strong melee and ranged attacks.|$|E

'If I'd dreamed it was any such storm as this, I should never have let you go out in it in the world. It wasn't at all necessary to have the flowers. I could have got on perfectly well, and I believe NOW the table would look better without them. The chrysanthemums would have been quite enough; and I know you've taken more cold. I could tell it by your voice {{as soon as you}} spoke; and just as quick as they're gone to-night I'm going to have you bathe your feet in mustard and hot water, and take eight of aconite, and go straight to bed. And I don't want you to eat very much at dinner, dear, and you must be sure not to drink any coffee, or the aconite won't be of the least use.' She turns and encounters her husband, who enters through the portiere, his face pale, his eyes wild, his white necktie pulled out of knot, and his shirt front rumpled.
