Nothing perhaps brings this truth home to the feelings more than the city of Rome, {{not so much in}} respect to the impression made at the moment when it is first seen and looked at as a whole, for then the imagination may be invigorated, and the mind's eye quickened to perceive as much as that of the imagination; but when particular spots or objects are sought out, disappointment is, I believe, invariably <b>felt.</b> <b>Ability</b> to recover from this disappointment will exist in proportion to knowledge, {{and the power of the}} mind to reconstruct out of fragments and parts, and to make details in the present subservient to more adequate comprehension of the past.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an econometric {{analysis}} of the most important determinants of Swedish households' choice to pay a price premium for "green" electricity. We draw on recent developments in the literature on integrating norm-motivated behavior into neoclassical consumer theory, and assume that individuals have a preference for keeping a self-image as a morally responsible person. Consumer behavior in the "green market place" will then be heavily determined by how purchases of different goods affect this self-image. The analysis is based on postal survey responses from 655 Swedish households, which are analyzed within a binary choice econometric framework. The results indicate that the impact of choosing "green" on the household budget largely influences the choice between "green" and "brown" electricity, as does the degree of perceived personal responsibility for the issue and the <b>felt</b> <b>ability</b> to affect the outcome in a positive way. We find limited support for the notion that perceptions about others' behavior in general affect individual moral norms and ultimately expressed behavior, but this is also complemented by the influence of explicit social influence. The difficulty in observing others' purchases makes it however difficult to distinguish between social and moral norms in the case of "green" electricity.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to provide an econometric {{analysis}} of the most important determinants of Swedish households' (self-reported) willingness to accept a price premium for "green" electricity. Methodologically, we draw heavily on recent developments in the literature on integrating norm-motivated behavior into neoclassical consumer theory, and assume that individuals have a preference for keeping a self-image as a responsible person. Consumer behavior in the "green market place" will then be heavily determined by how purchases of different goods affect this self-image. The analysis is based on postal survey responses from 655 Swedish households in four different municipalities, which are analyzed within a binary choice econometric framework. The results indicate that the impact of choosing "green" on the household budget largely influences the willingness to contribute to "green" electricity schemes, as do the degree of perceived personal responsibility for the issue and the <b>felt</b> <b>ability</b> to affect the outcome in a positive way. We find only limited support for the idea that perception about others' behavior affect individual moral norms and ultimately behavior: stronger support is rather found for the hypothesis that the presence of a prescriptive social norm influences the willingness to pay for "green" electricity. The difficulty in observing others' purchases makes it however particularly difficult to distinguish between social and moral norms in the case of "green" electricity.

50|$|The Mothership Core {{is a slow}} moving, flying {{unit that}} has three abilities. Photon Overcharge (previously known as Purify) allows a {{targeted}} Nexus to gain a single-target, long-range energy attack, similar to the Photon Cannon. Mass Recall warps Protoss units around Mothership Core, and the Core itself, to any targeted Nexus. Finally, Time Warp slows down enemy ground units' movement and refire rate in an area. Once a Protoss building called Fleet Beacon is constructed, the Mothership Core can transform into the Mothership from Wings, trading in its Photon Overcharge for the mass cloaking field.

The Nova documentary on Genie, however, states the rejection of Butler came partially on the hospital's recommendation; there is evidence many hospital authorities, including Hansen, <b>felt</b> Butler's <b>ability</b> to care for Genie was inadequate, and hospital policy forbade its staff members from becoming foster parents of its patients.

5000|$|Social {{emotions}} are emotions that {{depend upon the}} thoughts, feelings or actions of other people, [...] "as experienced, recalled, anticipated or imagined at first hand". Examples are embarrassment, guilt, shame, jealousy, envy, empathy, and pride. In contrast, basic emotions such as happiness and sadness only require the awareness of one's own physical state. Therefore, the development of social emotions is tightly linked {{with the development of}} social cognition, the ability to imagine other people's mental states, which generally develops in adolescence. Studies have found that children as young as 2 to 3 years of age can express emotions resembling guilt and remorse.

40|$|The {{first study}} (Aim 1) {{documented}} the visit process and care delivery {{in relation to}} the IMAT intervention. This study documented variation in the time patients spend receiving various clinic services, as well as variation in the types of services providers engage in. Results from this research aim also show variation in the degree to which patients received integrated care. The second study (Aim 2) examined the impact participation in the IMAT intervention had on patient attendance at the methadone clinic. Results indicate that participation in IMAT had a positive effect on patient attendance. The third study (Aim 3) examined patient and provider perceptions of the IMAT intervention to better understand factors that might have influenced their participation. Providers <b>felt</b> the <b>ability</b> of the intervention to incorporate patient needs, fit into clinic procedures, and evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention had a positive influence on implementation effectiveness. Strong positive influences included adaptability, and perceptions of the advantage of implementing IMAT compared to alternative solutions. Resources dedicated to intervention such as physical space and time presented a challenge to implementation effectiveness. Patients <b>felt</b> the <b>ability</b> to receive anti-retroviral medication in the clinic made it easier for them to receive care. Patients identified challenges to implementation, such as clinic resources, consistent access to nutrition, and concerns about stigma from their fellow patients. Patients enrolled in IMAT felt positively about the program overall, indicating that IMAT improved care receipt, and streamlined the care process. Implementing HIV care and treatment and methadone treatment concurrently in health care settings with marginal resources poses a challenge. Access and availability of treatment is an important issue when considering the link between injection drug use and HIV, especially for those who are HIV positive. While it is possible to implement this intervention in this setting attention should be placed on issues of care retention and attendance. This dissertation seeks to better understand these issues outside of a western care context, with the hopes of documenting core components...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a night hospital nursing service for elderly people suffering from dementia; in particular, to establish the appropriateness of night support for this group and their carers. The study developed as a result of previous work that demonstrated that some carers requested "inpatient" admission for their relative/friend because of the stress of providing support and supervision at night. The research methods involved an evaluative structure - process - outcome, quality assurance and case study approach. An operational policy for the service was drawn up, as were nursing standards (process). The service was evaluated over a two year period. Patient outcomes were measured using a visual analogue scale at intervals over six months to identify behavioural changes. Similarly, carers' feelings of anxiety and coping ability relating to their caring role were measured. Changes in patient behaviour and carer anxiety and <b>felt</b> <b>ability</b> to cope were analysed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test. Carers were interviewed to elicit the effects their relatives' attendance at CREST had on their day to day lives. Changes in the use of community care services as a result of CREST were also identified. The sample consisted of 38 patients and their informal carers. Nursing activity was observed using non-participant observation to establish both the type of activity and peak work load periods. The results demonstrate that CREST had a positive outcome in terms of supporting patients' carers and that patients' behaviour did not change significantly while attending the night hospital. This latter result has been interpreted as a positive outcome in that people suffering from dementia can be expected to deteriorate over time. In conclusion it is anticipated that the results of this study have significance for planning nursing services for the care group involved and should assist in identifying the number and grade of staff needed to deliver optimum care at night to elderly people with dementia. Recommendations for changes in the operational policy have been made which will assist managers in planning new services. The research suggests that new nursing services for this group in the health authority will be more closely related to the individual needs of patients and their carers than has been achieved hitherto. This strategy should lead to fewer patients needing long term in-patient care...|$|R

One area of significance that has emerged for patients living in different types of staffed accommodation (forensic, psychiatric in-patient and community learning disability residences) has been {{the extent to which}} they are engaged in activities by staff members. However, there has been little consideration of what is meant by the term engagement and whether staff from a range of mental health professional backgrounds construct it in the same way. Little attention has also been given to what staff feel affects their ability to engage patients within the context of a low secure inpatient unit for people with learning disabilities and complex needs. Grounded Theory was used to analyse the data from interviews with seven participants who work on such a unit.
