In January 2006, the Committee of Ministers on the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> {{recommended}} that the 1987 version needed “to be substantively revised and updated in order to reflect the developments which have occurred in penal policy, sentencing practice and the overall management of prisons in Europe”. Revisions {{can also be seen}} to reflect the expansion of Council of Europe membership: 15 member states in 1973, 21 in 1987, and 46 by 2005. A new version of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> was adopted in 2006, replacing all previous versions entirely. [...] The 2006 <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> contain a significantly expanded section on health care in the prison setting. For the first time, they refer specifically to the prison authorities' obligation to safeguard the health of all prisoners (rule 39) and the need for prison medical services to be organized in close relationship with the general public health administration (rule 40).|$|E

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> {{are based}} on the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. They are not legally binding for member states of the Council of Europe, but provide {{recognised}} standards on good principles and practices in the treatment of detainees and the management of detention facilities. One observer suggests that ‘almost all European countries aim to apply these standards but it is unlikely that a single one has succeeded in applying them fully.’ In 2006 the Quaker Council for European Affairs produced a gender critique of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> as part of its Women in Prison Project. In recent years the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> have been reported to have formed the basis for complaints against penal services and institutions in Norway and Ireland, and have set officially acknowledged standards for prison reform in Armenia. There are 108 rules in nine parts. Part I (rules 1 to 13) sets out basic principles as well as the scope and application. Part II (rules 14 to 38) covers conditions of imprisonment, including: nutrition, hygiene, access to legal advice, education, contact with the outside world, freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Part III deals with health and health care in prisons. Part IV deals with order and security; Part V Management and staff; Part VI Inspection and monitoring; Part VII Untried prisoners; Part VIII Sentenced prisoners; and Part IX the requirements for updating the Rules.|$|E

The goal of the changes is obvious and contrary to the rule # 8 of the <b>European</b> <b>prison</b> <b>rules,</b> which stipulates that “although obtaining financial profit from {{the operation of the}} enterprises in the correctional facilities can be useful {{from the point of view}} of enhancing standards and quality and expediency of the professional training, the interests of the prisoners should not be subject to this goal”.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{deprivation}} of liberty often {{to a certain degree}} forms an obstacle to the enjoyment of other rights too, this does not as such mean that authorities are permitted also to deny those rights to prisoners. Several international soft law instruments confirm this. Principle 5 of the United Nations Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners (1990) states: ‘Except for those limitations that are demonstrably necessitated by the fact of incarceration, all prisoners shall retain the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and United Nations covenants’. Moreover, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (1957) affirms in Rule 57 that ‘the prison system shall not, except as incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, aggravate the suffering inherent in such a situation’. The principle that prisoners retain all rights apart from the right to liberty can also be found in several regional soft law instruments. For example, Rule 2 of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> 2006 states: ‘Persons deprived of their liberty retain all rights that are not lawfully taken away by the decision sentencing them or remanding them in custody’. More specific is Principle VIII of the recently approved Principles and Best Practices on the Protection of Persons Deprived of Liberty in the Americas (2008) 8 : ‘Persons deprived of liberty shall enjoy the same rights recognized to every other person by domestic law and international human rights law, except for those rights which exercise is temporarily limited or restricted by law and for reasons inherent to their condition as persons deprived of liberty’. And in the Kampala Declaration on Prison Conditions in Africa (1996) the second Recommendation on Prison Conditions declares ‘that prisoners should retain all rights which are not expressly taken away by the fact of their detention’. Furthermore, those regional instruments demand, in various formulations, that the suffering inherent in imprisonment shall not be aggravated by the regime in prison. Rule 5 of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> 2006 even specifies: ‘Life in prison shall approximate as closely as possible the positive aspects of life in the community’. In the case of FDRE government, the 1995 constitution guarantees that detained persons shall be treated with due respect to their dignity. Moreover, the federal prison Commission was established pursuant to Proclamation No. 365 / 2003, to implement judicial decisions and to undertake the functions of the custody, reformation and rehabilitation of prisoners as part of the contribution to crime prevention. Ethiopia also domesticated standards for the treatment of prisoners...|$|E
40|$|Unconditional Imprisonment Kateřina Hádková 1 Resumé Despite {{the efforts}} for a wider use of {{alternative}} forms of punishment, the sentence of unconditional imprisonment still remains the main form of sanction used in criminal law and can be imposed for any type of crime. However, it {{should be treated as}} the ultima ratio form of punishment, because it is the strictest sanction interfering heavily with the fundamental rights and freedoms of an individual. The topic of unconditional imprisonment is very extensive and is often discussed even amongst the general public. The aim of this paper was to report on the approach of the Czech legal system to the unconditional imprisonment, especially concerning its realization in prisons. The paper is divided into three parts of a similar scope - the theoretical background, sentencing and the realization of imprisonment including a practical excursion to Rapotice prison. The first part of the paper consisting of three chapters starts with introduction to the historical background beginning with the ancient times, through the age of Enlightenment and the roots of modern penitentiary systems ending with international cooperation in the field and implementation of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules.</b> The next two chapters focus on the concept, purpose and objectives of imprisonment [...] ...|$|E

Part One focuses on the most important principles of imposing punishments, such as principle of legality, principle of subsidiarity, etc. Part Two analyzes the role of unconditional imprisonment in the sentencing structure. Part Three describes duration of unconditional imprisonment and Part Four reviews two types of extraordinary sentences. Chapter Three concentrates on execution of unconditional imprisonment.

40|$|In Europe, the {{old adage}} that {{individuals}} are sent to prison as punishment rather than for punishment has now been supplemented by a further maxim: that prisoners retain all civil rights other than those that are incompatible with the very fact of loss of liberty. Prisoners retain their human rights, and the scope of these rights is increasing. For example, a plethora of decisions and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights has helped spell out the content of rights relating to communication {{with the outside world}} and exercise of the franchise. In Europe at least, prisons are changing in how the legal system engages with the treatment of prisoners. This text examines one particular aspect of this protection: the prohibition of ill-treatment in prison. It focuses upon what this prohibition entails, and the emergence of positive obligations and new expectations in respect of the responsibilities of prison services towards those entrusted to its care. It also examines the development of new obligations in respect of combating the impunity of those who use ill-treatment in places of detention. It seeks to provide a basic awareness of European standards, both in terms of legal obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and in respect of standard-setting by allied bodies (in particular, by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), but also by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe). It also highlights examples of good practice in domestic systems that may be worthy of emulation elsewhere. Working in prisons is not without significant challenge. The intention is that this text will help those concerned with this area of public provision achieve a more humane and open service. In this regard, it seeks to help realisation of Rule 81 (4) of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec. R(2006) 2 on the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules.</b> This provides that “The training of all staff shall include instruction in the international and regional human rights instruments and standards, especially by ECHR and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT Convention), {{as well as in the}} application of the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules.</b> ” This text is designed for practitioners. It provides a guide to these legal instruments and standards in an accessible way. It follows upon a multilateral meeting held in Strasbourg in spring 2015 which helped bring together management and leadership from prison services from across Europe to address issues of common concern. It was clear from the discussions during the two days of the meeting that not only do many countries face the same set of problems, but also that “good practice” does exist across Europe, and that discussion not only of these challenges but also of possible solutions can be of real assistance. Following the meeting, representatives were asked to highlight further instances of “good practice” in their countries that could be of use elsewhere across Europe. Many good ideas were highlighted.

40|$|A perverse side-effect of our {{interconnected}} {{world is}} that also crime crosses more and more borders. As a result, judicial cooperation in criminal matters is crucial before and after a criminal sentence. The increased global connectivity also gave rise to new paradigms in social sciences. As such, the paradigm of cosmopolitanism {{has been researched extensively}} in social sciences but has been largely neglected in criminology. By analyzing case law, European detention norms and EU legal instruments the submission critically evaluates cosmopolitanism in the area of EU judicial cooperation in criminal matters and more specifically to the transfer of prisoners. Cosmopolitanism is perfectly reflected in the mutual recognition principle as the cornerstone to develop the EU area of freedom, security and justice, based on notions of equivalence and trust. This principle is justified because every member state signed the European Convention of Human Rights and is a party of the EU Charter on Human Rights. On the other hand, reality revealed that mutual recognition is not absolute and mutual trust cannot be blind. An IRCP study, published in 2011, highlighted the various and often detrimental material prison conditions in different member states. These variances undermine the assumed mutual trust between member states although European detention norms - such as the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> and CPT reports’ already exist. These norms aren’t legally binding and are still considered as “soft law”, simultaneously they gain importance due to increased reference in the ECtHR judgments. The cosmopolitan outlook by the member states related to the transfer of prisoners is in this submission highlighted as being both problematic and promising. Hereby it appears as if the EU rhetoric being a “unity in diversity”, by applying mutual recognition, is dominantly used to accommodate member states purposes rather than giving a central role to the individual...|$|E
40|$|THE MISSING LINK BETWEEN TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP PERSPECTIVES ON NORMALIZATION “Life {{in prison}} shall {{approximate}} {{as closely as}} possible the positive aspects of life in the community. ” With this reaffirmation of the normalization principle, the <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> of 2006 aimed at reducing the negative consequences of imprisonment, recognizing the human rights of prisoners and promoting their reintegration. Thus, the idea of normalization has not only been included in European regulations, but also in many national penal legislations. However, whereas reducing negative consequences, ensuring the human rights of prisoners and promoting their reintegration might seem valuable objectives from a “topdown” policy perspective, the compatibility of these objectives is less obvious when viewed from the perspective of prisoners or a “bottom-up” perspective. Just one example of this apparent incompatibility is that refusing to participate in the system of conditional release (for which conditions should be met both before and after release) may increase prisoners’ autonomy within prison, hence reducing the negative consequences of the loss of liberty; yet, it contrasts with preparing the reintegration as is expected within the prison system. This raises questions {{about the extent to which}} the normalization principle as conceived by policymakers can truly reduce the harm caused by detention whilst also serving other purposes such as reintegration and rehabilitation. This presentation seeks to identify the extent to which the top-down and the bottom-up approaches of the normalization principle could be made compatible in practice and at which points they counteract with each other. To this end, we will first pay attention to the normalization principle as defined and used by European and national policies; then discuss the normalization principle from the perspective of prisoners, as deduced from observations and interviews. This should contribute to a more comprehensive and practically feasible view of the normalization principle. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, we could witness the {{increasing}} activity of Europe in setting detention norms and standards. Yet, in criminological research, {{little is known}} about the policy networks and actors guiding the role of Europe as a penal actor. During the twentieth-century Westphalian world, the nation state had a quasi-monopoly over rule making. On the contrary, contemporary rule making increasingly takes place in a transnational area bringing together a diverse set of actors which all have an interest in this process. As a result, transnational networks are a crucial part of the contemporary policy making process, and especially for very complex challenges such as the area of detention. The challenge is therefore to disentangle this policy-making web in order to gain increased insights and to shed light on these norm and standard setting process which shape the European penal identity. Policy networks appear in different shapes with varying origins, goals, interests, compositions, working methods, etc. But not only does the structure of these networks play a crucial role, policy outcomes are also shaped by strategically calculating subjects. As a result, both agents and structure shape policy outcomes because it are the agents who interpret and negotiate constraints or opportunities within a structured context: The specific network and the broader political institution. In addition, these networks appear in formal and informal settings, posing serious challenges for the systematic study of policy developments. Drawing from an extensive literature review, an in-depth analyses of official documentation and the preliminary results of expert interviews, the aim of this presentation is twofold. Firstly, a methodological reflection will be made by identifying and sharing experiences related to the challenges and obstacles in conducting expert interviews at a European level. Secondly, the policy-making processes of two key policy outcomes related to detention conditions: The <b>European</b> <b>Prison</b> <b>Rules</b> (CoE) and the Recast Reception Conditions Directive (EU) will be disentangled...|$|E
