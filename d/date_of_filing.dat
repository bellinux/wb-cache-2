2500|$|Friedman {{and others}} have argued that delays in the {{approval}} process have cost lives. The thalidomide birth defects crisis led to passage of the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment, which required proof of efficacy in addition to safety for approval of new drugs [...] {{despite the fact that}} the thalidomide crisis was entirely a safety issue. Proving efficacy is much more expensive and time-consuming than proving safety. [...] By requiring proof of efficacy in addition to safety, the Kefauver Harris Amendment added considerable cost and delay to the drug approval process [...] which critics say may well have cost many more lives than it was said to save. Prior to passage of the Kefauver Harris Amendment, the average time from the filing of an investigational new drug application (IND) to approval was 7 months. By 1998, it took an average of 7.3 years from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>filing</b> to approval. Prior to the 1990s, the mean time for new drug approvals was shorter in Europe than in the United States, although that difference has since disappeared.|$|E
