25|$|As a {{first step}} towards realizing a Two Stage To Orbit (TSTO) fully {{re-usable}} launch vehicle, a series of technology demonstration missions have been conceived. For this purpose, a Winged Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) has been configured.

This was in contrast to the prevailing focus on two-dimensional nozzles in the Western press. Lyulka (later Lyulka-Saturn) also began studies of thrust-vectoring engines in 1985.

40|$|The {{unmanned}} {{space vehicle}} (USV) {{program has been}} undertaken by the Italian Center for Aerospace Research {{with the aim of}} developing <b>flying</b> <b>test</b> <b>beds</b> of next generation reentry launch vehicles. In this framework, the development of small demonstrators is also foreseen to validate technological and operational aspects of full-scale vehicles and missions. In this paper, a small-scale demonstrator of the sub-orbital re-entry test mission of the USV program is described. Both mission profile and objectives are very challenging in terms of demonstrator guidance, navigation and control. After a short description of the mission and demonstrator architectures, particular emphasis is given to the guidance and navigation analysis. To this end, mission objectives and reduced-scale system constaints are integrated and translated into innovative guidance solutions relying on optimization techniques. Then, performance of a commercial-off-the-shelf GPS-aided, miniature inertial navigation system over the proposed trajectories is evaluated by Monte Carlo analysis. Standalone inertial and GPS-aided inertial navigation performance is also compared considering GPS loss conditions due to antenna plasma effects...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{to improve the}} path tracking performance based on time shifted feed-forward signals is presented. It uses approximately linear closed-loop dynamics through feedback linearization of the ARTIS unmanned helicopter. The flight controller is currently in use to track nonlinear trajectories represented by piece-wise cubic splines. Feedforward signals shifted in time with varying and constant time-shifts are evaluated to improve the suboptimal tracking behavior. The problem is illustrated for a representative path {{and the process of}} determining the time shift is discussed. Having runtime performance advantages, the constant variant of time-shifted feedforward signals is chosen for onboard implementation. To validate the approach, it is implemented onboard our <b>flying</b> rotorcraft <b>test</b> <b>bed</b> and flight <b>test</b> results showing the improved tracking performance are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Building on {{the work}} {{originally}} done for the Enhanced Business Reporting consortium of the AICPA, this paper develops a <b>test</b> <b>bed</b> for innovation in business reporting. As with <b>flying</b> <b>test</b> <b>beds</b> in aviation, {{the object is to}} explore the impact of new technologies and techniques rather than to create a product intended for immediate implementation. The starting point of our analysis is that if the financial reporting system was being built from scratch today, it would look very different, taking into account fundamental changes in the two drivers of financial reporting: First, the dominance of market making by professional investors, which includes such intermediaries as pension and mutual funds, which is how most ordinary individuals interact with the market; Second, the reduction in the variable costs of disclosures to technology-enabled firms, while time taking a broader view of the cost of reporting to include the opportunity cost to the firm from faulty disclosures and the cost to professional investors of having to extract the data they need from statements that were not designed for their needs. Taken together, the consequence of these two changes is that a system being designed today has to rethink the entire process by which financial data held by the firm is translated into decision relevant information by users. This process takes place both within the firm and outside of it, with a handover of financial statements taking place at the boundary between the firm and its users. Given these changes it is time to ask whether the location of that handover boundary point is still appropriate: whether the firm should continue to aggregate and condense information extensively before releasing it, or whether sophisticated users would prefer to have access to more information in closer to its raw format so that they can manipulate and aggregate it as the...|$|R
