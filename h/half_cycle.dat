5|$|Akshaya Tritya is {{considered}} holy and supremely auspicious by Jains. It {{is believed that}} Rishabhanatha took his first ahara (alms) after becoming an ascetic on this day. Rishabhanatha, Jains believe, was the first monk of the present <b>half</b> <b>cycle</b> of time (avasarpini). Therefore, people {{did not know how}} to offer food (ahara) to monks. King Shreyansa of Hastinapur offered sugarcane juice (ikshu-rasa) to Rishabhanatha. Jains attach great importance to this day as it was only after one year that Rishabhanatha was offered food. The day is celebrated in the Jain tradition on the third day of the bright fortnight of the month Vaishaka (usually April).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a health monitoring method using measured hysteretic responses. Acceleration and infrequently measured displacement are integrated using a multirate Kalman filtering method to generate restoring force-displacement hysteresis loops. A linear/nonlinear regression analysis based two-step method is proposed to identify nonlinear system parameters. First, hysteresis loops {{are divided into}} loading/unloading <b>half</b> <b>cycles.</b> Multiple linear regression analysis is applied to separate linear and nonlinear <b>half</b> <b>cycles.</b> Preyielding stiffness and viscous damping coefficient are obtained in this step and used as known parameters in the second step. Then, nonlinear regression analysis is applied to identified nonlinear <b>half</b> <b>cycles</b> to yield nonlinear system parameters and two damage indicators: cumulative plastic deformation and residual deformation. These values {{are closely related to}} structural status and repair costs. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated using a simulated shear-type structure with different levels of added measurement noise and a suite of ground motions. The results show that the proposed SHM method effectively and accurately identifies physical system parameters with up to 10 % RMS added noise. The resulting damage indicators can robustly and clearly indicate structural condition over different earthquake event...|$|R

25|$|Regulators powered from AC power {{circuits}} can use silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) as {{the series}} device. Whenever the output voltage {{is below the}} desired value, the SCR is triggered, allowing electricity to flow into the load until the AC mains voltage passes through zero (ending the <b>half</b> <b>cycle).</b> SCR regulators have the advantages of being both very efficient and very simple, but {{because they can not}} terminate an ongoing <b>half</b> <b>cycle</b> of conduction, they are not capable of very accurate voltage regulation in response to rapidly changing loads. An alternative is the SCR shunt regulator which uses the regulator output as a trigger, both series and shunt designs are noisy, but powerful, as the device has a low on resistance.|$|E
25|$|In the {{electrical}} schematic to the right, a typical silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) based light dimmer dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is {{wired in series}} with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 will charge up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops {{at the end of}} the <b>half</b> <b>cycle,</b> ready for the circuit to start work on the next <b>half</b> <b>cycle.</b> This is an example of a Leading Edge Dimmer.|$|E

Operating frequencies of electronic ballasts are selected to avoid interference with infrared remote controls. Poor quality (or failing) electronic ballasts may have insufficient reservoir capacitance or have poor regulation, thereby producing considerable 100/120Hz modulation of the light.|$|E

It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 megavolts. Although it was used {{for a short period}} in 1929-30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a <b>half</b> <b>cycle</b> of the RF voltage.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the load}} is purely reactive, then the {{voltage and current}} are 90degrees out of phase. For two {{quarters}} of each cycle, the product of voltage and current is positive, but for the other two quarters, the product is negative, indicating that on average, exactly as much energy flows into the load as flows back out. [...] There is no net energy flow over each <b>half</b> <b>cycle.</b> In this case, only reactive power flows: There is no net transfer of energy to the load, however, electrical power does flow along the wires and returns by flowing in reverse along the same wires. During its travels both from the power source to the reactive load {{and back to the}} power source, this purely reactive power flow loses energy in the line resistance.|$|E
2500|$|Moving coil {{instruments}} {{can respond}} {{only to the}} average value of the current through them. [...] To measure alternating current, which changes up and down repeatedly, a rectifier is inserted in the circuit so that each negative <b>half</b> <b>cycle</b> is inverted; [...] {{the result is a}} varying and non-zero DC voltage whose maximum value will be half the AC peak to peak voltage, assuming a symmetrical waveform. [...] Since the rectified average value and the root-mean-square value of a waveform are only the same for a square wave, simple rectifier-type circuits can only be calibrated for sinusoidal waveforms. [...] Other wave shapes require a different calibration factor to relate RMS and average value. This type of circuit usually has fairly limited frequency range. Since practical rectifiers have non-zero voltage drop, accuracy and sensitivity is poor at low AC voltage values.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of intrawave {{sediment}} entrainment {{processes are}} reported above ripples under irregular waves generated in a large-scale flume facility. The data consist of substantive observations of small-scale processes collected at high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution under irregular wave forcing, typical of coastal environments. Acoustic measurements were made of water velocities, bed forms, and suspended sediment concentration over plane and rippled beds. During each rippled bed experiment, measurements were taken over the crests of steep sided ripples, above which flow separation was considered likely to occur. Above the ripple crests, a strong intrawave variation in the near-bed suspended sediment, indicative of vortex formation and shedding, was observed to dominate wave <b>half</b> <b>cycles</b> where the orbital diameter was greater than 1. 2 times the ripple wavelength lambda. The irregular waves were parameterized with a significant wave height H-s and a significant orbital diameter d(0 s). Thus, during irregular wave conditions and over steep ripples where d(0 s) /lambda > 1. 2, vortex shedding was deemed as the dominant sediment entrainment process. Furthermore, the percentage of wave <b>half</b> <b>cycles</b> where vortex shedding was observed, was found to scale as 26 d(0 s) /lambda. These results demonstrate, for under irregular waves, {{the existence of a}} clear suspended sediment structure consistent with vortex shedding, previously observed under regular wave...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates a rapid structural {{health monitoring}} method for civil structures that delivers results immediately after a major seismic event. The method {{is based on}} an overall least squares regression analysis and hypothesis test, and is applied to an experimental scaled 12 -story reinforced concrete frame structure subjected to two stages of input ground motions. The test structure is simplified to a six degree of freedom (DOF) system model, where the accelerations of each DOF are recorded. Nonlinear hysteresis loops are reconstructed for each DOF, and divided into a number of <b>half</b> <b>cycles</b> in chronological order. Changes in identified elastic story stiffness in these selected <b>half</b> <b>cycles</b> are used as an index for damage localization and severity assessment, and tracked over time using the proposed identification algorithm. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed monitoring algorithm is validated using the data from the experimental test structure. No large drop of elastic stiffness was identified for the test structure under the small input ground motion. Significant stiffness degradation was identified for the fourth, third and second DOF with stiffness losses over 50 % compared to the calculated initial stiffness. Cracks were also observed at the beam-column joint connection at floors six, five and four after the experiment for the strong input ground motion. The results indicate the identification algorithm is capable of detection and assessing the damage location and severity automatically by tracking the evolution of elastic story stiffness without requiring human input...|$|R
