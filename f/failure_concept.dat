5000|$|As part of {{the debate}} about the state failure definition, Charles T. Call (2010) {{attempts}} to abandon the concept of state failure altogether; as, he argues, it promotes an unclear understanding of what state failure means. Indeed, one of the main contributions to the theorization of the [...] "failed-state" [...] is the [...] "gap framework" [...] developed by Call (2010). This framework builds on his previous (2008) criticisms of ‘state failure’, as a concept used as a catch-all term for diverse states with varying problems and as a base and explanation for universal policy prescriptions. It unpacks the concept of [...] "state failure" [...] focusing on three gaps that the state is not able to provide when it {{is in the process of}} failure: capacity, when state institutions lack the ability to effectively deliver basic goods and services to its population; security, when the state is unable to provide security to its population under the threat of armed groups; and legitimacy, when a [...] "significant portion of its political elites and society reject the rules regulating power and the accumulation and distribution of wealth." [...] The [...] "gap framework" [...] seems to be more useful than other definitions. Instead of attempting to quantify the degree of failure of a state, the gap framework provides a three-dimensional scope useful to analyse the interplay between the government and the society in states in a more analytical way. Call does not necessarily suggest that states that suffer from the challenges of the three gaps should be identified as failed states; but instead, presents the gap idea as an alternative to the state <b>failure</b> <b>concept</b> as a whole. [...] Although Call recognizes that the gap concept in itself has limits, since often states face two or more of the gap challenges, his conceptual proposition presents a useful way for more precisely identifying the challenges within a society and the policy prescriptions that are more likely to be effective for external and international actors to implement.|$|E

Several state space exploration algorithms are evaluated in terms of bounds quality and memory and CPU time requirements.

40|$|Basal {{dendrites}} of neocortical pyramidal neurons {{are relatively}} short and directly {{attached to the}} cell body. This allows electrical signals arising in basal dendrites to strongly influence the neuronal output. Likewise, somatic action potentials (APs) should readily propagate back into the basilar dendritic tree to influence synaptic plasticity. Two recent studies, however, determined that sodium APs are severely attenuated in basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, so that they completely fail in distal dendritic segments. Here we used the latest improvements in voltage-sensitive dye imaging technique (Zhou et al., 2007) to study AP backpropagation in basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat prefrontal cortex. With signal-to-noise ratio greater than 15, and minimal temporal averaging (only 4 sweeps) {{we were able to}} sample AP waveforms from the very last segments of individual dendritic branches (dendritic tips). We found that in short (< 150 µm) and medium range basal dendrites (150 – 200 µm in length) APs backpropagate with modest change in AP half-width or AP rise-time. The lack of substantial change in AP shape and dynamics of rise is inconsistent with the AP failure model. The lack of substantial amplitude boosting of the 3 rd AP in the high-frequency burst, also suggests that in short and medium range basal dendrites backpropagating APs are not severely attenuated. Our results show that the AP <b>failure</b> <b>concept</b> does not apply in all basal dendrites of the rat prefrontal cortex.

40|$|A common {{approach}} for joining silicon - structured using anisotropic etching - and glass is anodic bonding. The {{combination of these}} two techniques (etching and bonding) lead to problems concerning {{the reliability of the}} resulting microelectromechanical systems during mechanical loading caused by mechanical failure starting at sharp interfacial corners conditional to etching technology. Therefore a <b>failure</b> <b>concept</b> is required that can be applied for the design of reliable microsystems. Based on the fracture mechanic concept of critical stress intensity factors it is possible to develop such a criteria for fracture initiation at interface corners of silicon/glass anodic bonds. For examination of this approach we designed and fabricated a series of special test structures -silicon/glass anodic bonds with different notch geometries. These structures are based on typical structures found in microelectromechanical systems. We performed a large number of symmetric and asymmetric four-point flexure tests at different temperatures and loading rates to eliminate the influence of sub critical crack growth. The measured critical failure stresses were used as input data for a finite element model to calculate the singular stress field of the interface notch tip and its corresponding notch stress intensity factors A 1 C (mode I) and A 2 C (modeII). Using the results of the asymmetric four-point flexure tests it can be shown that failure is mostly characterised by A 1 C. Furthermore, using optical and scanning electron microscopy we were able to show, that the crack path is well approx imated by the path of maximum radial stresses calculated using finite element analysis.

With a critical approach {{to the concept of}} state failure, the project sets out to answer 1) what is a state? 2) What is state failure? 3) How are failed states perceived and portrayed in the failed state debate? 4) Are there alternative modes of governance to statehood? The concept of the state is delineated primarily through Weber’s understanding of the state and his ideal of legal-rational authority. Further, Thomas Hobbes’ take on the social contract is used to describe the relationship between the state and its citizens. The state is further understood in this project as inscribed in the global state system, and that this is an actor of what defines and regulate state failure. Moreover, key functions of the state will also be included to create a cohesive notion of what is understood to be the Western perception of the state. This account of the state will then be used to understand the premises of state failure, and will establish a foundation for critically engage with the failed state debate, especially in relation to three dimensions: authority, services, and legitimacy. To accentuate the premise and conception of the failed state debate, the project will analyse two state failure indexes, the State Fragility Index, by the Centre for Systemic Peace, and the Failed States Index, by the Fund for Peace. These have a function to objectify, measure, and rank a state according to its fragility, and it is thus of interest to understand which state conceptions lie at heart of these rankings, and on what notion as society can be seen as ‘failed’. To underline the pitfalls of the failed state debate, the project will look into how Somalia is being understood as a failed state, and in which institutions it is deemed most unredeemable By looking into the history of Somalia, the project will describe how the different attempted reforms of state building have failed. It will be analysed and discussed to what extent the failed state debate, portrayed through the failed state indexes, has been a product of and reaffirming the conception of Somalia as a failed state.

40|$|Action {{potential}} (AP) backpropagation {{into the}} dendritic tree represents an important retrograde signal broadcasting {{the outcome of}} synaptic integration in the axon to synapses in the dendrites. Its relevance has been established to several physiological processes. Although well studied in apical dendrites, little is known how APs invade basal dendrites of the prefrontal cortical (PFC) pyramidal neurons. Using improved voltage-sensitive dye imaging technique we studied AP backpropagation in the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat PFC. We found that in short- and medium-range of basal dendrites APs propagated actively with only modest changes in AP half-width or AP rise-time. Together {{with the lack of}} substantial amplitude boosting of the third AP in a high-frequency burst, our findings are inconsistent with the previous AP-failure model, but suggest that in short and medium-sized basal dendrites bAPs were not severely attenuated. Our results show that the AP <b>failure</b> <b>concept</b> does not apply to all basal dendrites of the rat PFC. The majority of synaptic contacts in the basilar dendritic tree receive significant AP-associated electrical and calcium transients. ^ Next, we asked whether and how the propagation of AP is favored in different dendrites of the same class, in different neurons of the same subtype and in sister branches of the same pyramidal neurons of the PFC. Using whole-field illumination combined with intracellular application of voltage- or calcium-sensitive dyes, we found that AP propagation in two sister branches (branching off the same parent dendrite) may differ drastically in efficacy and high-frequency filtering properties. The heterogeneity of AP backpropagation was not only detected among sister branches belonging to the same neuron, but among the neighboring layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In two nearby pyramidal cells the calcium electrogenesis in the dendritic tuft exhibited drastically different sensitivity to the AP firing. The efficacy of AP propagation is influenced by the branching pattern (topology), thickness (diameter) of individual dendritic branches and the distribution of dendritic A-type conductance. By applying adequate synaptic inputs into the dendritic tuft in the form of cholinergic stimulation and/ or LTP induction, we were able to effectively change the efficacy of AP propagation in the target dendritic branches, suggesting activity-dependent compartmentalized alteration might be an important drive for the heterogeneity of branch-specific excitability in the dendritic tree. Such findings might provide a new perspective for understanding the subcellular basis of intrinsic excitability and the role of local regulation of dendritic excitability in synaptic integration and memory. ^ Lastly, we investigated the modulation of AP backpropagation by synaptic-like dopaminergic stimulation. Using focal application of exogenous dopamine (DA) onto one dendritic branch while monitoring APs from all dendrites in the visual field using calcium- and/ or voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that DA suppressed AP-evoked calcium transients while it had little effect on voltage transients. Dopaminergic suppression of dendritic calcium transients was rapid (3 ̆c 500 ms) and restricted to the dopamine input site, and were fully mimicked by agonists, partially obscured by D 1 antagonist. In comparison, we also studied GABA effect on AP-associated voltage and calcium transients. Contrary to DA, GABA prohibited AP propagation distally from the input site, and therefore excluded AP-associated calcium transient. We hypothesize that the mammalian neocortex employs two distinct strategies (two spatio-temporal patterns) for rapid (3 ̆c 0. 5 sec) modulation of dendritic calcium influx (DA and GABA). The DA-mediated spatio-temporal pattern of dendritic calcium suppression is expected to occur during phasic dopaminergic signaling, when midbrain dopaminergic neurons generate a transient (0. 5 s) burst of action potentials in response to a salient event in the animal 2 ̆ 7 s environment. ...|$|E

The Physics of <b>Failure</b> (PoF) <b>concept</b> {{is based on the}} understanding of the relationships between requirements and the physical characteristics of the product and their variation in the manufacturing processes, and the reaction of product elements and materials to loads (stressors) and interaction under loads and their influence on the fitness for use with respect to the use conditions and time.|$|R

Especially, the effective utilization of stable contacts qualifies the presented solution for the application in heterogeneous networking environments with zones of stable connectivity and common disruptions as in disaster scenarios. In case of random node <b>failures,</b> the <b>concept</b> shows a better performance than the original version for a large number of backbone nodes and otherwise a similar performance and is thus considered as robust solution.|$|R
50|$|Antifragility is a {{property}} of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness {{as a result}} of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. It is a concept developed by Professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book, Antifragile and in technical papers. As Taleb explains in his book, antifragility is fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency (i.e. the ability to recover from failure) and robustness (that is, the ability to resist <b>failure).</b> The <b>concept</b> has been applied in risk analysis, physics, molecular biology, transportation planning, engineering, Aerospace (NASA), and computer science.|$|R
