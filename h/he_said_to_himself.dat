500|$|While {{defending}} the role Moldavian {{politicians in the}} 1840s had in shaping modern Romanian culture, Ibrăileanu argued that practices {{such as those of}} Heliade and Laurian carried the risk of [...] "suppressing the Romanian language", and credited Alecu Russo, more than his successors at Junimea, with providing a passionate defense of spoken Romanian. He notably cited Russo's verdict: [...] "The modern political hatred aimed at [...] has thrown us into Italianism, into Frenchism, and into other -isms, that were not and are not Romanianism, but the political perils, in respect to the enslavement of the Romanian soul, have since passed; true Romanianism ought to hold its head up high". The literary critic George Călinescu also connected Heliade's experimentation to his Russophobia, in turn reflecting his experiences as a revolutionary: [...] "Hating Slavism and the Russians, who had striven to underline , <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that he was to serve his motherland by discarding all Slavic vestiges". Călinescu notably attributed Heliade's inconsistency to his [...] "autodidacticism", which, he contended, was responsible for [...] " [...] casual implication in all issues, the unexpected move from common sense ideas to the most insane theories".|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Usher {{revealed}} that {{for his next}} album {{he was working on}} a new type of music which he has depicted as [...] "revolutionary pop", which combines different genres to form a new sound. His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: [...] "What he wanted to do [...] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is [...] "the most artistic of an album" [...] he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me".|$|E
2500|$|At {{about that}} time, Earhart {{and a young}} woman friend visited an air fair held in {{conjunction}} with the Canadian National Exposition in Toronto. One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I ace. The pilot overhead spotted Earhart and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dived at them. [...] "I am sure <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'Watch me make them scamper,'" [...] she said. Earhart stood her ground as the aircraft came close. [...] "I did not understand it at the time," [...] she said, [...] "but I believe that little red airplane said something to me as it swished by." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could hear}} the tolling. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> over <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> the song that Brigid had taught him.|$|R
6000|$|... "If my {{face was}} washed, I'd kiss her this minute," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> and {{immediately}} Master Plummer looked jealous.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no use {{thinking}} about it; I've {{got to take}} the chances," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> resolutely <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> and the weary march was resumed.|$|R
2500|$|The austere {{beauty of}} Euclidean {{geometry}} {{has been seen}} by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "You never can make a lawyer {{if you do not}} understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight". Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet [...] "", [...] "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". Einstein recalled a copy of the Elements and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the [...] "holy little geometry book".|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> {{that there}} was nothing to think about, and began walking towards his home.|$|E
60|$|He had determined, by {{this way}} of putting the question, to give Bosinney a chance, as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose the}} bills you {{found in the}} pile of dirt are in the sergeant's hands," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> when Jet concluded.|$|R
6000|$|... "They'll {{be coming}} round the Black Copse in five minutes," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "James, {{get the other}} chairs out of the wagon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Penelope Morse," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "Seems <b>to</b> me I'm rather popular this evening. Say I'll be {{down right}} away, my boy." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that it {{was worse}} than yesterday. He {{wondered}} if it would go on getting worse every day.|$|E
6000|$|The Vicar {{examined}} his visitor critically--for {{the first}} time. [...] "He {{will be difficult}} to explain," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> softly.|$|E
6000|$|... "They sha'n't {{have these}} papers, {{no matter what}} happens," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> and stuffed the {{documents}} into an inside pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is over, this long-talked-of meeting," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> half <b>to</b> Dorward. [...] "It is over, and Europe {{is left to}} wonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|Home he trotted {{as hard as}} {{the pony}} would go, holding his head down to try to bury nose and mouth in his collar, and the thick rain {{plastering}} his hair, and streaming {{down the back of}} his neck. What an ill-used wretch was <b>he,</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>to</b> have to rattle all over the country in such weather! ...|$|R
60|$|But while <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>to</b> Maitland he only wished a good voyage, and {{particularly}} recommended {{to him a}} comedy (and a comédienne) at the Palais Royal.|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't mornin', that's certain," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "I {{wonder what}} aunt Dorcas is doin'? Perhaps the princess is sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's awfully fond of Wendy,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> He {{was angry}} with her now for not seeing why {{she could not have}} Wendy.|$|E
6000|$|... "From the hedges and {{highways}} bid them come," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> softly smiling. And then to Absalom: [...] "Send Louis to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{he went to}} his old office, {{wrote his}} resignation, and walked home meditating to what next step above he should now aspire to rise. 'Excelsior!' <b>he</b> still <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'Excelsior!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{shall be}} my defence against life," [...] <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> {{with a sort}} of inward {{consciousness}} that for the son of his father there was no other worthy alternative.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was a good}} man," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> more <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> than <b>to</b> Andrew, [...] "and {{the world}} has lost a great philanthropist; but he is better as he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a big place, and no mistake," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "My gracious, what tall buildings, and {{how they}} are crowded together!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Doctor {{took several}} turns round his study, {{with his hands}} in his pockets, and a thin sparkle, {{possibly}} of irritation, but partly also of something like humour, in his eye. [...] "By Jove," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "I believe she will stick--I believe she will stick!" [...] And this idea of Catherine [...] "sticking" [...] appeared to have a comical side, and to offer a prospect of entertainment. He determined, as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> to see it out.|$|E
6000|$|Randal {{drew back}} a step. Mrs. Presty's audacity was {{something}} {{more than he could}} understand. [...] "Is this woman mad?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
60|$|Reddy grinned wickedly as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> for <b>he</b> {{knew that}} there was no one for whom Peter Rabbit had less love, unless it was old Granny Fox.|$|R
6000|$|Razumov {{was ready}} for the name. He had been looking out for the question. [...] "When it comes I shall own up," [...] <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> But <b>he</b> took his time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that {{is exactly}} the way I feel!" [...] Lemuel was proud of the coincidence. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> commend <b>himself</b> further <b>to</b> Miss Carver, [...] "I have just been round to see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> 'If {{only these}} oranges were real fruit--fruit as {{refreshing}} as what I ate in Flanders! And, after all, who knows?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That girl {{will leave}} him,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> 'She'll hate him like poison. And serve him right. Then she'll go off with {{somebody}} else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet," [...] as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "though the rough-footed knaves be {{our enemies}} in Cumberland, in Palestine one almost {{considers}} them as brethren." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{comes of}} my bein' so foolish as {{to bring that}} fool liquor," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> half <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "It's mighty lucky he didn't know I {{had more than one}} bottle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is made of}} {{the finest}} flour and mixed with the richest milk and stirred by the best cook in all the countryside,' and though <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> the woman heard him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{remember}} that anyone ever recognized it before," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> more <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> than <b>to</b> her, then came {{and leaned over}} the rail at her side. His doubts were gone. Fate had spoken.|$|R
