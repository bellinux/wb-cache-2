5|$|<b>In</b> <b>reviewing</b> <b>the</b> {{sweep of}} botanical history {{it is evident}} that, {{through the power of}} the {{scientific}} method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E

25|$|On 29 June 2010, the Palermo Court of Appeals {{reduced the}} 2004 nine-year {{sentence}} for collusion with the Mafia to seven years. <b>In</b> <b>reviewing</b> <b>the</b> previous sentence, {{the appeals court}} said the conviction stood only for acts committed by Dell'Utri prior to 1992, while he was acquitted for charges after that year. The prosecution had asked that the sentence be increased to 11 years. The judges took six days to consider their decision, an extraordinary long time for deliberations. The verdict effectively cleared Dell'Utri and Italian prime minister Berlusconi over allegations his entry into politics was backed by Cosa Nostra and a terrorist bombing campaign.

25|$|Norman and Bennett {{note that}} some studies that {{compared}} alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest alcoholism {{is linked to}} increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality.

25|$|Italian {{private equity}} fund Investindustrial signed a deal on 6 December 2012 to buy 37.5% of Aston Martin, {{investing}} £150 million as a capital increase. This was confirmed by Aston Martin in a press release on 7 December 2012. In April 2013 {{it was reported that}} Dr Ulrich Bez would be leaving his role as chief executive officer to take up a more ambassadorial position widely seen as the first move by the new shareholders <b>in</b> <b>reviewing</b> <b>the</b> leadership and strategy of Aston Martin. On 2 September 2014, Aston Martin announced it had appointed the Nissan executive Andy Palmer as CEO with Ulrich Bez retaining a position as non-executive chairman. As sales had been declining, from 2015 Aston Martin sought new customers (particularly wealthy female buyers) with cars like Lagonda and DBX while releasing concept cars like the Vulcan. According to Palmer, the troubles started when sales of the DB9 failed to generate sufficient fund to develop next-generation models which led to a downward spiral of declining sales and profitability.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Herb Wagner {{showed that}} the fertile {{population}} in Havana Glen was tetraploid, while ordinary Aspleniumebenoides was diploid. Wagner and Robert S. Whitmire followed up in 1957 and induced chromosome doubling in diploid A.ebenoides collected in Maryland, and produced fertile, allotetraploid offspring, the first allopolyploid ferns to be artificially produced in culture. There were significant morphological differences between these artificially produced ferns and those from Havana Glen. Wagner and Whitmire attributed this {{to the fact that}} the presumed ancestral diploid at Havana Glen and those in Maryland had originated in separate hybridization events between A.platyneuron and A.rhizophyllum and that alloploidy might magnify genetic differences between the parental species. <b>In</b> <b>reviewing</b> <b>the</b> characteristics of the species in 1982, Wagner and his collaborators noted that as a hybrid, the name of the species was more correctly written Asplenium×ebenoides, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. However, they preferred to use Wherry's combination of ×Asplenosorus ebenoides. (A change in the ICBN in 1972 rendered a Latin diagnosis for ×Asplenosorus unnecessary.) Since then, phylogenetic studies have shown that Camptosorus nests within Asplenium, and current treatments do not recognize it as a separate genus.|$|E
