5|$|Australian openside David Pocock, who {{was also}} shortlisted for the IRB award, admires the way he reads the game as well as <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to read the referee. One of McCaw's {{strengths}} is <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to re-invent himself.

5|$|In an {{era when}} defencemen were {{expected}} to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known for <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to score goals while playing a defensive role, and for <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to remain calm during matches that often turned violent.

5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. <b>His</b> <b>ability</b> to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident in <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to escape in 13rounds than in <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
5|$|Show runner Mike Scully had pitched {{an idea to}} Dan Greaney on Marge forcing Bart {{to become}} Ralph Wiggum's friend. Scully gave the idea to Greaney due to <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to write Ralph's lines and actions well, and his overall liking of the character.|$|E

5|$|The second French squadron, under Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, cruised in the South Atlantic and the Caribbean {{during the}} spring and summer of 1806, {{conducting}} several successful raids on British islands in the West Indies. <b>His</b> <b>ability</b> to affect British trade was hampered by the deployment of British squadrons against him and the disobedience of Captain Jérôme Bonaparte, the Emperor's brother. On 18 August an Atlantic hurricane dispersed his ships, causing severe damage and forcing them to take shelter in friendly or neutral harbours in the Americas. Waiting British ships destroyed one vessel, and several others were so badly damaged that they never sailed again, the four survivors limping back to France individually over the next two years. The various British squadrons deployed against him failed to catch Willaumez, but their presence had limited <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to raid British trade routes.|$|E
