5|$|Although {{specimens}} of M.griveaudi differ by only 0.6% in their cytb sequences, analysis of D-loop data does show some differentiation between the island populations. These <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the species originated on Madagascar, where a large, stable population persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations came into contact, resulting in inter-island gene flow.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Voalavo is a genus of rodent in the {{subfamily}} Nesomyinae, {{found only}} in Madagascar. Two species are known, both of which occur in mountain forest above 1250m (4100ft) altitude; the northern voalavo lives in northern Madagascar and eastern voalavo is restricted to a small area in {{the central part of}} the island. The genus was discovered in 1994 and formally described in 1998. Within Nesomyinae, it is most closely related to the genus Eliurus, and DNA sequence <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the current definitions of these two genera need to be changed.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
5|$|After Whitley's initial description, C. tilstoni was {{generally}} regarded as synonymous with C. limbatus, the common blacktip shark. In the 1980s, additional morphological and life history data again favored the recognition of C. tilstoni as a separate species, which was eventually confirmed by allozyme studies performed by Shane Lavery and James Shaklee. Several molecular phylogenetic studies based on allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA {{have found that the}} Australian and common blacktip sharks form a closely related clade with the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the smoothtooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon). The interrelationships between them have not been fully resolved, but available <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> C. tilstoni and C. limbatus are not the most closely related species within the clade despite their similarity.|$|E
5|$|Although The Volcano is {{estimated}} to have last erupted 150years ago, {{it is one of}} the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985. Others include Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds both with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E

5|$|Of {{all people}} with lung {{cancer in the}} US, 16.8% survive {{for at least five}} years after diagnosis. In England and Wales, between 2010 and 2011, overall five-year {{survival}} for lung cancer was estimated at 9.5%. Outcomes are generally worse in the developing world. Stage is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV. Survival for lung cancer falls as the stage at diagnosis becomes more advanced: the English <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> around 70% of patients survive at least a year when diagnosed at the earliest stage, but this falls to just 14% for those diagnosed with the most advanced disease.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm {{is one of}} numerous seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have experienced volcanic earthquakes include Mount Meager (seventeen events), Mount Cayley (four events), Mount Garibaldi (three events), Silverthrone Caldera (two events), Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events), The Volcano (five events), and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes {{with a history of}} significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in {{the genus}} Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary {{when it was}} first {{described}} in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M.alcathoe and any other species.|$|E
