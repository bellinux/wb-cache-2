This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources and receivers. Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe <b>Designated</b> <b>Forwarder</b> (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology. With {{the assistance of the}} DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state. The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Many safety-related {{applications}} in Ve-hicular Ad Hoc Networks require fast and reliable emergency message dissemination through multi-hop broadcast. However, the conventional broadcast mech-anism is neither efficient nor reliable because {{it results in}} serious contention and collisions, which is usually {{referred to as the}} broadcast storm problem. In this paper, we propose ERP, a two-phase broadcast proto-col that improves both efficiency and reliability. The first phase, a “fast-propagation phase”, is designed to improve efficiency. We explicitly <b>designate</b> <b>forwarders</b> to relay the message and thus ensure both collision-free and quick propagation. The second phase, a “loss-recovery phase”, enhances reliability. In this phase, nodes overhear the message and repeatedly broadcast it for the benefit of nodes which have not received the message in the first phase. We analytically show that using a density-aware power control mechanism in the second phase can efficiently improve the recovery rate. We also demonstrate how to find the optimal trans-mission power. Simulation results illustrate that our protocol outperforms probabilistic forwarding, which is currently the most widely studied solution, by a factor of 2 to 3. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the routing protocols designed to date for mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) rely on flooding of route requests {{for the establishment of}} routes on demand. A novel approach called CBORCA (Cut-Based On-demand Routing with Coordinate Awareness) is introduced. CBORCA improves the efficiency with which route requests are disseminated by parti- tioning the <b>designated</b> route <b>forwarders</b> in distinct quadrants and by selecting at most one “pivot” within each quadrant. Each new pivot is required to pass a distance test before joining the pivot set. Message complexity at each hop is shown to be O(C) ≍ O(1). Experimental results using simulations demonstrate that the performance of CBORCA achieves better results than ORCA (On-demand Routing with Coordinate Awareness) in packet- delivery ratio, signaling overhead, and end-to-end delay...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{ascertain}} and draw conclusions on the extent of distribution strategies employed by Con-Plant Technology P/L (CPT). The successful implementation of an effective distribution strategy according to literature requires an organization to; understand the various forms of distribution strategies, appreciate the determinants of a distribution strategy, evaluate the distribution strategies, and discover factors that inhibit the successful implementation of an efficient distribution strategy. Nevertheless, this literature is restricted to the outside world. Hence, the purpose of this study was to fill this research gap by evaluating distribution strategies in the capital equipment market in a Zimbabwean perspective. Furthermore, the business world, nation, and researchers will derive value from the data gathered in this study. A qualitative research approach based on a single case study design of Con-Plant Technology P/L (CPT) was adopted. Purposive sampling strategy was utilized to select fourteen (14) respondents drawn from eight organizations representing senior employees of CPT, customers, OEMs (suppliers), and the <b>designated</b> freight <b>forwarder</b> in the distribution channel. The selected respondents were all related to distribution and would best answer the research questions. Interviews were used to gather evidence using an unstructured questionnaire and the data was analyzed through data displays in the form of content analytical tables to draw conclusions. The study concluded that CPT is strongly commitment to less efficient traditional distribution strategies because management is not fully aware of the forms of distribution strategies available, the management has little understanding of the factors that influences the selection of a distribution strategy, evaluation of distribution strategies is non-existent at CPT, and limited resources inhibits the successful implementation of efficient distribution strategies. In view of these findings, CPT is recommended to adopt hybrid channeling to improve its distribution network and market coverage, employ expertise to articulate marketing functions, secure other sources of finance, and evaluate the contribution of each distribution strategy...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{communication}} and networking technologies are rapidly making ubiquitous network connectivity a reality. In recent years, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have already become very popular and been receiving an increasing {{amount of attention}} by the research community. Basically, a WMN consists of simple mesh routers and mesh clients, where mesh routers form the backbone of WMN. Due to the limited transmission range of the radio, many pairs of nodes in WMN {{may not be able}} to communicate directly, hence they need other intermediate nodes to forward packets for them. Routing in such networks is an important issue and it poses great challenges. Opportunistic Routing (OR) has been investigated in recent years as a way to increase the performance of WMNs by exploiting its broadcast nature. In OR, in contrast to traditional routing, instead of pre-selecting a single specic node to be the next-hop as a forwarder for a packet, an ordered set of nodes (referred to as candidates) is selected as the potential next-hop forwarders. Thus, the source can use multiple potential paths to deliver the packets to the destination. More specically, when the current node transmits a packet, all the candidates that successfully receive it will coordinate with each other to determine which one will actually forward it, while the others will simply discard the packet. This dissertation studies the properties, performance, maximum gain, candidate selection algorithms and multicast delivery issues about Opportunistic Routing in WMNs. Firstly, we focus on the performance analysis of OR by proposing a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). This model can be used to evaluate OR in terms of expected number of transmissions from the source to the destination. Secondly, we apply our Markov model to compare relevant candidate selection algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. They range from non-optimum, but simple, to optimum, but with a high computational cost. Thirdly, the set of candidates which a node uses and priority order of them have a signicant impact on the performance of OR. Therefore, using a good metric and algorithm to select and order the candidates are key factors in designing an OR protocol. As the next contribution we propose a new metric that measures the expected distance progress of sending a packet using a set of candidates. Based on this metric we propose a candidate selection algorithm which its performance is very close to the optimum algorithm although our algorithm runs much faster. Fourthly, we have investigated the maximum gain that can be obtained using OR. We have obtained some equations that yield the distances of the candidates in OR such that the per transmission progress towards the destination is maximized. Based on these equations we have proposed a novel candidate selection algorithm. Our new algorithm only needs the geographical location of nodes. The performance of our proposal is very close to the optimum candidate selection algorithm although our algorithm runs much faster. Finally, using OR to support multicast is an other issue that we have investigated in this thesis. We do so by proposing a new multicast protocol which uses OR. Unlike traditional multicast protocols, there is no <b>designated</b> next-hop <b>forwarder</b> for each destination in our protocol, thus the delivery ratio is maximized by taking advantage of spatial diversity.
