Many others were sent to central Germany as forced labour or conscripted into the German army. Poznań's Jewish population, which had numbered 2,000 in 1939, was largely murdered in the Holocaust.

Along with Pucheu and Paul Marion Lehideux expressed this view to Otto Abetz when they signed a memorandum to him in March 1941 stating that they hoped to make France [...] "Europe's bridgehead" [...] in the new German-led order.

40|$|Fuel poverty {{may become}} an {{increasingly}} severe problem in developed countries in cases when real prices for fossil fuels increase at high rates or when real energy prices increase due to policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Fuel poverty measurement consists of two largely independent parts, firstly, the definition of an adequate fuel poverty line, and secondly, the application of techniques to measure fuel poverty given some poverty line. This paper reviews options for the definition of fuel poverty lines as well as techniques for fuel poverty measurement.

40|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Euro many observers had expected an increase of inflationary pressures due to a de-coordination-shock to national wage bargaining. However, if anything systematically happened after {{the introduction}} of the Euro wage restraint increased (Posen and Gould 2006). A possible explanation for this finding is that a system of pattern bargaining has emerged with <b>Germany</b> <b>figuring</b> as a "centre of gravity" for European wage bargains (Traxler et al. 2008, Traxler and Brandl 2009). This paper studies wage and nominal unit labour cost spill-overs for the EMU for a panel over 13 manufacturing sectors from 1992 - 2005 and quantifies the effects of different countries. It turns out that there are strong interdependencies across EMU-members with regard to nominal wage growth. Indeed, a leading role accrues to Germany whose wage developments are twice as influential as those of the next important countries. Remarkably, the strong interdependence of wage growth is not reflected with regard to unit labour costs. Here, only the development in a core group composed of Austria, France, Germany and the Netherlands, is bound to each other. The development of nominal unit labour costs in other countries is largely independent from each other and especially from this core group.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of {{wild service tree}} in Germany {{is limited by the}} North European Plain in the north and mountain ranges and the river Danube in the south (Figure 1). The species occurs mainly on well-drained calcareous soils (rendzina type) and on clayey soils (marl) with or without periodically stagnant water. Climate change scenarios indicate that in the future the climatic requirements of wild service tree can be expected to match essentially all of <b>Germany</b> (<b>Figure</b> 2). Already now, Denmark is located within the potential climatic range of wild service tree. Wild service tree is found mainly in mixed forest of light demanding species, typically oak, hornbeam and field maple, but less frequently beech. The species enjoys much attention in silviculture, but is rarely planted. The height growth of wild service tree is approximately as that of oak, i. e. fast in youth, later stagnant (Box 1 and Figure 3 (numbers indicate site index or height at age 100 years, black = wild service tree, red = oak, green = beech)). In Denmark wild service tree typically achieves a height of 15 - 17 m in 100 years (based on measurements of old trees in the forests at Ulvshale (Møn) and Døndalen (Bornholm) and in the Arboretum at Charlottenlund (Copenhagen), see Box 2). This is similar to the growth rate on sites of low productivity in Germany...|$|R
