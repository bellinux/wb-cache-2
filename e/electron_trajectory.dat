40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of ionization {{of the hydrogen}} atom due to an XUV pulse {{in the presence of}} an IR laser with both fields linearly polarized in the same direction. In particular, we study the energy distribution of photoelectrons emitted perpendicularly to the polarization direction. By means of a very simple semiclassical model which considers <b>electron</b> <b>trajectories</b> born at different ionization times, the electron energy spectrum can be interpreted as the interplay of Intra and Intercycle interferences. The intracycle interference pattern stems from the coherent superposition of four <b>electron</b> <b>trajectories</b> giving rise to (i) interference of <b>electron</b> <b>trajectories</b> born during the same half cycle (Intrahalfcycle interference) and (ii) interference between <b>electron</b> <b>trajectories</b> born during the first half cycle with those born during the second half cycle (Interhalfcycle interference). The intercycle interference is responsible for the formation of the sidebands. We also show that the destructive interhalfcycle interference for the absorption and emission of an even number of IR laser photons is responsible for the characteristic sidebands in the perpendicular direction separated by twice the IR photon energy. We analyze the dependence of the energy spectrum on the laser intensity and the time delay between the XUV pulse and the IR laser. Finally, we show that our semiclassical simulations are in very good agreement with quantum calculations within the strong field approximation and the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
