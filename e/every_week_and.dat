5|$|A free weekly parkrun {{takes place}} in the centre of Shrewsbury. The event is {{attended}} by over 250 runners <b>every</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> is 'twinned' with Darwin parkrun in Northern Territory, Australia due to the city of Darwin being named after Charles Darwin. Shrewsbury has also seen activity in the physical discipline, Parkour.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, {{he spent}} {{a week in the}} {{religious}} class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school <b>every</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service <b>every</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E

25|$|The town {{continued}} to grow at a moderate pace. Railroads finally arrived {{to connect with the}} Central Pacific and San Francisco in 1876. The impact was small. Much greater was the impact of the Santa Fe system (through its subsidiary California Southern Railroad) in 1885. The Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines provided direct connections to the East, competed vigorously for business with much lower rates, and stimulated economic growth. Tourists poured in by the thousands <b>every</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> many planned on returning or resettling.|$|E
25|$|On average, {{nine million}} people watched BBC Three <b>every</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> {{it had a}} 2.6% share of the 15–34-year-old {{audience}} and 1.4% of the whole population, according to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB). These ratings by BARB, the official ratings agency, average out BBC Three's viewing figures over a 24-hour period even though the channel only broadcasts in the evening, giving a distorted sense of the channel's viewership. Despite several official complaints from the BBC, BARB continues to publish figures which the BBC argues are unrepresentative.|$|E

25|$|Research {{funded by}} the U.S. National Institutes of Health {{has shown that the}} average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian.

The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.|$|E

Interestingly, this would not be the final regular season game for Clemson due to the September 11 attacks. The Tigers rescheduled their September 15 game (Vs.

25|$|The church {{continued}} growing. Inspired by Alan Roxburgh, Driscoll {{settled on}} an emerging and missional ecclesiology, and a complementarian view {{on women in}} ministry. The church installed the first team of elders and they took {{over much of the}} work teaching classes, counseling and training new leaders. Furthermore, the church started a course for new members, called the Gospel Class, to ensure that members were focused on the mission of the church and that they agreed with the central doctrinal statements of the church. The class has been running every quarter since. In the fall of 1999 the church had grown to 350 in attendance <b>every</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> was able to pay Driscoll full-time. Prior to 1999, Driscoll operated as an unpaid pastor for three years.|$|E
25|$|The reform {{also brought}} the Sovereign Council of New France (Conseil souverain) into existence, which was later renamed the Superior Council (Conseil supérieur). The Sovereign Council {{effectively}} acted as the functional {{equivalent of a}} Council of State (Conseil d'État) for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal. Initially, the Council convened once <b>every</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases. The Council's practices evolved over time. At the Sovereign Council there was a king's attorney-general (procureur général du roi) {{in charge of the}} similar tasks as the district king's attorneys. He was also responsible for supervising the king's attorneys' daily operations as well as execution of royal edicts and regulations passed by the Council in their respective districts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the urban}} area, several small {{mountains}} and hills {{play the same}} role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city.

It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (달구벌대종, 達句伐大鐘), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck <b>every</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.|$|E
