50|$|There are two {{differences}} between net income and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> The {{first is the}} accounting {{for the purchase of}} capital goods. Net income deducts depreciation, while the <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> measure uses last period's net capital purchases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{most large}} for-profit {{entities}} often operating as companies, firm affaires are handled by professional managers who are legal representatives of shareholders {{and in these}} types of firms, management and ownership are separated in practice. Managers may attempt to fulfill expected profit through discretionary accruals because manipulation of non-discretionary accruals is nearly impossible. Based on Jenson research, in companies with high <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and low growth, managers likely engage in earnings management {{in order to fulfill}} their self-interest. Thus {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the relationship between earnings management and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in firms with high <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and low growth. For testing research hypotheses, the required data were collected from 63 companies listed in Tehran Securities Exchange. Data analysis was conducted using three methods of linear regression, Pearson analysis, and variance analysis and showed that there was a direct significant relationship between discretionary accruals and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Also based on Jensen theory and other related research, there was also a direct relationship between discretionary accruals and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in Iranian firms with high <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and low growth...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between the accrual and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> components of earnings for agribusiness. Three accrual models with their respective <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to equity are analyzed. Results for the agribusiness industry are compared with results from previous studies of all firms. Earnings Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), a measure frequently recommended as a proxy for <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> is tested using these models. Empirical results show that both the magnitude and the behavior of EBITDA differ from <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and should not be used as a proxy. Agribusiness,...|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{we think}} that more {{theoretical}} contributions that analyze the relationship between dividend taxation and payout policy in agency settings would help to develop a coherent theory as to how investor level taxes impact managerial investment decisions. Among others, Jensen (1986) shows that the agency conflict between firm owner and manager influences whether <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are distributed among firm owners or reinvested. Similarly, dividend taxation impacts the decision of whether to distribute or invest <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Thus, a joint analysis of tax effects on dividend payouts and investment decisions {{seems to be a}} promising area for future research.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a disaggregated {{version of the}} abnormal earnings growth (AEG) model of Ohlson and Juettner-Nauroth (2005). The value of the firm then becomes discounted <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> minus initial debt. Discounted <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are equal to capitalized operating earnings from the initial stock of operating assets plus {{the present value of}} an infinite sequence of growth projects, where each growth project is valued by discounted economic value added. Sufficient conditions for the present value of the <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to be equal to the sum of these two components are investigated. The Gordon growth formula is found to be one special case. Another case concerns lumpy growth projects with depreciation according to the annuity method. We then allow for three different interest rates, the required rate of return on equity under all-equity financing, the borrowing rate, and the required rate of return on equity under partial debt financing (the latter given by MMâ€™s Proposition 2). In the model of Ohlson and Juettner-Nauroth, these rates are the same. A firm-level model is developed that focuses on operating earnings and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> with discounting at the required rate of return under all-equity financing. An equity-level model is then developed that focuses on bottom-line earnings and dividends with discounting at the required rate of return under partial debt financing. Relationships between the two models are explored. Dividend policy irrelevance holds only in a limited sense for the equity-level model...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} {{managers}} of industry rivals act to mitigate their agency exposure and improve operating performance {{when one of the}} firms in the industry is subject to a takeover attempt. The results indicate that rival firms in general decrease <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> improve operating performance, reduce capital expenditures and increase leverage in response to a control threat within the industry. In particular, rival firms with potentially higher agency costs i. e. fewer investment opportunities and high <b>cash</b> or high <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> exhibit a higher reduction in <b>cash</b> levels and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> subsequent to a control threat in their industry. These results are consistent with the inefficient management hypothesis, which suggests poorly performing firms {{are more likely to be}} the target of a takeover attempt and the acquisition probability hypothesis proposed by Song and Walkling (2000), which states that rivals of initial targets earn abnormal returns because of an increased probability that they themselves will be targets. These results lend support to the argument that takeovers act as an effective external contro...|$|R

40|$|According to firm {{lifecycle}} theory {{the agency}} costs of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are not transitory problems, but are a recurrent issue once firms reach a certain stage in their lifecycle. In particular, as firms mature their <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> increase substantially while their investment opportunities decline and, to prevent retrenchment, managements {{need to invest}} in negative net present value projects. However, too much overinvestment leads to low firm valuation and potentially a hostile takeover. This paper extends firm lifecycle theory by arguing that to neutralize the threat of takeover, managements of maturing firms and their boards of directors progressively deploy antitakeover provisions which allow them to overinvest safely and prevent {{a decline in the}} size of their corporations. Firm lifecycle theory is also tested empirically. In this respect, a contribution {{of this paper is to}} develop a new empirical index that permits the identification of mature corporations with governance problems due to agency costs of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> The empirical results show that as firms mature agency costs of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> increase, more antitakeover provisions are put into place and firms invest in projects with returns below their cost of capital...|$|R

Finally, we derive closed-form solutions for equity betas, which differ from the formulas that have traditionally been used to lever and unlever equity betas. ...|$|R

The samples were 150 manufacturing companies listed on Indonesian Stock Exchange. The sampling method utilized in this research was purposive sampling. The number of samples that fitted the criteria set was 69 companies. The data were analyzed by using multiple regression test and preceded by classic assumption test consisted of normality test, multicollinearity test, autocorrelation test, and heteroscedasticity test.
