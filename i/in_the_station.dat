However, this was changed to occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> due to problems that arose during the ride's first season.

Throughout this period WIN-4 expanded its repeater transmissions to include Moruya, Batemans Bay, Narooma, Bega and Eden.

5|$|The {{extension}} {{opened to}} Jay Street on February 1, 1933, but the High Street station remained closed {{for an additional}} five months.
