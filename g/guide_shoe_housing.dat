40|$|Several common {{elevator}} malfunctions {{were diagnosed}} with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). After acquiring vibration signals of various elevator functions, their energy characteristics and time domain indicators were extracted by theoretically analyzing the optimal wavelet packet, in order to construct a feature vector of malfunctions for identifying causes of the malfunctions as input of LS-SVM. Meanwhile, parameters about LS-SVM were optimized by K-fold cross validation (K-CV). After diagnosing deviated elevator guide rail, deviated shape of <b>guide</b> <b>shoe,</b> abnormal running of tractor, erroneous rope groove of traction sheave, deviated guide wheel, and tension of wire rope, the results suggested that the LS-SVM based on K-CV optimization was one of effective methods for diagnosing elevator malfunctions...|$|R
