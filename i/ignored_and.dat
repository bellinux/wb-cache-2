5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was <b>ignored,</b> <b>and</b> later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E

5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be <b>ignored,</b> <b>and</b> the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E

5|$|Browning's {{dealings}} with the British Army were no smoother. His successor as commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Major-General Hopkinson, had sold the British Eighth Army commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, on Operation Ladbroke, a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse. Browning's objections to the operation were <b>ignored,</b> <b>and</b> attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion {{had to go through}} him. Browning concluded that to be effective, the airborne advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders.|$|E
5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated {{on the morning}} of the attack. It called for more than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was <b>ignored</b> <b>and</b> more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This classification was widely <b>ignored</b> <b>and</b> later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E

5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most did not return to Ireland. The famine of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly <b>ignored</b> <b>and</b> sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark {{the supreme}} and {{dominating}} power in Northern Europe, yet failed {{to restore the}} Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led {{to a series of}} conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were <b>ignored,</b> <b>and</b> thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan's point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, now that they were no longer fighting each other.|$|E

5|$|To bolster his {{authority}} {{and secure the}} position of the crown, James launched preemptive attacks on some of his nobles beginning in 1425 with his close kinsmen the Albany Stewarts resulting in the execution of Duke Murdoch and his sons. In 1428 James detained Alexander, Lord of the Isles, while attending a parliament in Inverness. Archibald, 5th Earl of Douglas, was arrested in 1431, followed by George, Earl of March, in 1434. The plight of the ransom hostages held in England was <b>ignored</b> <b>and</b> the repayment money was diverted into the construction of Linlithgow Palace and other grandiose schemes.|$|E

After serving in the position for three years, Richard was named a vice-president of the Canadiens in 1964. He became disgruntled with a role he felt was powerless and only honorary, and resigned one year later. Richard grew estranged from the organization as his desire {{to be involved in the}} team's operations was <b>ignored,</b> <b>and</b> the split deepened when the Canadiens forced Frank Selke to retire in 1965. He eventually refused to allow his name to be associated with the team.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi, before {{dropping}} out {{to join the}} military. Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion {{that he was involved}} in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963. Such reports were <b>ignored</b> <b>and</b> Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often <b>ignored</b> <b>and</b> the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E
5|$|In Lindblum, {{the party}} meets with Cid, who {{explains}} that he hired the group to kidnap Garnet to get her away from Brahne, who also worries him. Upon learning that Alexandria has invaded the city-state of Burmecia, the party splits in two. Zidane, Vivi, and new joinee Freya investigate Burmecia, while Dagger and Steiner journey back to Alexandria {{to try to stop}} Brahne from starting a war. Zidane's group finds that Burmecia has been conquered with help from a man named Kuja, and refugees have fled to the nearby city of Cleyra. They rush to Cleyra to defend it from the encroaching forces. Dagger, meanwhile, is <b>ignored</b> <b>and</b> captured by Brahne, who extracts powerful magical weapons called eidolons from her. Brahne proceeds to use one to destroy Cleyra. Zidane and company escaped the city on Brahne's airship and rescue Garnet, but while they do so Brahne attacks Lindblum with another eidolon.|$|E
5|$|On December 3, 1855, the {{legislature}} convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation {{to move the}} capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, {{the legislature}} re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask {{the people of the}} territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a runoff. The initial vote set up a runoff between Eugene and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low public participation, the election was <b>ignored,</b> <b>and</b> the capital remained in Salem.|$|E
