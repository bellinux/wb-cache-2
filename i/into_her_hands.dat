5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
25|$|Now {{aware that}} the {{characters}} who originally survived the movie can die, Max and the others decide to save anyone they can. They dress Tina in a life jacket and mittens, to prevent her from undressing. They also decide that Max, the only remaining virgin, is the new final girl, and plot to get Billy's machete <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> so she can kill him and end the film. Meanwhile, Max and Nancy bond, and theorize that, if Nancy survives the movie, she can go back home with Max and be whomever she wants.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel is}} notable for its overt use of coincidence, such as Mrs Oliver {{going into a}} café that happens to contain the girl she is seeking, and having a key piece of {{evidence}} literally fall <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> from a drawer as furniture is being removed from a dead woman's flat. This very obvious use of coincidence is known as open authorial manipulation and {{is often used to}} draw the reader's attention to the artificiality of the plot. It is highly appropriate to a detective novel in which a central character writes detective fiction and is an example of metafiction.|$|E
60|$|She had {{no sooner}} taken it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> than, whether being very hasty at it, {{somewhat}} unhandy, {{or that the}} decree of the Fairy had so ordained it, it ran <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and she fell down in a swoon.|$|R
60|$|She {{gathered}} the reins <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> preliminary to starting.|$|R

25|$|From {{that time}} she was an indefatigable reader, troubling her parents only by her devotion to books {{rather than to the}} play natural to her age. Her father had a {{considerable}} library, the contents of every book in which she made her own, always preferring history, — before she had finished her 10th year being acquainted with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and kindred writers. At this point, she was sent away to school. Her father and mother, seeing the intellect for which they were responsible, took all possible pains with her education, and fortunately her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. She cared more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no especial pleasure in mathematics. Booth's superior education was not given her at school, where she learned less than she did by herself, for she showed very young that disdain of obstacles and that taste for literature which were two strong points in her character. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French. A stray French primer fell <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and she became interested in spelling out the French words and comparing them with the English ones, and continued to study in this way. Later she acquired German in the same manner, and being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she never learned to speak them, but made herself so proficient in them in after years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French at sight, reading them aloud in English.|$|E
500|$|Maggie has {{performed}} {{a number of}} feats that suggest she is a genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, {{the rest of the}} Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and in a more intentional manner during [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.|$|E
2500|$|By 664, Empress Wu, {{who felt}} that her power was well established, was {{extending}} her influence further in the political arena, and when the eunuch Wang Fusheng (王伏勝) reported to Emperor Gaozong that she had engaged the sorcerer Guo Xingzhen (郭行真) – an act that was strictly forbidden—Emperor Gaozong, in anger, summoned the chancellor Shangguan Yi to consult Shangguan. [...] Shangguan suggested that he depose Empress Wu. [...] He agreed, and had Shangguan draft an edict to that effect. [...] However, Empress Wu had received information that that was happening, and she emerged to defend herself. [...] Emperor Gaozong could not carry out the removal, and instead blamed Shangguan. [...] As both Shangguan and Wang had previously served the former crown prince Li Zhong, Empress Wu had Xu Jingzong falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of conspiring against Emperor Gaozong's life. [...] Around the new year 665, Shangguan and Wang were executed, and Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide. [...] From this point on, whenever Emperor Gaozong presided over imperial meetings, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind him to hear the reports as well, and political power largely fell <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter {{referred to as the}} [...] "Two Saints." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prime Minister Thatcher {{expected}} Scargill {{to force}} a confrontation, and in response she set up a defence in depth. She believed that the excessive costs of increasingly inefficient collieries had to end in order to grow the economy. She planned to close inefficient pits and depend more on imported coal, oil, gas and nuclear. She appointed hardliners to key positions, set up a high level planning committee, and allocated funds from the highly profitable electrical supply system to stockpile {{at least six months}} worth of coal. Thatcher's team set up mobile police units so that forces from outside the strike areas could neutralise efforts by flying pickets to stop the transport of coal to power stations. It used the National Recording Centre (NRC), set up in 1972 by the Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales linking 43 police forces to enable police forces to travel to assist in major disturbances. [...] Scargill played <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> by ignoring the buildup of coal stocks and calling the strike at the end of winter when demand for coal was declining. His refusal to hold a strike ballot weakened support from other unions and the general public. Without a national ballot, miners in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, South Derbyshire, North Wales and parts of Lancashire kept working and Scargill sent flying pickets to prevent them. The police provided protection for working miners.|$|E
2500|$|A younger {{version of}} Jean, {{alongside}} teenage versions of Scott and Ororo, appears in [...] Now blue-eyed with long, loosely curled orange hair, this new variation of Jean had been located and enrolled sometime {{prior to the}} movie, as she, now in her mid-teens, is introduced as already being a student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. When Alex Summers brings his younger brother to the school after his own optic laser blasts powers had manifested, Scott bumped into Jean, as he couldn't see due to being blindfolded. [...] Jean drops the many books, binders, and papers she held, but instantly we watch as this new incarnation of Jean telekinetically pulls them back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> exhibiting seemingly little effort, which seems {{to imply that the}} Professor has left her mind unbarred. She gets mad at this, but apologizes as Scott explains he can't exactly look where he's going. Later, Jean is studying by a tree when Scott attempts to talk to her. Seeing the other students show fear, Jean explains that they're afraid of her because they are aware of her full powers, and therefore is treated as an outcast. Jean is affected by the energy wave released by an ancient, god-like mutant who had awakened that day. This causes Jean to have a nightmare of the world ending during which the entire school shakes, most of the students are awoken from sleep, and the Professor hurries to her room to find [...] that her telekinetic powers, already immensely strong, are quite literally burning the walls of her room. Telepathically reaching into Jean's mind to awaken her - an act that causes Charles a sizeable amount of pain - the wooden walls cease to burn and to emit smoke, and the Professor slumps back, substantially exhausted now. The powerful young psychic is reassured by Xavier that she is not losing control of her powers, despite her doubts. When the mansion is destroyed, she comforts Scott over the loss of his own brother and conceals herself, Scott, and Nightcrawler from Stryker's men. While in Stryker's base, she connects with Weapon X (Wolverine), and releases him from his cell. Before he, fearfully, leaves the complex Jean restores the few remaining memories of his that she can. She then joins the fight in Cairo. She telekinetically protects the group from Angel's metal wings. After Xavier is saved, he mentally links with her and reveals to Apocalypse that he is not the most powerful psychic, and convinces Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers. Her eyes glowing with an orangey-golden light, the powerful young Mutant's walks through midair and within a matter of seconds, a massive burst of telekinetic energy explodes outward from within Jean's body, almost instantaneously taking the shape of a great, fiery bird. With a single powerful scream that is as much verbal as it is mental, Jean Grey incinerates Apocalypse and helps to psychically restore and revive Professor Xavier. She is last seen helping to re-build the mansion, alongside Erik Lensherr, before joining Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Quicksilver, under the leadership of Hank and Raven, to become the new official team of X-Men and preparing to test her powers in her very first Danger Room session against a group of Mark I Sentinels.|$|E
