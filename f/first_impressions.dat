She was the {{daughter}} of Richard Jennings (or Jenyns), a Member of Parliament, and Frances Thornhurst; her paternal grandfather was Sir John Jennings, father, by his wife Alice Spencer, of an extraordinarily large family. Her uncle (Martin Lister) was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings came into contact with James, Duke of York (the future James II, brother of King Charles II), in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent (Agney Court) that had been the property of his mother-in-law, Susan Lister (nee Temple). James's <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, Frances, was appointed maid of honour to the Duchess of York, Anne Hyde.|$|E

The tour's setlist song pool was determined by a fan vote on their entire song catalog (excluding <b>First</b> <b>Impressions).</b> Thrice's second live album, Anthology, was released on October 30, 2012 on two CDs and as a quadruple 180 gram LP box set limited to 3000 copies, and features 24 songs recorded at select shows along the tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the band}} self-released an EP titled <b>First</b> <b>Impressions</b> {{which was the}} product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios with Brian Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them out of their cars. Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released Identity Crisis on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for Children and Families. More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued Identity Crisis, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E

25|$|<b>First</b> <b>impressions</b> {{are based}} {{on a wide range of}} characteristics: age, race, culture, language, gender, {{physical}} appearance, accent, posture, voice, number of people present, and time allowed to process. The <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> individuals give to others could greatly influence how they are treated and viewed in many contexts of everyday life.|$|E
25|$|One's <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> are {{affected}} by {{whether he or she}} is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> more because the collective first impression tends to remain stable over time. Solo experiences tend to facilitate local processing, causing the viewer to take a more critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are more likely to experience an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual viewers will like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if it is really the same quality.|$|E

25|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo.

25|$|It takes just {{one-tenth of}} a second for us to judge someone and make a first impression. Research finds that the more time {{participants}} are afforded to form the impression, the more confidence in impressions they report. Not only are people quick to form <b>first</b> <b>impressions,</b> they are also fairly accurate when the target presents him or herself genuinely. People are generally not good at perceiving feigned emotions or detecting lies. Research participants who reported forming accurate impressions of specific targets did {{tend to have more}} accurate perceptions of specific targets that aligned with others' reports of the target. Individuals are also fairly reliable at understanding the first impression that he/she will project to others.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{different}} qualities are detected in <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> {{may be linked to}} what has been important to survival from an evolutionary perspective. For example, trustworthiness and attractiveness were the two traits most quickly detected and evaluated in a study of human faces. People are fairly good at assessing personality traits of others in general, but {{there appears to be a}} difference in first impression judgments between older and younger adults. Older adults judged young adult target photos as healthier, more trustworthy, and less hostile, but more aggressive, than younger adults did of the same photos. Older adults could have a lower response to negative cues due to a slower processing speed, causing them to see facial features on young adults as more positive than younger adults do.|$|E
