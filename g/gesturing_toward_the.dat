For example, early in Defending Your Life (1991), Brooks’s recently deceased character, Albert, finds himself in an afterlife nightclub, watching a terrible comedian. “How’d you die?” the comic asks him; Albert replies, “Onstage, like you.” Later, Meryl Streep's character invites Albert to leave with her. “I can’t,” he says, <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stage. “That’s my father.” ...|$|E

Some contend Ruth's extended arm is pointing more to the left field direction, toward the Cubs bench, which would be consistent with his (continued) <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bench while rounding the bases after the hit. Others who have studied the film closely assert that in addition to the broader gestures, Ruth did make a quick finger point in the direction of Cubs pitcher Charlie Root, or center field just as Root was winding up.|$|E

40|$|The {{frontispiece}} to the Jesuit priest Guilielmus Gumppenberg’s book Atlas marianus, {{first published}} in 1657, illustrates {{a story of the}} miraculous transport of the Virgin Mary’s house in Nazareth to Loreto, Italy.

The engraving shows a team of angels transporting the Virgin Mary’s humble dwelling to its destination. Beams of light emanate from the bottom of the house, which is covered by images of the Madonna with the Christ Child.

40|$|<b>Gesturing</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> Ellipsis’ is an {{installation}} work comprising {{two lines of}} poetry that intersecting spatially across an ellipsis. The first line of poetry is placed on a window inside The Slade School of Fine Art; the second line is situated in the portico space fronting University College London, with one word placed {{on the base of}} seven out of ten columns. The ellipsis connecting the two lines is constructed by wrapping layers of black felt around the bottoms of the three remaining columns, with part of the their surface remaining exposed. Reading the line of text outside, these three exposed surfaces form an ellipsis {{at the end of that}} line. Reading the text inside, a perspectival foreshortening allows the black felt to be read as an ellipsis at the end of the text inscribed on the window. The result is an elliptical connection between the two lines through a visual construct of punctuation. Meanwhile, the viewer’s movement down the stairs, through the doorway, across the quadrangle and into the portico space (and vice versa) enacts a spatial practice of punctuation: a meandering and embodied connection between the two lines...|$|E
40|$|This thesis traces a subtle, but central, {{concern of}} Blanchot’s works: that of {{childhood}} {{and its relation}} to the silence in language. Beginning with an in-depth analysis of the commentary surrounding the fragment from Blanchot’s text, The Writing of the Disaster (1980), titled ‘(A primal scene?) ’, our introduction and first two chapters examines the way that Freud and Blanchot come into conjunction with one another through their shared focus on the importance of the origin {{and its relation to}} the silence of the Other. From here, we move into an examination of Blanchot’s use of fragmentary writing. Our aim is to demonstrate {{the manner in which the}} ‘secret’ in which the child of ‘(A primal scene?) ’ shall ‘live henceforth’ enters into a relationship with the ‘nondialectical’ Other; the Other that (or who) for Blanchot enables language to be possible within the realms of the impossible. This will lead us into an examination of the theme of childhood as it occurs more generally throughout Blanchot’s oeuvre. Examining the works of Louis-René des Forêts alongside Blanchot’s texts ‘The Last Word’ and A Voice from Elsewhere, we will argue that, when Blanchot writes that childhood is the period of ‘the impossibility of speaking’, he is <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> way that childhood and death are incorporated into the adult’s language through the silence that both maintain within the Self. We will conclude by arguing that, for Blanchot, the reason that ‘every poet is Narcissus’ is because every poet is turned away from herself in the act of writing, thereby allowing the silence of childhood and death to come forth as the ‘secret’ of language...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} theorizes {{the place}} of Latin American fiction from the 1990 s and the 2000 s within a global framework by studying ways in which authors reflect upon the experience of globalization and situate themselves {{beyond the boundaries of}} national literatures. In particular, it analyzes a set of disruptive practices that lay in-between spaces among the verbal, the performative, and the visual. By <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> global, these phenomena seek to estrange and re-mediate power relations both within literary canons and across worldwide cultural hegemonies. Through them, authors not only address globalization as a literary topic, but claim an active role in imagining the global. The interest of this study is thus twofold, for while such a gesturing distinguishes contemporary authors who otherwise do not claim to form a generational movement or aesthetic, it also invites a reconfiguration of received ideas about global culture. Among such phenomena, I study appropriations of the concerns and methods of contemporary art, parody of celebrity culture, and representations of alternative models of globalization. The first of four chapters shows how Cesar Aira's motif of the sonrisa seria calls for readers to critically explore the relationship between iconic images, what these represent beyond the realm of the national, and their function within visual displays of power. The second chapter analyzes Aira and Mario Bellatin's borrowings from conceptualism and performance art as they bear upon the problems of the circulation of books and the commodification of the presence of the author in a world market. The third chapter presents how, by imagining Medellin as the capital of the world, Fernando Vallejo carries out a transcendental exploration of the limits of the visual as an instrument for mediation between local, national, and global realms. Lastly, the fourth chapter considers the reasons behind the persistent choice of Nazism, as it is represented in pop culture, as a distressing backdrop for contemporary reflections on globalized politics in Roberto Bolano, Jorge Volpi and Ignacio Padilla. 2018 - 07 - 3...|$|E
