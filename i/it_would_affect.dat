5|$|Although Parker {{had promised}} to hold auditions for {{students}} attending the Performing Arts, the school was initially advised by the Board of Education to prevent the students from working on the film, fearing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> their studies. It was later announced that filming would occur during the summer when the students were not attending school. Parker distributed casting call advertisements at the Performing Arts school and the High School of Music & Art.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it was an}} open trial, the 500-page {{indictment}} was {{not made}} public. Media representatives petitioned for its release, but it was denied by judge Viriato Manuel Pinheiro de Lima, who said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> witnesses' thoughts and testimony. The prosecution charged Ao with having received {{millions of dollars in}} kickbacks for contracts, including those for the dome constructed for the 2005 East Asian Games, the Venetian and the Galaxy StarWorld Hotel, from Ho Meng-fai, Chairman of San Meng Fai Engineering and Construction Company.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs was an {{occasional}} medium-paced bowler who bowled a good length {{and made the}} ball swing. Some critics judged {{him to be a}} potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the wicket-keeper. Contemporaries believed him {{to be one of the}} best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.|$|E

5|$|To achieve full {{political}} control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) {{to a vote}} in the newly elected Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich")—gave Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution. Since <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the path}} of Emmy was {{uncertain}} whether <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the Lesser Antilles. As a result, officials issued a hurricane watch for the northeastern Leeward Islands. The warning was cancelled when the storm turned more to the north, with the outer fringes of the hurricane slightly impacting Antigua. Several ships experienced rough seas and strong winds from Emmy, though none reported any damage. After Emmy turned to the west for the final time, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center considered the hurricane not a real threat to land, though they indicated it had a remote chance to affect land masses. The hurricane also posed {{a threat to the}} island of Bermuda initially, though it remained away from the island. Two days before Emmy passed through the Azores, the National Hurricane Center advised citizens there to closely monitor the progress of the storm. No damage reports exist from the Azores, though it was likely not severe.|$|E

25|$|H.R. 4587 {{would impose}} {{sanctions}} against Venezuela and authorize appropriations to support {{civil society in}} that country. The bill’s provisions would expire two years after enactment. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4587 would cost $7 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the specified and estimated amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this legislation because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> direct spending and revenues; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant.|$|E

While he still advocated the post-war plan for industrial peace that the Communist Party, along with the leaders of the CIO, the AFL and the Chamber of Commerce, were advocating, he differed sharply with CIO leadership on Cold War politics. He had his own opinions about the Marshall Plan and the application of the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey, as well as participation in the World Federation of Trade Unions, viewing every element from the point of how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> his constituents.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the San Martinian Society {{requested}} to fence the monument {{after it was}} repeatedly vandalized.

In 2012, the municipal government of Neuquén made renewals on the monument. The Public Buildings and Transit Secretariat replaced the quicklime tiles of the roundabout for porphyr ones, that formed a sun-and-star shape. The National University of Comahue {{was in charge of}} the new illumination of the monument. On each of the twelve pointers of the star, metal cilynders were built to house lights that pointed toward the pedestal. Additional reflectors were placed on the top of the base to illuminate the statue.|$|E
25|$|The way the Polk {{administration}} {{handled the}} Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo demonstrated that Mexico {{had become a}} conquered nation. After the treaty reached Washington on February 19, 1848, Polk {{sent a message to}} Congress recommending two changes to the treaty. First, he wanted the insertion of a secret article protecting the treaty’s validity. Second, Polk asked for the deletion of Article X, which declared that the United States would respect land grants given by the Spanish and Mexican governments to residents of the conquered territories. This article was aimed specifically at protecting land grants in Texas, and Polk objected to it, arguing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the property grants made by the Texas republic following its independence.|$|E

On April 14, 2012, Momota succeeded famous child actress Mana Ashida as subhost of the Nippon Television show Meringue no Kimochi. At that time, neither she nor Momoiro Clover Z was widely known. But when in 2013 it was announced that she would leave the program after almost a year and a half, there were worries that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the popularity of the show. In August 2013, Momota became the first person to appear on both the front and back covers of an issue of QuickJapan magazine, which also published a lengthy interview with her.|$|E
25|$|The {{project is}} {{estimated}} to cost £16.42 billon (£9.86 bn at 2013 prices). A notice was published on 28 February 2014 in the Official Journal of the European Union asking for expressions of interest in building the trains. On 9 October 2014 TFL published a shortlist of those (Alstom, Siemens, Hitachi, CAF and Bombardier) who had {{expressed an interest in}} supplying 250 trains for between £1.0 billion and £2.5 billion, and on the same day opened an exhibition with a design by PriestmanGoode. The fully automated trains may be able to run without drivers, but the ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> safety. The Invitation to Tender for the trains was issued in January 2016; the specifications for the Piccadilly line infrastructure are expected in 2016, and the first train is due to run on the Piccadilly line in 2022.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{magnitude}} of mycorrhizal fungal inputs to the soil carbon pool, {{some have suggested that}} variation in the recalcitrance of mycorrhizal biomass may be important for predicting soil carbon storage, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> {{the rate at which the}} contribution of mycorrhizal fungi to soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere. The compound glomalin, produced only by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, has been found to accumulate in some soils, and may be a substantial fraction of the soil carbon pool in these ecosystems. However, a recent set of experiments demonstrates the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi results in net losses of soil carbon, calling into question the role of glomalin produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi leading to increased soil carbon storage. Proteomic work has revealed that most of the proteins isolated in the glomalin extraction are not of mycorrhizal origin, and therefore the contribution of this molecule to soil C storage has likely been overestimated.|$|E
