The sorption isosteric heat computed from the water activity (A,) sorption isosteric model developed in this study showed good agreements with the values calculated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation or from calorimetric method. As the A, model had the better fitting performance, the sorption isosteric beat values calculated from the water activity sorption isosteric model were more close to the sorption isosteric heat values obtained from other methods.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{concern about}} environmental degradation, {{it is desirable}} to decrease energy consumption in all sectors. Drying {{has been reported to}} account for anywhere from 12 to 20 % of the energy consumption in the industrial sector. Drying processes {{are one of the most}} energy intensive unit operations. There are a number of approaches to reduce energy consumption in dryers. This paper reviews some novel strategies used to decrease energy consumption in drying operations. Drying conditions can be modified or the <b>drying</b> <b>equipments</b> can be modified to increase overall efficiencies. Hybrid drying techniques can also be used, such as combining vacuum or convective drying with electro-technologies (microwave, radio frequency, infrared heating). There is much debate on how to define drying and energy efficiencies.

50|$|Also in 1954, a major {{decision}} faced management. The {{issue was}} whether to buy new, more efficient, <b>dry</b> cleaning <b>equipment</b> {{that would increase}} productivity and provide better service to their customers or wait, because (1) management knew their <b>dry</b> cleaning <b>equipment</b> was fairly new and had been kept in excellent condition, (2) the country {{was in the midst}} of a recession, (3) business, in general, was leveling off throughout the nation due to the recession, and (4) economists warned companies to proceed with caution.

They felt that much of the growth was attributed to the company’s policy of giving the public better and better service. The new system of dry cleaning appeared to offer a superior way of processing garments and improving service. After weighing the pros and cons, they decided to spend more than $40,000 ($335,943 in 2011 dollars) for the new <b>dry</b> cleaning <b>equipment.</b> The new equipment replaced a number of smaller dry cleaning units, freed up more production space, and released employees for other work in the plant. Two dry cleaners could now do the work of three and spotting work decreased by 70%.

5000|$|Solvent inks: The main {{ingredient}} of these inks are {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks {{is that they are}} comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special <b>drying</b> <b>equipment,</b> usually a combination of heaters and blowers.

30|$|The impact {{fretting}} wear has largely occurred at nuclear power device {{induced by the}} flow-induced vibration, {{and it will take}} potential hazards to the service of the equipment. However, the present study focuses on the tangential {{fretting wear}} of alloy 690 tubes. Research on impact fretting wear of alloy 690 tubes is limited and the related research is imminent. Therefore, impact fretting wear behavior of alloy 690 tubes against 304 stainless steels is investigated. Deionized water is used to simulate the flow environment of the <b>equipment,</b> and the <b>dry</b> environment is used for comparison. Varied analytical techniques are employed to characterize the wear and tribochemical behavior during impact fretting wear. Characterization results indicate that cracks occur at high impact load in both water and dry equipment; however, the water as a medium can significantly delay the cracking time. The crack propagation behavior shows a jagged shape in the water, but crack extended disorderly in <b>dry</b> <b>equipment</b> because the water changed the stress distribution and retarded the friction heat during the wear process. The SEM and XPS analysis shows that the main failure mechanisms of the tube under impact fretting are fatigue wear and friction oxidation. The effect of medium(water) on fretting wear is revealed, which plays a potential and promising role in the service of nuclear power device and other flow equipments.|$|R
