500|$|A patent {{application}} for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer-cancer promoting mutations, {{as well as}} methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994; [...] over the next year, Myriad, in collaboration with other investigators, isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene and identified relevant mutations, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and the other institutions in 1995. [...] Myriad is the <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs. [...] This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit. [...] The patents begin to expire in 2014.|$|E

500|$|Mario & Sonic {{was officially}} {{announced}} with a joint press release by Sega and Nintendo on March 28, 2007 and premiered at E3 2007. In another showing of the {{collaboration between the}} two companies, the game was predominantly developed by the Sega Sports R Department of Sega Japan {{under the supervision of}} Shigeru Miyamoto. He served as senior producer. Sega's Osamu Ohashi and Nintendo's Hiroshi Sato served as producers, Eigo Kasahara as director, and Teruhiko Nakagawa as composer. Racjin and according to gaming site IGN, TOSE, a developer known to avoid crediting itself in its works, helped to develop Mario & Sonic. The game is officially licensed by the IOC through <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensee</b> ISM and is the first official video game of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. The president of Sega Europe stated that they originally planned a number of events, including judo, to fully epitomize the Olympics. However, the figure for the final product was reduced and judo was omitted. The development of the game was swifter than planned; in October 2007, Sega announced that Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games scheduled release date for the Wii has been advanced by two weeks and the game had gone gold. It was released in 2007 in North America on November 6, in Australasia and Japan on November 22, in Europe on November 23, and in Korea on May 29, 2008. The DS version followed in 2008 in Japan on January 17, in North America on January 22, in Australasia on February 7, in Europe on February 8, and in South Korea on June 26. Both versions were published by Nintendo for Japan (where it is known as [...] ) and by Sega for North America, Europe and all other regions.|$|E

5000|$|An {{assignment}} is simple {{transfer of the}} ownership of the copyright. Section 13(5) of the Copyright Act states that [...] "where, under any partial assignment of copyright, the assignee becomes entitled to any right comprised in copyright, the assignee ... shall be treated {{for the purposes of}} this act as the owner of the copyright ..." [...] Generally, assignments are distinct from exclusive licenses because exclusive licenses are revocable by the owner of the copyright and because <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees</b> cannot transfer their rights without authorization from the owner.|$|R

However, four foreign organizations are allowed to sue {{on behalf of their}} members because they have that right under foreign law.

40|$|Universities {{that own}} patents have a problem. While nearly all are keen {{to enhance their}} revenue {{generated}} from patents, few are eager or prepared to enforce them in court, alone or with their <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees,</b> should a third party deploy a product or process covered by a university-owned patent. Yet strict prudential standing requirements imposed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) effectively require university participation as plaintiffs in enforcement lawsuits over their exclusively licensed patents, regardless of a university’s effective ability or enthusiasm {{to participate in a}} given action. Supported by forty years of lawsuit data and original survey and interview data collected from high-level administrators at universities that litigate patents, this Article explores in depth the complicated legal and policy tensions presented by university participation as plaintiffs in patent infringement litigation. I offer two proposals for alleviating these tensions. The first proposal urges universities to move toward a coherent position on patent ownership and enforcement, particularly in light of recent trends in higher education finance. The second proposal outlines a potential legislative amendment to the Patent Act that would allow universities to enjoy the revenue-generation aspect of patent ownership while freeing them from the legal compulsion to participate as co-plaintiffs with their <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees</b> in enforcement actions. This novel tweaking of the CAFC’s prudential standing requirement would save universities untold time and money that they currently spend pursuing litigation. By permitting universities to focus more on innovation and less on litigation, this proposal also would better align societal expectations for university commercialization efforts with the public interest...|$|R
50|$|Since French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007, this {{expression}} {{is used in}} almost all the articles of the French Intellectual Property Code relating to the saisie-contrefaçon {{to refer to the}} person entitled to request it. Simply put, the persons having standing to request a saisie-contrefaçon are generally the holders of the allegedly infringed intellectual property right and the <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees</b> - after the right holder has been notified and yet taken no action. The person having standing to request the saisie-contrefaçon does not have to provide evidence of the alleged infringement as the saisie-contrefaçon precise goal is to gather evidence. However, the requesting party must duly justify both the existence of an intellectual property right in force and its standing to request the saisie-contrefaçon.|$|R

5|$|In a rare move, District Judge Earnest Lau {{released}} a 14-page judgment explaining the court's denial of Odex's request for Pacific Internet's client information. He compared Odex's demands to an Anton Piller order, which {{provides for the}} right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. Seen as draconian, it is only used under extreme circumstances. He held that only copyright holders themselves, or their <b>exclusive</b> <b>licensees,</b> can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders. Out of all the anime licensed to Odex, only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company. The judge noted that, out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court, ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS), not Odex, to act for the copyright holders. Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$7,000.|$|R
