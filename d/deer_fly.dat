50|$|<b>Deer</b> <b>flies</b> are a genus of horse-flies (Tabanidae). They have {{coloured}} {{eyes and}} dark bands across their wings. While female <b>deer</b> <b>flies</b> feed on blood, males instead collect pollen. When feeding, females use knife-like mandibles and maxillae {{to make a}} cross-shaped incision and then lap up the blood. Their bite can be painful, but many bites are not noticed at the time, especially if the victim is distracted. Allergic reaction from the saliva of the fly can result in further discomfort and health concerns. Pain and itch {{are the most common}} symptoms, but more significant allergic reactions can develop.|$|R

Horse-flies (genus Tabanus) are larger, up to 25 mm in length and are mostly dark brown or black, with dark eyes, often with a metallic sheen. Yellow flies (genus Diachlorus) are similar in shape to <b>deer</b> <b>flies</b> but have yellowish bodies and the eyes are purplish-black with a green sheen.

50|$|Loa loa infective larvae (L3) are {{transmitted}} to humans by <b>deer</b> <b>fly</b> vectors, Chrysops silica and C. dimidiata. The vectors are blood-sucking and day-biting, {{and they are}} found in rainforest-like environments in west and central Africa. Infective larvae (L3) mature to adults (L5) in the subcutaneous tissues of the human host, after which the adult worms—assuming presence of a male and female worm—mate and produce microfilariae. The cycle of infection continues when a non-infected mango or <b>deer</b> <b>fly</b> takes a blood meal from a microfilaremic human host, and {{this stage of the}} transmission is possible due to the combination of the diurnal periodicity of microfilariae and the day-biting tendencies of the Chrysops spp.|$|E

50|$|Snipes feed {{mainly on}} insect larva. Snipes also eat actual fly such as crane, horse and <b>deer</b> <b>fly</b> {{as well as}} beetle, dragonfly, cricket, grasshopper, ant, mayfly, butterfly, caddisfly and moth. Other {{invertebrate}} prey include snail, crustacean, and worm. The snipe's bill allows the very tip to remain closed while the snipe slurps up invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|The {{bite of the}} mango fly can be very painful, {{possibly}} due to the laceration style employed; {{rather than}} puncturing the skin like a mosquito does, the mango (and <b>deer</b> <b>fly)</b> make a laceration in the skin and subsequently lap up blood. Female flies require {{a fair amount of}} blood for their aforementioned reproductive purposes and thus may take multiple blood meals from the same host if disturbed during the first one.|$|E
50|$|Deer flies (also {{known as}} yellow flies, june flies, or stouts in Atlantic Canada) are {{flies in the}} genus Chrysops of the family Tabanidae that can be pests to cattle, horses, and humans. Otherwise similar in size and {{appearance}} to the ubiquitous housefly, the distinguishing characteristic of a <b>deer</b> <b>fly</b> is patterned gold or green eyes. The name of the genus refers to their coloration, from the Ancient Greek χρυσός (chrysós), gold, and ὤψ (ops), appearance.|$|E
50|$|Loa loa is {{transmitted}} by {{several species of}} tabanid flies (Order: Diptera; Family: Tabanidae). Although horseflies of the Tabanus genus are often mentioned as Loa vectors, the two prominent vector are from the Chrysops genus of tabanids—C. silacea and C. dimidiata. These species exist only in Africa and are popularly known as <b>deer</b> <b>flies</b> and mango, or mangrove, flies.|$|R
50|$|Two {{well-known}} genera are {{the common}} horse-flies, Tabanus, named by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, and the <b>deer</b> <b>flies,</b> Chrysops, {{named by the}} German entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1802.

5000|$|... is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by thread-like parasitic filarial worms called nematode worms, all transmitted by mosquitoes. Loa loa is another filarial parasite transmitted by the <b>deer</b> <b>fly.</b> 120 {{million people are}} infected worldwide. It is carried by over half {{the population in the}} most severe endemic areas. The most noticeable symptom is elephantiasis: a thickening of the skin and underlying tissues. Elephantiasis is caused by chronic infection by filarial worms in the lymph nodes. This clogs the lymph nodes and slows the draining of lymph fluid from a portion of the body.|$|E
50|$|F. tularensis {{has been}} {{reported}} in birds, reptiles, fish, invertebrates, and mammals including humans. Despite this, no case of tularemia {{has been shown to be}} initiated by human-to-human transmission. Rather, tularemia is caused by contact with infected animals or vectors such as ticks, mosquitos, and <b>deer</b> <b>flies.</b> Reservoir hosts of importance can include lagomorphs (e.g. rabbits), rodents, galliform birds, and deer.|$|R

In this area the Shoshone were often known by white people as the Snakes. By late August, the band was short of supplies, particularly good horses, guns, and ammunition. Has No Horse traveled east along the Oregon Trail to meet his uncle, <b>Deer</b> <b>Fly</b> and borrow soldiers from him. Now reinforced, he identified the Clark party as his target.|$|E
50|$|There are {{official}} hunting {{seasons for}} the grouse, deer and bears, with a state-run lottery system for awarding moose-hunting licences. Char including squaretail, togue, and isolated populations of blueback trout {{are the best}} known fish of the rivers and lakes. Black fly, mosquito, <b>deer</b> <b>fly,</b> and midge populations can be significant from late spring through early autumn. The Maine North Woods are also home to the endangered Canada lynx, bald eagle and the Furbish lousewort, a rare plant that is found only in the Saint John River Valley. Animals which have disappeared from the woods during European settlement include caribou and gray wolf.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{believe that}} geo-mapping of {{appropriate}} habitat and human settlement patterns may, {{with the use}} of predictor variables such as forest, land cover, rainfall, temperature, and soil type, allow for estimation of Loa loa transmission in the absence of point-of-care diagnostic tests. In addition to geo-mapping and chemoprophylaxis, the same preventative strategies used for malaria should be undertaken to avoid contraction of loiasis. Specifically, DEET-containing insect repellent, permethrin-soaked clothing, and thick, long-sleeved and long-legged clothing ought to be worn to decrease susceptibility to the bite of the mango or <b>deer</b> <b>fly</b> vector. Because the vector is day-biting, mosquito (bed) nets do not increase protection against loiasis.|$|E
50|$|Parasites use {{a variety}} of methods to infect hosts. For example, the Acanthamoeba enters the body when the {{environment}} is not hostile, and Strongyloides stercoralis enters the body when a host steps on infected ground while barefoot. Many parasites enter the food of their hosts and wait to be eaten. Plasmodium malariae uses a mosquito host to transmit malaria, and Loa loa parasites use <b>deer</b> <b>flies</b> to enter hosts.|$|R
