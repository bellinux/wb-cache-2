In 2006, Rhoades published an article looking at whether the Auditory Verbal approach was justified. Using Frattali’s system for weighing the strength of treatment evidence based {{on the degree of}} scientific rigour, she found 7 studies concerning the AV approach of class II level evidence. She concluded that even with the minimal number of studies, there was evidence [...] "for the validity and effectiveness of the A-V intervention model". Following on from Rhoades’ work, Hogan et al. (2008; 2010) published outcomes for children in an AV programme which were essentially quasi-experimental studies in that the assessment tool used had been standardised on typically developing children and so a comparison could be drawn between the age equivalence scores obtained by the children on the study and their chronological or ‘hearing’ age. (The <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> of a child is the duration of time since the child has had optimal access to sound.) In these studies, the average rate of language development increased significantly during the time on the programme compared to the average rate of language development prior to embarking on the programme. Dornan et al. (2009) reviewed the evidence for Auditory Verbal Therapy and concluded that while {{it was not possible to}} demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between the intervention and the outcome, increasing the strength of evidence for outcomes was vital. In 2010, Dornan et al. published a longitudinal study comparing the outcomes of 29 children enrolled on an AV programme with age-matched controls. They found AV to be an effective intervention.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: {{to analyze}} {{auditory}} and oral communication behaviors {{in a group}} of children and adolescents, users of cochlear implants and to establish a relationship with factors that interfere with aural rehabilitation. Methods: participants were 13 children or adolescents with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Standardized procedures were applied to check: the auditory and oral communication behaviors of participants and their relationships with the child's age at diagnosis period; the interval between diagnosis and intervention, adaptation onset of the cochlear implant; the <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> and aural rehabilitation period. Results: statistically significant data were found to correlate the interval between diagnosis and intervention with the scores in the evaluation procedures of oral communication. Conclusion: there was {{a significant impact on the}} development of oral communication when the period elapsed between the diagnosis and intervention was analyzed, in such way that the faster the intervention time, the better the results. It was also evident that the earlier the beginning of the use of cochlear implants, the greater the <b>hearing</b> <b>age,</b> and the longer the rehabilitation period, the better the scores in the procedures that evaluated auditory and verbal development...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Over {{the last}} 10 years more than 300 persons {{received}} cochlear implant in Serbia {{and more than}} 90 % of the recipients were children under 10 years of age. The program of cochlear implantation includes postoperative rehabilitation in which cognitive, integrative and developmental methods are used. The {{study was conducted to}} reveal factors affecting communication performance (CP) of cochlear implanted (CI) children. Special attention was focused on the influence of the duration and intensity of rehabilitation and <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> on further development of communication skills. Methods. A group of 30 CI children (13 boys and 17 girls) aged 2 to 5 years was enrolled in the study. All of the children had average intelligence and no other developmental disorder. They lived in families and attended rehabilitative seances 3 to 5 times a week. Their parents/ caregivers answered structured questionnaire about functioning after pediatric cochlear implantation (FAPCI) and the results were the subject of detailed statistical analysis. Results. Analysis of variance did not show any difference between the boys and the girls regarding FAPCI achievements (F (1, 28) = 2. 909; p = 0. 099) and age aberration in CP score (F (1, 28) = 0. 114, p = 0. 738). Correlation analysis showed a statistically significant difference in FAPCI scores related to <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> and duration of rehabilitation. Regression analysis (enter method) showed that model consisting of indipendent variables significantly contributed to prediction of overall FAPCI scores and Adjusted R 2 value could explain 32 % difference in communication skills of participants in this study. Conclusion. Communication skills of CI children evaluated by FAPCI are falling behind normatives for normal hearing children 18. 6 months on the average. <b>Hearing</b> <b>age,</b> duration and intensity of rehabilitation have positive predictive value for communication skills development. Later identification of hearing loss and later cochlear implantation lead to delayed development of communication skills.

O ABFW- Teste de Linguagem Infantil nas Áreas de Fonologia, Vocabulário, Fluência e Pragmática é um teste que avalia também o vocabulário e pode ser usado com essas crianças. Objetivo: Avaliar o vocabulário de crianças usuárias de Implante Coclear. Método: O estudo foi feito com 16 crianças que realizaram a cirurgia de IC entre 08 meses e 04 anos e 04 meses de idade. Cinco grupos foram formados: Grupo 01, 03 crianças com idade auditiva entre 01 ano e 01 ano e 11 meses, usuárias de implante coclear unilateral. Grupo 02, 03 crianças com idade auditiva entre 01 ano e 01 ano e 11 meses de idade, porém com implante bilateral. Grupo 03, 03 crianças com idade auditiva entre 02 anos e 02 anos e 11 meses. Grupo 04, 03 crianças com idade auditiva entre 03 anos e 03 anos e 11 meses. Grupo 05, 04 crianças com idade auditiva entre 04 anos e 04 anos e 11 meses. Resultados: No teste de vocabulário quando se compararam as crianças usuárias de IC, levando em conta a idade de desenvolvimento auditivo {{cerebral}} x idade cronológica de crianças ouvintes, todas as crianças usuárias de implante apresentaram desempenho melhor. Na comparação entre crianças com implante unilateral x bilateral, estas últimas demonstraram melhores resultados. Quando comparados o desempenho no teste levando em consideração a idade cronológica tanto das crianças surdas quanto das crianças ouvintes, estas últimas obtiveram melhor desempenho, porém há aproximação de resultados com uso efetivo do IC e presença na reabilitação auditiva. Conclusão: O vocabulário de crianças usuárias de IC deste presente estudo se assemelha ao vocabulário de crianças ouvintes. Com uso efetivo do IC e assiduidade na terapia fonoaudiológica as crianças deficientes auditivas conseguem alcançar seus pares ouvintes aos 05 anos de idade. O teste de vocabulário, embora com resultados preliminares, se mostrou uma medida efetiva para observar as lacunas, controlar e direcionar a terapia fonoaudiológica para o desenvolvimento pleno das habilidades de linguagem e fala destas crianças. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIntroduction: In {{order to}} have a better knowledge about the development of language skills in cochlear implant (CI) users it is necessary to evaluate the speech of these subjects using appropriate tests. The ABFW- Child Language Test is a tool that relates to various areas: phonology, vocabulary, fluency and pragmatics, and that can be used with cochlear implant users {{for the purposes of this}} study. Objective: To evaluate the vocabulary of children who are cochlear implant users. Method: This study evaluated 16 children who had CI surgery between 08 and 52 months of age. The subjects were divided in five groups according to the age at the time of the CI activation, as follows: Group 1 : 3 children implanted unilaterally with <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> between 12 and 23 months of age; Group 2 : children implanted bilaterally with <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> between 12 months and 23 months of age; Group 3 : 3 children implanted unilaterally with <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> between 24 and 35 months of age; Group 4 : 3 children implanted unilaterally with <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> between 36 and 47 months of age and Group 5 : 4 children implanted unilaterally with <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> between 48 years and 59 months of age. Results: In the vocabulary test, when comparing CI users considering the auditory brain development age and the chronological age of normal hearing children, all CI users performed better than the standards for normal hearing children. When comparing children with unilateral and bilateral CI, the bilateral cochlear implant users showed better results. When comparing test performance considering the chronological age, normal hearing children performed better, but the results were similar in CI users that systematically use the device and attend auditory rehabilitation sessions. Conclusion: The vocabulary of CI users in the present study was similar to normal hearing children’s vocabulary. The vocabulary test proved to be an effective measure to observe the gaps in development and helped the conduction of speech therapy in order to achieve the full development of speech and language skills of these children...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{tries to}} {{evaluate}} different factors on communication ability outcomes in cochlear implanted children. Methods: Communication abilities are studied using the validated APCEI-scale based on five {{components of the}} language: cochlear implant acceptance, perceptive language performance, comprehension of the oral orders, expressive language and speech intelligibility. APCEI-scores were calculated every 6 months for the first 2 years, then yearly. The studied variables were: gender, social origin, preoperative residual <b>hearing,</b> <b>age,</b> aetiology of hearing loss, and associated disabilities. Results: Communication ability scores increased with high socioeconomic level, presence of residual hearing, younger patients when no residual hearing, connexin mutation related deafness, and absence of associated disabilities. No significant difference has been noted between both sexes. Conclusion: Many different factors influence the evolution of communication abilities of cochlear implanted children. Investigating the cause of hearing loss, presence of associated disabilities and residual hearing before surgery may help to predict outcome and plan appropriate care to those children with negative predictive factors.

A pilot study showed that the IMP quantified typical infant vocal development as a function of chronological age/normal hearing experience (birth to 12 months).

40|$|Within the {{population}} of children with profound hearing loss, children who use cochlear implants (CIs) have much better speech and language development than children who use hearing aids. However, CI users still perform more poorly than children with normal hearing (NH).

This study analyzes initial consonant accuracy in real words and nonwords for 18 children with bilateral CIs between age 4; 0 and 9; 2 and for two comparison groups of children with NH. The accuracy of word-initial singletons /t/, /d/, /k/, /g / and word-initial clusters /tw/, /kw/, and /kj / in real words and nonwords were examined.

40|$|Though {{previous}} findings report that hearing impaired children exhibit impaired language and arithmetic skills, our current {{understanding of how}} hearing and the associated language impairments may influence the development of arithmetic skills is still limited.

On the other hand, however, children with CI exhibited very circumscribed difficulties associated with place-value processing. Performance declined specifically when subtraction required a borrow procedure and number line estimation required the integration of units, tens, and hundreds instead of only units and tens. Thus, it seems that despite initially atypical language development, children with CI are able to acquire arithmetic skills in a qualitatively similar fashion as their normal hearing peers.

40|$|Introduction: In recent years, {{music has}} been {{employed}} in many intervention and rehabilitation program to enhance cognitive abilities in patients. Numerous researches show that music therapy can help improving language skills in patients including hearing impaired. In this study, a new method of music training is introduced based on principles of neuroscience and capabilities of Persian language to optimize language development in deaf children after implantation.     Materials and Methods: The candidate children are classified in three groups according to their <b>hearing</b> <b>age</b> and language development. The music training program is established and centered on four principles, as follows: hearing and listening to music (with special attention to boost hearing), singing, rhythmic movements with music and playing musical instruments.   Results: Recently much {{research has demonstrated that}} even after cochlear implant operation, a child cannot acquire language to the same level of detail as a normal child. As a result of this study music could compensate this developmental delay. It is known that the greater the area of the brain that is activated, the more synaptic learning and plasticity changes occur in that specific area. According to the principles of neural plasticity, music could improve language skills by activating the same areas for language processing in the brain.   Conclusion:  In conclusion, the effects of music on the human brain seem to be very promising and therapeutic in various types of disorders and conditions, including cochlear implantation...|$|E
40|$|The {{cochlear}} implant (CI) gives severely hearing impaired to profoundly deaf children access to auditory speech input and consequently stimulates their oral language development. However, speech perception with a CI {{is still not}} optimal. Therefore, these children develop oral language based on reduced auditory speech input. This dissertation aims at enhancing our knowledge of whether a CI provides sufficient access to auditory speech input to acquire verbal morphology. It takes a new perspective regarding the research on morphology acquisition in CI children. The outcomes of the children under investigation are not only compared to those of their normal hearing peers, but also to those of their specific language impaired (SLI) peers. The latter group {{is known to be}} particularly delayed in their acquisition of verbal morphology. One of the major findings of this dissertation is that CI children outperform their SLI peers in the production of verbal morphology. Remarkably, they are even able to catch up with their normal hearing peers. Nevertheless, their spontaneous speech samples contain more verb inflection errors as compared to similar samples from normal hearing peers. In this respect CI children compare to their SLI peers. The results of the CI children are further analyzed as a function of their age at implantation and <b>hearing</b> <b>age.</b> Additional emphasis is given to the role of perceptual salience in the acquisition of morphology.
