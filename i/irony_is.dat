25|$|The final <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> {{enduring}} fame: Malley {{is better}} known and more widely read today than either McAuley or Stewart.|$|E
25|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that Nately {{actually}} {{sees his}} friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe and Dunbar whom his parents {{would not be}} impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”.|$|E
25|$|<b>Irony</b> <b>is</b> one of Austen's most {{characteristic}} {{and most}} discussed literary techniques. She contrasts the plain {{meaning of a}} statement with the comic, undermining {{the meaning of the}} original to create ironic disjunctions. In her juvenile works, she relies upon satire, parody and irony based on incongruity. Her mature novels employ irony to foreground social hypocrisy.|$|E
50|$|The next day, the {{breaking}} news {{was about the}} tragedy. However, the <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> there was no actual or visible fire.|$|R
60|$|De Marmont's triumph too {{was hard}} to bear: his clumsy <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> terribly galling.|$|R
60|$|The tone {{of bitter}} <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> {{lost on the}} dulled {{perceptions}} of this miserable coward.|$|R
25|$|Having {{assembled}} an {{army that}} {{was close to}} the Carthaginian one in size if not in skill, the Roman dictator had the choice of seeking battle with Hannibal or trying a new ploy. Fabius was about to pull something similar to Hamilcar Barca's strategy on Hamilcar's own son Hannibal. The <b>irony</b> <b>is,</b> Fabius was not lacking in manpower like Hamilcar, nor would he fight a static campaign.|$|E
25|$|One <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> {{that given}} the {{association}} of the flag with Chinese nationalism in opposition to Taiwan independence, the ROC flag has found an unexpected ally in the People's Republic of China. The PRC has criticized Taiwan independence groups for wishing to change or abolish the ROC flag, and has implied that legal steps {{to do so would}} bring a strongly negative reaction from the PRC.|$|E
25|$|The band's final {{show will}} be taking place at Terminal 5 in New York City on December 29, 2017. They will be {{supported}} by Code Orange and Daughters. The band will also will play two additional shows before the final on December 27 and 28. For the first show the band announced that Mike Patton would be joining the band to perform their collaborative EP, <b>Irony</b> <b>Is</b> a Dead Scene, and will be supported by God Mother.|$|E
25|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that by {{the time}} the story was published, the Bikini Club had been gone for over a year.|$|R
6000|$|... "And the officer's idea of caressing <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> to let {{you think}} you could escape equally well by being {{perfectly}} candid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lady Augusta stared—my <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> lost on her. ‘She didn’t have time, so {{she gave}} me a chance first; because {{unfortunately}} I go to-morrow to Bigwood.’ ...|$|R
25|$|Both tickets offer All-Star Game goers {{unmatched}} {{vantage points}} in Busch Stadium at prices that are significantly discounted {{from the market}} value of a professional game. The opportunity to get an autograph from a Hall of Famer is a complimentary bonus. The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that Lou Brock was asked to participate in the event long before the connection was made between the Lewis & Clark Baseball League and the St. Louis great's full name: Louis Clark Brock.|$|E
25|$|Here, Ellis touches {{upon the}} often {{paradoxical}} nature of widely reported consensual S practices. It {{is described as}} not simply pain to initiate pleasure, but violence—"or the simulation of involuntary violent acts"—said to express love. This <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> highly evident in the observation by many, that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist, {{but that it is}} often the designated masochist who may direct such activities, through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist.|$|E
25|$|The {{biggest problem}} with prosecuting Mengistu for {{genocide}} {{is that his}} actions did not necessarily target a particular group. They were directed against anybody who was opposing his government, and they were generally much more political than based on any ethnic targeting. In contrast, the <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> the Ethiopian government itself {{has been accused of}} genocide based on atrocities committed in Gambella. I'm not sure that they qualify as genocide either. But in Gambella, the incidents, which were well documented in a human rights report of about 2 years ago, were clearly directed at a particular group, the tribal group, the Anuak.|$|E
50|$|Life's Little <b>Ironies</b> <b>is</b> a {{collection}} of tales written by Thomas Hardy, originally published in 1894, and republished with a slightly different collection of stories, for the Uniform Edition in 1927/8.|$|R
5000|$|The work {{goes far}} beyond what might be {{expected}} from the early works of a budding writer. Romantic longing and disappointment, illusion and <b>irony</b> <b>are</b> already freely woven into the writing: ...|$|R
40|$|Humour and <b>irony</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} {{not recommended}} within crisis communication. So when the main Swedish rail company SJ in January 2011 issued three short videos taking an ironical {{stance on the}} company and its damaged reputation, it attracted a great deal of attention. But the good will generated by this unexpected <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> apparently never fully understood by the management, and was thus lost or directly undermined by their subsequent communication. This article addresses the specific case of SJ’s crisis communication in early 2011, with particular interest in the question of the use of humour and irony in a crisis situation...|$|R
25|$|Tibetan {{versions}} differ very {{greatly in}} details. Often Buddhist motifs are conspicuous, with episodes {{on the creation}} of the world and Tibet's cosmic origins. In other variants, Gautama Buddha is never mentioned, or a certain secular <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> voiced against the national religion. According to Samten Karmay, Gesar arose as the hero of a society still thinly permeated by Buddhism and the earlier myths associate him with pre-Buddhist beliefs like the mountain cult. While in most episodes, Gesar fights against the enemies of dharma, an old warrior ethos, where physical power, courage, a combative spirit and things like cunning and deceit, prevail.|$|E
25|$|While {{the search}} was underway, vocal duties were handled {{by a number of}} the band's friends, {{including}} Sean Ingram of Coalesce and Mike Patton, who agreed to help the band produce an EP. The plan to record with Patton was in place before a replacement vocalist had been found however by the time Patton had recorded vocals and the EP was released, the band had been touring with Minakakis's replacement, Greg Puciato, for nearly a year. The EP titled <b>Irony</b> <b>Is</b> a Dead Scene was released on August 27, 2002, through Epitaph Records. The EP features Weinman, Pennie, Benoit, Wilson, Patton on vocals, and ex-bassist Adam Doll assisting with keyboards and sample effects.|$|E
25|$|The series explores social problems, {{including}} discrimination, scientific advancement, political greed, brotherhood, family, and war. Scar's backstory and his {{hatred of}} the state military references the Ainu people, who had their land taken by other people. This includes the consequences of guerrilla warfare {{and the amount of}} violent soldiers a military can have. Some of the people who took the Ainus' land were originally Ainu; this <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> referenced in Scar's use of alchemy to kill alchemists even though it was forbidden in his own religion. The Elrics being orphans and adopted by Pinako Rockbell reflects Arakawa's beliefs about the ways society should treat orphans. The characters' dedication to their occupations reference the need to work for food. The series also explores the concept of equivalent exchange; to obtain something new, one must pay with something of equal value. This is applied by alchemists when creating new materials and is also a philosophical belief the Elric brothers follow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our Saviour's tender mercy, then, {{would not}} have been wide enough for such sin as that." [...] This the Vicar said with {{intended}} irony; but <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> thrown away on Mrs. George Brattle.|$|R
60|$|The tone of <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> now unmistakable. It angered the colonel, {{but he did}} {{not know}} what to say. The spirit of {{military}} subordination is not favorable to retort, nor even to deprecation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{study of}} <b>irony</b> has always <b>been</b> {{a field of}} {{interest}} for diverse disciplines. Whereas <b>irony</b> had <b>been</b> traditionally explained as a contrast between what was said and what was meant, more recent, pragmatically-oriented studies have adopted a wider perspective, by considering aspects like the speaker’s attitude, intention or context. Among these approaches, relevance theory has proposed an ostensive-inferential approach to communication, whereby the addressee seeks to infer the speaker’s intention. Such an approach seems to be appropriate {{for the study of}} irony, and in fact, <b>irony</b> has <b>been</b> a hotly-debated issue within the relevance-theoretical framework (Sperber and Wilson 1981, 1978), even before the model as such (Sperber and Wilson 1986 / 95) was explicitly fleshed out. Moreover, the proposals made reach very recent times (for instance, Wilson, 2006). In one of the contributions by Sperber and Wilson (1998), they claimed that <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> not a natural kind, and enhanced the echoic nature of verbal irony. A distinction between ostensive and non-ostensive forms of <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> put forward. Precisely, among the latter, Sperber and Wilson gave as instances forms such as dramatic irony, or irony of fate...|$|R
500|$|In addition, Kirby {{sees the}} Church's goal as {{deconstructing}} [...] "normative modes {{of thought and}} behavior" [...] in American culture; she believes that it attempts to fight culturally ingrained thought patterns by shocking people. She argues that traditional approaches to religion cast seriousness {{as a measure of}} devotion, an approach which she believes has failed in contemporary society. She feels that <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> a common value that has been ignored by most religions. By embracing the quality, she maintains, the Church of the SubGenius offers a more accessible worldview than many groups.|$|E
500|$|Cobain's lyrics {{address the}} {{people outside the}} {{underground}} music scene that began showing up at Nirvana shows {{after the release of}} the group's debut album Bleach. Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad wrote, [...] "But remarkably, [...] translated even better to the mass popularity the band enjoyed." [...] Regarding the song's chorus, Azerrad commented, [...] "The brilliant <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that the tune is so catchy that millions of people actually do sing along to it." [...] In his biography of Cobain, Heavier Than Heaven, Charles R. Cross asserted that the song was a [...] "thinly disguised portrait" [...] of Cobain's friend Dylan Carlson.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> you have that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and make it sound like John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can easily}} at the worst, after all, give you up." [...] The <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> {{so obvious that}} it needed no care. [...] "I can easily at the worst, after all, even forget you." ...|$|R
60|$|The visitor was not {{a person}} easily discouraged. He took Lady Lydiard's hand, and kissed it with easy grace. A shade of <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> in his manner, agreeably {{relieved}} by a playful flash of tenderness.|$|R
50|$|A tragic <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that Saqr bin Sultan - the {{man whose}} memory the {{demolition}} of the fort was intended to erase - was to return to Sharjah in 1972 in an abortive coup attempt in which Sheikh Khalid bin Muhammad was killed.|$|R
500|$|Scholars {{often have}} {{difficulty}} defining the Church. Most commentators have placed the Church {{in the category}} of [...] "joke religions", which is usually seen as a pejorative description. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> an essential aspect of their faith. Other terms used to describe the Church include [...] "faux cult", [...] " [...] cult", [...] "satirical pseudoreligion", [...] "sophisticated joke religion", [...] "anti-religion religion", and [...] "high parody of cultdom". Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion. Stang has described the group as both [...] "satire and a real stupid religion", and he contends that it is more honest about its nature than are other religions.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but the <b>irony</b> <b>is</b> that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education {{is more of a}} struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
500|$|Potter and Quarshie are {{the only}} regular Holby City cast members who appear in the episode. Discussing Ric's motivations in [...] "Tuesday's Child", Quarshie {{explained}} that his character was born there, and was [...] "always meant to return at some point", leading to issues with his family. He expanded that in leaving Holby, Ric aimed to escape [...] "the politics and stresses in his own life", stating: [...] "It's somewhere he can recharge himself by getting back to uncomplicated medicine. The <b>irony</b> <b>is,</b> when he gets there, he realises there's no such thing, especially when you're constantly hustling to get funding for your clinic and struggling to find qualified doctors and nurses." [...] Like his character, Quarshie is native to Ghana, though moved to the United Kingdom when he was three years old.|$|E
60|$|The tone of her latter words was equivocal, {{and while}} he {{remained}} in doubt whether a gentle <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> or was not inwrought with their sound, she swept lightly round and left him alone. He saw her form get smaller and smaller along the damp belt of sea-sand between ebb and flood; and when she had vanished round the cliff into the harbour-road, he himself followed in the same direction.|$|R
25|$|An <b>irony</b> <b>was</b> that 72 {{years earlier}} the Nez Perce had greeted in {{friendship}} the half-starved Lewis and Clark Expedition on Weippe Prairie. Clark, it was reputed, {{had a son}} with a Nez Perce wife and that son, now an elderly man, was with Joseph.|$|R
50|$|For humans, {{repetition}} {{is inherently}} transgressive. As in Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty, Deleuze identifies humor and irony as lines of {{escape from the}} generalities of society. Humor and <b>irony</b> <b>are</b> in league with repetition because they create distance from laws and norms even while re-enacting them.|$|R
