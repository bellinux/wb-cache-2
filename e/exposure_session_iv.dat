40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the (mis) match model of Rachman and {{co-workers}} during real life exposure therapy in panic disorder patients with agoraphobic avoidance. The results showed that although the patients tended to overpredict their expected fear before the <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions,</b> their predictions did not show a tendency to become more accurate in the course of treatment. After an overprediction predicted fear tended to decrease and self-efficacy tended to increase; after a correct match both predicted fear and self-efficacy remained unchanged. Patients reports of fear tended to decrease within and across <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> regardless of the occurrence of correct or incorrect matches. Patients reported significantly more positive self-statements in underprediction sessions compared to overprediction and correct match sessions. Positive self-statements increased both in underprediction and correct match sessions, but decreased in overprediction sessions.

METHOD: In an experimental design, 30 female volunteers diagnosed with binge-eating disorder (BED) (DSM-IV) and 30 non-eating-disordered controls (NC) were exposed to their physical appearance in a mirror. The confrontation procedure was guided by a standardized interview manual and took place on two separate days. Self-reported mood, appearance self-esteem, and frequency of negative cognitions were assessed repeatedly throughout the experiment. RESULTS: During body image <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions,</b> binge-eating-disordered individuals showed significantly lower mood than controls while appearance self-esteem was diminished in both groups. During the second body image <b>exposure</b> <b>session,</b> higher levels of mood and appearance self-esteem were observed in both groups, and negative cognitions occurred less frequently.

The condition is often associated with symptoms such fatigue, headaches, sleep disturbances and difficulties concentrating. Present study aimed to investigate how people are affected when exposed to noise over time. This was operationalized by collecting data from essentially three domains; subjective, physiological and cognitive. Since hyperacusis is largely defined by the individualsâ€™ subjective experience, participants were divided into three groups based on their own subjective reports of discomfort during an exposure to white noise (60 db).

40|$|Purpose/Background: D-cycloserine (DCS) is {{a partial}} N-methyl-Daspartate {{receptor}} agonist that potentially augments response to exposure therapy in anxiety disorders by enhancing extinction learning. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled augmentation trial examined (1) {{the effectiveness of}} adding 125 mg of DCS to exposure therapy (before or directly after the first 6 treatment sessions) in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia and (2) the effectiveness of DCS augmentation preceding exposure relative to DCS augmentation directly postexposure. Methods/Procedures: Fifty-seven patients were allocated to 1 of 3 medication conditions (placebo and pre-exposure and postexposure DCS) as an addition to 6 <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> within a 12 -session exposure and response prevention protocol. The primary outcome measure was the mean score on the "alone" subscale of the Mobility Inventory (MI). Findings/Results: No {{differences were found in}} treatment outcome between DCS and placebo, administered either pre-exposure or postexposure therapy, although at 3 -month follow-up, the DCS postexposure group compared with DCS pre-exposure, exhibited greater symptom reduction on the MI-alone subscale. Ancillary analyses in specific subgroups (responders vs nonresponders, early vs late responders, severely vs mildly affected patients) did not reveal any between-group DCS versus placebo differences. Finally, the study did not find an effect of DCS relative to placebo to be specific for successful <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions.</b> Implications/Conclusions: This study does not find an effect of augmentation with DCS in patients with severe panic disorder and agoraphobia administered either pretreatment or directly posttreatment sessions. Moreover, no preferential effects are revealed in specific subgroups nor in successful <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions.</b> Yet, a small effect of DCS administration postexposure therapy cannot be ruled out, given the relatively small sample size of this stud...|$|R

The performance of a dynamic and continuous whole-body human exposure chamber using turbulent air mixing during exposure to these organic aerosols of humans and of a new heated mannequin was evaluated. Variability of temporal and spatial distribution of the airborne particle concentration, and aerodynamic aerosol size distribution of the inhalable fraction, were evaluated. The temporal and spatial distribution of these aerosols close to the breathing zone during an <b>exposure</b> <b>session</b> was typically < 10 %, which is low for airborne particles of this size. In a larger section around a human, only slightly higher spatial variation was found. Variability between <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> was also low (< 10 %).

40|$|Work {{over the}} last 20 years has {{provided}} evidence that syntactic comprehension is affected by comprehendersâ€™ language experience: Structures that are more expected in their context are processed faster [1 - 2]. Comprehenders achieve this by integrating information from multiple cues [1, 3]. Recent work further suggests that how these cues are combined into syntactic expectations can change due to recent experience [2, 4 - 6]. However, there are so far no models of how comprehenders adapt {{to changes in the}} informativity of the cues that explain the observed ability to adapt syntactic expectations. Here we develop a Bayesian belief-updating model which captures the qualitative behavioral effects found in a recent study on cue-combination and syntactic adaptation [6]. Via a Dirichlet-multinomial model, this model formalizes the following related claims: that comprehenders (a) track the co-occurrence of syntactic structuresâ€” here, sentence complement (SC) or direct object (DO) continuations, as in (1) â€”and cues providing information about the probability of those structures (here, the verbs and the complementizer that), and (b) use these continuously updated estimates to generate expectations about upcoming syntactic structures.

Over this period, the dolphins have become habituated to human swimmers. Long-term underwater observations revealed {{that some of these}} dolphins engaged in play behavior using man-made and natural objects in the presence of humans, and allowed humans to interact with them during play. We investigated the dolphinsâ€™ play behaviors in response to a more formal two-way communication interface from 1997 - 2000. Spotted dolphins were exposed to an underwater keyboard in which visual and acoustic symbols represented the objects the dolphins were observed playing with. Objects could be obtained and played with by indicating the appropriate associated symbol. Pointing and triadic gaze between human participants was used to model the system in the presence of dolphins. Our results indicated that human use of the system encouraged the dolphins to attend to activity at the keyboard. Female juveniles, especially six main individuals, were the main players. Dolphins increased their normal levels of associations with certain conspecifics during <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> and also took dominant roles during sessions in the presence of certain conspecifics.

40|$|Background: For {{exposure}} {{therapy to}} be successful, {{it is essential}} that fear extinction learning extends beyond the treatment setting. d-Cycloserine (DCS) may facilitate treatment gains by increasing generalization of extinction learning, however, its effects have not been tested in children. We examined whether DCS enhanced generalization of fear extinction learning across different stimuli and contexts among children with specific phobias. Methods: The study was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial among dog or spider phobic children aged 6 â€“ 14. Participants ingested either 50 mg of DCS (n = 18) or placebo (n = 17) before receiving a single prolonged <b>exposure</b> <b>session</b> to their feared stimulus. Return of fear was examined 1 week later to a different stimulus (a different dog or spider), presented in both the original treatment context and an alternate context. Avoidance and fear were measured with Behavior Approach Tests (BATs), where the child was asked to increase proximity to the stimulus while reporting their fear level. Results: There were no differences in BAT performance between groups during the <b>exposure</b> <b>session</b> or when a new stimulus was later presented in the treatment context. However, when the new stimulus was presented in a different context, relative to placebo, the DCS group showed less avoidance (P =. 03) and less increase in fear (P =. 04) with moderate effect sizes. Conclusions: DCS enabled children to better retain their fear extinction learning. This new learning generalized to different stimuli and contexts. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Augmentation of {{exposure}} therapy with d-cycloserine (DCS) has proven efficacious across anxiety disorders, although results in PTSD have been mixed. Work in animals and anxiety-disordered patients {{suggest that the}} potentiating effects of DCS are dependent {{on the level of}} extinction learning during extinction training and exposure treatment, respectively. The aim of the current study was to replicate and extend previous work by examining the association between the degree of extinction learning and DCS efficacy in our randomized clinical trial on DCS (50 mg) versus placebo enhancement {{of exposure}} therapy in a chronic mixed-trauma PTSD sample (N = 67; de Kleine, Hendriks, Kusters, Broekman, & van Minnen, 2012). The decline in subjective units of distress ratings collected during and across the <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> were evaluated as indices of extinction learning. First, we examined whether extinction learning during an <b>exposure</b> <b>session</b> moderated DCS effects on self-reported PTSD symptoms at the next session. Second, we examined whether averaged extinction learning over the course of treatment interacted with group assignment to predict change over time and post treatment outcome. We did not find evidence that DCS effects were moderated by the degree of extinction learning, although, extinction learning was related to outcome regardless of group assignment. In PTSD, not one extinction-learning index has been consistently linked to DCS enhanced exposure treatment outcome. More (experimental) work needs to been done to unravel the complex interplay between extinction learning and DCS enhancement, especially in PTSD patients...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Although {{psychotherapy}} {{generally is}} effective in anxiety disorders, many patients are treatment-resistant. At the same time, some patients with anxiety disorders show alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, {{one of the major}} stress-responsive systems. Since raised levels of the end product of the HPA axis, cortisol, adversely affect cognition, we hypothesised that more pronounced alterations in cortisol levels would be associated with a less favourable response to psychotherapy. More specifically, the higher patients' basal levels and the lower their levels during exposure, the less likely we expected them to profit from treatment. METHODS We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO to review the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the relationship between pre-treatment cortisol and psychotherapy response. Records were included if they studied patients with any anxiety disorder undergoing psychotherapy, with a pre-treatment cortisol and a post-treatment symptom measure. Correlation coefficients were extracted for meta-analyses. RESULTS We identified six studies (N= 274). No relationship between patients' basal cortisol and post-treatment symptoms was found (p= 0. 981). The systematic review showed higher cortisol during <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> to predict better outcomes. Meta-analysis did not confirm this (p= 0. 603). CONCLUSIONS Basal cortisol did not seem to predict psychological therapy responses in patients with anxiety disorders. By contrast, the current state of research is equivocal in terms of whether higher cortisol concentrations during <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> are linked with better treatment outcomes, and {{more research is needed to}} investigate this...|$|R
40|$|Seventy six male {{volunteers were}} studied in a {{crossover}} trial {{to assess the}} effect on the central nervous system of 50 Hz electric currents. Currents totalling 500 microamperes were passed through electrodes attached to the head, upper arms, and feet, simulating exposure to a vertical electric field of about 36 kV/m. Exposure and sham <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> were assigned using double blind techniques and current passed for about 5. 5 hours during the <b>exposure</b> <b>session.</b> A series of psychological tests comprising self reports of mood and performance tests of memory, attention, and verbal skills were administered. The present paper discusses the effects of those currents on vigilance and sustained concentration and examines the hypothesis that electric fields act as stressors. The results indicate that vigilance and concentration were not influenced by exposure, nor do they support the hypothesis of a stress reaction. Although brief reports of sensations at electrode sites compromised the double blind conditions to some extent, the performance changes associated with these reports were independent of exposure per se. Within the vigilance task there were two possible exposure effects on the time taken to identify non-target numbers. Firstly, the non-targets were identified more slowly during the first hour of exposure. Secondly, for subjects not reporting sensations, non-target latencies on the second day were slower in the exposed group [...] there were no corresponding differences on the first day. The interpretation of this effect is complicated by its apparent restriction to the second day and may indicate some kind of state dependent transfer phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Extensive {{research}} on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress has not clarified whether that axis is activated by phobic anxiety. We addressed this issue by measuring cortisol in situational phobics during exposure treatment. Methods: Salivary cortisol was measured in 11 driving phobics before and during three <b>exposure</b> <b>sessions</b> involving driving on crowded limited-access highways and compared with levels measured in 13 healthy controls before and during two sessions of driving on the same highways. For each subject, data collected {{in the same time}} period on a comparison nondriving day served as an individual baseline from which cortisol response scores were calculated. Results: Cortisol levels of driving phobics and controls did not differ on the comparison day. Phobics also had normal cortisol response scores on awakening on the mornings of the exposures but these were already increased 1 hour before coming to the treatment sessions. Phobics had significantly greater cortisol response scores during driving exposure and during quiet sitting periods before and afterward. These greater responses generally paralleled increases in self-reported anxiety. At the first <b>exposure</b> <b>session,</b> effect sizes for differences in cortisol response scores between the two groups were large. Initial exposure to driving in the first session evoked the largest responses. Conclusion: The data demonstrate that the HPA axis can be strongly activated by exposure to, and anticipation of, a phobic situation.
