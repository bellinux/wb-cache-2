40|$|Recently, several broad {{classes of}} inflationary {{models have been}} {{discovered}} whose cosmological predictions, in excellent agreement with Planck, are stable with respect to significant modifications of the inflaton potential. Some classes of models {{are based on a}} nonminimal coupling to gravity. These models, which we call xi attractors, describe universal cosmological attractors (including Higgs inflation) and induced inflation models. Another class describes conformal attractors (including Starobinsky inflation and T models) and their generalization to alpha attractors. The aim of this Letter is to elucidate the common denominator of these attractors: their robust predictions stem from a <b>joint</b> <b>pole</b> of order 2 in the kinetic term of the inflaton field in the Einstein frame formulation prior to switching to the canonical variables. Model-dependent differences only arise at subleading level in the kinetic term. As a final step towards the unification of the different attractors, we introduce a special class of xi attractors which is fully equivalent to a attractors with the identification alpha = 1 + (1 / 6 xi). While r is generically predicted to be of the order 1 /N- 2, there is no theoretical lower bound on r in this class of models...|$|E
40|$|The Sand Creek Prospect {{is located}} within the eastern exposed margin of the Coast Plutonic Complex. The {{occurrence}} is a plug and dyke porphyry molybdenum deposit. The rock types, listed in decreasing age: 1) metamorphlc schists and gneisses; 2) diorite suite rocks - diorite, quartz diorite, tonalite; 3) rocks of andesitic composition; 4) granodiorites, coarse porphyritic granodiorite, quartzfeldspar porphyry, feldspar porphyry; and 5) lamprophyre. Hydrothermal alteration {{is known to have}} resulted from emplacement of the hornblende-feldspar porphyry through to the quartz-feldspar porphyry. Molybdenum mineralization is chiefly associated with the quartz-feldspar porphyry. Ore mineralogy is dominated by pyrite with subordinate molybdenite, chalcopyrite, covelline, sphalerite, galena, scheelite, cassiterite and wolframite. Molybdenite exhibits a textural gradation outward from the quartz-feldspar porphyry. That is, disseminated rosettes and rosettes in quartz veins to fine-grained molybdenite in quartz veins and potassic altered fractures to fine-grained molybdenite paint or 6 mears in the peripheral zones. The quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes were emplaced in an inhomogeneous stress field. The trend of dykes, faults and shear zones is 0 ^ 1 ° to 063 ° and dips between 58 ° NW and 86 * SE. <b>Joint</b> <b>Pole</b> distribution reflects this fault orientation. These late deformatior maxima are probably superimposed upon annuli representing diapiric emplacement of the plutons. A model of emplacement involving two magmatic pulses is given in the following sequence: Diorite pulse (i) dioritequartz diorite, (ii) tonalites; granodiorite pulse (iii) hornblende-fildspar microporphyry, hornblende/biotite porphyry, (iv) coarse grained granodiorite, (v) quartz-feldspar porphyry, (vi) feldspar porphyry, and (vii) lamprophyre. The combination of plutonic and coarse porphyritic textures, extensive propylitic overprinting of potassic alteration assemblages suggests that the. prospect represents the lower reaches of a porphyry system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPole {{vaulting}} {{has progressed}} rapidly {{in terms of}} mechanical properties and appearance {{as a result of}} the use of a flexible fiberglass pole. Various researchers have modeled the vaulter body as a series of rigid-links, limited to a two-dimensional plane. In this research, a combination system consisting of a flexible pole and three-dimensional vaulter model which consists of a rigid-body link with a twist motion is presented. Here, the simulation analysis optimizes the pole characteristics and the joint torque with the application of a Genetic Algorithm. The control parameters were the <b>joint</b> torque and <b>pole</b> stiffness. From the results, it was clarified that there is optimal pole characteristic which is linked to the vaulter’s initial velocity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{years have}} seen a {{worldwide}} increase in people participating in Nordic walking (NW), with a heavy concentration in Northern Europe. This trend has led to abundant research in NW, which {{has the potential to}} reduce the load of the <b>joints</b> because <b>poles</b> are used during walking, and walkers may distribute part of their weight to the poles. A high exercise effect for NW is recognized now, and various studies are performed in the past. However, there are few studies focused on the various joint loads for NW. Therefore, as for examining having joint load reduction effect or not of the NW, it is with an important element judging the right or wrong of the application to everyday life of the NW for patients with joint disease and elderly people. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the joint load (lumbar spine, hip, knee and ankle joints) for NW to ordinary walking (OW) on a level surface and for going up and down stairs. Five healthy participants were asked to conduct NW and OW on a level surface and going up and down stairs equipped with force platforms. 3 D inverse dynamics was used to calculate joint reaction force and joint moment in the lower limb joints. Then, the joint forces (compression and shear) at each of the lumbar spine, hip, knee and ankle joints were calculated using the Software for Interactive Musculoskeletal Modeling (SIMM). It was found that NW reduces the load of the lumbar spine and lower limb joints compared with OW on a level surface and going up stairs, but not going down stairs...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} to {{complete}} {{the description of the}} special mapping method which theoretical basis and principles were published in [Seminsky, 2014]. With reference to data on the Ulirba site located in Priolkhonie (Western Pribaikalie), the content of special mapping is reviewed in detail. The method is based on paragenetical analysis of abundant jointing which specific feature is the lack of any visible displacement indicators. There are three stages in the special mapping method (Fig. 3) as follows: Stage I: Preparation and analysis of previously published data on the regional fault structure (Fig. 1, А–Г), establishment of a networks of stations to conduct structural geological monitoring and mass measurements of joints, re­cord of rock data (Fig. 2, А), general state of the fault network (Fig. 1, Д–З), fracture density (Fig. 2, Б) and, if any, structures of the above-jointing level (Fig. 1, Е, З; Fig. 2, А). Stage II is aimed at processing of field data and includes activities in four groups (II. 1 –II. 4) as follows: Group II. 1 : construction of circle diagrams, specification of characteristics of joint systems and their typical scatters (Fig. 4, А), identification of simple (generally tipple) paragenesises, and determination of dynamic settings of their formation (translocal rank) (Table 1), evaluation of densities and complexity of the joint networks, analysis of their spacial patterns within the site under mapping, and identification of the most intensively destructed zones in the rock massif (Fig. 2, Б–В). Group II. 2 : comparison of jointing diagrams with reference ones showing <b>joint</b> <b>poles</b> (Fig. 4, Б–В; Е–З; Л–Н), and, in case of their satisfactory correlation, making a conclusion of potential formation of a specific joint pattern in the local zone of strike-slip, normal faulting or reverse faulting (Fig. 4,  Г–Д, И–К, О–П; Fig. 5; Fig. 7, Б), and determination of relative age relationships between such zones on the basis analysis of the scatter of joint systems, shearing angles and other relevant information. Group II. 3 : construction of a circle diagram for the specified mapping site with local fault poles (Fig. 8, Б), identification of conjugated systems and dynamic settings of their formation (Fig. 2), plotting the information onto the schematic map of the location under study, and marking the transregional fault zones (Fig. 7, В–К) with observation sites showing similar settings and paragenesises of local faults. Group II. 4 : comparison between diagrams of fault poles of local ranks with reference patterns selected according to the availability of conjugated pairs of fractures (Fig. 9, Б–Г); based on the above comparison, decision making on potential formation of a paragenesis of local faults in the strike-slip, normal and reserve/thrust fault zones (Fig. 9, Д–Ж), and delineation of boundaries of such zones in the schematic map by connecting the observation sites with similar solutions (Fig. 7, Л–Н). Stage III is aimed at interpreting and includes comprehensive analyses of mapping results and priori information, construction of a final scheme of the fault zones showing their subordination by ranks (Fig. 7, О) and schemes of fault zones for various structure formation stages, showing types of faults and specific features of their internal patterns, i. e. definition of the peripheral sub-zone, sub-zones of fractures of the 2 nd order and, if established, the sub-zone of the major fault (Fig. 7, Л–Н). Prospects of the special mapping method can be highlighted upon its comparison with the conventional structural methods applied in studies of faults. On the one side, the method requires time-consuming mass mea­surements and special processing of 'dumb' joints; on the other side, it provides for analyses of abundant jointing data, ensures a high level of detail in mapping of patterns of fault zones, reveals rank subordination of faults and helps to determine other specific features of fractures and faults. Hence, a conventional study of sites with evident tectonics can be based on traditional structural methods, while the special mapping method is recommendable as an additional means of analyses providing information on specific elements of the fault patterns, including establishment of the internal zoning of faults, hierarchy of dynamic settings of faulting etc. In cases when direct observation of faults is limited as the study area is poorly outcropped, or in case of specialized studies such as drilling of wells, the special mapping method can be most useful when applied in its full scope. With account of its specific features, this method is a promising tool for solution of theoretical problems related to studies of divisibility of the Earth's crust into zones and blocks and researches of regularities in development of fault zones in space and time. It can be useful for application-oriented surveys in geology, ore geology, engineering geology and hydrogeology that require detailed mapping of fault zones controlling many associated processes of key importance. </p...|$|R
