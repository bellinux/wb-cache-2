Research in the past decade has explored <b>drug</b> <b>profiling</b> with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). This type of research can be limited by the use of substances seized by police, of which the provenance is unknown. Fortunately, however, some studies in recent years have been carried out on drugs synthesized in-house and therefore of known history. In this study, 18 MDMA samples were synthesized in-house from aliquots of the same precursor by three common reductive amination routes and analyzed for C- 13, N- 15, and H- 2 isotope abundance using IRMS. For these three preparative methods, results indicate that H- 2 isotope abundance data is necessary for discrimination by synthetic route. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis using H- 2 data on its own or combined with C- 13 and/or N- 15 provides a statistical means for accurate discrimination by synthetic route...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} polypharmacology {{paradigm}} in drug discovery calls for novel chemoinformatic tools for analyzing compounds' multi-targeting activities. Such tools should provide an intuitive {{representation of the}} chemical space through capturing and visualizing underlying patterns of compound similarities linked to their polypharmacological effects. Most of the existing compound-centric chemoinformatics tools lack interactive options and user interfaces that are critical for the real-time needs of chemical biologists carrying out compound screening experiments. Toward that end, we introduce C-SPADE, an open-source exploratory web-tool for interactive analysis and visualization of <b>drug</b> <b>profiling</b> assays (biochemical, cell-based or cell-free) using compound-centric similarity clustering. C-SPADE allows the users to visually map the chemical diversity of a screening panel, explore investigational compounds {{in terms of their}} similarity to the screening panel, perform polypharmacological analyses and guide drug-target interaction predictions. C-SPADE requires only the raw <b>drug</b> <b>profiling</b> data as input, and it automatically retrieves the structural information and constructs the compound clusters in real-time, thereby reducing the time required for manual analysis in drug development or repurposing applications.

The methodology combines functional regulation and enrichment analysis into a single visual summary. The workflow enables improved insight into perturbations caused by drugs.

40|$|Drug {{sensitivity}} and resistance testing on diagnostic leukemia samples should provide important functional information to guide actionable target and biomarker discovery. We provide {{proof of concept}} data by profiling 60 drugs on 68 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples mostly from resistant disease in cocultures of bone marrow stromal cells. Patient-derived xenografts retained the original pattern of mutations found in the matched patient material. Stromal coculture did not prevent leukemia cell cycle activity, but a specific sensitivity profile to cell cycle-related drugs identified samples with higher cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo as leukemia xenografts. In patients with refractory relapses, individual patterns of marked drug resistance and exceptional responses to new agents of immediate clinical relevance were detected. The BCL 2 inhibitor venetoclax was highly active below 10 nM in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) subsets, including MLL-AF 4 and TCF 3 -HLF ALL, and in some T-cell ALLs (T-ALLs), predicting in vivo activity as a single agent and in combination with dexamethasone and vincristine. Unexpected sensitivity to dasatinib with half maximal inhibitory concentration values below 20 nM was detected in 2 independent T-ALL cohorts, which correlated with similar cytotoxic activity of the SRC inhibitor KX 2 - 391 and inhibition of SRC phosphorylation. A patient with refractory T-ALL was treated with dasatinib {{on the basis of}} <b>drug</b> <b>profiling</b> information and achieved a 5 -month remission.

30|$|Seized morphia tablets are not {{influenced}} by trafficking, {{as it is}} not possible to add adulterants. External marks or stains may be left on tablets during trafficking. Tablets therefore only reflect the chemical synthesis procedure of the active component, diluents added, and the pressing (press marks, etc.) at clandestine laboratory. Because of no or very less effects of trafficking, tablets show the original physical and morphological characteristics as well as chemical information. The manufacturing process of tablets involves two steps, the synthesis, and the pressing. The concentration of heroin and other components in illicit morphia tablets is the same as manufactured.

This is especially true for ranking the effectiveness of several drugs from many thousands of images directly. This paper introduces, for the first time, a new framework for automatically ordering the performance of drugs, called fractional adjusted bi-partitional score (FABS). This general strategy takes advantage of graph-based formulations and solutions and avoids many shortfalls of traditionally used methods in practice. We experimented with FABS framework by implementing it with a specific algorithm, a variant of normalized cutânormalized cut prime (FABS-NCâ²), producing a ranking of drugs.

A unique chemical database of heroin and cocaine seizures is available and allows assessing the methods. Evaluation is done using the area under the ROC curve of the classifiers. Gaussian mixture models and the SVDD method are trained both with and without outlier examples, and it is found that providing outliers during training improves in some cases the classification performance. Finally, combination schemes of classifiers are also tried out. Results highlight methods that may guide the profiling methodology used in forensic analysis. ...|$|E

The {{goal is to}} find relevant features that could guide the data analysis process in chemical <b>drug</b> <b>profiling,</b> a recent field in the crime mapping community. The data has been collected using gas chromatography analysis. Several methods are tested: PCA, kernel PCA, isomap, spatio-temporal isomap and locally linear embedding. ST-isomap is used to detect a potential time-dependent nonlinear manifold, the data being sequential. Results show {{that the presence of}} a simple nonlinear manifold in the data is very likely and that this manifold cannot be detected by a linear PCA. The presence of temporal regularities is also observed with ST-isomap. Kernel PCA and isomap perform better than the other methods, and kernel PCA is more robust than isomap when introducing random perturbations in the dataset. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPLGA/PLA {{polymeric}} nanoparticles {{could potentially}} enhance {{the effectiveness of}} convective delivery of drugs, such as carboplatin, to the brain, by enabling a more sustained dosage over a longer time than otherwise possible. However, {{the link between the}} controlled release nanoparticle synthesis route, and the subsequent <b>drug</b> release <b>profile</b> obtained, is not well-understood, which hinders design of synthesis routes and availability of suitable nanoparticles. In particular, despite pore structure evolution often forming a key aspect of past theories of the physical mechanism by which a particular <b>drug</b> release <b>profile</b> is obtained, these theories have not been independently tested and validated against pore structural information. Such validation is required for intelligent synthesis design, and NMR cryoporometry can supply the requisite information. Unlike conventional pore characterisation techniques, NMR cryoporometry permits the investigation of porous particles in the wet state. NMR cryoporometry has thus enabled the detailed study of the evolving, nanoscale structure of nanoparticles during drug release, and thus related pore structure to <b>drug</b> release <b>profile</b> in a way not done previously for nanoparticles. Nanoparticles with different types of carboplatin <b>drug</b> release <b>profiles</b> were compared, including burst release, and various forms of delayed release. ESEM and TEM images of these nanoparticles also provided supporting data showing the rapid initial evolution of some nanoparticles.

For a core-coat nanoparticle formulation, the development of smaller nanopores, following an extended induction period with no structural change, was associated with the onset of substantial drug release. This information could be used to independently validate the rationale for a particular synthesis method. Hence, the specific reasons for the effectiveness of the synthesis route, for obtaining core-coat nanoparticles with delayed release, have been elucidated...|$|R
