25|$|In the end, {{the inquiry}} had a larger {{focus on the}} crews of the San Juan and S.C.T. Dodd. After {{interviewing}} survivors, it became disputed whether the crew acted appropriately towards the disaster or not. Turner claimed that either way, nothing could have been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> passengers survive the sinking as {{there was no time}} for action. First Officer Charles Tulee of the San Juan reported a similar statement to the inquiry. The inquiry claimed the San Juan had veered off course. Third Officer Robert Papenfuss of the San Juan, despite having claimed the S.C.T. Dodd had been the ship which veered off course, was found guilty of negligence, leading to his license being revoked. Evidence surfaced after the inquiry's conclusion, proving that the S.C.T. Dodd had veered off course rather than San Juan, proving Papenfuss' innocence.|$|E
25|$|As {{everything}} had been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the passengers, and when nothing else {{could be done to}} save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead. As Ireland {{was in the middle of}} a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the clothes from the dead.|$|E

25|$|Cyclone Bebe caused {{severe damage}} to Funafuti during the 1972–73 South Pacific cyclone season. Funafuti’s Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, {{with all its}} {{vegetation}} {{and most of its}} sand swept away during the cyclone. Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996-97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season. Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu in late January and early February 1990. On Vaitupu Island around 85 percent of residential homes, trees and food crops were destroyed, while residential homes were also destroyed on the islands of Niutao, Nui and Nukulaelae. The majority of the islands in Tuvalu reported damage to vegetation and crops especially bananas, coconuts and breadfruit, with the extent of damage ranging from 10 to 40 percent. In Funafuti sea waves flattened the Hurricane Bebe bank {{at the southern end of}} the airstrip, which caused sea flooding and prompted the evacuation of several families from their homes. In Nui and Niulakita there was a minor loss of the landscape because of sea flooding while there were no lives lost. Soon after the systems had impacted Tuvalu, a Disaster Rehabilitation Sub-Committee was appointed to evaluate the damage caused and make recommendations to the National Disaster Committee and to the Cabinet of Tuvalu, on what should be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> rehabilitate the affected areas.|$|E
25|$|On Flight Day 4, Stott and Barratt grappled the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) {{using the}} Canadarm2 and removed {{it from the}} {{starboard}} sill of Discovery's payload bay. Once it was grappled {{and out of the}} payload bay, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System grappled the end of the OBSS and took a hand off from the Canadarm2. The OBSS was grappled by the space station arm, because the SRMS could not reach it due to clearance issues, and it needed to be moved out of the way so that the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) could be removed from the payload bay. After the OBSS hand off, the entire STS-133 crew was joined by ISS Expedition 26 commander Scott Kelly and flight engineer Paolo Nespoli for a series of in-flight media interviews. The interviews were conducted with the Weather Channel, WBZ radio in Boston, Massachusetts, WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, and WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina. The crew also completed more cargo transfers to and from the ISS. Throughout the day, Drew and Bowen prepared tools that they would use on their spacewalk on Flight Day 5. Later in the day, they were joined by the shuttle crew and ISS commander Kelly and Flight Engineer Nespoli, for a review of the spacewalk procedures. After the review, Bowen and Drew donned oxygen masks and entered the crew lock of the Quest airlock for the standard pre-spacewalk campout. The airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi for the night. This was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the spacewalkers purge nitrogen from their blood and help prevent decompression sickness, also known as the bends.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} their upcoming album, vocalist Gregg Allman was {{also working on}} his solo album, Laid Back, and the sessions occasionally overlapped. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Allman and Betts took turns caring for Oakley, taking him outdoors to places like the zoo {{to keep him from}} drinking as much. [...] "Time and time again, I have sat and wondered, 'God, what in the hell could I have done, what could have anybody have <b>done,</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him?'" [...] said Allman. Upon Leavell's entry into the group, Oakley {{went out of his way}} to make the new member comfortable. On November 11, 1972, overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.|$|E

During these years, Puyi began taking a greater interest in traditional Chinese law and religion (such as Confucianism and Buddhism), but this was disallowed by the Japanese. Gradually his old supporters were eliminated and pro-Japanese ministers put in their place. During this period Puyi's life consisted mostly of signing laws prepared by Japan, reciting prayers, consulting oracles, and making formal visits throughout his state.|$|E
