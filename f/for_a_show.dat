5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act.

This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E

The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>show.</b> He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater.

5|$|Odense Municipality is the {{administrative}} unit which covers {{not only the}} city of Odense but surrounding suburbs and villages. Odense City Council consists of 29 members, including a mayor. The mayor of Odense, Anker Boye, {{is a member of}} the Social Democratic Party. His first term was from 1993 to 2005 when he was defeated by Jan Boye, a Conservative. He was re-elected in the 2009 election, forming a coalition with the Red–Green Alliance, the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democrats. The city council's motto is At lege er at leve (Playing is living) summarising a new approach addressing learning, innovation, development and growth with targets for 2017. Boye and his administration have been criticised for mismanaging the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen in 2005, above all for allegedly signing a contract with Tina Turner <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> which resulted in a deficit of 13 million kroner.|$|E

5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{was portrayed}} by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had {{previously}} worked with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in both The Lieutenant and a pilot <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> he created called Police Story. Whitney as Rand was involved in promoting Star Trek before it aired, but did {{not appear in the}} first two pilots. Roddenberry set out the role of Rand to Whitney, saying that she and Kirk were meant to have feelings for one another, but should never act on them. Part way through the first season, Whitney was released from her contract. The official explanation was that the production team wanted to free up Kirk to have relationships with other women, but it was actually necessitated because the series was over budget and was looking to cut costs. It is unclear as to who suggested that her contract should be terminated, or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said he regretted it. Whitney later directly linked her departure from the show to her alcoholism.|$|E
