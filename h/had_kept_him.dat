5|$|The Grant administration, who {{recognized}} Morton {{as a powerful}} friend, offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain, replacing John Lothrop Motley, but Morton declined. Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats, Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat. In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Later, Grant recalled that concerns over Morton's ill health alone <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> from proposing Morton for Chief Justice, but Grant may have mistaken. Well-advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered {{a place on the}} Supreme Court, unofficially, and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown).|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E
25|$|Although Gravano evaded {{criminal}} charges, he incurred Castellano's wrath {{over the}} unsanctioned killing. Gravano attempted to lie low {{for nearly three}} weeks afterwards, during which time he called his crew together and {{made the decision to}} kill Castellano if necessary. Gravano and Milito were then summoned to a meeting with Castellano at a Manhattan restaurant. Castellano had been given the details of what Fiala had done, but he was still livid that Gravano had not come to him for permission to kill Fiala first. Gravano, however, was spared execution when he convinced Castellano that the reason he <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> in the dark was to protect the boss in case something went wrong with the hit.|$|E

25|$|As {{close as}} they were, often their jobs kept them apart for long periods. Particularly {{at the start}} of their {{relationship}} they were able to see very little of each other. She had been an assistant mistress at Oxford High School and later became a headmistress in Brighton and his medical career <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> in London. Even after their marriage they found it hard to spend time together as Head spent most weekends from 1903 to 1907 in Cambridge experimenting with Rivers. To cope with the long periods of separation, they started writing a joint diary and commonplace book. Each had a volume and they would exchange them from time to time so that they could comment on each other's experiences, thoughts and reading.|$|E
25|$|Following {{an injury}} which <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> {{out of the}} one day tour of Sri Lanka, Broad {{returned}} for the Tri series against Australia and India. In the first match of the series he was wicket less as England lost to Australia. In the next match against India, Broad finished with figures of 0–33. His worst performance of the series came in the following match against Australia, where he finished with figures of 0–61. However, he played well in the must win game against India, taking figures of 2–56 to help England qualify for the final. In the final match against Australia he took figures of 3–55 and made 24 with the bat, {{but it was not}} enough to prevent an England defeat as they went on to finish the tournament as runners up.|$|E
25|$|Questioned at {{the scene}} by four officers, Bryson {{initially}} claimed he had been hitchhiking when abducted by Berdella, who had kidnapped, raped, and tortured him for four days before {{he had managed to}} escape by jumping from a window {{on the second floor of}} the property. Furthermore, this individual <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> bound to a bed on the second floor of the house throughout much of the time he had been held against his will, repeatedly sodomizing him, drugging him, and injecting his throat with drain cleaner to diminish his ability to speak loudly. As Bryson spoke, the officers also noted that in addition to the dog collar and broken foot, Bryson had red, swollen eyes, and visible scars and welts across his entire body. Two officers were told to maintain a discreet surveillance of the property, as Bryson was driven to the Menorah Medical Center, accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the Kansas City Police Department to request a formal search warrant of the property be drafted.|$|E

25|$|A {{stricken}} MCC team {{arrived in}} Perth, Western Australia after the First Test. John Edrich and Dennis Amiss had had their hands broken from the battering {{they received from}} Lillee and Thomson. David Lloyd was recovering from a broken finger that <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> out of the Test. Keith Fletcher had a bruised arm from the Test, which seemed fine until it {{was hit by a}} medium paced delivery in the nets from the assistant-manager Alan Smith and went numb so that he could not bat even though {{it was too late to}} change the XI. Smith was a wicketkeeper who had rarely bowled, but had swung the ball so much in the nets at Lords in 1972 that Geoff Boycott asked him to stop before he destroyed the confidence of the batsman who had to face Bob Massie. Bob Willis was nursing a groin strain and Peter Lever strained a side muscle and had to pull out of the state match. As a result, the team facing the Sheffield Shield champions Western Australia was chosen because only 11 players were fit, and as a result included both wicket-keepers Alan Knott and Bob Taylor, with the latter behind the stumps. The 41-year-old batsman Colin Cowdrey joined the party in Perth, but too late to play in the state game.|$|E
25|$|President Buchanan was {{surprised}} and dismayed at Anderson's move to Sumter, unaware of the authorization Anderson had received. Nevertheless, he refused Pickens's demand to evacuate Charleston harbor. Since the garrison's supplies were limited, Buchanan authorized a relief expedition of supplies, small arms, and 200 soldiers. The original intent was to send the Navy sloop-of-war USS Brooklyn, but {{it was discovered that}} Confederates had sunk some derelict ships to block the shipping channel into Charleston and there was concern that Brooklyn had too deep a draft to negotiate the obstacles. Instead, it seemed prudent to send an unarmed civilian merchant ship, Star of the West, which might be perceived as less provocative to the Confederates. As Star of the West approached the harbor entrance on January 9, 1861, it was fired upon by a battery on Morris Island, which was staffed by cadets from The Citadel, among them William Stewart Simkins, who were the only trained artillerymen in the service of South Carolina at the time. Batteries from Fort Moultrie joined in and Star of the West was forced to withdraw. Major Anderson prepared his guns at Sumter when he heard the Confederate fire, but the secrecy of the operation <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> unaware that a relief expedition was in progress and he chose not to start a general engagement.|$|E
500|$|Mohammed M'Barek {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the French authorities that <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> [...] "in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing". He {{thought it was an}} outrage that the French regarded the dumping of an inconveniently dead body in a ravine as a crime. He {{even went so far as}} to appeal to the new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice. On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then jumped to his feet pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones. [...] "You're the guilty ones, you the rich, who want to take his inheritance!" [...] he shouted as police wrestled with him in the dock. After refusing requests from his lawyer and the judge to sit down and be quiet, M'Barek was taken down to the cells and the hearing temporarily adjourned.|$|E

500|$|On 5 March 2010, Gordon Brown {{appeared}} before the inquiry. In a four-hour hearing he told the inquiry that he believed the war had been [...] "right" [...] and that intelligence briefings had convinced him that Iraq was a threat that [...] "had to be dealt with". He said that his predecessor Tony Blair <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> informed despite Blair not being aware of some developments and that the main issue which concerned him was that Iraq was in breach of UN resolutions. He feared the [...] "new world order {{we were trying to}} create would be put at risk" [...] if the international community did not act together to deal with Iraq. When asked about equipment, Brown said that British troops in Iraq had all the equipment they needed. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said, [...] "Gordon Brown's aim today appears to be to look and sound different from Tony Blair whilst simultaneously opening up no gap of substance with him and the decisions he took".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the match}} against Middlesex, the team {{travelled}} to the north, where the strongest English rugby teams were based. Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until {{many of their}} respective member clubs split from the RFU in 1895 {{over the issue of}} [...] "broken time" [...] payments. The New Zealanders lost to Hull F.C. 1–0, defeated Dewsbury, then lost to Wakefield Trinity. After their first draw of the tour (against Northumberland County) they defeated Stockton-on-Tees and Tynemouth. Joe Warbrick appeared in the match against Tynemouth, but aggravated the foot injury that <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> out of the side until that point. These victories were followed by a 13–4 defeat to Halifax on 10 November. The team then won seven matches in a row, including one against Hawick RFC, their only Scottish opposition of the tour. The last two matches that month were a loss to Swinton and a 9–0 victory over Liverpool and District. The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them. By this point, the team was beset by injuries– of the fifteen players that played against Westmorland County on 24 November, five had injuries. The squad comprised only 26 players, and the tourists were often struggling to field a side. Nevertheless, their heavy schedule continued; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin, where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team.|$|E
500|$|In late December, Ovechkin {{went on a}} seven-game point streak that {{featured}} the two-point games {{in the final four}} games of the streak. In conjunction with the point streak, he scored eight goals in nine games. Washington went 5–1–1 during the streak, which was eventually snapped in a 5–2 loss to the San Jose Sharks on January 7. In the game prior to the streak being snapped, Capitals' defenseman Mike Green returned from a groin injury that <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> out of the lineup for 23 games. Washington defeated the Calgary Flames 3–1 in the contest, which moved their record to 9–0–0 with Green in the line-up. However, the news coming out of the game was not all good. During the game, the Capitals' leading scorer, Nicklas Backstrom, was elbowed in the head by the Flames' Rene Bourque. Backstrom underwent concussion testing, which proved inconclusive; he suffered from what was described as [...] "concussion-like symptoms" [...] and was eventually placed on the injured reserve. For his actions, Bourque was suspended five games for delivering the elbow. Compounding the Capitals' injury problem was the loss of Mike Green in just his second game back; he re-injured his groin during the contest and was placed on the long-term injured reserve. During a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Ovechkin delivered a hit to Pittsburgh defenseman Zbynek Michalek. On the hit, Ovechkin launched himself into Michalek's shoulder, where the force of the hit caused Ovechkin to make contact with Michalek's head. Later in the game, Michalek delivered an elbow to the back of Matt Hendricks' head, driving it into the glass. The following day, it was announced that Ovechkin was suspended for three games for the reckless hit despite not receiving a penalty on the play during the game. Vice President of Player Safety Brendan Shanahan stated the length of the suspension took into account that Ovechkin was a repeat offender, having been suspended twice before and fined twice as well. It also took into consideration that Michalek was not injured on the play. Despite his own actions, Michalek avoided a fine or suspension. Without Ovechkin, Backstrom or Green, Washington nonetheless defeated defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins in the final game before the All-Star break to move into first place in the Southeast Division.|$|E

2500|$|Ray Goetz, {{producer}} of Paris and Fifty Million Frenchmen, {{the success of}} which <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> solvent when other producers were bankrupted by the post-crash slump in Broadway business, invited Porter to write a musical show about the other city that he knew and loved: New York. Goetz offered the team with whom Porter had last worked: Herbert Fields writing the book and Porter's old friend Monty Woolley directing. The New Yorkers (1930) acquired instant notoriety for including a song about a streetwalker, [...] "Love for Sale". Originally performed by Kathryn Crawford in a street setting, critical disapproval led Goetz to reassign the number to Elisabeth Welch in a nightclub scene. The lyric was considered too explicit for radio at the time, though it was recorded and aired as an instrumental and rapidly became a standard. [...] Porter often {{referred to it as}} his favorite of his songs. The New Yorkers also included the hit [...] "I Happen to Like New York".|$|E
