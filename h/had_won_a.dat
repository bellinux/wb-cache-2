However, the Fairs Cup committee required that only teams from the highest tier of a nation's league system could enter. In the end, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Liverpool qualified for the following season's competition.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{authorities}} <b>had</b> <b>won</b> <b>a</b> total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures {{on the general}} population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
