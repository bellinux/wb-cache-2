Until 1812, the French occupants requisitioned in money and kind from various corporations and persons, especially by billetting soldiers on cities, further contributions additionally amounting to between 146 and 309 million francs, according to different calculations. The Prussian government indebtedness soared between 1806 and 1815 by thaler 200 million to altogether 180.09 million interest-bearing debts, 11.24 million non-interest-bearing unconsolidated treasury notes and another 25.9 million former provincial debts assumed by the royal government. The cities' debts, {{especially those of}} Berlin often billetted on, were not assumed by the Prussian government. Since the creditors deemed Prussia to be over-indebted in 1817, the 4-per cent state bonds were traded at the bourses with a <b>disagio</b> of 27 to 29 per cent, in 1818 even with a discountor of 35 per cent, causing the effective interest to rise to 6.15 per cent. At restructuring part of the debts in 1818 by a £5 million loan (= thaler 30 million) at 5% at the London financial market, the Prussian government had to accept a <b>disagio</b> of 28⅓%, thus paying an annual effective rate of 6.98%.|$|E

Many of the comics were extremely violent and sexual and attempted to stretch the comix genre to its vary limits in both style and [...] "good taste." [...] Satirical magazines such as Frigidaire and Il Male often printed these stories in episodic formats or as vignettes in their monthly publications.|$|E
5000|$|The name malaria {{derived from}} mal aria ('bad air' in Medieval Italian). This idea {{came from the}} Ancient Romans who thought that this disease came from the horrible fumes in the swamps. The word malaria {{has its roots in}} the miasma theory, as {{described}} by historian and chancellor of Florence Leonardo Bruni in his Historiarum Florentini populi libri XII, which was the first major example of Renaissance historical writing:Avuto i Fiorentini questo fortissimo castello e fornitolo di buone guardie, consigliavano fra loro medesimi fosse da fare. Erano alcuni a' quali pareva sommamente utile e necessario a ridurre lo esercito, e massimamente essendo affaticato per la infermità e per la mala ariae per lungo e difficile campeggiare nel tempo dell'autunno e in luoghi infermi, e vedendo ancora ch'egli era diminuito assai per la licenza conceduta a molti pel capitano di potersi partire: perocchè, nel tempo che eglino erano stati lungamente a quello assedio, molti, o per <b>disagio</b> del campo o per paura d'infermità, avevano domandato e ottenuto licenza da lui (Acciajuoli 1476).After the Florentines had conquered this stronghold, after putting good guardians on it they were discussing among themselves how to proceed. For some of them it appeared most useful and necessary to reduce the army, more so as it was extremely stressed by disease and bad air, and due to the long-lasting and difficult camps in unhealthy places during the autumn. They (the Florentines) further considered that the army was reduced in numbers due to the leave permits granted to many soldiers by their officers. In fact, during the siege, many soldiers had asked and obtained leave permits due to the camp hardships and fear of illness from medieval Italian, Toscanic dialect.The coastal plains of southern Italy fell from international prominence when malaria expanded in the sixteenth century. At roughly the same time, in the coastal marshes of England, mortality from [...] "marsh fever" [...] or [...] "tertian ague" [...] (ague: via French from medieval Latin acuta (febris), acute fever) was comparable to that in sub-Saharan Africa today. William Shakespeare was born at the start of the especially cold period that climatologists call the [...] "Little Ice Age", yet he was aware enough of the ravages of the disease to mention it in eight of his plays.|$|E

40|$|Nel 1893, prima di diventare professore universitario, Giovanni Pascoli, nominato presidente di un Comitato per l'esame dell'insegnamento del latino nelle scuole italiane, esprime il suo <b>disagio</b> nei confronti del fallimentare eccesso di erudizione nell'insegnamento. Il saggio esamina il contrasto tra queste metodologie, di origine tedesca, e quelle tradizionali italiane, soprattutto nelle scuole cattoliche del Centro Italia. Queste tematiche ritornano in una lettera di molti anni dopo di Giovanni Giolitti, che al tempo dell'inchiesta commissionata da Ferdinando Martini era presidente del consiglio. Before {{the great}} Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli (1855 - 1912) was {{appointed}} University Professor of Latin and later of Italian, he taught in several Italian high schools. In 1893, the Secretary for Education, the well known journalist and writer Ferdinando Martini, wishing {{to improve the}} teaching of Latin in Italy, appointed Pascoli {{as a member of}} a committee of specialists in this field. Pascoli, who was elected president of the committee, wrote a famous report criticizing the excess of grammar and erudition and the lack of a true ``reading'' of authors. The paper shows that Pascoli's statement must be understood within the framework of the cultural struggles concerning the teaching of Latin and Greek in the first decades of the recently unified Italy: the ``local'' tradition (practical teaching of Latin, particularly in Central Italy and Catholic schools) was challenged by a different approach, particularly in the North of the country. This was of German origin and placed the emphasis on grammar and philology. Many years later, in 1922, a letter of Giovanni Giolitti, who in 1893 was Prime Minister, shows the inluence of Pascoli's ideas, as well as of other disputes regarding the teaching of Greek in Italian high schools...|$|E

What particular posture unites them ( [...] . if there is any) ? This paper aims at remembering the stakes of this literature and at exploring the practical {{ways in which the}} work of re-elaboration is undertaken by the different authors who are claiming a space “in-between” Italy and Africa. Among them we can quote Igiaba Scego, Ribka Sibhatu, Gabriella Ghermandi and Kaha Mohamed Aden. Finally, a special attention will be paid to Carla Macoggi’s Kkeywa – storia di una bimba meticcia (2011). The narrator remembers how, as a child, she has been taken from her etiopian family without any explanation and sent to be brought up in the social environment of her italian father after he passed away. Placed at the exact converging point between two legacies – African and Western – and in the attempt (in vain?) to heal the wounds, – following from its Greek etymology, the author defines the word “trauma” as “a wound by fracture” – she makes use of the rhetorical figure of antanaclasis to put into words a persisting discomfort. L'Altro versante della Storia: dalle memorie rimosse dell'Africa italiana alle antanaclasi di Carla MacoggiIn seno al corpus sempre più esteso degli scrittori transculturali, il focus è messo su quegli autori che vengono a colmare alcuni vuoti della memoria italiana in materia di colonialismo. Quale particolare postura li accomuna (… o meno) ? La comunicazione mira a ricordare la posta in gioco ed esplora qualche modalità pratica del lavoro di rielaborazione intrapreso da diverse scrittrici che rivendicano uno spazio collocato "tra" Italia e Africa. Tra di loro vengono citate Igiaba Scego, Ribka Sibhatu, Gabriella Ghermandi e Kaha Mohamed Aden. Infine, è dedicato particolare interesse a Kkeywa – storia di una bimba meticcia (2011) di Carla Macoggi che, collocata all'esatto punto di congiunzione dei due retaggi – quello africano e quello occidentale – e nel (vano?) tentativo di rimarginare le ferite, – (in conformità con l’etimologia greca, l'autrice definisce la parola "trauma" come "ferita con frattura") – si avvale della figura retorica dell'antanaclasi per verbalizzare un <b>disagio</b> persistente...|$|E
