5000|$|The Syrian {{government}} has reportedly used [...] "barrel bombs" [...] to attack civilian populations in rebel held territories {{in defiance of}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 2139 passed on February 22, 2014.

[...] Between February 2014 and January 2015, Human Rights Watch reports that [...] "at least 450 major damage sites" [...] in Syria [...] "showed damage consistent with barrel bomb detonations".
