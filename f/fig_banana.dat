40|$|ABSTRACTBanana fig from fully ripe banana, caramel and malt extract, food drink {{thickening}} agent, {{acetic acid}} and local hop extract (Alfalfa) {{were used in}} the formulation of a low-sugar malt drink. <b>Banana</b> <b>fig</b> was used as a replacement for malted barley. The pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), percentage sugar content, specific gravity and saccharification of the extracts were determined. The effects of optimization of the mashing process using industrial enzyme-amyloglucosidase were also evaluated. The pH and percentage sugar content of the <b>banana</b> <b>fig</b> extract decreased with increased mashed temperatures. Specific gravity of the <b>banana</b> <b>fig</b> extracts decreased with increased mashed temperatures, with values from 1. 013 to 1. 010 against mashed temperatures of 45 °C and 80 °C respectively. At temperatures of 70 °C and above the saccharification was observed to be incomplete. However, the introduction of industrial enzyme-amyloglucosidase resulted in complete saccharification. The formulation of the malt flavoured low-sugar drink gave three samples of 6. 2 %, 7. 4 % and 11. 8 % sugar contents. Sensory evaluation carried out on the malt flavoured low-sugar drink with commercial Amstel malt drink showed no significant difference in taste and flavour for all the samples compared with reference sample at p> 0. 05. But sample BS 3 with 11. 8 % sugar content was significantly different (p< 0. 05) from sample BS 2 (7. 4 % sugar) and BS 1 (6. 2 % sugar) in colour and general acceptability. All samples except BS 1 with 6. 2 % sugar were accepted by the panellists. This malt flavoured low-sugar drink could thus help reduce health complications in conditions associated with high sugar consumption. The use of additional enzymes in combination with the amyloglucosidase could improve the extract yield, nutritional and sensory qualities of the drink...|$|R

Twelve palm trees clustering with ripe fruit, and each of which seemed to spring from a flowering hedge of myrtles, supported a roof formed with much artifice of the braided boughs of trees. These, however, only furnished an invisible framework, from which were suspended the most beautiful and delicious fruits, citron and pomegranate, orange, and <b>fig,</b> and <b>banana,</b> and melon, in such thickness and profusion that they formed, as it were, a carved ceiling of rich shades and glowing colours, like the Saracenic ceiling of the mansion, while enormous bunches of grapes every now and then descended like pendants from {{the main body of the}} roof.

50|$|Dr. Doshi's city garden {{methods are}} revolutionary for being {{appropriate}} to apply in reduced spaces as terraces and balconies, even on civil construction walls, and for not requiring big investments in capital or {{long hours of}} work. His farming practice is purely organic and is mainly directed to domestic consumption. His gardening tools are composed of materials available in the local environment: sugarcane waste, polyethylene bags, tires, containers and cylinders, and soil. The containers and bags (open at both ends) are filled with the sugarcane stalks, compost, and garden soil, which make possible the use of minimal quantity of water if compared to open fields. Dr. Doshi states that solar energy can replace soil in cities. He also recommends the idea of chainplanting, or growing plants in intervals and in small quantities rather than at once and in large amounts. He has grown different types of fruit such as mangos, <b>figs,</b> guavas, <b>bananas,</b> and sugarcane stalks in his terrace of 1200 sq ft in Bandra.

50|$|According to the Samkhya {{school of}} philosophy, {{everything}} in the universe—including people, activities, and foods—can be sorted into three gunas: sattva (calm/good), rajas (passionate/active), and tamas (dull/lethargic).As a vigorous activity, wrestling has an inherently rajasic nature, which pehlwan counteract through the consumption of sattvic foods. Milk and ghee are regarded as the most sattvic of foods and, along with almonds, constitute the holy trinity of the pehlwani khurak (from Persian خوراک پهلوانی khorâk-e pahlavâni), or diet. A common snack for pehlwan are chickpeas that have been sprouted overnight in water and seasoned with salt, pepper and lemon; the water in which the chickpeas were sprouted is also regarded as nutritious. Various articles in the Indian wrestling monthly Bharatiya Kushti have recommended the consumption of the following fruits: apples, wood-apples, <b>bananas,</b> <b>figs,</b> pomegranates, gooseberries, lemons, and watermelons. Orange juice and green vegetables are also recommended for their sattvic nature. Some pehlwan eat meat {{in spite of its}} tamasic nature.|$|R
50|$|Seedlessness {{is seen as}} a {{desirable}} trait in edible fruit with hard seeds such as banana, pineapple, orange and grapefruit. Parthenocarpy is also desirable in fruit crops that may be difficult to pollinate or fertilize, such as fig, tomato and summer squash. In dioecious species, such as persimmon, parthenocarpy increases fruit production because staminate trees {{do not need to be}} planted to provide pollen. Parthenocarpy is undesirable in nut crops, such as pistachio, where the seed is the edible part. Horticulturists have selected and propagated parthenocarpic cultivars of many plants, including <b>banana,</b> <b>fig,</b> cactus pear (Opuntia), breadfruit and eggplant. Some plants, such as pineapple, produce seedless fruits when a single cultivar is grown because they are self-infertile. Some cucumbers produce seedless fruit if pollinators are excluded. Strange as it seems, seedless watermelon plants are grown from seeds. The seeds are produced by crossing a diploid parent with a tetraploid parent to produce triploid seeds.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} that caught our eye on board the negro boats which were {{alongside}} was, of course, the baskets of fruits and vegetables, of which one of us at least had been hearing all his life. At St. Thomas's we had been introduced to <b>bananas</b> (<b>figs,</b> as they are miscalled in the West Indies); to the great green oranges, thick- skinned and fragrant; to those junks of sugar-cane, some two feet long, which Cuffy and Cuffy's ladies delight to gnaw, walking, sitting, and standing; increasing thereby {{the size of their}} lips, and breaking out, often enough, their upper front teeth. We had seen, and eaten too, the sweet sop {25a}--a passable fruit, or rather congeries of fruits, looking like a green and purple strawberry, of the bigness of an orange. It is the cousin of the prickly sour-sop; {25b} of the really delicious, but to me unknown, Chirimoya; {25c} and of the custard apple, {25d} containing a pulp which (as those who remember the delectable pages of Tom Cringle know) bears a startling likeness to brains. Bunches of grapes, at St. Kitts, lay among these: and at St. Lucia we saw with them, for the first time, Avocado, or Alligator pears, alias midshipman's butter; {26a} large round brown fruits, to be eaten with pepper and salt by those who list. With these, in open baskets, lay bright scarlet capsicums, green coconuts tinged with orange, great roots of yam {26b} and cush-cush, {26c} with strange pulse of various kinds and hues. The contents of these vegetable baskets were often as gay-coloured as the gaudy gowns, and still gaudier turbans, of the women who offered them for sale.|$|R
6000|$|It was so in Mr. Stone's old bottle, hour by {{hour and}} day by day, {{throughout}} the month. A pinker, robuster look {{came back to}} his cheeks; his blue eyes, fixed on distance, had in them more light; his knees regained their powers; he bathed, and, all unknown to him, for he only saw the waters he cleaved with his ineffably slow stroke, Hilary and Martin, on alternate weeks, and keeping at a proper distance, for fear he should see them doing him a service, attended at that function in case Mr. Stone should again remain too long seated {{at the bottom of}} the Serpentine. Each morning after his cocoa and porridge he could be heard sweeping out his room with extraordinary vigour, and as ten o'clock came near anyone who listened would remark a sound of air escaping, as he moved up and down on his toes in preparation for the labours of the day. No letters, of course, nor any newspapers disturbed the supreme and perfect self-containment of this life devoted to Fraternity--no letters, partly because he lacked a known address, partly because for years he had not answered them; and with regard to newspapers, once a month he went to a Public Library, and could be seen with the last four numbers of two weekly reviews before him, making himself acquainted with the habits of those days, and moving his lips as though in prayer. At ten each morning anyone in the corridor outside his room was startled by the whirr of an alarum clock; perfect silence followed; then rose a sound of shuffling, whistling, rustling, broken by sharply muttered words; soon from this turbid lake of sound the articulate, thin fluting of an old man's voice streamed forth. This, alternating with the squeak of a quill pen, went on till the alarum clock once more went off. Then he who stood outside could smell that Mr. Stone would shortly eat; if, stimulated by that scent, he entered; he might see the author of the [...] "Book of Universal Brotherhood" [...] with a baked potato in one hand and a cup of hot milk in the other; on the table, too, the ruined forms of eggs, tomatoes, oranges, <b>bananas,</b> <b>figs,</b> prunes, cheese, and honeycomb, which had passed into other forms already, together with a loaf of wholemeal bread. Mr. Stone would presently emerge in his cottage-woven tweeds, and old hat of green-black felt; or, if wet, in a long coat of yellow gaberdine, and sou'wester cap of the same material; but always with a little osier fruit-bag in his hand. Thus equipped, he walked down to Rose and Thorn's, entered, and to the first man he saw handed the osier fruit-bag, some coins, and a little book containing seven leaves, headed [...] "Food: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday," [...] and so forth. He then stood looking through the pickles in some jar or other at things beyond, with one hand held out, fingers upwards, awaiting the return of his little osier fruit-bag. Feeling presently that it had been restored to him, he would turn and walk out of the shop. Behind his back, on the face of the department, the same protecting smile always rose. Long habit had perfected it. All now felt that, though so very different from themselves, this aged customer was dependent on them. By not one single farthing or one pale slip of cheese would they have defrauded him for all the treasures of the moon, and any new salesman who laughed at that old client was promptly told to [...] "shut his head." ...|$|R
