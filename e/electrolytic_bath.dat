40|$|We {{evaluated}} the electrochemical deposition of Pb(II) onto Fractured Vitreous Carbon (FVC) electrodes from solutions containing very low concentrations {{of lead in}} different electrolytes (sulfate or chloride). To examine how the FVC surface state influences the lead deposition efficiency, the electrodes were subjected to different electrochemical pretreatments prior to the actual deposition process. The FVC electrode {{was used as a}} representative model of the vitreous carbon (VC) bulk, avoiding the polishing procedure that could change the surface. Electrochemical pretreatment was carried out by cyclic voltammetry in electrolytes containing chloride or nitrate anions and in some cases, ferrocyanide. Before and after the electrochemical pretreatment, the electrode surface morphology was assessed using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging. The quantity of lead deposited on the FVC electrode surface (lead deposition efficiency) in each experiment was estimated from the charge under the lead anodic, dissolution peak. Electrochemical pretreatment of electrodes in chloride or nitrate <b>electrolytic</b> <b>baths</b> consistently reduced the lead deposition efficiency. A detailed analysis, correlating lead deposition efficiencies to surface roughness and fractal dimension of the freshly prepared and electrochemically pretreated FVC electrodes, indicated that the decrease in efficiency corresponded to the change in electrode surface geometry.

Job's plot for the absorption spectra of mixed solution in various Cu 2 +: SCN- ratios have revealed {{the presence of}} [Cu(SCN) 2] 0 as a soluble species responsible to the electrode process in SCN- rich solutions. From Levich analysis of diffusion limited current employing a rotating disc electrode (RDE), diffusion coefficients of 5. 2 × 10 - 6 cm 2 s- 1 and 3. 0 × 10 - 6 cm 2 s- 1 in ethanol at 298 K were determined for [Cu(SCN) 2] 0 and [Cu(SCN) ]+, respectively.

40|$|The {{addition}} of organic compounds to the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>baths</b> during the electrodeposition of metals affects {{the structure and}} {{the properties of the}} deposits, leading to the preparation of coatings with defined characteristics. In this work, a complete study of the action of the organic additives on the crystalline orientation of the nickel electrodeposits was carried out. The selection of the organic compounds was made in order to investigate the effect of the stereochemical structure and unsaturated bonds on the nickel electrocrystallization process. It was found that the presence of acetylenic compounds (butyne- 2 -diol 1, 4 and propyne- 2 -ol) in nickel plating baths leads to the predominance of high inhibited modes of crystal growth. Propyne- 2 -ol seems to be more active, as the geometry of its molecule favours the adsorption of the additive on the metallic surface and, thus, its faster hydrogenation. With the additon of phenyl propyl alcohol, a strong perturbation of the oriented crystal growth of the nickel crystallites occurs. The adsorption of the phenyl group on the metallic surface and its hydrogenation is responsible for the predominance of high inhibited textures. In the case of coumarin, the complexity of its molecule makes its adsorption more difficult, resulting in the development of [100] textured deposits even at high concentrations of the additive. Finally, when sodium benzene sulphonate or saccharin are added to the bath, the presence of sulphur in their molecules influences the nickel electrodeposition process through a different mechanism...|$|R
