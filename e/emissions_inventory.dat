40|$|International audienceThe {{importance}} of <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> uncertainty on the simulation of summertime tropospheric ozone over China has been analyzed using a regional chemical transport model. Three independent <b>emissions</b> <b>inventories,</b> that are (i) emission estimates from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) {{for the year}} 1995, (ii) a regional <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> used in the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) program with emissions for the year 2000 and (iii) a national <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> used in the China Ozone Research Program (CORP) with emission estimates for the year 1995, are used for model simulation over a summer period. Methods used {{for the development of}} the inventories are discussed and differences in simulated ozone and its precursors with these <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> are analyzed. Comparison of the <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> revealed large differences in the emission estimates (up to 50 % for NO x, ~ 100 % for NMVOC and ~ 1000 % for CO). Application of the different <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> in three model simulations showed minor differences in both surface O 3 in rather unpolluted areas in China and at higher altitudes (500 mbar). In polluted areas, differences in surface O 3 are 30 - 50 % between the different model simulations which seem rather small taking into account the large differences in the <b>emission</b> <b>inventories.</b> Additional sensitivity runs showed that the difference in NO x emissions as well NMVOC emissions is a dominant factor which controls the differences in simulated O 3 concentrations while the impact of differences in CO emissions is relatively small.

40|$|A {{collaborative}} research project between the European CommissionÂ¿s Joint Research Center and the Lombardy Region, both located in Northern Italy, aims {{to identify the}} best pollution reduction strategies {{in this area and}} to set a framework solving such complex problem for whichever area in Europe. Advanced numerical air quality models (AQMs) have become an essential tool for analyzing the effect of the implementation of pollutant emission abatement strategies and for the integrated assessment modeling. Spatialized <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> compatible with the requirement of Eulerian chemical transport model (CTM) represent one of the most crucial issues for performing reliable air quality simulations. Therefore a spatialized atmospheric <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> concerning major pollutants (CO, NOx, SO 2, CH 4, PM 10, PM 2. 5, NH 3 and VOC) was elaborated for all regions of Northern Italy putting together information collected from the institutions in charge of <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> at regional and national scale. This paper will address the methodology, the steps followed and the difficulties encountered to prepare a high quality spatialized <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> as input to AQMs. In the case presented here, the major challenge was to include, as much as possible, bottom-up emissions information elaborated by the regional authorities. All the problems of data collection, homogenization and merge had to be faced, considering that each of the 10 Regions in Northern Italy is in charge of its own air quality plan and <b>emission</b> <b>inventory.</b> For the area of interest (570 x 390 km 2) emission data, coming both from the regional and the Italian national <b>emission</b> <b>inventories,</b> were put together and consolidated. For the countries outside Italy, the European <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> (EMEP) was used. In general, two kinds of emissions data sets with different aggregation level were acquired and merged as input to the spatialized <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> of Northern Italy: - INEMAR (INventario EMissioni ARia) Â¿ a database created for an implementation of high-quality regional <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> estimating the <b>emissions</b> of several pollutants at municipal level mainly with a bottom-up approach. INEMAR is currently used by most of the regions in Northern Italy. - Italian national <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> Â¿ a database that collects and calculates all the emissions at national level and provides an estimation at provincial level applying a top-down disaggregation. Priority was given to the INEMAR emissions data at municipal level where available (i. e. fully completed for three of the Northern Italian regions and partially completed for the other regions). The rest of the data were covered by the use of the national <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> at provincial level, which was further disaggregated at municipal level using various proxies. The resulting <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> has then been spatialized on a 3 x 3 km grid. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|R

40|$|Concentrated {{animal feeding}} {{operations}} (CAFOs) are potentially significant sources of ammonia emissions. Because {{of the number}} and proximity of swine CAFOs in North Carolina, the emissions and subsequent deposition of ammonia from these operations {{may lead to the}} eutrophication of North Carolina streams and estuaries. Accurate <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> are needed to assess the environmental impact of these swine CAFOs. In efforts to improve ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> in North Carolina, a mass-balanced <b>emission</b> <b>inventory</b> was developed based on growth-stage-specific nitrogen excretion rates. This paper addresses the ammonia data available from monitoring studies of CAFOs and methods of selecting growth-stage-specific emission factors from the data set. Three approaches for developing <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> for North Carolina swine CAFOs are then presented and compared. For each approach, ammonia emissions are evaluated for five model CAFOs: three single growth-stage CAFOs (farrow-to-wean, wean-to-feed, and feed-to-finish) and two multiple growth-stage CAFOs (farrow-to-feed and farrow-to-finish). The results of the different <b>emission</b> <b>inventories</b> are compared and evaluated, and the advantages and limitations of the different emission factor approaches are discussed...|$|R
