25|$|The 1960s {{began on}} a {{positive}} note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's Il Federale (The Fascist). In an interview with American composer Fred Karlin, Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> much more important films with major directors.|$|E
25|$|Once Ardashir was {{appointed}} shahanshah, {{he moved his}} capital further {{to the south of}} Pars and founded Ardashir-Khwarrah (formerly Gur, modern day Firuzabad). The city, well supported by high mountains and easily defendable through narrow passes, became the center of Ardashir's efforts to gain more power. The city was surrounded by a high, circular wall, probably copied from that of Darabgird, and on the north-side included a large palace, remains of which still survive today. After establishing his rule over Pars, Ardashir I rapidly extended his territory, demanding fealty from the local princes of Fars, and gaining control over the neighboring provinces of Kerman, Isfahan, Susiana and Mesene. This expansion quickly {{came to the attention of}} Artabanus V, the Parthian king, who initially ordered the governor of Khuzestan to wage war against Ardashir in 224, but the battles were victories for Ardashir. In a second attempt to destroy Ardashir, Artabanus V himself met Ardashir in battle at Hormozgan, where Artabanus V met his death. Following the death of the Parthian ruler, Ardashir <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> invade the western provinces of the now defunct Parthian Empire.|$|E

I was very interested in characterizing or caricaturing a brushstroke..." [...] He has also described this series as follows: [...] "t's taking something that originally was suppose to mean immediacy and I'm tediously drawing something that looks like a brushstroke...I want it to look as though it were painstaking."

2500|$|Gray {{revealed}} {{the most memorable}} thing anyone has said about her work {{in an interview at}} The Eternal Night, a book review site in Britain. Says Gray, [...] "Well, a few years ago, I submitted a story to an editor who wrote back and said it was the sickest thing she ever read, but then she said it was [...] "sick in the best sense of the word". I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> sell it elsewhere (twice!), and it received a Stoker recommendation, so I guess others thought it [...] "sick" [...] as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|The nation {{provided}} an ideal model for showing {{the value of}} the railways for speeding the Industrial Revolution. After 1830, the new nation decided to stimulate industry. It funded a simple cross-shaped system that connected the major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. The system was very soundly built along British lines, so that profits and wages were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place. Léopold <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> build the first railway in continental Europe in 1835, between Brussels and Mechelen. The first trains were drawn by Stephenson engines imported from Great Britain. The development of smaller railways in Belgium, notably the Liège-Jemappes line, was launched by tendering contracts to private companies which [...] "became the model for the extension of small local railways all over the low countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A well edited Amen Break {{alongside}} an 808 sub {{kick and}} some simple atmospherics just sounded so amazing all on its own, thus the speech sample [...] "strictly drum and bass". A {{whole new world}} of possibilities was opening up for the drum programming... It wasn't long before the amen break was being used by practically every producer within the scene, and as time progressed the Belgian style techno stabs and noises disappeared, and the edits and studio trickery {{got more and more}} complex. People were at last beginning to call the music Drum and Bass instead of hardcore. This Amen formula certainly helped cement the sound for many of the tracks <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> produce for Gwange, Q-Project and Spinback on Legend Records. After a while, tracks using the Amen break virtually had a genre all of their own. Foul Play, Peshay, Bukem, DJ Dextrous and DJ Crystl among others were all solid amen addicts back then too." ...|$|E

2500|$|His fast bowling {{gave him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Typhoon Tyson", and despite his short career he achieved status as the fastest England bowler in living memory. Don Bradman called him [...] "the fastest bowler I have ever seen" [...] and Richie Benaud agreed, writing [...] "For a short time, Frank Tyson blasted all-comers". Tom Graveney wrote 'I cannot believe any bowler was faster than Tyson at that time'. When fielding in the slips he had 'to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still. the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots'. His Northants colleague Jock Livingston said 'When really firing, Tyson was the quickest of all {{over a period of}} three or four overs'. Livingston had seen Harold Larwood bowl Bodyline and batted against the Australian fast bowlers Miller and Lindwall in the Sheffield Shield. At the Aeronautical College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1955 metal plates were attached to a cricket ball and a sonic device was used to measure their speed, with Tyson's bowling measured at [...] 89mph (142km/h), but he was wearing three sweaters on a cold, damp morning and used no run up, Brian Statham bowled at 87mph (139km/h). He certainly bowled faster than 89mph in matches, and Tyson claimed that he could bowl at 119mph (190km/h), but this cannot be proven. The best that can be said was that he was noticeably faster than his contemporaries Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Peter Heine and Neil Adcock. His great fast bowling rival Fred Trueman ‘was forever being told that when it came to bowling I was very fast, but on his day Frank Tyson was faster than me' and it was Tyson who kept Trueman out of the England team in 1954–55. When they played together in a Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough in 1957 the captain Godfrey Evans insisted Trueman bowl into the headwind so as to give the faster Tyson the advantage of the tailwind. Dickie Bird, the famous England umpire, wrote [...] "he was certainly the quickest bowler I ever seen through the air, and on one occasion the quickest bowler I never saw through the air". When playing for [...] at Scarborough in 1958 [...] "I opened the innings against him and hit his first three deliveries through the off side for four. With supreme confidence <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the front foot for the fourth ball. Tyson dropped one short. It reared up and hit me on the chin. I went down as if I'd just been {{on the receiving end of}} a right hook...I still carry the scar to show my folly that day. There was blood all over and I saw stars. I could hear bells ringing in my head...". Dickie came back to score his then highest first class score of 62 and Tyson took 4/30. When they met in Australia in 1998–99 Tyson joked 'You're looking well Dickie. See you still have the scars though'.|$|E
