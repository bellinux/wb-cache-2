40|$|This study {{offers the}} reader an {{opportunity}} to glimpse the world and narrative of a gay man recently {{come out of the}} closet and to be invited to participate in his search for improved understanding of his sense <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> It is a study of autobiographical works in order to gain insight into the changes occurring in the author’s sense <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> but is also in itself an autobiographical work. It is a reflection on the author’s story and an interpretation of aspects of that story, using selected documents written by him over a period of time, in order to highlight specific changes that occur in his sense <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> this study is to generate some insight into the sense <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> a gay man, and optimistically other marginalised groups of people, with specific focus on the changes that have occurred over. This study will be approached from a social constructionist paradigm using qualitative and interpretative methods to analyse the various autobiographical works.

It gives us a look at materhood like a social construct and a biological instinct. This part is also dealing with their reciprocal combinations. Another parts of this section is to introduce motherhood like a social role and motherhood like a sense <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> the practical part is to collect information from mothers of three generations about their own experiences with motherhood.

40|$|The method {{known as}} {{analysis}} of variance of simple sort offers a possibility of how to test equality of mean values of several random selections. At the same time, however, it requires the random selections to originate from normal distribution and to meet the condition of homoscedasticity, i. e. the requirement <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> variances. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> this Thesis is to analyse consequences of violation of the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of the input data. The {{first part of the}} Thesis presents an overview of the course of the method based on the {{analysis of variance}} with standard assumptions. It is followed by the deriving of asymptotic distribution of test statistics, supposing the validity of the null hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> mean values in the case that neither the normality of input data nor the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> variances is supposed. The findings are then applied to several special cases.

The social and economical aspects of her struggle, which would help label it as a "Chicana struggle", are less representative than those related to her feminist vindications. Nonetheless, this feminist struggle cannot be understood as a pure feminist one, for the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the Chicana is strongly marked by ethnic and the aforementioned socio-economic factors. Accordingly, the Literature written by the Chicana writer clearly epitomises the ambivalence <b>of</b> her <b>identity.</b> The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> this work is to portray the need of a Chicana critical method that accounts for the particularity of this body of Literature...|$|R

The Schur's formula is extended to the vector case, thus providing the same treatment for vector sequence transformations and the corresponding recursive algorithms.

40|$|The {{mass media}} and the {{cultural}} {{industry as a whole}} have always been regarded as debilitating or even destructive of local and regional cultures, also putting at risk their cultural <b>identities.</b> The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> this paper is to reflect upon alternative ways of thinking about the roles of the mass {{media and the}} possibility <b>of</b> creating new <b>identities</b> in a society which is becoming more complex and global. The analysis starts from empirical data on the cultiual <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the people of the southern-most Brazilian state, who, despite the mass media, and many times with its support, strenghten and renew themselves. The analysis is supported in theories that take into account the communicative aspect of culture and the cultural aspect of commimication, that is, that give cultural status to mass media, blowing us to think of them an outlining element <b>of</b> new cultural <b>identities.</b> These identities can no longer be considered in traditional ways, but as a part of communication processes...|$|R

Using a Grounded Theory approach and a constructivist/symbolic interactionism framework, this case study will exemplify these constructions as fundamental elements of acculturation as a process, through an analysis of one personal weblog.

40|$|The nursing {{profession}} {{belongs to}} helping professions which are heavily demanding {{in terms of}} mental and physical aspects. The nurses who are university graduates enter into practice more mentally and physically mature, and their approach to patients and the care provided may be better than in nurses with secondary education. In care provision nurses have to cooperate with physicians, but also with other healthcare professionals. Due {{to the lack of}} medical personnel nurses assume responsibilities of other team members, which they may perceive as a restriction in fulfilling their professional identity. This restriction may be reflected in the quality of the care provided. It often happens that a nurse cannot fulfill her professional <b>identity</b> because <b>of</b> the pressure of her family which requires the fulfillment of their own requirements prior to fulfilling the professional <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> a nurse. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> the thesis was to determine how nurses, but also their family members, perceive the professional <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> nurses. The <b>aim</b> was achieved. The research was carried out in two phases. The first phase was conducted using interviews with six nurses of different ages both with and without university education.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to study skateboarders' place consumption, identity construction through physical performances and power relations with society in urban context revealing their lived experiences. The objective is to grasp on the everyday life of skateboarders to understand better how skateboarders see themselves in the world and experience the places they take over. This study's research approach is social constructivism and the methodology is Practice Theory. As a method semi-structured interviews were conducted. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> the chosen methodology is to provide thick descriptions of skateboarders' experiences from their everyday life. Previous literature defines urban skateboarding as resistant to the mainstream values by arguing that they want to ideologically distinct themselves from the mainstream society.
