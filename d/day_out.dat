We examined the relative importance of commonly occurring physical and mental disorders in accounting for <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role in 24 countries that participated in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 62 [*] 971 respondents (72. 0 % pooled response rate). Presence of ten chronic physical disorders and nine mental disorders was assessed for each respondent along with information about the number of days in the past month each respondent reported being totally unable to work or carry out their other normal daily activities because of problems with either physical or mental health. Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate associations of specific conditions and comorbidities with <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role, controlling by basic socio-demographics (age, gender, employment status and country). Overall, 12. 8 % of respondents had some <b>day</b> totally <b>out</b> of role, with a median of 51. 1 a year. The strongest individual-level effects (<b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role per year) were associated with neurological disorders (17. 4), bipolar disorder (17. 3) and post-traumatic stress disorder (15. 2). The strongest population-level effect was associated with pain conditions, which accounted for 21. 5 % of all <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role (population attributable risk proportion).

The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910.

40|$|Background: Both {{mental and}} {{physical}} disorders can result in role limitation, such as ‘days out of role’, which have an important impact on national productivity losses. This paper analyses data from the South African Stress and Health Study (SASH) on the association of both {{mental and physical}} disorders with <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role. Methods: Face-to-face {{interviews were conducted with}} a representative sample of 4, 351 adult South Africans. The World Health Organization’s Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI) was used to assess the presence of 21 mental and physical disorders that were grouped into 10 disorder categories for the analysis: major depressive disorder, any anxiety disorders, any substance abuse disorders, headaches or migraine, arthritis, chronic pain, cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes and digestive disorders. Multiple regression techniques were used to explore associations between individual disorders, comorbid conditions, and annual <b>days</b> spent <b>out</b> of role. The estimated societal effects of the disorders [population attributable risk proportion (PARP) ] were obtained. Results: The majority of respondents who reported a mental or physical disorder also reported another disorder (62. 98 %). The average number of disorders reported by respondents who had at least one disorder was 2. 3. Overall 12. 4 % of respondents reported any <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role due to mental or physical disorder. Anxiety disorders and depression were associated with highest <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role (28. 2 and 27. 2, respectively) followed closely by arthritis and pain (24. 7 and 21. 7, respectively). Any mental disorder was associated with 23. 6 <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role, while any physical disorder was associated with 15. 5 <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role. Of the mental disorders, anxiety disorders had the highest PARP in relation to <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role (9. 0 %) followed by depression (4. 8 %) and substance disorder (3. 3. %). More than one-third (37. 6 %) of <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role are attributable to physical disorders and 16. 1 % to mental disorders. Conclusions: Comorbidity is common in both mental and physical disorders, and both are associated with substantial <b>days</b> <b>out</b> of role in South Africa. These data indicate substantial social and economic loss associated with these conditions, and emphasize the need to integrate health services to include common mental disorders in all basic packages of care and to assess for and manage comorbid conditions.
