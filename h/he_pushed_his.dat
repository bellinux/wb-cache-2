25|$|Matisse was {{recognised}} as {{a leader}} of the Fauves, along with André Derain; the two were friendly rivals, each with his own followers. Other members were Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, and Maurice de Vlaminck. The Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau (1826–1898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.|$|E
25|$|Ripley then dispatches {{the money}} back to the Pierson family, {{encourages}} Frank {{to return to his}} family in New England and accompanies him there besides. Despite Ripley's coaching and reassurances, Frank is overwhelmed by guilt as well as by his unrequited love for a teenaged girl named Teresa, and eventually commits suicide by throwing himself over the same precipice from which <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> wheelchair-confined father. Shaken and, much to his own surprise, saddened by Frank's death, Ripley returns to Belle Ombre after securing a former possession of the boy's as a memento.|$|E
25|$|Historian Martin H. Folly {{argues that}} Bevin was not {{automatically}} pro-American. Instead <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> embassy in Washington {{to project a}} view of Britain that neutralized American criticisms. He felt Britain's problems were in part caused by American irresponsibility. He was frustrated with American attitudes. His strategy was to bring Washington around to support Britain's policies, arguing Britain had earned American support and ought to compensate it for its sacrifices against the Nazis. Bevin was not coldly pragmatic, says Folly, nor was he uncritically pro-American; nor was he a puppet manipulated by the British Foreign Office.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> troops so {{hard that}} their horses became unusable, and killed them on this campaign, {{creating}} the namesake for Horseheads, New York. The lukewarm response of the Congress was {{more than he could}} accept. Broken, tired and again opposed by Congress, he retired from the army in 1779 and returned to New Hampshire. Around this time, Sullivan was approached by British agents who tried to persuade him to switch sides. This was part of a concerted effort of approaches to other Generals such as Moses Hazen, Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold who it was believed were unhappy with their treatment by Congress and had lost their faith in the goal of American independence. It was a strategy with mixed results—but which produced the notable defection of Arnold.|$|E
500|$|Former Montreal Canadiens goaltender Ken Dryden {{described}} of Orr: [...] "When {{he began}} to move... the sensation was unique: All the Canadiens began backpedalling in a small panic, like beachgoers sighting a coming monster wave. He brought others with him; he wanted them involved. That's what made him so different: It felt like a five-player stampede moving toward you—and at his pace. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>his</b> teammates, [...] you're playing with {{the best player in}} the league and he's giving you the puck and you just can't mess it up. You had to be better than you'd ever been." ...|$|E
