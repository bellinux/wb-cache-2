The exterior was designed by Olivier Boulay, who was hired by Subaru on a short-term basis. The tail light appearance on both the sedan and wagon {{was influenced by the}} taillights on the SVX. In 1996, Subaru decided to make AWD standard equipment in all vehicles produced for the North American market, which would be the case until 2012. Subaru still offered a choice between FWD and AWD for its domestic market vehicles for this generation. The increased ground clearance Outback was introduced with this generation in 1995 with AWD only internationally, and the air suspension with height control was no longer offered.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a software monopolist who benefits from a lagged network externality arising from consumers' feedback through the so-called bug-fixing effect. That is, the software producer is able to correct errors in the software code detected by previous users, improving her products over time. Another feature of the model is that it responds to the short life cycle of software products, implying time-of-purchase depending utility functions, which are in contrast to the usual durable goods models. Both of these modifications are incorporated in a standard two-periods durable goods monopoly, analysing questions of <b>introductory</b> <b>pricing</b> and quantity rationing. The model suggests that neither of these two instruments is able to explain why we see so much free software in the markets.

40|$|We {{study the}} pricing {{decision}} for a monopolist launching a new innovation. At {{the time of}} launch, {{we assume that the}} monopolist has incomplete information about the true demand curve. Despite the lack of objective information the firm must set a retail price to maximize total profits. To model this environment, we develop a novel two-period non-Bayesian framework, where the monopolist sets the price in each period based only on a non-parametric set of all feasible demand curves. Optimal prices are dynamic as prices in any period allow the firm to learn about demand and improve future pricing decisions. Our main results show that the direction of dynamic <b>introductory</b> <b>prices</b> (versus static) depends on the type of heterogeneity in the market. We find (1) when consumers have homogeneous preferences, <b>introductory</b> dynamic <b>price</b> is higher than the static price (2) when consumers have heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has no ex-ante information, the <b>introductory</b> dynamic <b>price</b> {{is the same as the}} static price and (3) when consumers have heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has ex-ante information, the <b>introductory</b> dynamic <b>price</b> is lower than the static price. Further, the degree of this initial reduction increases with the amount of heterogeneity in the ex-ante information...|$|R

The drugs that enter through the centralized EMA approval procedure are overpriced, which may be a consequence of market globalization and international price setting...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{dynamic pricing}} in markets with network externalities. Network externalities imply demand inertia, because {{the size of}} a network increases the usefulness of the product for consumers. Since past sales increase current demand, firms have an incentive to set low <b>introductory</b> <b>prices</b> to be able to increase prices as their networks grow. However, in reality we observe decreasing prices. This could be due to other factors dominating the network e¤ects. We use an experimental duopoly market with demand inertia to isolate the effect of network externalities. We find that experimental price dynamics are rather consistent with real world observations than with theoretical predictions. Network Externalities, Demand Inertia, Experiments, Oligopoly...|$|R
