5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the <b>disks,</b> which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous <b>disks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} in the physics of {{accretion}} <b>disks</b> is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity. The turbulent viscosity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the transport of the mass to the central protostar and momentum to the periphery of the disk. This is vital for accretion, because the gas can be accreted by the central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum, which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards. The result of this process is the growth of both the protostar and of the disk radius, which can reach 1,000AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough. Large <b>disks</b> are routinely observed in many star-forming regions such as the Orion nebula.|$|E

5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} <b>disks</b> encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in <b>disks</b> are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society.

Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral <b>disks,</b> and rings with gemstones.|$|E

40|$|If a Kerr {{black hole}} is {{connected}} with a <b>disk</b> rotating around it by a magnetic field, the rotational energy of the Kerr black hole provides an energy source for the radiation of the <b>disk</b> in addition to <b>disk</b> accretion. If the black hole rotates faster than the <b>disk,</b> energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and transfered to the <b>disk.</b> The energy deposited into the <b>disk</b> is eventually radiated away by the <b>disk,</b> which will increase {{the efficiency of the}} <b>disk</b> and make the <b>disk</b> brighter than usual. If the black hole rotates slower than the <b>disk,</b> energy and angular momentum are transfered from the <b>disk</b> to the black hole, which will lower the efficiency of the <b>disk</b> and make the <b>disk</b> dimmer than usual. With suitable boundary conditions, quasi-steady state solutions exist for a thin Keplerian <b>disk</b> magnetically torqued by a black hole. By ``quasi-steady state'' we mean that any macroscopic quantity at a given radius in the <b>disk</b> slowly changes with time: the integrated change within one rotation period of the <b>disk</b> is much smaller than the quantity itself. We find that, the torque produced by the magnetic coupling propagates only outward in the <b>disk</b> and approaches a constant at large radii. The total radiation flux of the <b>disk</b> is a superposition of the radiation flux produced by the magnetic coupling and the radiation flux produced by accretion. When the black hole rotates faster than the <b>disk,</b> the magnetic coupling produces an annular bright ``bump'' on the <b>disk.</b> When the black hole rotates slower than the <b>disk,</b> the magnetic coupling produces an annular dark ``valley'' on the <b>disk.</b> An interesting result is that a <b>disk</b> can shine without accretion: the rapidly rotating black hole provides the power...|$|R
