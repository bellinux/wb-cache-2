6000|$|In October 1845 the {{earthquake}} came. Newman was received into the Roman communion. Of this step Mr. Gladstone {{said that it}} has never yet been estimated at anything like the full amount of its calamitous importance. The leader who had wielded a magician's power in Oxford {{was followed by a}} host of other converts. More than once I have heard Mr. Gladstone tell the story <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> time he sought from Manning an answer to the question that sorely perplexed him: what was the common bond of union that led men of intellect so different, of character so opposite, of such various circumstance, to come to the same conclusion. Manning's answer was slow and deliberate: 'Their common bond is their want of truth.' 'I was surprised beyond measure,' Mr. Gladstone would proceed, 'and startled at his judgment.'[193] ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{account for}} this we must tell <b>how,</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> time, it chanced that a very drunk man of the very lowest London type, as far as {{appearance}} went, awoke from a heavy slumber {{which he had been}} enjoying under the seat of a compartment in a certain low gin-palace. He was about to stretch himself and give vent to a noisy yawn when the word [...] "Laidlaw" [...] smote his ear. Pale, worn-out, cadaverous, threadbare, inexpressibly mean, the man gently raised his dissolute form on one elbow and listened to two men in a box beside him. Their heads met almost over the spot where his own head rested. The men were Lockhart and Spivin, and the occasion was that on which we have already described them as engaged in plotting, or referring to, the downfall of the man from Scotland.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{that is a}} discriminating {{portrait}}--a portrait {{which really}} helps you to see that which the writer sets out to describe. After reading it one can understand why even in reminiscent sporting descriptions of those old days, amid all the Tonis and Bills and Jacks, it is always Mr. John Jackson. He was the friend and instructor of Byron and of half the bloods in town. Jackson it was who, {{in the heat of}} combat, seized the Jew Mendoza by the hair, and so ensured that the pugs for ever afterwards should be a close-cropped race. Inside you see the square face of old Broughton, the supreme fighting man of the eighteenth century, the man whose humble ambition it was to begin with the pivot man of the Prussian Guard, and work his way through the regiment. He had a chronicler, the good Captain Godfrey, who has written some English which would take some beating. <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> passage?-- ...|$|E
