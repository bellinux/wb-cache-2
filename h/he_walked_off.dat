5|$|E. Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian was {{originally}} awarded {{a bronze medal}} in the Greco-Roman 84 kg event. However, at the medal ceremony <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the podium and dropped his medal on the mat in protest of the judging in his event. On August 16, 2008, the International Olympic Committee decided to strip him of his medal because they felt it amounted to a political demonstration and was disrespectful to other athletes.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{returned}} from injury after {{two and a}} half weeks on the sidelines immediately after the Fourth Test. He made 24 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. He delivered 14 overs in the second innings, taking 0/6, the most economical figures in the match apart from one bowler who bowled a solitary maiden. When Australia fielded, a point of interest for onlookers was where Barnes would field; he stayed at mid-wicket, well clear of the batsman. Barnes made 31 in the next game against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. After being given out lbw to Allan Watkins, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> visibly showing his displeasure at the umpiring decision, believing the ball would have missed leg stump. The hosts fell for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E

25|$|Pasarell won a titanic first set, 24–22, {{then with}} {{daylight}} fading, the 41-year-old Gonzales {{argued that the}} match should be suspended. The referee didn't relent, and thus the petulant Gonzales virtually threw the second set, losing it 6–1. At the break, the referee agreed the players should stop. Gonzales was booed as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> Centre Court.|$|E
25|$|Included as a {{replacement}} for Alan Kippax, Bradman walked to the crease {{on the first day of}} the second Test at the MCG with the score at 2/67. A world record crowd of 63,993 provided a standing ovation that delayed play for several minutes. Anticipating the bouncer first ball, Bradman moved across to play the hook shot, but the ball failed to rise and he dragged it onto his stumps, making his initial first-ball duck in a Test. The crowd fell into stunned silence as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April 1994, Cantona {{was awarded}} the 1994 Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year Award by his fellow professionals. Cantona had been banned from March until October 1995 for aiming a flying kick at a spectator gesturing {{at him from the}} Palace crowd as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the field after being sent off for a {{straight}} red card offence shortly after half time during a League game on Wednesday 25 January 1995 at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace. In April 1996, Cantona {{was awarded the}} Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year Award, for both his on-field contributions, and his exemplary behaviour following the Selhurst Park incident.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 Cohen toured for {{the first}} time, in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and {{appeared}} at the Isle of Wight Festival. In 1972 he toured again in Europe and Israel. When his performance in Israel didn't {{seem to be going}} well, however, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the stage, went to his dressing room, and took some LSD. He then heard the audience clamoring for his reappearance by singing to him in Hebrew, and {{under the influence of the}} psychedelic, he returned to finish the show. Additionally, in 1973 he played a special performance for a group of IDF soldiers in the outposts of Sinai during the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
25|$|Australian wrestler Hassene Fkiri was {{ejected from}} the 96kg Greco-Roman {{competition}} and stripped of the silver medal after making an obscene gesture at the international FILA judges during the final. According to an Australian official, Fkiri was furious at his Indian rival Anil Kumar, who he accused of breaking the rules {{a number of times}} in the first period by holding Fkiri around the neck and head with two hands. The Australian received his first warning after he made a comment to the referee as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the mat {{at the end of the}} two-minute period; when Kumar repeated the same move in the next round, Fkiri headbutted him and was issued a second warning. He then proceeded to swing his arms uncontrollably afterwards, which resulted in his third warning and eventual disqualification. After losing, Fkiri refused to shake hands with the victor.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 {{he reached}} {{the quarterfinals of the}} French International Hard Court Championship partnering Béla von Kehrling; they were {{defeated}} by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926 he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm threw derogatory verbal abuses to his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who had enough and walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy and as a result an official ban was requested on the Austrian to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard the laughter of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was also upset by the count's actions and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again.|$|E

25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E
500|$|On 1 June 1987, Davies {{made his}} first and only {{appearance}} as a television presenter on Play School alongside regular presenter Chloë Ashcroft. Why Don't You? line producer Peter Charlton suggested that he would [...] "be good on camera" [...] and advised him to take his career public. Davies was granted the opportunity for sporadic appearances {{over a period of}} six months; he hosted only one episode as a storytelling illustrator before <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the set and commented he was [...] "not doing that again". The appearance remains an in-joke in the industry, and the recordings were invariably requested for wrap parties Davies attended.|$|E

[...] There was further difficulties in production as Zicree also hired a professional assistant director, but <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> set during a night shoot early in the production and did not return. Cawley later said [...] "Marc is all about using this production to further his own career, a stark difference between his goal {{and all the others}} who were there doing it, did we aspire to be a pro-looking production? Yup. And we were and are proud of it. Did we take salaries and/or compensation? Nope. That was a tough episode to shoot for many reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling about him." [...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off,</b> and my life was never the same again".|$|E
500|$|The public clamoured for {{the return}} of Bradman to defeat Bodyline: [...] "he was the batsman who could conquer this cankerous bowling... 'Bradmania', amounting almost to {{religious}} fervour, demanded his return". Recovered from his indisposition, Bradman returned to the side in Alan Kippax's position. A world record crowd of 63,993 at the MCG saw Bradman come to the crease {{on the first day of}} the Second Test with the score at 2/67. A standing ovation ensued that delayed play for several minutes. Bradman anticipated receiving a bouncer as his first ball and, as the bowler delivered, he moved across his stumps to play the hook shot. The ball failed to rise and Bradman dragged it onto his stumps; the first-ball duck was his first in a Test. The crowd fell into stunned silence as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off.</b> However, Australia took a first innings lead in the match, and another record crowd on 2 January 1933 watched Bradman hit a counter-attacking second innings century. His unbeaten 103 (from 146balls) in a team total of 191 helped set England a target of 251 to win. Bill O'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger bowled Australia to a series-levelling victory amid hopes that Bodyline was beaten.|$|E

500|$|Bangladesh lost wickets {{at regular}} {{intervals}} {{at the start of}} their innings; {{by the end of the}} 38th over, they had lost five wickets. Rahim joined Siddique after the fifth wicket fell, and the pair batted patiently together to see their side through to force the match into its final day. The partnership continued to battle during the fifth morning of the match, and Siddique reached his first Test century, coming from 262 deliveries. Shortly after, Prior failed to take a difficult catch, but Siddique did not capitalise on the mistake, adding no more runs before he was caught in the slips shortly after lunch. The bowler, Swann, swore at Siddique as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the pitch, something he later apologised for, saying that it was [...] "a testament to him that he did get everyone frustrated." [...] Rahim was bowled by Swann four overs later, and despite a late assault by Naeem Islam, who scored three fours and three sixes before being becoming Swann's 10th victim of the match, England won by 181 runs. Swann, who took five wickets in each innings, was the first English off spinner since Jim Laker in 1956 to take 10 wickets in a match. His performance in the match led to him rising to second place in the ICC Test bowling rankings.|$|E
500|$|Hutton then leg glanced Miller, before cover {{driving and}} square cutting him in another over. All three shots went for four {{and he reached}} his fifty in 110 minutes. Miller responded to the spate of {{boundaries}} {{with a series of}} bouncers, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his short-pitched barrage, including shouts of [...] "Bodyline". The original practitioners of Bodyline, Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, were both from Nottinghamshire and played at Trent Bridge, and were later excluded from selection for England after being blamed for the ill-feeling caused by Bodyline. The Nottinghamshire supporters were still angry with how their players had been removed and were not happy that Miller was able to do something they saw to be equivalent. For his part, Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. However, Hutton had the last word, glancing Miller down to fine leg for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 121/2, with Hutton and Compton on 63 and 36 respectively. Miller was widely jeered and heckled as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the field, and the crowded surged towards him as he walked up the steps into the dressing room. O'Reilly defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that he had not employed a packed leg side field and had allowed the batsman the opportunity to score from hook and pull shots if he was willing to try; in contrast the packed Bodyline field meant batsmen would find little reward for such shots and defensive play would only lead to dismissal.|$|E
