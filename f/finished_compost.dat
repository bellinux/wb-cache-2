40|$|Compost {{has been}} shown to have a range of {{positive}} impacts on soil quality and can provide an important source of nutrients for plants. While these benefits have been documented for many <b>finished</b> <b>composts,</b> there is presently little understanding of the impact of composting process conditions and the extent of compost decomposition on soil C and N mineralization after compost incorporation. This study evaluated the impact of composting process conditions and the extent of compost decomposition on soil C and N mineralization after compost incorporation. Dried, ground composts were blended with equal parts of quartz sand and soil and incubated aerobically for 28 d at 30 °C. Cumulative respired CO 2 –C and net mineralized N were quantified. Results indicate that (1) organic substrates that did not degrade due to sub-optimal conditions during the composting process can readily mineralize after incorporation in soil; (2) C and N cycling dynamics in soil after compost incorporation can be affected by compost feedstock, processing conditions, and time; and (3) denitrification after compost incorporation in soil can limit N availability from compost...|$|R
30|$|This {{stage of}} {{composting}} process consists in a directed and controlled fermentation. The compost is introduced in totally isolated tunnels where the adequate conditions of temperature, humidity and oxygenation are achieved {{to get the}} perfect <b>finish</b> of the <b>compost.</b> Instruments such as long distance thermometers, fans, steam injection systems, valves and boilers are used to facilitate the control at this stage.|$|R
40|$|Stabilization {{of organic}} wastes by {{composting}} is highly desirable as composting eliminates odor, increases nutrient contents, and prevents the organic wastes from becoming phytotoxic when {{incorporated into the}} soil. It is a microbial-mediated process, which breaks {{down some of the}} organic N to more readily useable forms, with the release of a sizable portion of organic C as CO 2. The viability of composting depends very much on the quality and consistency of compost produced as they affect compost marketability and its end use. The article reviews the composting processes, various techniques used in compost production, and the methods used in the determination of compost maturity and quality. The selection of a technique and a location for composting should consider the availability of feed stocks and the land, and the proximity to urban population. The review also focuses in some detail on nitrogen and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in various composts and how effective the composts are in promoting crop productivity and soil quality as well as in replacing peat as a growing medium for container crops. Because of a significant impact of compost metals on compost quality and soil metal accumulation, an extensive review was made on the concentrations of various metals in composts using municipal solid waste and/or sewage sludge (or biosolids) as feed stocks. The concentration limits of various metals in the <b>finished</b> <b>composts</b> imposed by different countries around the world and the resulting effect of compost application to soil on plant uptake of metals and the transferability of the added compost metals from soil to plants were discussed...|$|R

Composting mixtures with greater pH values during composting process showed higher losses of N. Super phosphate charged manure compost outperformed the control, in terms of C/N ratio and concentration of macro-nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg and S). Quality parameters for all the manure composts conformed to the Canadian Compost Guidelines indicating satisfactory standards. Waste cocoa pods enriched with superphosphate did not show any deleterious effects on cocoa seedlings’ growth, rather, improved plant height, dry matter production and foliar N concentration.|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of NH 3 and NOx gases during feedlot manure composting reduces the agronomic value of final compost as a soil amendment. In addition, NOx gases cause air smog and deplete stratospheric ozone. The effect of passive aeration treatment (no turning) and active aeration treatment (turned 6 times) on NH 3 and NOx emission during composting of feedlot manure {{was investigated in}} open windrows in summer 1997. The atmospheric concentrations of NH 3, NO and NO 2 at the windrow surface and 50 cm above were monitored throughout the composting period (99 days). Composting increased the atmospheric concentration of NH 3 and NO, while NO 2 was not affected. The atmospheric NH 3 concentration was higher during early composting and decreased with the composting period for both aeration treatments. Active aeration resulted in a much higher early NH 3 concentration (5500 ppb) than passive aeration (1000 ppb) at the windrow surface, {{but there was little}} difference later in the composting. The lower NH 3 loss for the passive aeration treatment is consistent with the higher N retained in the compost {{at the end of the}} experiment. The atmospheric NO concentration increased up to 350 ppb at the surface of the passive aeration windrow during early composting, then decreased to much lower values (< 50 ppb) around day 50 and stayed low for the rest of composting period. Similar NO atmospheric concentration patterns were observed for the active aeration treatment, but the early NO concentration was much lower. Since the decomposition of manure/compost materials was incomplete for the passive aeration treatment, further studies are needed to investigate possible techniques to reduce NH 3 and NO losses (retaining more N in the <b>finishing</b> <b>compost)</b> while increasing the composting rate...|$|R

Recycled Content: Approximately 50% of {{materials}} in the building are recycled or re-used, including brick cladding from early 20th century street pavers (brick [...] "cobblestones"), approximately 65% of the heavy timber structural frame was salvaged from the Armories Building across the street, interior steel railings at stairs and balconies, sinks, toilet accessories, doors and frames, approximately 25% of the electrical conduit, {{as well as other}} components that used recycled {{materials in the}}ir fabrication. * Sanitary System: When initially constructed, the building was not connected to the campus sanitary (sewage) system. Instead the building washrooms were fitted with composting toilets [...] that allowed waste to fall down through a stainless steel chutes into composting bins located {{in the basement of the}} building. Urine filtering through the compost medium forms a leachate, which initially was drained and combined with drainage from the lavatories and released into a linear bioswayle or [...] "greywater trench", designed by the landscape architect and the mechanical engineer.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Power plants spend nearly 50 billion dollars a year on fuel cost. Presently coal accounts for over 75 % of the electricity generated in this country. Due to increasingly harsh environmental regulations, the demand for low sulfur (S) coal has dramatically increased. This increase in demand is expected to cause the price of coal to rise. Such a senario has caused the utilities to explore the possibilities of supplementing coal with fuel alternatives such as the byproducts of process industries. The supplemental fuel for utilities located near feedlots (e. g. Northwest Texas) happens to be feedlot manure. Feedlot manure is attractive because it is nearly ten times cheaper than coal and is relatively inexpensive to transport. There exists nearly six million head of cattle in Northwest Texas which produce 25, 000 tons of manure each day. Feedlot manure presents water and air pollution concerns if not disposed of properly. As such, the feedlot operators are eager to find methods of safely disposing of the feedlot manure. A small scale boiler burner facility has been constructed to simulate a utility class boiler. Experiments were conducted with coal only and then for coal/feedlot manure. Three types of feedlot manure are examined; raw feedlot manure, partially composted feedlot manure, and <b>finished</b> <b>composted</b> feedlot manure. Performance characteristics and emission data were taken for each case. A summary of the results is as follows: (I) sulfur Wyoming coal was fired and a gasification efficiency of 66 % was measured. (i I) Emissions measurements were recorded and it was seen that emissions of NO,, and S 02 increased as the burnt mass fraction increased. However, all emissions were within NSPS guidelines. (iii) The successful firing of coal and feedlot manure was achieved, a gasification efficiency in the range of 86 % was measured, which is higher than 66 % obtained when firing coal alone. (iv) When the fuel blend is fully burnt, the NO,, emissions with the blend firing was lower than the firing of coal alone...|$|R

3000|$|Hazards—First, a {{biological}} hazard can be found, as the <b>compost</b> that has <b>finished</b> this stage and {{is ready to}} be spawned may be contaminated by contact with the compost from Phase I, which {{is ready to be}}gin the pasteurization process. Another major hazard is the neglect of sanitary conditions in the facilities, which leads to conditions that favor the microbiology contamination, the occurrence of diseases and the appearance of pathogens that may be harmful for the <b>finishing</b> of <b>compost</b> and the subsequent growth of mushrooms. When the equipment responsible for keeping the temperature and oxygenation conditions does not work properly, which is not adequately controlled or calibrated, the main objective of the pasteurization process is impeded. Thus, certain organisms detrimental to the growth of the mushrooms may be developed with the subsequent consequences in the mushroom growth. In addition, an insufficient training of the personnel responsible for controlling the monitoring system may also lead to a hazard for the correct conduct of this stage. However, it is sufficient to establish preventive measures to eliminate or reduce this hazard to acceptable levels. When the tunnel is being filled, if the compost is unevenly distributed, the irregularities of the compost may serve as a refuge for some pests and diseases since the pressure of the air injected into these areas will be lower than the rest.|$|R

30|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of the <b>composted</b> <b>finished</b> product, i.e., RP-EC with different combination ratios of RP and compost revealed that the maximum improvement in the P availability (2380  mg kg− 1) was exhibited with 50 : 50 combination ratio between RP and compost (Table  1). The C:N is an important indicator of compost maturity as it indicates the extent of decomposition of biological wastes being used during composting and its stabilization, ranges from 15 to 25 of matured compost materials (Watson 2003). The production of organic acids such as acetate, lactate, oxalate, tartrate, succinate, citrate, gluconate, ketogluconate, glycolate, etc., during the composting process by the microbes might have resulted in increasing the availability of nutrients especially P as observed the chemical analysis after composting (Table  1). Due to mineralization of nutrients present, availability of carbon and other nutrients is increased during composting, which increases the microbial population and ultimately the production of organic acids (Rashid et al. 2004; Biswas and Narayanasamy 2006; Chakraborty et al. 2011). The presence of various organic acids in the composted materials helps to accelerate the break down the RP by pushing the dissolution reaction to the right. The increase in production of CO 2 during the composting process occurred due to low pH. This CO 2 helps to produce carbonic acids {{in the presence of}} water and have been reported to increase the available P in the soil and from RP (Chien 1979). Previous studies indicated that production of microbial extracellular products such as enzymes and organic acids can increase the mineralization of nutrients (Chien 1979; Jansson et al. 1988).|$|R
