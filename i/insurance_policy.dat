40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are {{traditionally}} classified as unilateral or “reverse-unilateral” contracts, a characterization we find largely incorrect, with problematic consequences for adjudication of insurance coverage disputes. In {{addition to the}} general difficulties attending the unilateral classification, the concept as applied to <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> is not only unhelpful but incorrect. <b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are more accurately viewed as bilateral contracts. In addition, the unilateral characterization of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> introduces error and inconsistency into the litigation of insurance controversies. In particular, the unilateral view tends toward excessive formalism and focus on so-called “conditions” precedent to coverage, eschewing material breach analysis and encouraging needless forfeitures as well as unwisely removing the concept of anticipatory repudiation and corresponding remedy from insurance law. Categorizing <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> as unilateral fails to appreciate the ongoing, iterative nature of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> and the insurer-policyholder relationship. Recognizing the bilateral nature of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> holds substantial potential for improving insurance coverage adjudication...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{treatment}} of life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> in deceased estates {{and the effect}} thereof on marriages in community of property {{is the cause of}} various problems for executors. In terms of section 3 (3) of the Estate Duty Act 45 of 1955 life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets of the deceased. Consequently life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the estate duty addendum of the deceased estate. Life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> however are not always reflected in the liquidation account of the deceased estate as assets, notwithstanding the fact that life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets for estate duty purposes. In this regard a distinction should be made between two situations: firstly where life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured estate and secondly where life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured. For spouses married in community of property this creates a problem especially when you keep in mind that life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are in many instances a person's biggest monetary asset. When life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has a claim on half of the policy proceeds. When life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has no claim on the policy proceeds. The problem that arises in this regard {{is that there is no}} certainty as to what extent life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> should be included in the calculation of estate duty, and how these policies must be reflected in the estate of the deceased. This uncertainty has been perpetuated by courts. This research will illustrate how the courts came to different conclusions where the facts were more or less similar. Master...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive assessment of premiums, reserves and solvency capital requirements (SCRs) {{for long-term care}} (LTC) <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> using Activities of Daily Living and US data. We compare stand-alone <b>policies,</b> whole life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> with LTC benefit riders (LTC insurance combined with whole life insurance), life care annuities (LTC insurance combined with annuities) and shared LTC insurance in terms of net premium cost and SCRs. Net premiums and best-estimate reserves for base LTC <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are determined using Thiele’s differential equation. Product features such as the elimination period and the maximum benefit period are compared using a simulation-based model. We show how a maximum benefit period can reduce costs and risks for LTC insurance products. SCRs for longevity risk and disability risk {{are based on the}} Solvency II standard formula. We quantify the extent to which whole life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> with LTC benefit riders and life care annuities provide lower SCRs than stand-alone LTC <b>insurance</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
