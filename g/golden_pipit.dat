50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>pipit</b> (Tmetothylacus tenellus) is a {{distinctive}} pipit of dry country grassland, savanna and shrubland in eastern Africa. It {{is native to}} Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, and has occurred as a vagrant to Oman, South Africa and Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|The adult male, {{unlike most}} pipits, {{is very easy}} to identify. It is yellow below and yellow in the wings. From the front the yellow throat and breast with the dark band does {{resemble}} the yellow-throated longclaw or Pangani longclaw, but neither have yellow wings (very obvious in flight) and both have a black line in the face. The female <b>golden</b> <b>pipit</b> is a fairly typical brown pipit but has a yellow underside to the wing.It is gold in colour.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the family}} {{there is an}} {{additional}} species, the <b>golden</b> <b>pipit,</b> Tmetothylacus tennelus, which belongs to a distinct, monotypic genus. This species is apparently intermediate in appearance between the pipits and the longclaws, and is probably {{more closely related to}} the longclaws. One species of pipit, the yellow-breasted pipit, is sometimes split out into a genus Hemimacronyx, which is considered to be intermediate between the longclaws and pipits. The split was originally proposed based on morphological features but it has also found support based upon genetic analysis.|$|E
50|$|Padjelanta's bird-life however is {{very rich}} and showcases most species {{associated}} with the Swedish bare mountain fell - and fell lake regions.The most typical species on the heath are European <b>golden</b> plover, meadow <b>pipit</b> and northern wheatear but rock ptarmigan, Eurasian dotterel and whimbrel are also fairly common sights.|$|R
50|$|About 125 {{different}} species of birds have been observed in the park. Some common species are European <b>golden</b> plover, meadow <b>pipit</b> and northern wheatear. Whimbrel, long-tailed jaeger, eagle and rough-legged buzzard {{can also be seen}} and with a bit of luck the unusual species lesser white-fronted goose, gyrfalcon and great grey owl can be observed. Sjaunja, the largest bird reserve in Sweden, borders to the park in the east.|$|R
50|$|Because its {{landscape}} is largely untouched by man, Cape Wrath {{has a wide}} diversity of wildlife, including red deer, fulmar, hooded crow, rock <b>pipit,</b> <b>golden</b> eagle, cormorant and gannet. An area of 1019.2 ha is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The cliffs around the cape are an internationally important nesting site for over 50000 seabirds, including colonies of puffin Fratercula arctica, razorbill Alca torda, guillemot Uria aalge, kittiwake Rissa tridactyla and fulmar Fulmarus glacialis. The SPA extends 2 km out to sea and includes the sea bed and marine environment which {{is a source of}} food for the bird population of the area.|$|R
50|$|The Sharpe's longclaw is {{a member}} of the family Motacillidae, which {{includes}} the pipits and wagtails. The species was originally placed with the other longclaws in the genus Macronyx, a treatment still followed by some taxonomists. Most now place the species with the yellow-breasted pipit in the separate genus Hemimacronyx. The two species are closely related and form a superspecies. This genus, along with the <b>golden</b> <b>pipit</b> in the genus Tmetothylacus and the longclaws form an exclusively African clade within the family, separate from the true pipits in the genus Anthus and the wagtails.|$|E
5000|$|The lush river forest patches are {{remainders}} {{of western}} African forests. The river cuts through dry woodland and open savannah. Recorded bird species there number 262, {{and at least}} 57 species of mammals live there. There are several endemic tree species {{as well as a}} variety of other animals and plants. [...] Many of the bird and animal species in the reserve are unusual in East Africa, being typical of Central Africaâ€™s lowland rainforest. The white-winged apalis is extremely rare. The African openbill stork, martial eagle, bat hawk, African pygmy-falcon, African barred owlet, scaly babbler, black-bellied glossy-starling, and <b>golden</b> <b>pipit</b> are also rare.|$|E
50|$|Hemimacronyx is a {{proposed}} genus of {{birds in the}} pipit and wagtail family Motacillidae. It contains two species that are usually treated as belonging to two larger genera, Macronyx (in the case of Sharpe's longclaw) and Anthus (in the case of yellow-breasted pipit). The plumage of the two species is more {{similar to that of}} the longclaws and the <b>golden</b> <b>pipit,</b> having brown barred backs and bright yellow breasts and throats. They are presumed to be closely related to these two groups, but the split has not been widely recognised. Both species are found in open areas of Africa. They are both threatened with extinction due to human activities, principally habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|Wagtails, pipits, and longclaws are slender, {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} passerines, ranging from 14 to 17 centimetres in length, with short necks and long tails. They have long, pale legs with long toes and claws, particularly the hind toe {{which can be}} up to 4 cm in length in some longclaws. There is no sexual dimorphism in size. Overall the robust longclaws are larger than the pipits and wagtails. Longclaws can weigh as much as 64 g, whereas the weight range for pipits and wagtails is 15-31 g. The plumage of most pipits is dull brown and reminiscent of the larks, although some species have brighter plumages, particularly the <b>golden</b> <b>pipit</b> of north-east Africa. The adult male longclaws have brightly coloured undersides. The wagtails often have striking plumage, including grey, black, white, and yellow.|$|E
