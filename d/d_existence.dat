The spiral convergence is imposed due to the rule of kinetic-energy transfer between the two species. It results that the most probable scenario is that the steady state breaks into cyclic orbit at lower amplitude of vibration below a bifurcation threshold. The nature of the bifurcation is not known; it can be critical, subcritical, hypercritical or can exhibit a tri-critical point as varying the control parameters.

Meyer 1 1 Institute of Sports and Preventive Medicine, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany 2 Department Medical Engineering & Neuroprosthetics, Fraunhofer IBMT, St. Ingbert, Germany 3 Institute of Exercise and Health Sciences, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland Introduction Cooling after exercise {{has been suggested}} as a method to improve recovery during intensive training periods or competitions lasting several days to weeks. It has been investigated in various studies and has also {{found its way into}} practice. However, many existing studies include untrained subjects to induce a higher degree of muscle soreness and fatigue due to a reduced fitness level. It is not clear if the results of those studies can be transferred to trained athletes. Although recent review articles on the topic of cooling {{and recovery}} exist, none of those has focused especially on trained athletes [Halson, 2011; Leeder et al., 2011]. The purpose of this work was to fill this gap. Methods A literature search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, ISI Web of Science, AMED and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria were: a) explicit analysis of trained subjects, b) cooling after exercise, c) performance measurement, <b>d)</b> <b>existence</b> of a control group or condition, e) performance evaluation at least 2 h after cooling to exclude potential precooling effects. In total, 14 studies with 153 subjects were located and analyzed. For all studies, the effect of cooling on performance was determined, and effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated. Results In order to determine under which circumstances cooling may be most beneficial, several parameters of the study design were more closely examined. Regarding performance measurement, the best effects were found for endurance parameters (3 studies/ 30 subjects, 3. 7 %, g= 0. 35), while for jump (3 / 35, 3. 4 %, g= 0. 13), strength (10 / 113, 2. 4 %, g= 0. 12) and sprint performance (4 / 46, 2. 7 %, g= 0. 10), effects were smaller. The effects were most pronounced when performance was evaluated 48 h after exercise (7 / 71, 5. 0 %, g= 0. 34). With respect to the exercise which was used to induce fatigue, effects after strength training (4 / 39, 3. 6 %, g= 0. 18) were slightly larger than after endurance-type exercise (10 / 114, 2. 2 %, g= 0. 16). Cold water immersion (10 / 117, 2. 9 %, g= 0. 19) and cryogenic chambers (2 / 18, 3. 8 %, g= 0. 14) seemed to be more beneficial than cooling packs (2 / 18, 0. 3 %, g= 0. 00). Discussion Overall, the effects of cooling on recovery were rather small (2. 8 %, g= 0. 17). Under appropriate conditions, however, cooling after exercise may have relevant positive effects on performance recovery of trained athletes. Especially for the recovery of endurance performance, relevant beneficial changes were reported. Halson SL (2011) Int J Sports Physiol Perform 6 : 147 - 59. Leeder J et al.

We found four patterns in the frequency-dependent behavior of reflection coefficients: (a) a nearly flat spectrum (little variation), (b) a significant hole at a frequency of approximately 1 or 3  Hz, (c) a peak at a frequency of approximately 2 or 3  Hz, and (<b>d)</b> the <b>existence</b> of a hole and a peak. The variety in observed spectra reflects the complex nature of the ICB. To interpret these observations, we conducted 2 D finite difference simulations.

Our modeling results suggest that holes and peaks in the spectra of reflection coefficients can be qualitatively explained by a sinusoidal or spike-like topography at the ICB, with wavelengths and heights ~ 1 – 1.5  km, whereas a liquid or solid layer overlying the ICB does not reproduce any of the observed spectral features.|$|R
