We estimated odds ratios for associations with SNPs and combined SNP P-values to compute gene region-specific, functional group-specific, and overall P-value using an adaptive rank-truncated product algorithm. In the Mediterranean population, we found suggestive evidence that RECQL 4, a gene involved in genome stability, RTEL 1, a gene regulating telomere elongation, and TERF 2, a gene implicated in the protection of telomeres, were associated with melanoma, the presence of dysplastic nevi and number of nevi, respectively.

40|$|Prevention is an {{essential}} prerequisite to overcome the global burden of cancer. Skin cancer is a prevailing problem for societies. Dermatologists are the only group of specialist doctors appropriately trained for skin cancer detection. With the naked eye already most of melanocytic and non-melanocytic skin cancers can be detected. Further security and enhancement of detection rate is assisted by dermoscopy and in addition video dermoscopy. Patients having {{a large amount of}} melanocytic nevi and those suffering from <b>nevus</b> <b>dysplastic</b> syndrome need regular follow-up associated with a complete documentation by hand written methods, drawings and/or single or multi lesion photography. There is an increasing need to develop computer assisted full body skin imaging to support doctors and to reduce workload. It was the aim of our interdisciplinary group of dermatologists, specialists in computer visualistics, medical device manufacturer and automation system specialists to develop a physician assisting half automated full body scanning imaging system. Furthermore, a doctor’s working place for reviewing the online and offline produced pictures including data files of case history, dermpath and surgery records and procedures and decisions steps recording was developed. The automatic recognition of pigmented lesions is classified in three categories a. suspicious b. not suspicious, and, c. doubtful/no decison. The classification is based on a thesaurus of classified lesions by independent experienced dermatologists and stabilized by dermatopathological support of all types of lesions. The device is based on a scanner cabin in which according to the construction type the patient is stepwise rotating and more than 30 different imaging fields of the body surface are documented by high power cameras.

5000|$|... "Dysplastic nevus syndrome" [...] {{refers to}} {{individuals}} who have high numbers of benign moles and also have dysplastic nevi. A small percent of these individuals are members of melanoma kindreds. Inherited <b>dysplastic</b> <b>nevus</b> syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary condition. Dysplastic nevi {{are more likely to}} undergo malignant transformation when they occur among members of melanoma families. At least one study indicates a cumulative lifetime risk of nearly 100% in individuals who have dysplastic nevi and are members of melanoma kindreds.Roughly half of melanomas arise [...] "de novo" [...] on clear skin growth, whereas the other half arise within atypical moles. Those with dysplastic nevi have an elevated risk of melanoma. Such persons need to be checked regularly for any changes in their moles and to note any new ones. In 40-50% of cases, the disorder has been linked with germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene, which codes for p16 (a regulator of cell division).|$|E
50|$|Nevi are {{typically}} diagnosed clinically {{with the naked}} eye or using dermatoscopy. More advanced imaging tests are available for distinguishing melanocytic nevi from melanoma, including computerized dermoscopy and image analysis. The management of nevi depends on the type of nevus and the degree of diagnostic uncertainty. Some nevi are known to be benign, and may simply be monitored over time. Others may warrant more thorough examination and biopsy for histopathological examination (looking at a sample of skin under a microscope to detect unique cellular features). For example, a clinician may want to determine whether a pigmented nevus is a type of melanocytic nevus, <b>dysplastic</b> <b>nevus,</b> or melanoma as some of these skin lesions pose a risk for malignancy. The ABCDE criteria (asymmetry, border irregularity, color variegation, diameter > 6 mm, and evolution) are often used to distinguish nevi from melanomas in adults, while modified criteria (amelanosis, bleeding or bumps, uniform color, small diameter or de novo, and evolution) can be used when evaluating suspicious lesions in children. In addition to histopathological examination, some lesions may also warrant additional tests to aid in diagnosis, including special stains, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "scoop", [...] "scallop", or [...] "shave" [...] excisional biopsy, or [...] "shave excision". A trend has {{occurred}} in dermatology over the last 10 years with the advocacy of a deep shave excision of a pigmented lesion An author published {{the result of this}} method and advocated it as better than standard excision and less time consuming. The added economic benefit is that many surgeons bill the procedure as an excision, rather than a shave biopsy. This save the added time for hemostasis, instruments, and suture cost. The great disadvantage, seen years later is the numerous scallop scars, and a very difficult to deal with lesions called a [...] "recurrent melanocytic nevus". What has happened is that many [...] "shave" [...] excisions does not adequately penetrate the dermis or subcutanous fat enough to include the entire melanocytic lesion. Residual melanocytes regrow into the scar. The combination of scarring, inflammation, blood vessels, and atypical pigmented streaks seen in these recurrent nevus gives the perfect dermatoscopic picture of a melanoma. When a second physicians re-examine the patient, he or she {{has no choice but to}} recommend the reexcision of the scar. If one does not have access to the original pathology report, it is impossible to tell a recurring nevus from a severely <b>dysplastic</b> <b>nevus</b> or a melanoma. As the procedure is widely practiced, it is not unusual to see a patient with dozens of scallop scars, with as many as 20% of the scars showing residual pigmentation. The second issue with the shave excision is fat herniation, iatrogenic anetoderma, and hypertrophic scarring. As the deep shave excision either completely remove the full thickness of the dermis or greatly diminishing the dermal thickness, subcutanous fat can herniate outward or pucker the skin out in an unattractive way. In areas prone to friction, this can result in pain, itching, or hypertrophic scarring.|$|E

Although larger sample sizes are necessary to resolve these issues fully, results so far show that a high percentage of correct classification (from 96 % to 100 %) is achievable by either method, using only two or three of the 20 available features.

In this study, we provided clinical and histological characterisations for each of 150 pigmented lesions from 150 patients with prior malignant melanoma. The steps involved {{in the study were}} as follows: (1) The two to four clinicians characterised pigmented lesions on each of 150 patients, and the lesion closest in characteristics to an atypical nevus was quantitatively described based on size, border characteristics and colour characteristics; (2) The lesion was then removed and independently quantified by a single dermatopathologist without knowledge of the clinical features; (3) We computed the correlation between each of the clinical variables and each of the histologic features for each of the 150 patients. Histologic diagnosis of <b>dysplastic</b> <b>nevus</b> was strongly associated with total number of palpable arm nevi, total number of any arm nevi, total number of nevi on the body of any type, and total number of clinically atypical nevi on the body (correlation coefficients 23. 2 % to 30. 4 % with P less than 0. 01 in each instance).
