In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about five percent of the watershed.|$|E

5|$|The Liliaceae {{probably}} arose as shade plants, {{with subsequent}} evolution to open areas including deciduous <b>forest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more open autumnal period.

5|$|As with Seasons, the Triforce {{calls out}} to Link. Link is transported to a <b>forest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land of Labrynna, where he hears screaming. In a clearing, Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, {{a young woman with}} blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes a disruption in the time flow of Labrynna.|$|E

5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri <b>forest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in the ecology of tabonuco <b>forest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E

5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in old growth <b>forest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak <b>forest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on calcareous soil.|$|E

5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses.

5|$|Plants were {{cultivated}} {{mostly in}} small nearby gardens, but wheat and barley were also grown on small fields obtained by burning the <b>forest.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> absence of animal-drawn plowing devices, soil was being hoed manually.

Further out were the pastures, {{the entire area}} utilized by a single settlement having a radius of about 5km. Cattle, sheep and goats were even more numerous in the northern flatlands, where the land was less fertile.
