The little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs, which {{invariably}} end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotises Teddy, he snaps {{his fingers and}} the bear's head falls backwards {{as if it had}} fallen asleep instantly (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy's head up). Mr. Bean behaves as if the bear is real, buying it a Christmas present or trying not to wake it in the mornings. The bear is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated ("Mr. Bean in Room 426"), used as his paint brush ("Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean"), and shrunk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wash</b> ("Tee Off, Mr. Bean").

40|$|<b>The</b> dirty <b>washing</b> {{water can}} {{contaminate}} the utensil and spoil {{the quality of}} the food and causing food borne diseases. The Regulation of Ministry of Health no. 1908 year of 2003 mentions that <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> water used to wash utensils should not contain germ counted > 100 colonies/ml and it should not contain E. coli. This study aimed to determine the factors related to the number of colonies of bacteria and E. coli <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> water for utensil of food vendors at Tembalang. The study was observational, with cross sectional study design. Study subjects were 46 food vendors. There was a significant relation between <b>the</b> handling of <b>washing</b> dishes (p= 0. 022) with the presence of E. coli <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> water of utensil. There was no significant relation between the physical condition of the source of water (p= 1. 000), <b>the</b> handling of <b>washing</b> dishes (p= 0. 543), personal hygiene condition handlers (p= 1. 000), and <b>the</b> type of <b>washing</b> water used to clean the utensil (p= 1. 000) with the number of colonies of bacteria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> water.
