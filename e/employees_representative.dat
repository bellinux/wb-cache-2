40|$|This study {{analyzed}} incremental {{effects of}} single Dark Triad traits (i. e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism) on objective (i. e., salary and leadership position) and subjective (i. e., career satisfaction) career success. We analyzed 793 early career <b>employees</b> <b>representative</b> {{of age and}} education from the private industry sector in Germany. Results from multiple and logistic regressions revealed bright and dark sides of the Dark Triad, depending on the specific Dark Triad trait analyzed. After controlling for other relevant variables (i. e., gender, age, job tenure, organization size, education, and work hours), narcissism {{was positively related to}} salary, Machiavellianism was positively related to leadership position and career satisfaction, and psychopathy was negatively related to all analyzed outcomes. These results provide evidence that the Dark Triad plays a role in explaining important career outcomes. Implications for personality and career research are derived...|$|E

40|$|This article {{builds a}} {{comprehensive}} behavioural framework {{of cooperation between}} management and <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> in a works council setting. The authors do so by applying insights from organizational behaviour in the works council setting {{in the belief that}} this discipline’s long-standing research tradition on (work) group processes and outcomes may provide the necessary theoretical building blocks to unravel cooperation among managers and <b>employee</b> <b>representatives.</b> The authors’ framework suggests that cooperation is a complex phenomenon that is largely driven by the extent of ideological and educational differences between management and <b>employee</b> <b>representatives,</b> procedural justice and perceived organizational support. A series of case studies of Belgian works councils provide illustrations of this framework. The overall contribution of this article is a grounded and testable behavioural framework of how cooperation can develop between management and <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> in a works council context...|$|R
40|$|This inaugural {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the question of how <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> in German supervisory boards influence the remuneration of executives. This question is addressed in three articles. The first article proposes an index that captures the structural power resources of <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> at the supervisory board level to investigate this question. It condenses information regarding the legal co-determination status of a company and the positions occupied by <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> within the company. The resulting index has been applied to the 100 largest German companies in 2008. The second article examines hypotheses concerning the influence of co-determination on the coupling between executive compensation and the company's performance. For this purpose, reference is made to historical institutionalism as well as to principal-agent theory. The hypotheses are tested with the aid of the index developed in the first article and a balanced time series data set that covers 80 listed companies from 2007 to 2012. The analysis reveals that the structural power of <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> moderates the relationship between executive remuneration and return-on-assets, but not the relationship between management board remuneration and price-to-book ratio. Companies in which <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> have high structural power resources show a stronger relationship between executive remuneration and corporate performance compared to companies in which <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> have only limited structural power resources. In addition, building on ideas of coalitions within companies, hypotheses are tested on the question whether different power configurations between workers and a major shareholder influence the degree of coupling between company performance and executive remuneration. These hypotheses are supported by the analysed data. Finally, utilizing qualitative interviews, the third article analyses the preferences of <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> with regard to the design of executive compensation. The research further studies how they are involved in decisions that affect executive remuneration. The analysed interviews shows that the involvement of <b>employee</b> <b>representatives</b> in decisions affecting executive remunerations increases with increasing individual and structural power resources...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{contours}} of fairness by showing how different facets of fairness impact three important employee outcomes (job satisfaction, turnover intention and employer advocacy) and examining the mediating role of quality of management and leadership (through perceptions of both senior management and the quality of exchange with immediate supervisors) in attenuating negative impacts of unfairness on these outcomes. The study extends the concept of fairness beyond the traditional focus on organizational justice and models the mediating role of leadership on the relationship between (un) fairness and the three employee-level outcomes in a sample of <b>employees</b> <b>representative</b> of the UK workforce. Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 2, 067 employees in the UK. Exploratory factor analysis and then confirmatory factor analysis is used to refine three unfairness factors and address their dimensionality of the unfairness scale and then multiple regression analysis is used to test a fairness-leadership-employee performance outcome model. Findings – Results of multiple regression analysis revealed that both trust in leadership and leader-member exchange partially mediate the relationship between organizational (un) fairness and job satisfaction, advocacy and turnover intention, respectively. Practical implications – The findings highlight the important role that leaders play in influencing the relationship between perception of unfairness and employee outcomes. This has implications for both theory and practice as it suggests that the pattern of inclusion that leaders create through the relationships that they develop with their followers has a significant impact on the relationship between unfairness and the work outcomes. They not only must manage traditional perceptions of justice, but also the assessments employees make about trust in management judgements and the perceived consequences of such judgements. Originality/value – In an environment where perceptions of unfairness are becoming both more endemic but also more complex, the study shows that both senior leaders and immediate supervisors have important agency in managing negative consequences. Through the measurement of satisfaction, turnover intention and employer advocacy it also provides potential links to link fairness into the engagement literature...|$|E
