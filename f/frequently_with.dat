5|$|Although {{the name}} Strauss {{can be found}} in {{reference}} books <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> “ß,” Strauss himself wrote his name with a long s and a round s (Strauſs), which was a replacement form for the Fraktur-ß used in antique manuscripts. His family called him “Schani,” derived from the Italian “Gianni,” a nickname.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Bauer used Ellqvist {{as a model}} less <b>frequently.</b> <b>With</b> {{the birth}} of their son, Bauer started to paint {{pictures}} with children as part of the composition. The painting Rottrollen (The Root Trolls), completed in 1917, is of Putte sleeping among troll-shaped roots in a forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} Machiko Kyō's second {{collaboration}} with Mizoguchi, {{as she had}} a small role in his 1944 film The Three Danjuros. She had collaborated much more <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> Masayuki Mori. As Lady Wakasa, Kyō's costume was modeled after fashion before the Edo period {{and her face was}} designed to appear similar to a mask common in Noh theatre.|$|E
40|$|When a stimulus–response {{event is}} <b>frequently</b> paired <b>with</b> a {{specific}} foreperiod, response performance {{for this event}} is improved after this foreperiod. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} specific temporal expectancy. In four experiments, we investigated whether stimulus- or response-related processing benefits from specific temporal expectancy. In a speeded choice reaction task, different features of the imperative stimuli were <b>frequently</b> paired <b>with</b> foreperiods {{in such a way that}} only in some experiments were the responses also <b>frequently</b> paired <b>with</b> foreperiods. Participants revealed evidence for specific temporal expectancy when responses were <b>frequently</b> paired <b>with</b> foreperiods, but not when only the stimuli were <b>frequently</b> paired <b>with</b> foreperiods. We concluded that specific temporal expectancy affects response-related processing...|$|R

5|$|After John succeeded Richard in 1199, {{he decided}} to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but {{continued}} to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and {{for a short time}} peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed <b>frequently,</b> <b>with</b> few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic {{to the fact that}} his wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald {{permission}} to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque era was {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> marble used for tabletops. The {{furniture}} was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more <b>frequently,</b> <b>with</b> the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered {{a job as a}} Law Lord. After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During his time in the House of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During his time in the House of Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy his time in the House of Lords and clashed <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard in the House of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E

5|$|Lancashire {{appointed}} MacLaren {{as coach}} for the 1922 season, to popular acclaim; he also captained the Lancashire second team. Even before he began work, his poor financial situation forced him to request two advances on his salary. As a coach, MacLaren was autocratic and demanding, but encouraged the players to think for themselves. He was unpopular with some players and clashed <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> the Lancashire committee. During the winter of 1922–23, the MCC organised two cricket tours—a Test playing tour to South Africa and a tour to Australia and New Zealand intended to give experience to young, promising cricketers. MacLaren was chosen to captain the latter team {{on account of his}} experience and his success with young cricketers during his win over the Australians in 1921. He was given a good reception by the crowds when he played and press reports praised his tactical awareness. The team was undefeated in matches in New Zealand. Against the full New Zealand team, MacLaren scored 200 not out in 264 minutes in his final first-class innings; the effort placed a strain on his knee and he was unable to play again on the tour. He ended his first-class career with 22,236 runs at an average of 34.15.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the band}} members grew up together: Dama, Dadah and Bekoto were playmates and {{attended}} the same primary school; during their secondary school studies, Dadah's older brother Nono likewise became {{a close friend of}} Raoul, the older brother of Dama. The high school offered a music program in which Dadah, Nono, Charle, Bekoto and Fafa participated together, with Fafa as a vocalist and Bekoto as a pianist. Beginning in 1970, Raoul became enamored with the acoustic guitar. He met <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> Dadah and Nono to play together using guitars he constructed from wood and bicycle brake cables available at a workshop attached to a center for the deaf and blind where his father worked; the trio began performing at school parties and events. As teens, the trio often listened to a radio show hosted by popular Malagasy journalist and ethnomusicologist Latimer Rangers, who recorded, broadcast and promoted contemporary and traditional music from villages across Madagascar. Rangers also broadcast foreign artists who were relatively unknown to the Malagasy public, such as Bob Dylan, described the meaning and history of the protest song and other foreign genres, and drew connections between Malagasy musical styles and American Blues music, South African music and other genres.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the album}} had been {{composed}} and committed to demo form before the band arrived at Rundgren's studio, but the producer felt that the first crop was insufficient. He expected a full working album worth of songs to be ready, whereas the Furs believed that their creative process had always flourished best inside a studio. He postponed recording while the Furs made additional demos. British keyboardist and future music producer Ed Buller helped to create many of the demos made before the band returned. Although never an official member of the Furs, Buller supplied much-needed musical accompaniment at this stage, and {{would go on to}} collaborate <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> the band over the next six years. When the second batch arrived, Rundgren made major revisions and even dropped some tracks entirely. By necessity then, some songs were revised or fully composed in the studio.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} found singly, scattered, or {{clustered}} together in broad-leaf woods favoring beech, less <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> conifers. A preference for calcareous soils has been noted, {{but they will}} also grow on acidic bedrock. Because their initial development is subterranean, young fruit bodies are easy to overlook, as they as usually covered with dirt or forest duff. They are more common in mountainous locations, and occur most frequently in the spring, often near melting snow. The fungus is distributed in 23 European countries, North Africa, and North America, from British Columbia eastward to Michigan and New York, south to Veracruz, Mexico. It has also been collected from Israel and the Asian part of Turkey. In Europe, the fungus is red-listed in 14 countries, and is considered a threatened species by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. It is short-listed {{for inclusion in the}} Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. Threats to the species include loss and degradation of habitats due to clearcutting and soil disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Waldron {{went on to}} {{work with}} Ike Quebec in New York in 1950 and made his {{recording}} debut with the saxophonist in 1952. They played at Café Society Downtown on Mondays for six or seven months, which helped Waldron gain exposure and more work. Waldron worked <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> Charles Mingus from 1954 to 1956, {{as part of the}} latter's jazz composers' workshop. He was pianist on several Mingus recordings, including Pithecanthropus Erectus, which was a key development in the movement towards freer collective improvisation in jazz. In 1955, Waldron worked with Lucky Millinder and Lucky Thompson. Waldron formed his own band in 1956, which consisted of Idrees Sulieman (trumpet), Gigi Gryce (alto saxophone), Julian Euell (bass), and Arthur Edgehill (drums). This band recorded Waldron's first release as a leader, Mal-1, in November of that year. Waldron was Billie Holiday's regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959, including for the all-star television broadcast The Sound of Jazz.|$|E
5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke <b>frequently</b> <b>with</b> both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E
