40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} enterolignans, e. g., {{enterodiol}} (END) and particularly its oxidation product, enterolactone (ENL), on prevention of hormone-dependent diseases, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, hyperlipemia, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and menopausal syndrome, have attracted much attention. To date, the main way to obtain END and ENL is chemical synthesis, which is expensive and inevitably leads to environmental pollution. To explore a more economic and eco-friendly production method, we explored biotransformation of enterolignans from precursors contained in defatted <b>flaxseeds</b> by human intestinal bacteria. Results We cultured fecal specimens from healthy young adults in media containing defatted <b>flaxseeds</b> and detected END from the culture supernatant. Following selection through successive subcultures of the fecal microbiota with defatted <b>flaxseeds</b> {{as the only}} carbon source, we obtained a bacterial consortium, designated as END- 49, which contained the smallest number of bacterial types still capable of metabolizing defatted <b>flaxseeds</b> to produce END. Based on analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis, END- 49 was found to consist of five genomically distinct bacterial lineages, designated Group I-V, with Group I strains dominating the culture. None of the individual Group I-V strains produced END, demonstrating that the biotransformation of substrates in defatted <b>flaxseeds</b> into END is a joint work by different members of the END- 49 bacterial consortium. Interestingly, Group I strains produced secoisolariciresinol, an important intermediate of END production; 16 S rRNA analysis of one Group I strain established its close relatedness with Klebsiella. Genomic analysis is under way to identify all members in END- 49 involved in the biotransformation and the actual pathway leading to END-production. Conclusion Biotransformation is a very economic, efficient and environmentally friendly way of mass-producing enterodiol from defatted <b>flaxseeds.</b> </p...|$|R

Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trials the sample population was 60 women with hot flush who referred to urbon heath centers. They divided into two groups. For the first group 6 g fenugreek and for the other group 25 g <b>flaxseeds</b> were prescribed for four continuous weeks. The inclusion criteria were on menses in lately 12 months, normal blood pressure, no use of antidepressants and estrogen and progesterone hormones in lately 6 weeks, no anticoagulant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like brufen, no asthma and allergy. The exclusion criteria were no correct use of herbals, allergy to drugs, and change the life place. The severity and frequency of hot flush were examined in fourth and eighth weeks. Results: The severity of hot flush in flax group was (1. 163, 1. 614) 1. 389 and in fenugreek group it was (1. 541, 1. 992) 1. 767 in eighth week.

The United States Attorney's Office in San Francisco brought evidence before another grand jury to determine if Bonds should be indicted. Before testifying to the original grand jury (in 2003), witnesses including Bonds were told that they could not be charged with any crime other than perjury based on their testimony.

50|$|The diet {{of laying}} hens {{can affect the}} {{nutritional}} quality of eggs. For instance, chicken eggs that are especially high in omega-3 fatty acids are produced by feeding hens a diet containing polyunsaturated fats from sources like fish oil, chia seeds or <b>flaxseeds.</b> Pasture-raised free-range hens, which forage for their own food, also produce eggs that are relatively enriched in omega-3 fatty acids compared to cage-raised chickens.|$|R

Purslane contains more Omega 3 {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Flaxseeds</b> {{have been}} {{recently}} in focus {{due to the}} antioxidant capacity {{of some of their}} compounds. However, {{there is a lack of}} easily accessible information concerning their activity against lipid oxidation in food systems. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of defatted meals (DFM) and the aqueous extracts (AFE) obtained from brown and golden <b>flaxseeds</b> on lipid oxidation in pork meatballs. Fatty acid composi-tion, peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and cholesterol content were moni-tored during 6 months of freezer storage. Cholesterol oxi-dation products were identified and quantified. Both DFM and AFE limited fatty acid and cholesterol oxidation during meatball storage. Their antioxidant effect depended on flax variety (brown or golden) and preparation type (DFM or AFE). Lower level of PV and TBARS, compared with the ones with AFE, were noted in meatballs with DFM. Both DFM and AFE, from the brown seed variety, protect the lipids against oxidation to a higher extent. During the storage, a cholesterol degradation was observed. AFE (particularly from the brown variety) limited changes in cholesterol content. Moreover, they stabilized fatty acid composition of stored meatballs.

In the last years, {{several studies have}} reported the importance of consumption nuts and oilseeds to promote health benefits, especially those related with cardiovascular diseases. This is due to its high content of fat, which is mainly composed of unsaturated fatty acids. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to compare the total fat content and fatty acids profile of seven types of nuts and five types of oilseeds. Thereby, samples were randomly collected at supermarkets and herbal shops from Lisbon region, and three composite samples were prepared, in order to provide accurate data that covers all the possible variations among samples. For the lipid profile of oilseeds and nuts, either accredited methods or methods for which the laboratory has shown a successful participation in Proficiency testing schemes were used. Total fat determination was performed with an acid hydrolysis method followed by extraction using a Soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether, as the extraction solvent (AOAC 948. 15, 2000). Preparation of FA methyl esters was carried out by a combined method of methylation and transesterification. Chromatographic analysis was performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrophotometer detector. A HP- 88, fused silica capillary column (100 m x 0. 25 mm i. d., 0. 25 mm) was used for FA determination. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. The applied GC-MS method allows separation and identification of more than fifty FA, including some trans-FA and ω 3 or ω 6 FA. Total fat content ranged between 39. 8 ± 1. 15 and 66. 6 ± 0. 11 g/ 100 g of edible portion, for brown <b>flaxseeds</b> and Brazil chestnuts, respectively. Linoleic acid was the major fatty acid found in sunflower seeds and walnuts. Sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, roasted peanuts and salted peanuts have similar quantities of oleic and linoleic acid. For brown and golden <b>flaxseeds,</b> the major fatty acid was linolenic acid (18. 3 ± 1. 99 and 21. 8 ± 1. 03 g/ 100 g of edible portion, respectively). Cashew, peeled almonds and salted pistachio have similar fatty acids profile with oleic acid being the major fatty acid. Nuts and oilseeds are rich sources of fat, specially unsaturated fatty acids which are related with several health benefits, namely cardiovascular diseases. In Portugal, circulatory system diseases still remain the leading cause of death. Therefore, increasing the consumption of nuts and oilseeds in Portugal is extremely required.
