40|$|Abstract. Objectives The aim is {{to compare}} the {{efficiency}} of using the Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics {{to solve the problem}} of determining the category <b>of</b> potential text <b>recipients.</b> The relevance <b>of</b> the task is determined by the need to develop a means <b>of</b> <b>identifying</b> the <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> electronic documents. This has been complicated with the introduction of age restrictions on the content of Internet webpages and text resources. Moreover, there has been little coverage of this issue in the works of Russian researchers. Method A comparison of the relative efficiencies of using Euclid and Mahalanobis distances was carried out within the framework of the implementation of an intelligent system for text automatic classification based on the age category <b>of</b> their <b>recipients.</b> Results The main approaches to establishing proximity measures of objects represented as sets of classification characteristics are discussed and the choice of Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics for numerical comparison of classification results is justified. A description of the sample texts and characteristics of category designations are given for a computational experiment. The computational experiment was carried out using texts included in the National Corpus of the Russian language. Conclusion The computational experiment allows the most effective method for solving the problem of determining the age category <b>of</b> potential text <b>recipients</b> to be selected.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of interpersonal gift giving have uncovered feelings of anx-iety among gift givers. The anxious moments that givers often experience stand {{in stark contrast}} to the festive atmospheres and joyous celebrations that surround many gift occasions. Why is gift-giving such a torturous endeavor for so many people? What conditions coincide with the anxious moments that givers often experience? What factors drive this anxiety? These questions are explored in this article, which develops a model based on a self-presentational theory and two sets of qualitative data. The results show that givers become anxious when they are highly motivated to elicit desired reactions from their recipients but are pessimistic about their prospects of success. This article <b>identifies</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>recipients,</b> givers, and gift situations that appear to precipitate these anxious moments. Anxiety in gift-giving is so prevalent that a recentpopular press article asked, “Why must a ritual that we believe should be relaxed and joyful be so tortured?” (Vreeland 1998, p. 39).

40|$|The {{advanced}} age deceased kidney donor: Current outcomes and future opportunities. BackgroundDue to the aging general population, deceased donors ≥ 55 years will form an increasingly {{larger proportion of}} the deceased kidney donor pool. MethodsUsing data from the United States Renal Data System, we determined the change in graft survival between 1996 and 2000 among 32, 557 <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> donors aged 24 hours <b>identified</b> <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> donors ≥ 55 years at risk for graft loss. Compared to <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> donors < 55 years, <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> donors ≥ 55 years established a lower initial GFR (42 vs. 56 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, P < 0. 0001), and had less stable GFR in the first post-transplant year (- 1. 5 vs. - 0. 6 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, P <. 0001). Recipients from donors ≥ 55 years with initial GFR ≥ 50 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 and no drop GFR during the first post-transplant year had graft survival that was superior to that of donors < 55 years with either initial GFR < 50 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 or a drop in GFR during the first post-transplant year. ConclusionDonors ≥ 55 years are a valuable resource. Despite improvements in immunosuppression, rejection, and delayed graft function, the projected increase in long-term graft survival among <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> donors < 55 years was not shared among <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> donors ≥ 55 years. <b>Recipients</b> <b>of</b> donors ≥ 55 years had lower initial GFR, and less stable GFR during the first post-transplant year.

40|$|Lifelong {{immunosuppression}} increases {{morbidity and}} mortality in liver transplantation. Discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs could lessen this burden, but the safety, applicability and clinical outcomes of this strategy need to be carefully defined. We enrolled 102 stable liver recipients at least 3 years after transplantation in a single-arm multi-center immunosuppression withdrawal trial. Drugs were gradually discontinued over a 6 - 9 month period. The primary end-point was the development of operational tolerance, defined as successful immunosuppressive drug cessation maintained for at least 12 months with stable graft function and no histopathologic evidences of rejection. Out <b>of</b> the 98 <b>recipients</b> evaluated, 57 rejected and 41 successfully discontinued all immunosuppressive drugs. In non-tolerant recipients rejection episodes were mild and resolved over 5. 6 months (2 non-tolerant patients still exhibited mild gradually improving cholestasis {{at the end of}} follow-up). In tolerant recipients no progressive clinically-significant histological damage was apparent in follow-up protocol biopsies performed up to 3 years following drug withdrawal. Tolerance was independently associated with time since transplantation (OR 1. 353; p = 0. 0001), recipient age (OR 1. 073; p = 0. 009), and male gender (OR 4. 657; p = 0. 016). A predictive model incorporating the two first clinical variables <b>identified</b> subgroups <b>of</b> <b>recipients</b> with very high (79 %), intermediate (30 - 38 %), and very low (0 %) likelihood of successful withdrawal. Conclusion: When conducted at late time points after transplantation, immunosuppression withdrawal is successful in a high proportion of carefully selected liver <b>recipients.</b> A combination <b>of</b> clinical parameters could be useful to predict the success of this strategy. Additional prospective studies are now needed to confirm these results and to validate clinically-applicable diagnostic biomarkers. (HEPATOLOGY 2013.). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The use {{of small}} {{pediatric}} kidneys obtained from very young donors after cardiac death (DCD) {{has been limited}} and this remains an underutilized organ source. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all renal transplants at our institution from 2000 to 2013 to <b>identify</b> <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> an en-bloc pair of kidneys from pediatric donors less than 4 years of age. The outcomes of DCD en-bloc allografts were compared with neurologic determination of death (NDD) en-bloc allografts. RESULTS: 21 <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> en bloc renal allografts were <b>identified</b> <b>of</b> which 4 organ pairs were obtained through DCD. The mean donor age was 20. 6 ± 11. 6 months and mean donor weight was 12. 4 ± 3. 7 kg. Delayed graft function (DGF) occurred in 2 / 4 DCD and 3 / 17 NDD en bloc recipients. At one year post-transplantation, mean glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were similar at 80. 7 ± 15. 3 versus 85. 7 ± 33. 4 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 in the DCD and NDD groups respectively (p = NS). Surgical complications occurred in three patients; no grafts were lost to thrombosis.

40|$|The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) {{system has}} {{dramatically}} {{increased the number}} <b>of</b> <b>recipients</b> requiring pretransplant renal replacement therapy (RRT) prior to liver transplantation (LT). Factors affecting post-LT outcomes {{and the need for}} intraoperative RRT (IORRT) were analyzed in 500 consecutive recipients receiving pretransplant RRT, including comparisons among recipients not receiving IORRT (No-IORRT, n-=- 401), receiving planned IORRT (Pl-IORRT, n-=- 70), and receiving emergent, unplanned RRT after LT initiation (Em-IORRT, n-=- 29). Despite a median MELD of 39, overall 30 -day, 1 -, 3 - and 5 -year survivals were 93 %, 75 %, 68 % and 65 %, respectively. Em-IORRT recipients had significantly more intraoperative complications (arrhythmias, postreperfusion syndrome, coagulopathy) compared with both No-IORRT and Pl-IORRT and greater 30 -day graft loss (28 % vs. 10 %, p-=- 0. 004) and need for retransplantation (24 % vs. 10 %, p-=- 0. 099) compared with No-IORRT. A risk score based on multivariate predictors <b>of</b> IORRT accurately <b>identified</b> <b>recipients</b> with chronic (sensitivity 84 %, specificity 72 %, concordance-statistic [c-statistic] 0. 829) and acute (sensitivity 93 %, specificity 61 %, c-statistic 0. 776) liver failure requiring IORRT. In this largest experience <b>of</b> LT in <b>recipients</b> receiving RRT, we report excellent survival and propose a practical model that accurately identifies recipients who may benefit from IORRT.
