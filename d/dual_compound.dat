However, studies suggest that culture often fails to detect biofilm bacteria. This study optimises X-ray micro computed tomography (X-ray µCT) for the quantification and determination of distribution and heterogeneity of biofilms in in vitro central venous catheter (CVC) model systems. Bacterial culture and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to detect Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984 biofilms grown on catheters in vitro in both flow and static biofilm models. Alongside this, X-ray µCT techniques were developed in order to detect biofilms inside CVCs. Various contrast agent stains were evaluated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to further optimise these methods. Catheter material and biofilm were segmented using a semi-automated MATLAB script and quantified using the Avizo Fire software package. X-ray µCT was capable of distinguishing between the degree of biofilm formation across different segments of a CVC flow model. EDS screening of single and <b>dual</b> <b>compound</b> contrast stains identified 10 nm gold and silver nitrate as the optimum contrast agent for X-ray µCT. This optimised method was then demonstrated {{to be capable of}} quantifying biofilms in an in vitro static biofilm formation model, with a strong correlation between biofilm detection via SEM and culture.

Formation water originating from a 760 meter-deep geological gas storage aquifer was sampled and microcosms were set up to test the biodegradation potential of BTEX by indigenous microorganisms. After a long incubation period, with several subcultures, a sulfate-reducing consortium composed of only two Desulfotomaculum populations was observed able to degrade benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene, extending the number of hydrocarbonoclastic–related species among the Desulfotomaculum genus. Furthermore, we were able to couple specific carbon and hydrogen isotopic fractionation during benzene removal and the results obtained by <b>dual</b> <b>compound</b> specific isotope analysis (εC = - 2. 4 ‰ ± 0. 3 ‰; εH = - 57 ‰ ± 0. 98 ‰; AKIEC: 1. 0146 ± 0. 0009 and AKIEH: 1. 5184 ± 0. 0283) were close to those obtained previously in sulfate-reducing conditions: this finding could confirm the existence of a common enzymatic reaction involving sulfate-reducers to activate benzene anaerobically. Although we cannot assign the role of each population of Desulfotomaculum in the mono-aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, this study suggests an important role of the genus Desulfotomaculum as potential biodegrader among indigenous populations in subsurface habitats. This community represents the simplest model of benzene-degrading anaerobes originating from the deepest subterranean settings ever described. As Desulfotomaculum species are often encountered in subsurface environments, this study provides some interesting results for assessing the natural response of these specific hydrologic systems in response to BTEX contamination during remediation projects...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, in {{the context}} of ruin theory, most judgements are made on an {{immediate}} sense. An example would be the determination of ruin, in which a business is declared broke right away when it attains a negative surplus. Another example would be the decision on dividend payment, in which a business pays dividends whenever the surplus level overshoots certain threshold. Such scheme of decision making is generally being criticized as unrealistic from a practical point of view. The Parisian concept is therefore invoked to handle this issue. This idea is deemed more realistic since it allows certain delay in the execution of decisions. In this thesis, such Parisian concept is utilized on two different aspects. The first one is to incorporate this concept on defining ruin, leading to the introduction of Parisian ruin time. Under such a setting, a business is considered ruined only when the surplus level stays negative continuously for a prescribed length of time. The case for a fixed delay is considered. Both the renewal risk model and the dual renewal risk model are studied. Under a mild distributional assumption that either the inter arrival time or the claim size is exponentially distributed (while keeping the other arbitrary), the Laplace transform to the Parisian ruin time is derived. Numerical example is performed to confirm the reasonableness of the results. The methodology in obtaining the Laplace transform to the Parisian ruin time is also demonstrated to be useful in deriving the joint distribution to the number of negative surplus causing or without causing Parisian ruin. The second contribution is to incorporate this concept on the decision for dividend payment. Specifically, a business only pays lump-sum dividends when the surplus level stays above certain threshold continuously for a prescribed length of time. The case for a fixed and an Erlang(n) delay are considered. The <b>dual</b> <b>compound</b> Poisson risk model is studied. Laplace transform to the ordinary ruin time is derived.

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{abdominal surgery}} (laparoscopy) {{is performed using}} long, slender instruments inserted through multiple small incisions in the patient's abdominal wall. This results in less post [...] operative pain, shorter hospital stays, and a quicker return to normal activities for the patient compared to conventional open surgery; however, the use of small entry incisions provides only limited access to the surgical site compared to conventional open surgery. Robotic systems have been developed that overcome some limitations with laparoscopic surgery. The systems, however, are very high cost, provide limited benefit to the patient, and do not completely address limited access issues {{and the need for}} multiple incisions. New techniques, such as single [...] port laparoscopic and natural orifice surgery, reduce the number of entry incisions but still provide only limited access to the surgical site. An innovative solution that potentially overcomes both limitations is to insert miniature robotic assistants entirely inside the abdominal cavity through a single incision where they can be readily relocated as needed. Previous work has demonstrated that a family of fixed [...] base and modular, wireless, intracorporeal, mobile robots can successfully monitor physiological conditions, perform biopsies, staple and clamp tissue, and provide visual feedback within the abdominal cavity. Current robots do not have the ability to store or dispense liquids such as hemostatic agents. The use of hemostatic agents, such as fibrin sealants, instead of mechanical or electrical means of hemostasis alleviates the extensive training required for laparoscopic suturing, the nerve damage accompanying staples or tacks, and the need for a relatively large energy source for electrocautery tools and harmonic scalpels. An incorporeal robot capable of carrying and delivering liquids would combine the advantages of incorporeal mobile robots and liquid hemostatic agents. The main focus of this thesis is the development of a liquid delivery payload for a family of incorporeal robotic assistants. Included in this development is a method for mixing two liquids stored inside the robot as they are dispensed, which is needed for <b>dual</b> <b>compound</b> liquids such as fibrin sealants. Finally, two improvements to the design of the control electronics are presented that allow for more rapid robot deployment and provide the ability for point of use changes to the embedded control software...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the discounted penalty function by Gerber and Shiu (1998), significant progress has been made on the analysis of various ruin-related quantities in risk theory. As we know, the discounted penalty function not only provides a systematic platform to jointly analyze various quantities of interest, but also offers the convenience to extract key pieces of information from a risk management perspective. For example, by eliminating the penalty function, the Gerber-Shiu function becomes the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the time to ruin, inversion of which results in a series expansion for the associated density of the time to ruin (see, e. g., Dickson and Willmot (2005)). In this thesis, we propose to analyze the long-standing finite-time ruin problem by incorporating the number of claims until ruin into the Gerber-Shiu analysis. As will be seen in Chapter 2, many nice analytic properties of the original Gerber-Shiu function are preserved by this generalized analytic tool. For instance, the Gerber-Shiu function still satisfies a defective renewal equation and can be generally expressed in terms of some roots of Lundberg's generalized equation in the Sparre Andersen risk model. In this thesis, we propose not only to unify previous methodologies on the study of the density of the time to ruin through the use of Lagrange's expansion theorem, but also to provide insight into the nature of the series expansion by identifying the probabilistic contribution of each term in the expansion through analysis involving the distribution of the number of claims until ruin. In Chapter 3, we study the joint generalized density of the time to ruin and the number of claims until ruin in the classical compound Poisson risk model. We also utilize an alternative approach to obtain the density of the time to ruin based on the Lagrange inversion technique introduced by Dickson and Willmot (2005). In Chapter 4, relying on the Lagrange expansion theorem for analytic inversion, the joint density of the time to ruin, the surplus immediately before ruin and the number of claims until ruin is examined in the Sparre Andersen risk model with exponential claim sizes and arbitrary interclaim times. To our knowledge, existing results on the finite-time ruin problem in the Sparre Andersen risk model typically involve an exponential assumption on either the interclaim times or the claim sizes (see, e. g., Borovkov and Dickson (2008)). Among the few exceptions, we mention Dickson and Li (2010, 2012) who analyzed the density of the time to ruin for Erlang-n interclaim times. In Chapter 5, we propose a significant breakthrough by utilizing the multivariate version of Lagrange's expansion theorem to obtain a series expansion for the density of the time to ruin under a more general distribution assumption, namely when interclaim times are distributed as a combination of n exponentials. It is worth emphasizing that this technique can also be applied to other areas of applied probability. For instance, the proposed methodology can be used to obtain the distribution of some first passage times for particular stochastic processes. As an illustration, the duration of a busy period in a queueing risk model will be examined. Interestingly, the proposed technique {{can also be used to}} analyze some first passage times for the compound Poisson processes with diffusion. In Chapter 6, we propose an extension to Kendall's identity (see, e. g., Kendall (1957)) by further examining the distribution of the number of jumps before the first passage time. We show that the main result is particularly relevant to enhance our understanding of some problems of interest, such as the finite-time ruin probability of a <b>dual</b> <b>compound</b> Poisson risk model with diffusion and pricing barrier options issued on an insurer's stock price. Another closely related quantity of interest is the so-called occupation times of the surplus process below zero (also referred to as the duration of negative surplus, see, e. g., Egidio dos Reis (1993)) or in a certain interval (see, e. g., Kolkovska et al. (2005)). Occupation times have been widely used as a contingent characteristic to develop advanced derivatives in financial mathematics. In risk theory, it can be used as an important risk management tool to examine the overall health of an insurer's business. The main subject matter of Chapter 7 is to extend the analysis of occupation times to a class of renewal risk processes. We provide explicit expressions for the duration of negative surplus and the double-barrier occupation time in terms of their Laplace-Stieltjes transform. In the process, we revisit occupation times in the content of the classical compound Poisson risk model and examine some results proposed by Kolkovska et al. (2005). Finally, some concluding remarks and discussion of future research are made in Chapter 8...|$|E

My PhD work was focused on the design, characterisation and pharmacological evaluation of two main classes of cardiovascular new “hybrid-drug”: the nitrooxy-derivatives of anti-hypertensive drugs such as sartans and the nitrooxy-derivatives of a hypoglycaemic drug such as glibenclamide.
