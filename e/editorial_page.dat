5|$|Authentic Science Fiction was a British {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} {{published in the}} 1950s that ran for 85 issues under three editors: Gordon Landsborough, H.J. Campbell, and E.C. Tubb. The magazine was published by Hamilton and Co., and began in 1951 {{as a series of}} novels appearing every two weeks; by the summer it became a monthly magazine, with readers' letters and an <b>editorial</b> <b>page,</b> though fiction content was still restricted to a single novel. In 1952 short fiction began to appear alongside the novels, and within two more years it completed the transformation into a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|Under Knight Ridder, The Inquirer {{continued}} to be editorially independent. However, conservative commentators have labeled The Inquirer left leaning, and the paper has not endorsed a Republican candidate for President of the United States since Gerald Ford in 1976. Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of Israel such as the Zionist Organization of America often accused The Inquirer of being anti-Israel. At the same time, Edward S. Herman, a University of Pennsylvania media analyst, has written many articles accusing The Inquirer of having given in to conservative pressure and including a conservative slant in the paper's reporting and <b>editorial</b> <b>page.</b> In 2006, The Inquirer {{became one of the}} only major United States newspapers to print one of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Afterwards, protesting the printing of the cartoon, Muslims picketed outside The Inquirer Building.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} was to examine whether 10 Swedish {{newspapers}} <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> and their leader writers changed their view on Mikhail Gorbachev before, {{during and after the}} August Coup in 1991. Moreover, the aim was also to see if the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> used the same sources when they wrote about Gorbachev. In this essay four main questions were asked: - How is Gorbachev described before the August Coup? - How is Gorbachev described during the August Coup? - How is Gorbachev described after the August Coup? - What sources did the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> use when they wrote about Gorbachev? Ten newspapers and their <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> from the period of 1 - 31 August and 1 - 6 September, as well as 10 - 31 December 1991 and 1 January 1992 were examined. It was discovered that most of the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> changed their view from being negative in August to being more positive in December. As a conclusion it can be stated that the examined <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> did not write much about Gorbachev in the beginning of August and if they did mention him it was in a negative tone. One {{of the reasons for the}} lack of mentioning during the August Coup could be that the leader writers were not sure whether Gorbachev would return back to power. In December the views about Gorbachev were mostly positive, which could be related to the fact that the Soviet Union was about to become dissolved. Regarding the sources some of the newspapers referred to the same sources without giving clear information about where the source came from. A majority of the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> referred to the meeting between Gorbachev and George Bush, as well as to Gorbachev’s meeting with the Supreme Soviet after the August Coup...|$|R

25|$|The Chattanooga Times Free Press, the area's only daily newspaper, is {{published}} every morning. It {{was formed in}} 1999 from the merger of two papers that had been bitter rivals for half a century, the Times and the News-Free Press. The Times was owned and published by Adolph Ochs, who later bought the New York Times. The Times was the morning paper and had a generally more liberal <b>editorial</b> <b>page.</b> The News-Free Press, whose name {{was the result of}} an earlier merger, was an afternoon daily and its editorials were more conservative than those in the Times. On August 27, 1966, the News-Free Press became the first newspaper in the nation to dissolve a joint operating agreement. In 1999, the Free Press, which had changed its name from News-Free Press in 1993, was bought by an Arkansas company, WEHCO Media, publisher of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which then bought The Times from the Ochs heirs. The Times Free Press is the only newspaper in the United States to have 2 editorial pages, each reflecting opposite ends of the political spectrum. The Times' <b>editorial</b> <b>page,</b> which is liberal, is on the left page and the Free Press' <b>editorial</b> <b>page,</b> which is conservative, is on the right page.|$|E
