All hormones that act by regulation of gene expression have two consequences in their mechanism of action; their effects are produced after a characteristically {{long period of time}} and their effects persist for another long period of time, even after their concentration has been reduced to zero, due to a relatively slow turnover of most enzymes and proteins that would either deactivate or terminate ligand binding onto the receptor.|$|E
50|$|For steroid or thyroid hormones, their receptors {{are located}} inside the cell within the {{cytoplasm}} {{of the target}} cell. These receptors belong to the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. To bind their receptors, these hormones must first cross the cell membrane.

The combined <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to specific DNA sequences, regulating the expression of certain genes, and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes.

40|$|The ffect of N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide on the {{glucocorticoid}} receptor activity {{extracted from}} the cytosol of either mouse of hamster cells has been investigated. Treatment of mouse or hamster cytosol with N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide rapidly inactivates the [3 H]glucocorticoid hormone binding activity of either cytosol. Prebinding the glucocorticoid hormone, dexamethasone, to the cytosol receptor blocks the rapid inactivation of the receptor by N-ethylmaleimide. Treatment of the prebound <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> with iodoacetamide prevents the subsequent binding of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> to DNA without causing a dissociation of the complex. Although the conclusions may be limited {{by the lack of}} purity of the receptor, the results suggest that a sulfhydryl group is involved in the binding of glucocorticoid hormones to the receptor protein. In addition, the results suggest that iodoacetamide is inactivating a separate chemical site which is necessary for the binding of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> to DNA...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Glucocorticoids {{decrease}} the plasminogen activator activity of rat hepatoma cells through production of an inhibitor. We {{have examined the}} dexamethasone regulation of plasminogen activator in anucleate rat hepatoma cells to investigate {{the role of the}} nucleus in the steroid regulation of this membrane-associated phenomenon. Dexamethasone did not affect either the intra- or extra-cellular plasminogen activator activity of the anucleate cells, and did not induce production of an inhibitor of plasminogen acti-vator. Therefore, glucocorticoid regulation of plasminogen activator activ-ity requires the presence of an intact nucleus. Glucocorticoids alter several membrane-associated properties in hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) 1 cells, an established line of rat hepatoma cells (1). Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, decreases both the intra- and extra-cellular activity of plasminogen activator (2, 3), a serine protease which catalyzes the conversion of the serum protein, plasminogen, to the active fibrinolysin, plasmin. Seifert and Gelehrter (4) have previously reported that the mechanism of dexamethasone-induced inhibition of plasmin-ogen activator (PA) activity appears to be the production of an inhibitor of PA. Steroid hormones are thought to induce cellular changes through tran-scriptional activation of specific genes after translocation of cytosol <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes</b> into the nucleus and site-specific binding of the complexes to the chromatin (5). However, steroid hormones or <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes</b> might also mediate cellular changes by directly affect-ing cytoplasmic or membrane functions. To investigate these alternative mechanisms for steroid hormone action, we examined the glucocorticoi...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we have {{described}} a novel qualitative defect in insulin receptors {{from a patient}} with a genetic form of extreme insulin resistance (leprechaunism). Receptors from this insulin-resistant child are characterized by two abnormalities: (a) an abnormally high binding affinity for insulin, and (b) a markedly reduced sensitivity of 125 I-insulin binding to alterations in pH and temperature. In this paper, we have investigated the kinetic mechanism of this abnormality in steady-state binding. The increased binding affinity for 125 I-insulin results from {{a decrease in the}} dissociation rate of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex.</b> In addition, the cooperative interactions among insulin binding sites are defective with insulin receptors from this child with leprechaunism. With insulin receptors on cultured lymphocytes from normal subjects, both negative and positive cooperativity may be observed. Porcine insulin accelerates the dissociation of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> (negative cooperativity). In contrast, certain insulin analogs such as desoctapeptide-insulin and desalanine-desasparagine-insulin retard the dissociation of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> (positive cooperativity). With insulin receptors from the leprechaun child, positive cooperativity could not be demonstrated, although negative cooperativity appeared to be normal. It seems likely that the same genetic defect may be responsible for the abnormalities in both insulin sensitivity and positive cooperativity...|$|E
40|$|The lateral {{mobility}} of the {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) receptor in {{the plane of the}} plasma membrane of cultured A 431 cells was investigated using direct and indirect fluorescent probes to measure the generation and relaxation of electric field-induced receptor asymmetry. A steady electric field of 15 V/cm for 30 min at 23 degrees C induced a redistribution of the unoccupied EGF receptor such that there was approximately a three-fold higher concentration of receptors at the cathode-facing pole. After termination of the field, the unoccupied receptors back diffused at 37 degrees C with a rate corresponding to a diffusion coefficient of 2. 6 - 3. 5 X 10 (- 10) cm 2 /s. No diffusion was detected at 4 degrees C. Formation of the hormone- receptor complex is known to induce receptor clustering and internalization. By inhibiting internalization with metabolic poisons, we were able to study the cell surface {{mobility of}} clusters of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex.</b> The same degree of asymmetry was induced when the occupied receptor was exposed to an electric field and the rate of back diffusion of clusters of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> corresponded to a diffusion coefficient of 0. 68 - 0. 95 X 10 (- 10) cm 2 /s.

40|$|Salivary glands of third-instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster {{as well as}} Drosophila Kc {{tissue culture}} cells have been {{irradiated}} {{in the presence of}} ecdysterone. Irradiation covalently links ecdysterone to a single cellular protein, which is similar, if not identical, in salivary glands and in Kc cells. This protein has a molecular weight of 130, 000 and it has the characteristics of a typical hormone-receptor molecule in terms of hormone-binding properties, translocation into the nucleus, and sedimentation characteristics. The yield of the photoinduced bonding of ecdysterone to receptor protein is around 15 %. Ponasterone A competed with ecdysterone for the bonding. Also, ponasterone A itself reacted upon photoactivation with the β-ecdysterone receptor protein in Drosophila tissue culture cells. We have previously shown that ecdysterone can be bonded upon irradiation to specific hormone-controlled puffs of polytene chromosomes of D. melanogaster third-instar larvae [Gronemeyer, H. & Pongs, O. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 2108 - 2112]. Because we have now identified the molecular target of the ecdysterone photoreaction, these data show that a <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> translocates to the nucleus and directly binds to the genes, which are under hormonal control. A quantitative assay of <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> in Kc cells before and after hormone stimulation showed that ecdysterone does not regulate the synthesis and the available amount of its receptor.

Using tritiated {{triamcinolone}} acetonide to monitor purification, cytoplasmic {{triamcinolone acetonide}}-receptor complex has been purified 3 000 fold from rat liver cytosol. The isolated complex sedimented {{as a single}} radioactive peak on a 5 - 20 % sucrose gradient. Nuclear envelopes isolated from purified rat liver nuclei were found to contain binding sites for the partially purified cytoplasmic triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex. The binding constants showed two saturable high affinity binding sites and the envelope bound the complex with a specific activity ten {{times higher than the}} plasma membrane and more than three times higher than the two endoplasmic types of membrane. Saturable binding to chromatin was not observed in the concentration range tested. Free steroid hormone did not bind the envelope. Binding sites for steroid hormones or steroid <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes</b> have been demonstrated both in chromatin and the nuclear protein matrix (Barrack and Coffey, 1980; Spelsberg, 1976). Because the nuclear envelope may be isolated with both these nuclear subfractions, the observed binding sites for steroid <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes</b> might be due to the presence of envelope components. The extent of association of nuclear envelope or nuclear envelope components with chromatin and the matrix was therefore investigated. Nuclear envelope fragments could be isolated from chromatin purified by centrifugation through 1, 7 M sucrose. The binding of triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex to these fragments was indistinguishable from the binding to purified nuclear envelope. A certain class of saturable chromatin binding sites for steroid <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes</b> may thus be due to the presence of envelope fragments. Extensive association of nuclear envelope polypeptides with the nuclear protein matrix was also observed. The matrix however, failed to bind triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex. The nuclear envelope comprises an inner and outer membrane with well defined pore complexes spanning both membranes. In order to identify the location of the binding sites for trimacinolone acetonide-receptor complex in the envelope, fractionation and reconstitution of envelope proteins and lipids was attempted. Envelopes were solubilized in 2 - chloroethanol and protein and lipid components separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH 20. Envelope protein and lipid could be successfully reconstituted from chloroethanol by dialysis against aqueous buffer. Results showed that the receptor complex binds to the protein rather than lipid component of the envelope. This component was extractable by concentrations of the nonionic detergent Triton X- 100 which do not extract the pore complex or lamina components of the envelope and is therefore probably a loosely bound membrane protein. The presence of specific binding sites for triamcinolone acetonidereceptor complex on the nuclear envelope may be necessary for the transport of the complex into the nucleus. The possibility that the envelope mediates the glucocorticoid response in ways not linked to transport of the cytoplasmic receptor complex into the nucleus cannot be ruled out...|$|R

The binding {{site of the}} <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> {{is located in the}} long terminal repeat (LTR) of MMTV DNA as shown by filter binding studies with labeled restriction fragments and by visualization of DNA-receptor complexes with the electron microscope. The DNAs from cloned MMTV lacking the LTR sequences were neither retained on nitrocellulose filters nor bound specifically to HRCs examined in the electron microscope. The HRC also failed to bind to restriction fragments from pBR 322 and phage lambda. Specific binding of the HRC to LTR sequences is dependent upon occupancy of the receptor by a glucocorticoid. Previous work has demonstrated that the MMTV transcription is initiated within the LTR; additionally, MMTV transcription is known to be regulated by glucocorticoids. Our present results therefore support the hypothesis that HRC regulates hormone-induced transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences near the MMTV transcription start site...|$|E
40|$|A study {{into the}} binding of 125 I-human {{chorionic}} gonadotropin (hCG) to the lutropin (LH) receptor in rat testis Leydig cells, and subsequent internalization of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex,</b> {{has been carried}} out. The results {{show that there is}} rapid internalization of the hormone-receptor complex; 240 receptors/cell (from a total of approx. 4000 receptors/cell) were internalized each minute in the first hour after exposure to hCG. Radioactivity was released from the cell 1 h after internalization and was found to be associated with highly degraded hCG. The endocytic process was found to have two temperature-sensitive steps. At 4 degrees C, movement of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> inside the cell did not occur, and at 21 degrees C hormone accumulated within the cytoplasm but was not degraded or released from the cell. At 34 degrees C, internalization, degradation and loss of the degraded hormone from the cell occurred. These processes appeared to reach a steady state after 2 h. Even though there is rapid internalization of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> following exposure to hCG, the binding sites on the cell surface were maintained for at least 4 h. The number of binding sites on the cell surface was not decreased by a protein synthesis inhibitor but was reduced to undetectable levels by monensin. This compound inhibits acidification of endocytic vesicles, which is known to be an important prerequisite to receptor cycling. It is concluded that, in the rat testis Leydig cells, following binding of hCG to the LH receptor there is rapid internalization of the complex and that recycling of the receptor occurs to the cell surface. This process may be essential in maintaining the capacity of the Leydig cell to bind fresh hormone...|$|E

Since thyroid hormone stimulates transcription {{of the growth}} hormone gene through an unknown mechanism, {{the hypothesis that the}} thyroid <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> interacts with defined regions of this gene has been investigated in a cell-free system. Nuclear extracts from human lymphoblastoid IM- 9 cells containing thyroid hormone receptors were incubated with L- 3, 5, 3 '-tri[125 I]iodothyronine and calf thymus DNA-cellulose. Restriction fragments of the human growth hormone gene were added to determine their ability to inhibit labeled receptor binding to DNA-cellulose. These fragments encompassed nucleotide sequences from about three kilobase pairs upstream to about four kilobase pairs downstream from the transcription initiation site. The thyroid <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> bound preferentially to the 5 '-flanking sequences of the growth hormone gene in a region between nucleotide coordinates - 290 and - 129. The receptor also bound to an analogous promoter region in the human placental lactogen gene, which has 92 % nucleotide sequence homology with the growth hormone gene. These binding regions appear to be distinct from those that are recognized by the receptor for glucocorticoids, which stimulate growth hormone gene expression synergistically with thyroid hormone. The presence of thyroid hormone was required for binding of its receptor to the growth hormone gene promoter, suggesting that thyroid hormone renders the receptor capable of recognizing specific gene regions.

The insulin derivative retained 1. 15 % of its potency in stimulating glucose oxidation in fat cells but retained about 8. 3 % of its binding affinity toward receptors. The epidermal growth factor derivative was completely active in binding to fibroblast receptors and 40 % as potent as the native hormone in stimulating DNA synthesis.

This reduction of binding capacity could not be completely accounted for by occupation of receptors by homologous hormone, suggesting that receptors were lost.

At this hormone concentration the onset of insulin action {{was found to be}} biphasic, with a rapid phase up to 8 min, followed by a much slower phase, reaching maximal insulin action by 30 - 60 min.

Although all were {{selected on the basis}} of their ability to bind the intact hormone, each also bound one of the two subunits but not both. Using a solid phase double antibody system to measure the relative binding to sites on the surface of hCG, we observed that four of the five antibodies bound to different sites on the molecule. This information was correlated with the ability of each antibody to inhibit the biological activity of hCG. Of the five antibodies tested for their ability to inhibit hCG-induced stimulation of rat testes steroidogenesis in vitro, two proved to be potent inhibitors, whereas the other three had almost no effect. This inhibition of steroidogenesis was highly correlated with the ability of the antibodies to inhibit hCG binding to testes homogenates. Thus, we have begun to derive a scheme that describes the relative binding positions of individual monoclonal antibodies and receptor on hCG. The purified monoclonal antibodies were iodinated and employed to evaluate which antigenic sites on hCG remained free in hCG-receptor complexes. The data indicated that portions of the beta subunit in hCG-receptor complexes were buried (i. e., failed to bind radiolabeled antibody), whereas other portions remained exposed (i. e., they bound radiolabeled antibody). Those antibodies that interacted with portions of hCG that became inaccessible in the receptor complex also blocked the biological actions of hCG, whereas those that interacted with exposed sites had little or no effect on activity. Although we did not find antibodies to the alpha subunit that would bind to the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex,</b> we found that one of the two antibodies specific to alpha subunit epitopes blocked the actions of the hormone.

We have shown previously that a highly conserved 66 amino acid {{region of the}} oestrogen (ER) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors, which corresponds to part of the receptor DNA binding domain (region C) is responsible for determining the specificity of target gene activation. This region contains two sub-regions (CI and CII) analogous to the 'zinc-fingers' of the transcription factor TFIIIA.

Furthermore, using chimaeric ERs in which either the first (N-terminal) (CI) or second (CII) 'zinc finger' region has been exchanged {{with that of the}} GR, indicates that it is the first 'zinc finger' which largely determines target gene specificity. We suggest that receptor recognition of the HRE is analogous to that of the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif in that the receptor binds to DNA as a dimer with the first 'zinc finger' lying in the major groove recognizing one half of the palindromic HRE, and that protein-DNA interaction is stabilized through non-specific DNA binding and dimer interactions contributed by the second 'zinc finger'...|$|R

More importantly, the apparent DNA-binding affinity of the nt- receptors is lower than the wild type, whereas the nti receptors bind DNA with an affinity higher than the parental molecules. The parallelism of nuclear and DNA binding, together with the observations that the receptors from the variants have sedimentation properties different from the wild-type cells, lead us to conclude that (i) these variants may contain altered receptor molecules and (ii) DNA is probably the primary nuclear binding site for steroid receptors in vivo...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} immunohistochemical {{studies of}} chicken oviduct after different fixation procedures, by using antibodies against the progesterone receptor: polyclonal antibodies IgG-G 3 against the " 8 S" form (an oligomere containing progesterone-binding and nonprogesterone- binding units), polyclonal antibodies IgG-RB against the progesterone- binding B subunit, and monoclonal BF 4 against the non-progesterone- binding 90, 000 -mol-wt protein component. Chickens were immature animals {{with or without}} estrogen priming, and with or without progesterone treatment. The antibodies were revealed {{by means of an}} immunoperoxidase technique that used the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex, and controls were performed by presaturation of antibodies with the purified 8 S- progesterone receptor, the B subunit, and 90, 000 -mol-wt protein. The progesterone receptor was detected not only in well-characterized target tissues, i. e., in glands and luminal epithelium, but also in stromal cells (some displayed the strongest reaction), in mesothelium, and in fibers of smooth muscles. Only in cell nuclei, whether or not the animals received an injection of progesterone was an antigen revealed corresponding to the B subunit (and/or to the A subunit, because there is immunoreactivity of IgG-RB with both hormone-binding subunits A and B). The 90, 000 -mol-wt protein was revealed in both cytoplasm and nuclei. These immunohistological data suggest that the concept of steroid action that necessarily involves the original formation of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes</b> in the cytoplasm before translocation to the nucleus, may have to be revised...|$|R
40|$|Purified IgG from BALB/c mouse anti-C 3 H serum exerts {{positive}} inotropic and chronotropic {{effects in}} C 3 H mouse atria and induces testosterone synthesis in C 3 H mouse Leydig cells. The effect depends on IgG concentration {{and can be}} abolished by beta-adrenergic-receptor and luteinizing hormone-receptor antagonists. IgG interferes with the binding of dihydroalprenolol and luteinizing hormone. Monoclonal antibodies against major histocompatibility complex class I antigens were active on the Leydig cells of C 3 H and BALB/c mice. There was a parallelism between the effect of each individual monoclonal antibody with specificity for a particular haplotype and {{the response of the}} target cell from the strains carrying such haplotypes. These antibodies could precipitate the soluble luteinizing <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex.</b> The results suggested that bound hormone triggers the association of major histocompatibility class I antigen with the receptor, thereby activating the respective target cells...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoid binding was {{measured}} in resident and thioglycollate- elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages, rabbit alveolar macrophages, and human monocytes. Two assays of binding were used [...] an assay with intact cells in suspension or monolayers, and an assay of cytosol and nuclear forms of glucocorticoid receptors. The mononuclear phagocytes contained approximately equal to 4 [...] 10 X 10 (3) high affinity receptor sites per cell, with dissociation constants of approximately equal to 2 [...] 8 nM dexamethasone. The binding to the saturable sites was specific for steroids with glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. Cortisol, corticosterone, and progesterone competed with dexamethasone for binding, whereas estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, and 11 -epicortisol competed very little. Binding of dexamethasone to cytosol and nuclear forms of the receptor complex and temperature-sensitive translocation of cytosol forms to nuclear forms were shown. At 37 degrees C the predominant form of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex</b> was nuclear. These results demonstrate that corticosteroids interact with macrophages at physiological concentrations...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the nucleotide {{sequence of the}} androgen receptor from 22 unrelated subjects with substitution mutations of the hormone-binding domain. Eleven had the phenotype of complete testicular feminization, four had incomplete testicular feminization, and seven had Reifenstein syndrome. The underlying functional defect in cultured skin fibroblasts included individuals with absent, qualitative, or quantitative defects in ligand binding. 19 of the 21 substitution mutations (90 %) cluster in two regions that account for approximately 35 % of the hormone-binding domain, namely, between amino acids 726 and 772 and between amino acids 826 and 864. The {{fact that one of}} these regions is homologous to a region of the human thyroid hormone receptor (hTR-beta) which is a known cluster site for mutations that cause thyroid hormone resistance implies that this localization of mutations is not a coincidence. These regions of the androgen receptor may be of particular importance for the formation and function of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complex...</b>|$|E
40|$|The exoloops of {{glycoprotein}} hormone receptors (GpHRs) transduce the signal {{generated by the}} ligand-ectodomain interactions to the transmembrane helices either through direct hormonal contact and/or by modulating the interdomain interactions between the hinge region (HinR) and the transmembrane domain (TMD). The ligand-induced conformational alterations in the HinRs and the interhelical loops of luteinizing hormone receptor/follicle stimulating hormone receptor/thyroid stimulating hormone receptor were mapped using exoloop-specific antibodies generated against a mini-TMD protein designed to mimic the native exoloop conformations that were created by joining the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor exoloops constrained through helical tethers and library-derived linkers. The antibody against the mini-TMD specifically recognized all three GpHRs and inhibited the basal and hormone-stimulated cAMP production without affecting hormone binding. Interestingly, binding of the antibody to all three receptors was abolished by prior incubation of the receptors with the respective hormones, suggesting that the exoloops are buried in the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes.</b> The antibody also suppressed the high basal activities of gain-of-function mutations in the HinRs, exoloops, and TMDs such as those involved in precocious puberty and thyroid toxic adenomas. Using the antibody and point/deletion/chimeric receptor mutants, we demonstrate that changes in the HinR-exoloop interactions {{play an important role}} in receptor activation. Computational analysis suggests that the mini-TMD antibodies act by conformationally locking the transmembrane helices by means of restraining the exoloops and the juxta-membrane regions. Using GpHRs as a model, we describe a novel computational approach of generating soluble TMD mimics that can be used to explain the role of exoloops during receptor activation and their interplay with TMDs...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{solution}} structure of human prolactin determined by NMR spectroscopy. Our {{result is a}} significant improvement over a previous structure in terms of number and distribution of distance restraints, regularity of secondary structure, and potential energy. More significantly, the structure is sufficiently different that it leads to different conclusions regarding the mechanism of receptor activation and initiation of signal transduction. Here, we compare the structure of unbound prolactin to structures of both the homologue ovine placental lacto en and growth hormone. The structures of unbound and receptor bound prolactin/placental lactogen are similar and no noteworthy structural changes occur upon receptor binding. The observation of enhanced binding at the second receptor site when the first site is occupied has been widely interpreted to indicate conformational change induced by binding the first receptor. However, our results indicate that this enhanced binding at the second site {{could be due to}} receptor-receptor interactions or some other free energy sources rather than conformational change in the hormone. Titration of human prolactin with the extracellular domain of the human prolactin receptor was followed by NMR, gel filtration and electrophoresis. Both binary and ternary <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes</b> are clearly detectable by gel filtration and electrophoresis. The binary complex is not observable by NMR, possibly due to a dynamic equilibrium in intermediate exchange within the complex. The ternary complex of one hormone molecule bound to two receptor molecules is on the contrary readily detectable by NMR. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} widely held view that the ternary prolactin-receptor complex is only transiently formed. Thus, our results lead to improved understanding of the prolactin-prolactin receptor interaction...|$|R
40|$|The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{controls}} LH and FSH secretion by membrane receptor interaction {{followed by}} a transmission mechanism involving Ca 2 + secretion and phosphoinositides hydrolysis. In the first step, GnRH binds to its receptor and induces the formation of aggregates of {{a certain number of}} <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>complexes.</b> Some of these GnRH-receptor complexes are internalized. Then, the receptors are either degraded in lysosomes or recycled through inclusion into secretory granules {{in the area of the}} Golgi. Note that receptor internalization is not necessary for the LH response to GnRH that intervenes immediately after GnRH binding to its receptor. Binding of GnRH to membrane receptors provokes extracellular calcium flux into the cell. At the same time, an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + from non-mitochondrial stock is observed. Intracellular Ca 2 + is important for the initiation of LH response and then extracellular Ca 2 + is necessary for a sustained response. GnRH also stimulates phosphoinositides hydrolysis (probably mediated by a G-protein) inducing inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate liberation. This component would participate in Ca 2 +i increase necessary for the early LH response. Another hydrolysis product is diacylglycerol (DAG) that binds principally to protein kinase C (PKC). On the one hand, this complex can activate "masked" GnRH receptors and participate in this manner to an up-regulation. On the other hand, it seems that FSH beta mRNA expression depends on PKC. GnRH secretion rythm modulates alpha, LH beta and FSH beta subunits mRNA expression, and secretion of these hormones. PKC could be an important regulator of these functions. DAG can also induce LH secretion, this mechanism uses PKC activation and requires gonadotrophin neosynthesis. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
