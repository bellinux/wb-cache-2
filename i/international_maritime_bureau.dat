25|$|According to Maritime Institute of Malaysia {{senior fellow}} Nazery Khalid, the action by PASKAL proved Malaysia's resolve in {{safeguarding}} its maritime interests and {{its commitment to}} fighting piracy. An official with the London-based <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau</b> (IMB) said, prior to any operation, the rescue team should first ensure the ship’s crew was safe before boarding the vessel. On 22 January 2011, the news of this success began to spread in newspapers and international news agencies AFP and Reuters.|$|E

50|$|Unarmed, the {{security}} guards attempted to repel the attackers for about 40 minutes by firing water cannon, zigzagging the skiff, and using a LRAD, a non-lethal weapon that fires focused sound beams producing excruciating pain. A distress signal was received at 0447 hours UTC by the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau's</b> Piracy Reporting Centre, in Kuala Lumpur. After the pirates boarded the ship and continued to shoot at {{the security}} force, the guards managed to escape by jumping overboard. They were rescued from the sea by a German navy helicopter, and taken first to the French light monitoring frigate Nivôse before being transferred to the Jean de Vienne, a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French Marine Nationale.|$|R
25|$|Established in March 2006, the Unit Gempur Marin {{was created}} under the Royal Malaysia Police {{with the first}} name as the Unit Selam Tempur due to the {{pressing}} need of suppressing pirate attacks alongside the coastal area of Malacca Straits and open sea area of South China Sea which were continuously widespread {{from time to time}} despite various efforts done to overcome the problem. Throughout the year of 2006, 239 cases of pirate attacks were reported according to statistics of the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau,</b> Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
25|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau</b> (IMB) reports {{worldwide}} pirate attacks {{fell for}} the third year in a row in 2006. Attacks on ships at sea in 2006 fell to 239vessels, down from 276 in 2005. That same trend echoed in the Strait of Malacca where attacks dropped from 79 in 2005 to 50 in 2006. Nonetheless, in 2004, the region accounted for 40% of piracy worldwide. The IMB reported in October 2007 that Indonesia continued to be the world's most pirate-struck region with 37attacks since January 2007, though that was an improvement from the same nine-month period in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau</b> (IMB) {{maintains}} statistics regarding pirate attacks {{dating back}} to 1995. Their records indicate hostage-taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers. For example, in 2006, there were 239 attacks, 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder. In 2007 the attacks rose by 10 percent to 263 attacks. There was a 35 percent increase on reported attacks involving guns. Crew members that were injured numbered 64 compared to just 17 in 2006. That number does not include instances of hostage taking and kidnapping where the victims were not injured.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} {{that the effect of}} {{governance}} on the emergence of crimes of different levels of sophistication is highly non-linear. State failure, anarchy and a lack of infrastructure are not conducive to establishing any business, including illicit enterprises. At the bottom of the spectrum, therefore, both legal business and criminal gangs benefit from improved governance. With further improvements in governance criminal activities decline. We find strong and consistent support for this hypothesis using the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau's</b> dataset on piracy. Piracy is reported by ship-owners, giving a unique insight into crime in badly governed countries which were systematically excluded from previous analyses. We show that profitable forms of piracy flourish where on the one hand there is stability and infrastructure, {{but on the other hand}} the state does not have the capacity to intervene and/or bureaucrats can be bribed to turn a blind eye. For minor acts of theft from ships the pattern is quadratic: piracy first rises and then falls as governance improves. Piracy, illegal behaviour, law enforcement, legal institutions...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{maritime}} piracy {{has received more}} attention from governments, the maritime industry, and the media. Increased incidents of violent attacks, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, create hazards for seafarers and shipping companies. The maritime industry has issued ?Best Management Practices for Protection against Somalia Based Piracy (?BMP 4 ?); however, not all practices are implemented, often {{to the detriment of}} the vessel under attack. The purpose of this paper is to identify what prevents an attack from being successful. Using data from the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau?s</b> Piracy Reporting Center and the Sea-Web shipping database, I have compiled a list of vessel characteristics, defense and deterrence strategies with particular emphasis on BMP 4, and cooperation with other companies or governments for each reported attack occurring between 2006 and 2011. From this list, we tested which of these variables have a relationship to the success or failure of an attack. Our study concluded that defense and cooperative strategies help prevent negative outcomes in general. Deterrence strategies are shown to help prevent hostages being taken, while defense strategies appear to reduce the need for a shipping company to pay a ransom. The industry supported best practices are shown to reduce the risk of property being stolen and hostages being taken...|$|R

25|$|Since 2008, Somali pirates {{centered}} in the Gulf of Aden made about $120 million annually, reportedly costing the shipping industry between $900 million and $3.3 billion per year. By September 2012, the heyday of piracy in the Indian Ocean was reportedly over. Backers were now reportedly reluctant to finance pirate expeditions due to the low rate of success, and pirates were {{no longer able to}} reimburse their creditors. According to the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau,</b> pirate attacks had by October 2012 dropped to a six-year low. Only five ships were captured {{by the end of the}} year, representing a decrease from 25 in 2011 and 27 in 2010, with only one ship attacked in the third quarter compared to 36 during the same period in 2011. However, pirate incidents off on the West African seaboard increased to 34 from 30 the previous year, and attacks off the coast of Indonesia rose from 2011's total of 46 to 51.|$|E
500|$|From 2003 to 2007, {{the number}} of piracy {{incidents}} worldwide declined from 452 to 282; however, piracy increased by 100% in Somalia, which suffered from severe poverty and lacked an effective central government since the 1991 ouster of Siad Barre. By 2005, the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau</b> advised ships to stay 200 nautical miles off the Somalian coast. According to academics J. Ndumbe Anyu and Samuel Moki, [...] "the overwhelming majority of pirates in Somalia come from Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in the northeast of the country... where [...] {{poorest of the poor}} live." [...] By 2008, as Anyu and Moki write, Somalia was the [...] "epicenter of piracy," [...] with 100 ships attacked that year; pirate ransom demands had spiked [...] "from {{tens of thousands of dollars}} a few years before to between $500,000 and $3.5 million," [...] since shipowners were willing to pay relatively small amounts to recover much more expensive ships. Pirates extorted about $120 million in ransoms in 2008. Accordingly, insurance premiums for shipping in the Gulf of Aden increased ten times from 2007 to 2008, from $900 to $9,000. The pirates frequently targeted yachts or commercial ships, which are unarmed and may hold valuable cargo. They sometimes targeted ships bearing humanitarian aid, such as the MV Semlow and MV Miltzow in 2005, which were hijacked while delivering food to Somalia under the UN World Food Programme. Despite international naval patrols working to curb piracy, The Telegraph noted that the region remained [...] "the most dangerous in the world for pirate attacks," [...] with 24 attacks between April and June 2008. In addition, 94 mariners were captured in the Gulf of Aden in the first half of the year.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 October 2007, Combined Maritime Forces {{received}} a call from the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Bureau</b> in Malaysia, regarding the North Korean cargo vessel Dai Hong Dan (pictured), which had been taken over the previous day by Somali pirates. The ship was approximately [...] northeast of Mogadishu, Somalia. The guided-missile destroyer James E. Williams was about [...] from the vessel, and sent a helicopter to investigate the situation. Williams arrived {{in the vicinity of the}} Korean ship at midday, local time, and contacted the pirates, ordering them to give up their weapons. The Korean crew then confronted the Somali pirates and regained control of the ship. The crew said the pirates had been in control of the bridge, but the crew had retained control of the steering and engineering spaces. The Williams crew provided care and assistance for approximately 12 hours to crew members and Somali pirates aboard Dai Hong Dan. [...] Six pirates were captured, and one was killed.

2500|$|The fourth {{volume of}} the handbook: Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area (known as BMP4) is the current {{authoritative}} guide for merchant ships on self-defense against pirates.

BMP4 encourages vessels to register their voyages through the region with MSCHOA as this registration is {{a key component of}} the operation of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC, the navy-patrolled route through the Gulf of Aden). BMP4 contains a chapter entitled [...] "Self-Protective Measures" [...] which lays out a list of steps a merchant vessel can take on its own to make itself less of a target to pirates and make it better able to repel an attack if one occurs. This list includes [...] rigging the deck of the ship with razor wire, rigging fire-hoses to spray sea-water {{over the side of the}} ship (to hinder boardings), having a distinctive pirate alarm, hardening the bridge against gunfire and creating a [...] "citadel" [...] where the crew can retreat in the event pirates get on board. Other unofficial self-defense measures that can be found on merchant vessels include the setting up of mannequins posing as armed guards or firing flares at the pirates.|$|E
