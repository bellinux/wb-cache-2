In the present study, a <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal pump with the staggered arrangement impeller in a domestic water supply {{project has been}} mapping and modeling, and then the symmetrical arrangement impeller of a <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal pump has been designed for comparison. The commercial code was used to investigate the pump efficiency and the time variation of pressure at the zone of volute tongue. This unsteady flow feature was investigated by the large eddy simulation (LES) method with the sliding mesh technology.

Nonsimilar solutions have been obtained from {{the starting point of}} the streamwise co-ordinate to the exact point of separation. The difficulties arising at the starting point of the streamwise co-ordinate, {{at the edges of the}} slot and at the point of separation have been overcome by applying an implicit finite difference scheme in combination with the quasi-linearization technique and an appropriate selection of the finer step sizes along the stream-wise direction. The present investigation shows that the point of ordinary separation can be delayed by nonuniform <b>double</b> slot <b>suction</b> if the mass transfer rate is increased and also if the slots are positioned further downstream.

Vibration level, hydraulic performance test and visual inspection of impeller wear and pitting show that cavitation problem is the cause of damage. Cavitation normally occurs when liquid at a constant temperature is subjected to vapor pressure either by static or dynamic means. If the local pressure somewhere in the fluid drops to or below vapor pressure and nuclei are present, vapor cavities can be formed.

Although these pumps met performance specifications {{on the test}} stand, they proved to be noisy when installed. Sound power levels greater than 93 dbA were observed. Pumping applications involving cooling water have been especially difficult to solve over the tears, due {{to the presence of}} dissolved air inherent in a cooling tower sump. Water that contains large amounts of dissolved air changes the apparent required net positive suction head (NPSH). In such applications, traditional correction techniques failed because the entire system was not analyzed, and the source of the noise generation could not be pinpointed. This paper deals with the steps involved with obtaining a solution to this problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed on the pump and impeller. Initial investigation revealed that the impeller was not the source of the problem. The casing inlet was then analyzed. The model indicated the presence of separation in the suction nozzle, causing a flow distortion at the impeller eye. A unique guide ring was developed to minimize the flow separation. The CFD analysis was revised to reflect the new geometry, and a significant improvement in the flow was predicted. A prototype guide ring was manufactured and installed in one of the four pumps.

Dual {{purpose of the}} investigation was to develop an impeller/pump case combination showing significantly less cavitation at the impeller leading-edges than the original design, and realize specific rate objectives for meeting new duty points to eliminate high pressure throttling over the discharge valve. New impeller designs were tested in a full scale model test pump running at reduced speed, which was equipped with an acrylic viewing window for direct observation of the impeller blade cavitation.

The first case study describes the rerate of a 4 X 6 X 13, 3560 rpm, 300 hp, single suction overhung pump and its spare, which were averaging between seven and 12 failures per year from 1990 to 1995.

In the light of their experience, the authors conclude that percutaneous aspiration may be a safe option in managing of mediastinal and pulmonary hydatid cyst in agreement with our experience 2. However, in our paper we clarify that surgical intervention is still the main modality for the treatment of hydatid disease especially in presence of giant cyst (> 10 cm) 3.

40|$|Lecturepg. 13 Following a brief {{description}} of the general suction performance of pumps and starting from an impeller designed for standard requirements, it will be discussed by which modifications and up to which limit the suction performance can be improved. In this context, it will be shown that the well-known measures ? e. g., enlargement of the impeller inlet diameter, reduction of the vane number or installation of an inducer ? may result in some restrictions concerning the possible operational range and may pose a risk of cavitation erosion. These undesirable consequences can, however, be avoided or at least moderated by modifications upstream of the impeller. The suction performance can also be improved by using <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> instead of single suction pumps. It is explained why the resulting improvement may not be as substantial as could be assumed at a first glace. Pumps with inlet velocities exceeding 25 to 30 m/s that are expected to run for 10, 000 hr and more without cavitation damage cannot operate at NPSH values corresponding to a 3. 0 percent head drop, even if a highly cavitation-resistant material is used. It is demonstrated that the design parameters of their impellers differ from those used for ?normal? impellers. If NPSHA is not sufficient, a booster pump has to be provided, or the rotational speed has to be reduced. As the latter is an expensive alternative, the question arises what the minimum booster pump head is. Some information regarding this issue is given. It will also be demonstrated that there is an upper limit of the rotational speed of the main pump beyond which can economical solution is impossible...|$|R
