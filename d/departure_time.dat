5|$|August 9, 1970 was a Sunday, and Flight 502 was {{originally}} scheduled to depart Cuzco at 8:30 am, but {{since many of}} the members of the American group wanted to visit the nearby Pisac native handicraft market prior to leaving for Lima, the airline postponed the <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> to 2:45 pm.|$|E
5|$|After {{exceeding}} the original <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous {{had resulted in}} clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By {{the time of the}} third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1941 {{the station}} was officially {{declared}} closed. The last recorded funeral carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868–1941), buried on 11 April 1941. The SR offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR's fast and frequent services to their own Brookwood railway station. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which bona fide mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11.57am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional <b>departure</b> <b>time),</b> but the SR management (themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage) refused to entertain any compromise.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} flying as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was {{a commercial}} Boeing 747-230B. The jet first flew on January 28, 1972, and was delivered on March 17, 1972, with {{the serial number}} CN20559/186 and registration HL7442 (formerly D-ABYH operated by Condor). The aircraft departed Gate 15 of John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City on August 30, 1983, bound for Gimpo International Airport in Gangseo District, Seoul, 35 minutes behind its scheduled <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> of 23:50 EDT (03:50 UTC, August 31). The flight was carrying 246 passengers and 23 crew members. After refueling at Anchorage International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska, the aircraft, piloted on this leg of the journey by captain Chun Byung-in, first officer Son Dong-hui and Flight Engineer Kim Eui-dong, departed for Seoul at 04:00 AHDT (13:00UTC) on August 31, 1983.|$|E
5|$|The last {{recorded}} funeral party {{carried on}} the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868–1941), buried on 11 April 1941.

5|$|The ship, with Stars of David {{painted on}} her funnels, {{pulled away from}} the dock at eight minutes before noon, nearly an hour later than her planned <b>departure</b> <b>time,</b> and headed to Haifa, with an {{intermediate}} stop in Naples. On board were some 400passengers from all over the United States and Canada, most of whom were tourists wanting to see the Holy Land. Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the Hebrew University at Mount Scopus by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour. President Arthur also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine. In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect <b>departure</b> <b>time</b> (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway (SR), {{which had}} absorbed the LSWR in 1923, offered the LNC the {{temporary}} use of Waterloo station {{to allow the}} Necropolis Railway service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains to the cemetery stations over the SR's fast and frequent services to Brookwood.

In September 1945, following the end of hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained, the branch line was in extremely poor condition.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} work, our driver agent is modeled {{regarding}} route choice only. Future work could investigate {{not only the}} drivers route choice but the trip planning as a whole, that is, <b>departure</b> <b>times,</b> mode and route choices when a road pricing scheme is being used. Arnott et al. [7] study the choice of routes and <b>departure</b> <b>times</b> in a single origin-destination scenario. Several works followed up since then, and we remark the comprehensive study presented in [10], where citizens have daily activity plans and have to decide <b>departure</b> <b>times,</b> transportation modes, and routes. Future work can extend this by implementing and assessing the impact of variable pricing approaches.|$|R
