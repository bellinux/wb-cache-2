40|$|The {{concentration}} of atmospheric pollutants in the Po Valley is {{renowned for its}} remarkably high levels, both for particulate and gaseous compounds. This analysis focussed on measurements of air pollutants from a background site in Modena, Po valley, Italy. These comprise hourly data for CO, NO, NO 2, NOx, O 3 and daily <b>gravimetric</b> <b>equivalent</b> data for PM 10 from 1998 – 2010. The data are analysed in terms of long-term trends, and of annual, weekly and diurnal patterns. Auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions are also investigated. Influence of anthropogenic sources on pollutant concentration has been studied by checking the presence of weekly cycles on pollutants. Gaseous pollutant characteristic of vehicular traffic emissions (i. e. CO, NO and NO 2) exhibit a daily pattern featured by peaks at morning and evening rush-hour and lower concentrations over the weekend. Ozone, whose annual pattern is typified by summer peak due to local production, did not show a significant variation in long term trend notwithstanding the significant decrease in NO over the decade. Regression models of PM 10 upon NOx show a greater intercept in winter, representing higher secondary PM 10 in the cooler months of the year, and a seasonal pattern in the PM 10 to NOx ratio, with lower values in winter and higher in summer...|$|E
40|$|The Po {{valley in}} {{northern}} Italy is {{renowned for its}} high air pollutant concentrations. Measurements of air pollutants from a background site in Modena, a town of 200 thousand inhabitants within the Po valley, are analysed. These comprise hourly data for CO, NO, NO 2, NOx, and O 3, and daily <b>gravimetric</b> <b>equivalent</b> data for PM 10 from 1998 – 2010. The data are analysed in terms of long-term trends, annual, weekly and diurnal cycles, and auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions. CO, NO and NO 2 exhibit a strongly traffic-related pattern, with daily peaks at morning and evening rush hour and lower concentrations over the weekend. Ozone shows an annual cycle with a peak in July due to local production; notwithstanding the diurnal cycle dominated by titration by nitrogen oxide, the decreasing long term trend in NO concentration {{did not affect the}} long term trend in O 3, whose mean concentration remained steady over the sampling period. PM 10 shows a strong seasonality with higher concentration in winter and lower concentration in summer and spring. Both PM 10 and ozone show a marked weekly cycle in summer and winter respectively. Regressions of PM 10 upon NOx show a consistently greater intercept in winter, representing higher secondary PM 10 in the cooler months of the year. There is a seasonal pattern in primary PM 10 to NOx ratios, with lower values in winter and higher values in summer, but the reasons are unclear...|$|E
40|$|Po Valley is one {{the largest}} European region with remarkably high {{concentration}} level of atmospheric pollutants, both for particulate and gaseous compounds. In {{the last decade}} stringent regulations on air quality standards and on anthropogenic emissions have been set by the European Commission, leading to the latest 2008 / 50 /CE, which requires a monitoring plan also for PM 2. 5, used {{as an indicator of}} population exposure to atmospheric particulates. These regulations lead to an overall improvement on air quality across Europe, including PM 10 in the Po valley (Bigi and Ghermandi, 2014). Due to the different nature of PM 2. 5 and its large fraction of secondary aerosols, patterns and trends of PM 2. 5 exhibit large difference to PM 10 features, therefore the latest air quality regulations may represent a hard challenge for municipalities and environmental agencies. Daily <b>gravimetric</b> <b>equivalent</b> PM 2. 5 concentration at 44 sites over the Po valley (either in urban or rural background conditions) has been analysed. Long term trends on deseasonalized monthly means have been estimated by Generalised Least Squares. These results have been compared with trends on annual quantiles. Changes, over the sampling period, in frequency distribution of PM 2. 5 in each month have also been estimated. For each site, impact of primary anthropogenic particulate emissions has been qualitatively estimated by testing PM 2. 5 series for a significant weekly periodicity using three different metrics. The former compares the median among time series of PM 2. 5 anomalies of weekdays, the second consists in the weekend effect magnitude. The latter used frequency domain analysis in order to test whether estimated spectral density at 1 / 7 day- 1 frequency is significantly higher than the spectral density of a red noise series. Finally a cluster analysis on the dataset has been performed, showing a geographical pattern for PM 2. 5 concentration across the valley. This study provides a reliable tool to asses the impact of the current and previous emission control policies across the Po valley...|$|E
40|$|We used gene {{expression}} profiling {{to investigate whether}} the molecular effects induced by estrogens of different provenance are intrinsically similar. In this article we show that the physiologic estrogen 17 β-estradiol, the phytoestrogen genistein, and the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol alter {{the expression of the}} same 179 genes in the intact immature mouse uterus under conditions where each chemical has produced an <b>equivalent</b> <b>gravimetric</b> and histologic uterotrophic effect, using the standard 3 -day assay protocol. Data are also presented indicating the limitations associated with comparison of {{gene expression}} profiles for different chemicals at times before the uterotrophic effects are fully realized. We conclude that the case has yet to be made for regarding synthetic estrogens as presenting a unique human hazard compared with phytoestrogens and physiologic estrogens. Ke...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the discontinuous ventilation cycle (DVC) observed in many insects, including all ants described to date, is an adaptation to reduce respiratory water loss. To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to measure respiratory water loss as a percentage of total water loss and to estimate what sustained rates of water loss would be in the absence of spiracular control. We used two independent techniques to measure real-time water loss rates in female alates of Pogonomyrmex rugosus. The first measured water vapor emission and CO 2 production simultaneously using dual-wavelength infrared absorbance analysis (DWIRAA). The second measured water loss gravimetrically. Real-time measurement allowed the separation of cuticular water loss rates (interburst) from water loss rates during the ventilation phase (burst) of the DVC. Cuticular permeability of P. rugosusfemale alates was only 27 ngh 21 cm 22 Pa 21, one-third of that reported for workers of the same species and the lowest yet reported for ants. Partly because of this low cuticular permeability, respiratory water loss represented a greater percentage of overall water loss (13 %) than has generally been reported for other insects. The DWIRAA and <b>gravimetric</b> techniques gave <b>equivalent</b> results. Peak rates of water loss during the burst phase were 2. 8 -fold higher than cuticular water loss rates alone (7. 68 mgg 21 h 21 versus 2. 77 mg 21 h 21 at 25 ˚C). This is a conservative estimate of water loss rates in the absence of spiracular control. Contrary to findings in certain other insects that suggest a negligible role for respiratory water loss, we find that, in an insect that employs the DVC and has low cuticular permeability, overall water loss rates rise several-fold in the absence of direct spiracular control. Our findings lend strong support to the water conservation hypothesis for the role of the DVC. In at least some insects, respiratory water loss rates can reach magnitudes significant enough, relative to other routes of water loss, for strong selective pressure to act on them...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare co-located real-time light scattering devices and <b>equivalent</b> <b>gravimetric</b> samplers in poultry and pig houses for PM 10 mass concentration, and to develop animal-specific calibration factors for light scattering samplers. These results will contribute to evaluate the comparability of different sampling instruments for PM 10 concentrations. Paired DustTrak light scattering device (DustTrak aerosol monitor, TSI, U. S.) and PM 10 gravimetric cyclone sampler were used for measuring PM 10 mass concentrations during 24 h periods (from noon to noon) inside animal houses. Sampling was conducted in 32 animal houses in the Netherlands, including broilers, broiler breeders, layers in floor and in aviary system, turkeys, piglets, growing-finishing pigs in traditional and low emission housing with dry and liquid feed, and sows in individual and group housing. A total of 119 pairs of 24 h measurements (55 for poultry and 64 for pigs) were recorded and analyzed using linear regression analysis. Deviations between samplers were calculated and discussed. In poultry, cyclone sampler and DustTrak data fitted well to a linear regression, with a regression coefficient equal to 0. 41, an intercept of 0. 16 mg m- 3 and a correlation coefficient of 0. 91 (excluding turkeys). Results in turkeys showed a regression coefficient equal to 1. 1 (P = 0. 49), an intercept of 0. 06 mg m- 3 (P < 0. 0001) and a correlation coefficient of 0. 98. In pigs, we found a regression coefficient equal to 0. 61, an intercept of 0. 05 mg m- 3 and a correlation coefficient of 0. 84. Measured PM 10 concentrations using DustTraks were clearly underestimated (approx. by a factor 2) in both poultry and pig housing systems compared with cyclone pre-separators. Absolute, relative, and random deviations increased with concentration. DustTrak light scattering devices should be self-calibrated to investigate PM 10 mass concentrations accurately in animal houses. We recommend linear regression equations as animal-specific calibration factors for DustTraks instead of manufacturer calibration factors, especially in heavily dusty environments such as animal house...|$|R
40|$|The Po Valley {{is one of}} {{the largest}} European regions with a remarkably high {{concentration}} level of atmospheric pollutants, both for particulate and gaseous compounds. In the last decade stringent regulations on air quality standards and on anthropogenic emissions have been set by the European Commission, including also for PM 2. 5 and its main components since 2008. These regulations have led to an overall improvement in air quality across Europe, including the Po Valley and specifically PM 10, as shown in a previous study by Bigi and Ghermandi (2014). In order to assess the trend and variability in PM 2. 5 in the Po Valley and its role in the decrease in PM 10, we analysed daily <b>gravimetric</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentration of PM 2. 5 and of PM 10 - 2. 5 at 44 and 15 sites respectively across the Po Valley. The duration of the times series investigated in this work ranges from 7 to 10 years. For both PM sizes, the trend in deseasonalized monthly means, annual quantiles and in monthly frequency distribution was estimated: this showed a significant decreasing trend at several sites for both size fractions and mostly occurring in winter. All series were tested for a significant weekly periodicity (a proxy to estimate the impact of primary anthropogenic emissions), yielding positive results for summer PM 2. 5 and for summer and winter PM 10 - 2. 5. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed moderate variability in PM 2. 5 across the valley, with two to three main clusters, dividing the area in western, eastern and southern/Apennines foothill sectors. The trend in atmospheric concentration was compared with the time series of local emissions, vehicular fleet details and fuel sales, suggesting that the decrease in PM 2. 5 and in PM 10 originates from a drop both in primary and in precursors of secondary inorganic aerosol emissions, largely ascribed to vehicular traffic. Potentially, the increase in biomass burning emissions in winter and the modest decrease in NH 3 weaken an otherwise even larger drop in atmospheric concentrations...|$|E
