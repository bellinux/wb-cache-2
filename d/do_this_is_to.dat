25|$|The general {{method to}} <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> monitor sludge blanket level, SVI (Sludge Volume Index), MCRT (Mean Cell Residence Time), F/M (Food to Microorganism), {{as well as}} the biota of the {{activated}} sludge and the major nutrients DO (Dissolved oxygen), nitrogen, phosphate, BOD (Biochemical oxygen demand), and COD (Chemical oxygen demand).|$|E
25|$|Because {{dark matter}} {{remains to be}} {{conclusively}} identified, many theories that aim to explain the observational evidence without invoking dark matter have emerged. The obvious way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar-system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales is less certain. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably {{eliminate the need for}} dark matter. The most well-known theories of this class are MOND and its relativistic generalization TeVeS, f(R) gravity and entropic gravity. Alternative theories abound.|$|E

5|$|Over the winter, Aristagoras {{continued}} to foment rebellion. In one incident, {{he told a}} group of Paeonians (originally from Thrace), who Darius had brought to live in Phrygia, to return to their homeland. Herodotus says that his only purpose in <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> vex the Persian high command.|$|R
25|$|Further {{reduction}} is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximal destructive interference. One way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> add a second quarter-wave thick higher-index layer between the low-index layer and the substrate. The reflection {{from all three}} interfaces produces destructive interference and anti-reflection. Other techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion, broadband anti-reflection coatings covering the visible range (400–700nm) with maximal reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable.|$|E
25|$|With the Authority {{beginning}} to forcefully expand {{its influence on}} the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act {{with the help of}} Raine who is able to recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all of the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally main channels will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel. The best way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> slow the overall flow from the main dam and redirect all water flowing originally through the damaged channel to backup channels. Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E

50|$|As the {{effective}} {{power of the}} Holy Roman Empire declined, kingdoms asserted their own independence. One way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> claim that the king had, in his kingdom, the same power as the emperor in the empire, and so the king assumed the attributes of potestas.|$|R
50|$|As a private, unsubsidised airline {{that for}} most of its {{existence}} mainly operated low-margin, predominantly seasonal charter flights due to government restrictions on scheduled services, Dan-Air needed to minimise overheads to ensure its profitability. One way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> outsource its ground handling to a third-party handler.|$|R
25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement {{along the length of the}} tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E
500|$|Showing {{that the}} {{condition}} is also a sufficient condition {{is a matter of}} describing how to fold a given crease pattern so that it folds flat. That is, one must show how to choose whether to make mountain or valley folds, and in what order the flaps of paper should be arranged on top of each other. One way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> choose a number [...] such that the partial alternating sum ...|$|E
500|$|The basic {{feature of}} every finite group is its {{multiplication}} table, also called Cayley table, that records {{the result of}} multiplying any two elements. A representation of a group {{can be thought of}} new set of elements, finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional matrices, giving the same multiplication table after mapping the old elements to the new elements in a one-to-one fashion. The same holds true {{in the case of an}} infinite group like the rotation group SO(3) or the Lorentz group. The multiplication table is just harder to visualize in the case of a group of uncountable size (same size as the set of reals). One way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> wellorder the elements of the group with an ordinal number [...] being the order type. The [...] "infinite Cayley table" [...] is then indexed by two ordinals [...] written on Cantor normal form.|$|E

25|$|The {{critical}} {{decision was}} made on 14 March when Thiệu met with Phu. Thiệu had decided to abandon Pleiku and Kon Tum so that the II Corps forces could concentrate on retaking Buôn Ma Thuột, which he considered more important. Phu then decided that the only possible means of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> retreat to the coast along Interprovincial Route 7B, a dilapidated, rough track with several downed bridges, before recuperating and counterattacking back into the highlands.|$|R
2500|$|Equipment {{earthing}} conductors {{provide an}} electrical {{connection between the}} physical ground (earth) and the grounding/bonding system, which connects (bonds) the normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment. According to the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC), the reason for <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line surges, and contact with higher voltage lines.|$|R
500|$|In {{the second}} instance, {{breaking}} the scheme {{is even more}} straightforward. Since {{there are only a}} limited number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack. One way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> write out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts – a technique sometimes known as [...] "completing the plain component". The example given is for the ciphertext [...] "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four. Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter. This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down in reverse order. The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{method to}} {{standardize}} {{the transformation of}} a word rate to a dot duration is useful. [...] A simple way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> choose a dot duration that would send a typical word the desired number of times in one minute. [...] If, for example, the operator wanted a character speed of 13 words per minute, the operator would choose a dot rate that would send the typical word 13 times in exactly one minute.|$|E

2500|$|Suppose {{you want}} to define {{what it means for}} two sets to [...] "have the same number of {{elements}}". One way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> say that two sets [...] "have the same number of elements" [...] if and only if all the elements of one set can be paired with the elements of the other, {{in such a way that}} each element is paired with exactly one element. Accordingly, we can define two sets to [...] "have the same number of elements" [...] if there is a bijection between them. We say that the two sets have the same cardinality.|$|E
2500|$|Redemptorist spirituality {{consists}} of the Crib, the Cross, and the Sacrament. In other words, the Redemptorists follow Christ in his incarnation, death, and resurrection and {{believe that he is}} always with them. They emphasize the encounter with Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, and have their founder's popular version of the Way of the Cross and the Christmas carols which he composed. With a practical focus, Redemptorist spirituality would render help to the those in dire spiritual or material need, based on Jesus' invitation to follow him. One of the most tangible ways they <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> proclaim the Gospel in simple ways to ordinary people, taking as their motto Jesus' words when he quoted Isaiah: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…. to preach Good News to the poor,… liberty to captives,… sight to the blind,… to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour (Luke 4:18-19).|$|E

It is like medicine for the soul. It helps us to relief pain, to get rid of fears, lessen our depression. The significance of the right literature for the right person is downright more effective than any other form of guidance, including religion or parenting. It is therefore paramount that the child reads for his own pleasure from an early age. And the way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show him the type of books that he would likely to enjoy, which is not necessarily the book the school or society considers as valuable. To do that, of course, his family members and those who are trusted with the child's care must consider his personality and interest. My younger son, Ben was infatuated with the wildlife and the animal world. So what did I do? I lavished him with books by Gerald Durrell and David Attenborough and Jane Goodall, and any book I could find on the animal kingdom, no expense spared. And before he knew it, he finished two books a week and soon began reading books, by own choice, like the Jungle Book and Treasure Island and the works of Mark Twain." ...|$|E
