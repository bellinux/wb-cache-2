40|$|Ceramic {{properties}} such as biocompatibility and inertness have secured {{their use}} in biomedical prosthetics. The brittle nature of ceramics governs their application in any design and fabrication technique. Current all-ceramic <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> have a reported failure rate of approximately 3 % a year. An investigation into a possible improved design over current all-ceramic <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> is performed. Current methods of fabricating all-ceramic <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> involve laborious and time consuming application of porcelain veneer layers onto a core material. The proposed design is to join independently fabricated veneer and core layers together using a high elastic modulus composite. Fracture behavior of brittle layers joined by a high elastic modulus composite is studied in this dissertation. There are two dominant fracture mechanisms of concern for <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> when joining brittle layers with a more compliant interlayer; the formation of radial cracks in the veneer or core and the propagation of cracks between brittle layers. The occlusal loading on <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> can be simulated {{with the use of}} Hertzian contact testing on flat brittle laminates, which allow for the study of radial cracks in the veneer. It is shown {{for the first time that}} bottom-surface radial cracks in the veneer due to flexure can be suppressed using a high elastic modulus joining interlayer. The relationship between the critical loads for radial crack formation, Pcr and the interlayer modulus and thickness is elucidated. Furthermore, using the high modulus composite as an interlayer increases the long term cyclic loading lifetime over joins with similar moduli to currently available dental adhesives. The propagation of cracks between adjacent brittle layers is shown to be controlled by a reinitiation mechanism and not penetration through the adhesive. Cracks that traverse the layer of origin arrest at the join interface in brittle laminates. Reinitiation loads are dictated by strength of the adjacent brittle layer and modulus of adhesive. This study shows that it is possible to use a high modulus composite as a joining material in the fabrication of <b>dental</b> <b>crowns,</b> while suppressing the formation of radial cracks in the veneer and limiting the propagation of cracks between adjacent brittle layers...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Various luting cements {{are used}} to fix <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> to {{prepared}} teeth, and should provide an adhesive bond to the tooth structure giving reliable retention. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish in vitro which type of the tested luting cement provided the strongest adhesive bond of the prepared teeth to the fixed denture. Methods. Testing was carried out on the sample of 100 intact human premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons. The preparation of the teeth was performed by a heavy-duty machine. The surfaces of the prepared teeth were mathematically calculated. <b>Dental</b> <b>crowns</b> from the Nickel-Chromium- Molybenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) alloy were made in a standard fashion, and fixed to prepared teeth (two samples of each group) with 5 different types of luting cements. The strength of force applyed to separate the cast crowns from the prepared teeth was measured by an electronic dynamometer, after 7 days. Results. The obtained results revealed the connection between the type of luting cement and the values of retention power. The best adhesive bond under the constant convergence angle of the prepared teeth was provided by the resin cement. Conclusion. When choosing a luting cement for fixing <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> to prepared teeth, the advantage should be given to the resin cement in case the glassionomers are not available...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to study dentofacial {{morphology}} in Turner syndrome (TS) versus controls and the influence hereupon from karyotype. One hundred thirty two TS females (5 - 66 years of age), from Göteborg, Uppsala and Umeå were participating. Cephalometric analysis, cast model analysis concerning palatal height, dental arch morphology and <b>dental</b> <b>crown</b> width were performed. Eighteen primary teeth were analysed in polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, microradiography and X-ray microanalysis were performed. The TS females were divided according to karyotype into: 1 45,X; 2 45,X/ 46,XX; 3 isochromosome; 4 other. Compared to healthy females, TS {{were found to have}} a flattened cranial base as well as small and retrognathic jaws with a posterior inclination. The maxillary dentoalveolar arch was narrower and longer, while the mandibular dental arch was wider and longer in TS compared to controls. The palatal height did not differ comparing TS and healthy females. The <b>dental</b> <b>crown</b> width was smaller in TS for both permanent and primary teeth. Aberrant elemental composition, prism pattern and lower mineral density were found in TS primary enamel compared to enamel in primary teeth from healthy girls. Turner syndrome karyotype was found having an impact on craniofacial morphology, with the mosaic 45,X/ 46,XX exhibiting a milder mandibular retrognathism as well as fewer cephalometric variables differing from controls compared to other karyotypes. Also for the dentoalveolar arch morphology the 45,X/ 46,XX group had fewer variables differing from healthy females. The isochromosome TS group exhibited the smallest <b>dental</b> <b>crown</b> width for several teeth, while 45,X/ 46,XX hade the largest <b>dental</b> <b>crown</b> with for some teeth and fewer teeth than both 45,X and isochromosomes that differed from controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{palladium}} {{and nickel}} sensitization in oral disease and dermatitis {{is not fully}} understood. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether sensitization to these metals was associated with exposure to dental alloys and oral and skin complaints/symptoms in a European multicentre study. METHODS: In six dermatology clinics, patch tests with palladium (3 % Na 2 PdCl 4; Pd[*]=[*] 102. 0 [*]µmol/g) and nickel (5 % NiSO 4. 6 H 2 O; Ni[*]=[*] 190. 2 [*]µmol/g) were performed in consecutive patients, and patients' characteristics were collected with a questionnaire and a clinical investigation. RESULTS: In total, 906 patients were included, of whom 24. 3 % reacted to palladium and 25. 2 % to nickel. The rate of monosensitization was 6 - 7 % for both metals. Palladium sensitization (as opposed to no sensitization to both metals) was associated with exposure to <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> [odds ratio (OR) 2. 0], skin reactivity to metals (OR 2. 8), oral lichenoid lesions (OR 4. 7), xerostomia (OR 7. 3), and metal taste (OR 20. 7), but not with eczema, stomatitis, or oral burning sensation. Additionally, xerostomia (OR 8. 7) and metal taste (OR 4. 6) were associated with sensitization to both metals. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, {{it is important for}} palladium-sensitized patients to undergo an oral examination, with particular attention to the presence of/exposure to <b>dental</b> <b>crowns.</b> In the case of metal contact allergy, exposure to <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> could play a role. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPorcelain {{fused to}} Y-TZP <b>dental</b> <b>crowns</b> {{are widely used}} in dental restorations. The {{fracture}} damage from concentrated loading especially under dual-motion cyclic loading-simulating chewing remains doubtful. Flat occlusal surface porcelain/Y-TZP ceramic crowns were fabricated following general dental practice and were supported with dentine-like composite to simulate actual dental restorations. Specimens were subjected to eccentric forces in a Willytic chewing simulator with loads of 5, 7 and 8 Kg delivered by means of steel stylus of 4 mm diameter in wet condition. The damage evolution was observed at stepwise increase in cycles of 100, 000 cycles each. Force measurements were taken using a 3 D force sensor during dynamic loading of simultaneous axial-lateral movements. Localized surface damage which was observed at early stages was halted later after 500, 000 cycles with distinctive crack patterns. Radial cracks were observed in three locations; the first location was at the porcelain inner layer under the indentation area. The second location was at the marginal extremists similar to lunar cracks observed when using soft intenders. The third location was the mesiobuccal area between the occlusal and axial sides of the crown. This latter finding may explain the chipping damage of the <b>dental</b> <b>crowns.</b> More interestingly at mesiobuccally area between the occlusal and the axial side of the crown which explain the chipping damage of <b>dental</b> <b>crowns,</b> {{it was believed that}} extension of radial cracks from indentation area are the major cause of such failure...|$|R
