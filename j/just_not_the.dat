According to GameCritics, [...] "It took Rare a whole console generation to do it ... and the wait wasn't really worth it". Game Informer found the game underwhelming, reviewing it under the tagline [...] "Don't believe the hype". In a positive review, GameSpy observed that [...] "Perfect Dark Zero is a lot of fun and does a lot of things very well, but it's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> killer-app that we'd all hoped for". Edge said that the game [...] "falls short", especially when compared to , a successful first-person shooter that was released as a launch title for the original Xbox.

It was a great two years, and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I think that would be pretty much ideal." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt {{like something out of a}} bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E

500|$|Due to his resounding loss to Nixon in the 1972 {{election}} and the causes behind it, [...] "McGovernism" [...] became a label that a generation of Democratic politicians tried to avoid. In 1992, nationally syndicated Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene wrote, [...] "Once again politicians – mostly Republicans, but some Democrats, too – are using his name as a synonym for presidential campaigns that are laughable and {{out of touch with}} the American people." [...] Conservatives used McGovern's name as a ready synonym for what they saw as liberal failures. Indeed, according to Daniel McCarthy of The American Conservative, the Republican Party began to act after 1972 as if [...] "every Democratic leader, no matter how Southern, how pro-war, how middle-of-the-road, is really a McGovernite. Indeed, for nearly 40 years the conservative movement has defined itself in opposition to the Democratic standard-bearer of 1972. Anti-McGovernism has come to play for the Right the unifying role that anticommunism once played, much to the detriment of older principles such as limited government, fiscal continence, and prudence in foreign policy." [...] The association with dovishness and weakness on defense has been especially prevalent, although McGovern publicly stated in 1972 that he was not a pacifist and that use of force was sometimes necessary, such as in World War II. McGovern later said in 2001 that his political image had been exaggerated: [...] "I am a liberal and always have been – <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be." [...] He continued to feel that he was marginalized with his views miscast. He saw himself as a son of the prairie, in 2005 reciting his traditional upbringing and family values, culminating with [...] "I'm what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like", and in 2006 said, [...] "How the hell do you get elected in South Dakota for twenty years if you're a wild-eyed radical?" ...|$|E
