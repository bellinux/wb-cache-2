25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>robotics</b> is a sub-branch in the {{industrial}} automation that aids in various manufacturing processes. Such manufacturing processes include; machining, welding, painting, assembling and material handling to name a few.

30|$|Security {{systems in}} <b>industrial</b> <b>robotic</b> environments can be {{classified}} as passive and active. Passive security systems are hazard warning elements which do not alter the robot behaviour. These systems are audible or visible signals such as alarms or lights or systems that prevent the inadvertent access to a restricted area. Active security systems in <b>industrial</b> <b>robotic</b> environments {{can be defined as}} the methods used to prevent the intrusion of humans to the robot workspace when it is in automatic mode. The difference with the passive methods is that active methods can modify the robot behaviour. Historically, devices such as movement, proximity, force, acceleration, or light sensors are used to detect human access to the robot workspace and to stop the execution of the robot task. However, as it has been discussed previously, research in this field is moving towards allowing humans and robots to share workspaces.|$|R
