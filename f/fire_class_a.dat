5000|$|Fires are {{classified}} by the proper extinguishing agent. While water {{is used to}} <b>fire</b> <b>Class</b> <b>A</b> fires, using water on a class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous. This is because burning grease is hotter that the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius); when water is placed on grease, it creates steam which expands rapidly and splatters, causing burns and spreading the fire). Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use dry chemicals (foam or powder), such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211).

40|$|Abstract. Reflectance-based indices {{derived from}} remote-sensing data {{have been widely}} used for {{detecting}} fire severity in forested areas. Rangeland ecosystems, such as sparsely vegetated shrub-steppe, have unique spectral reflectance dif-ferences before and after fire events that may not make reflectance-based indices appropriate for fire severity estimation. As an alternative, average vegetation height change (dh) derived from pre- and post-fire Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were used in this study for fire severity estimation. Theoretical deductions were conducted to demonstrate that LiDAR-derived dh is related to biomass combustion and thus can be used for fire severity estimation in rangeland areas. The Jeffreys–Matusita (JM) distance was calculated to evaluate the separability for each pair of <b>fire</b> severity <b>classes,</b> with <b>an</b> average JM distance of 1. 14. Thresholds for classifying the level of fire severity were determined according to the mean and standard deviation of each <b>class.</b> <b>A</b> fire-severity classification map with 84 % overall accuracy was obtained from the LiDAR dh method.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is twofold [...] first, to {{introduce}} the application of high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods to buoyancy-driven cargo hold fire simulations, second, to explore statistical variation in the fluid dynamics of a cargo hold fire given parameterized uncertainty in the fire source location and temperature. Cargo hold <b>fires</b> represent <b>a</b> <b>class</b> of problems that require highly-accurate computational methods to simulate faithfully. Hence, we use an in-house discontinuous Galerkin code to treat these flows. Cargo hold fires also exhibit a large amount of uncertainty with respect to the boundary conditions. Thus, the second aim of this paper is to quantify the resulting uncertainty in the flow, using tools from the uncertainty quantification community to ensure that our efforts require a minimal number of simulations. We expect that the results of this study will provide statistical insight into the effects of fire location and temperature on cargo fires, and also assist in the optimization of fire detection system placement.
