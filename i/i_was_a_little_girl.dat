500|$|Bush is of English, French, and Swiss ancestry. Her {{father was}} a home builder and later {{successful}} real estate developer, while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father's business. [...] Early on, her parents encouraged her to read, leading to what would become her love of reading. She said, [...] "I learned [...] at home from my mother. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> my mother would read stories to me. I have loved books {{and going to the}} library ever since. In the summer, I liked to spend afternoons reading in the library. I enjoyed the Little House on the Prairie and Little Women books, and many others... Reading gives you enjoyment throughout your life." [...] Bush has also credited her second grade teacher, Charlene Gnagy, for inspiring her interest in education.|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jemison flew {{her only}} space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992, as a Mission Specialist on STS-47, a {{cooperative}} mission between the United States and Japan, {{as well as}} the 50th shuttle mission. Jemison was a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments, one of 43 investigations that were done on STS-47. Jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members. [...] "The first thing I saw from space was Chicago, my hometown," [...] said Jemison. [...] "I was working on the middeck where there aren't many windows, and as we passed over Chicago, the commander called me up to the flight deck. It was such a significant moment because since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> I had always assumed I would go into space," [...] Jemison added. Despite NASA's rigid protocol, Jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a Trekkie could appreciate. [...] "Hailing frequencies open," [...] she could be heard repeating throughout the eight-day mission.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
