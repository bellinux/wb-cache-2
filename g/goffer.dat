6000|$|The climax came at {{six o'clock}} of that eventful afternoon, at the hour when I, with the newly-enthroned Mme. Ratichon on my arm, {{was about to take}} leave of M. Goldberg. I must admit that at that moment my heart was {{overflowing}} with bitterness. I had been led like a lamb to the slaughter; I had been made to look foolish and absurd {{in the midst of this}} Israelite community which I despised; I was saddled for the rest of my life with an unprepossessing elderly wife, who could do naught for me but share the penury, the hard crusts, the onion pies with me and Theodore. The only advantage I might ever derive from her was that she would darn my stockings, sew the buttons on my vests, and <b>goffer</b> the frills of my shirts! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{elaborate}} use of lace {{in costume}} was, of course, largely {{stimulated by the}} fashion of wearing ruffs, and their companion cuffs or sleeves. Catherine de Medicis induced one Frederic Vinciolo to come from Italy and make ruffs and gadrooned collars, the fashion of which she started in France; and Henry III. was so punctilious over his ruffs that he would iron and <b>goffer</b> his cuffs and collars himself rather than see their pleats limp and out of shape. The pattern-books also gave a great impulse to the art. M. Lefebure mentions German books with patterns of eagles, heraldic emblems, hunting scenes, and plants and leaves belonging to Northern vegetation; and Italian books, in which the motifs consist of oleander blossoms, and elegant wreaths and scrolls, landscapes with mythological scenes, and hunting episodes, less realistic than the Northern ones, in which appear fauns, and nymphs or amorini shooting arrows. With regard to these patterns, M. Lefebure notices a curious fact. The oldest painting in which lace is depicted {{is that of a}} lady, by Carpaccio, who died about 1523. The cuffs of the lady are edged with a narrow lace, the pattern of which reappears in Vecellio's Corona, a book not published until 1591. This particular pattern was, therefore, in use at least eighty years before it got into circulation with other published patterns.|$|E

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} hedge against the inherent uncertainty of renewable generation is to equip the renewable plants with energy storage systems. This paper focuses on designing profit maximization offering strategies, i. e., the strategies that determine the offering price and volume, for a storage-assisted renewable power producer that participates in hour-ahead electricity market. Designing the strategies is challenging since (i) {{the underlying problem}} is coupled across time due {{to the evolution of}} the storage level, and (ii) inputs to the problem including the renewable output and market clearing price are unknown when submitting offers. Following the competitive online algorithm design approach, we first study a basic setting where the renewable output and the clearing price are known for the next hour. We propose sOffer, a simple online offering strategy that achieves the best possible competitive ratio of O(log θ), where θ is the ratio between the maximum and the minimum clearing prices. Then, we consider the case where the clearing price is unknown. By exploiting the idea of submitting multiple offers to combat price uncertainty, we propose mOffer, and demonstrate that the competitive ratio of mOffer converges to that of sOffer as the number of offers grows. Finally, we extend our approach to the scenario where the renewable output has forecasting error. We propose <b>gOffer</b> as the generalized offering strategy and characterize its competitive ratio {{as a function of the}} forecasting error. Our trace-driven experiments demonstrate that our algorithms achieve performance close to the offline optimal and outperform a baseline alternative significantly...|$|E

5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the <b>goffered</b> pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child.

50|$|The town grew at the {{crossing}} of two ancient thoroughfares, Ermine Street and the Icknield Way (cum Ashwell Street); the former was created after the Roman conquest, while the Icknield Way {{has long been}} accepted as a prehistoric routeway. The roads are sometimes called military roads as they were prepared or improved by Roman soldiers to facilitate access to the hinterland of Roman Britain. The modern equivalent to Icknield Way is the A505, which bypasses the town to the north. The A10 follows the alignment of Ermine Street south of the town, but diverts before it reaches the crossroads. The A1198, known as the Old North Road follows the alignment of Ermine Street northwards. Barrows on <b>Goffers</b> Knoll and Therfield Heath are evidence of prehistoric settlement.|$|R

50|$|From the {{fundamental}} {{theme of the}} Face (The National Art Museum, 1999) until the anonymous multitude of the silhouettes of the Metropolis (The Shadows of the Present, Simeza, 2004), the painter meditates (approaching the face schematically and in series) on the entire magma of emotions and anxieties that haunt the human condition nowadays, evolving towards the depersonalisation of all the nets and towards the consumist reification. This existentialist pithy message is embodied in Florica’s painting exactly in the rind, the leather, the scales, the scars, the imprints and the crust of the tones of white, grey, black and ochre of the wrapping cardboard. Her images do not become simpler from a cycle to another. They become poli-matters reliefs, with cassetons, with the zigzag rhythms of the <b>goffered</b> cardboard, with fields of numbers with schematized eyes and palms, with interweavings and garlands of paper bands or painted cloth. Therefore, the artist neither performs in narrative scripts, nor composes after effects of rhetoric of the proper abstract image.|$|R

Of the mushroom look, she added: [...] "This may be small and snugly rounded, like the little pink Champignon de Paris (Chabeau makes one of these in fine straw with a <b>goffered</b> frill of organdy under the brim that somehow carries the model away back {{to the source of}} its inspiration)...or it is wide and gently curving at the brim like the larger and flatter field variety.

50|$|The road {{continues}} as single carriageway roughly north-easterly, following the ancient Icknield Way past <b>Goffers</b> knoll and {{passing through the}} hamlet of Flint Cross and over the Anglo-Saxon earthwork Bran Ditch. It enters the village of Duxford and passes the Imperial War Museum Duxford. The road crosses the M11 at Junction 10 - southbound leading to Bishop's Stortford, Stansted Airport, Harlow and London, but is just signposted for London and Airport. Northbound is signposted to The Midlands with Cambridge and A14. It also leads to Huntingdon and the A10. Icknield Way bears off north to join the A11 whilst the A505 continues forward to Whittlesford, then another roundabout with a service station (BP) and the A1301, northbound to Sawston, The Shelfords and Cambridge, the southbound route goes to Saffron Walden and the Historic Chesterfords where the Icknield Way once ran. Saffron Walden would be signposted from the M11 previously, {{as there is a}} restricted Junction at M11 Junction 9. The A505 serves as an access route to the A11 to those from the North, though another alternative would be to use the A14 if coming from the north, to access routes to Thetford and Newmarket.|$|R
40|$|Growing the {{epitaxial}} layers {{that contain}} the aluminium or indium has its specific features. So, the epitaxial layers prepared {{using the method}} of liquid-phase epitaxy at high (0. 1 to 0. 2 at. %) contents of a replacing element can possess a phase non-uniform boundary interface or <b>goffered</b> surface. Height of peaks can run from 2 up to 15 μm in them. The results of researches of diode structures based on epitaxial layers obtained by a combined method are represented in this work. The difference of the used method {{is that in the}} beginning growth of a layer goes as that under compulsory cooling, and further as the combined one. So, the melt will be combined due to the solid phase from the epitaxial layer, after admission of the first portion of a solution-melt onto the substrate when cooling the system and another part of the solution-melt will become saturated. In the beginning, the layer grows due to isothermal epitaxy caused by mixing the first and second portions of melts when feeding the next discrete portion of the solution-melt, onto the previous one. After their composition equalization, there takes place a growth caused by compulsory cooling. This way to grow the epitaxial layers can be considered as delta-thermal liquid-phase epitaxy in the multistage process.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of raglan, semi raglan, kimono, and dropped shoulder sleeves {{are made on}} {{one and the same}} constructional bases. In the constructional base the front and back in the underarm there are parts which have to be set to the both - the bodice and the sleeve. For the front and the back that is possible if the sleeve and a part of the bodice are separated by a design constructional seam. The type and design of the sleeve depends by the directions of the design constructional seam. If the seam joins the underarm and the neckline, or area around the neckline the type of sleeve is raglan. If the seam connects the underarm and the shoulder the type of sleeve is semi raglan. The type of the sleeve is kimono if the design constructional seam divides the bodice or the sleeve. In the dropped shoulder sleeve design constructional seam is located under the shoulder. The use of the main design principles, the possibilities for combinations between the four types of sleeves and the design with application of 3 D elements are investigated. Raglan, semi raglan, kimono and dropped shoulder sleeves can be combined each other. In combined sleeves only one of seams which define the types of the sleeves is with decorative constructional function. The other ones have only decorative function. Design constructional seams which define the types of the sleeves can be used as contours of location or fixation of all types of 3 D elements: pleats, <b>goffers,</b> flounces, tucks gathers, and draperies. The results of the investigation of application of the main design principles, combinations between different types of sleeves and possibility for the use of 3 D elements facilitate the process of fashion design and pattern making and gives opportunity for variety of models...|$|R
