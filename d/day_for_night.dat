5|$|On March 25, 2014, Corgan {{announced}} he {{had signed a}} new record deal with BMG, for two new albums, titled Monuments to an Elegy and <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>Night,</b> respectively. In June, {{it was revealed that}} Mike Byrne was no longer in the band, to be replaced by Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe on the new album, and Fiorentino would not be recording on the album either. Monuments to an Elegy was released on December 5, 2014, to generally positive reviews. The band toured in support of the album starting on November 26, with Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk filling in on drums and The Killers' Mark Stoermer filling in on bass. The follow-up album, which will no longer be titled <b>Day</b> <b>For</b> <b>Night,</b> was pushed back to a late 2015 or early 2016 release as the band continued to tour.|$|E
5|$|Val Guest, who had {{directed}} The Quatermass Xperiment, returned for Quatermass 2. Guest once again sought {{to create a}} film that felt as real as possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>night</b> photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day’s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots {{he wanted to make}} that day.|$|E

25|$|Truffaut's {{other films}} were from {{original}} screenplays, often co-written by the screenwriters Suzanne Schiffman or Jean Gruault.

Truffaut plays the director of the fictional film being made. This film features scenes shown in his previous films. It is considered to be his best film since his earliest work.

500|$|The {{majority}} of the special effects were done by Industrial Light & Magic. Salvation {{was one of the}} last films that Stan Winston, the visual effects supervisor on the first three films, worked on. He died on June 15, 2008, from multiple myeloma, and McG dedicated the film to him in the end credits. John Rosengrant and Charlie Gibson replaced Winston, and McG commented that they are [...] "trying to achieve something that's never been done before" [...] and [...] "push the envelope". Asylum Visual Effects created digital plates, Marcus' endoskeleton, and a digital T-600. Rising Sun Pictures did the digital correction of <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>night</b> scenes, the destruction of the submarine and Marcus' robot hand.|$|E
500|$|The second episode's climax was {{originally}} {{to take place}} in an actual cemetery, but problems at the potential filming locations prohibited this. The scene takes place at night, which, at that time of year, only lasts for nine and a half hours in Vancouver. With only four nights to film the sequence, production {{came up with the idea}} of having a [...] "supernatural solar eclipse" [...] so that the scenes could be shot <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>night.</b> However, the first filming location did not have trees, which were needed for the filming technique to work. After eventually finding a cemetery that did have trees, a rain storm during inspection forced the production team to realize that weather would interfere with the filming. It was decided at the last minute to film on a sound stage, and a cemetery set was constructed. However, the bark mulch used for the set had to contain manure, making it very rancid.

Yasujirō Ozu said it was his favorite non-Japanese film and was impressed by its techniques. François Truffaut said that the film [...] "has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout the world than any other" [...] and recognized its influence in The Barefoot Contessa, Les Mauvaises Rencontres, Lola Montès, and 8 1/2. Truffaut's <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>Night</b> pays tribute to the film in a dream sequence depicting a childhood memory of the character played by Truffaut stealing publicity photos from the film. Numerous film {{directors have}} cited the film as influential on their own films, including Theo Angelopoulos, Luc Besson, the Coen brothers, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, John Frankenheimer, Stephen Frears, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese, Bryan Singer and Steven Spielberg. Ingmar Bergman disliked the film and called it [...] "a total bore. Above all, the performances are worthless. The amount of respect that movie has is absolutely unbelievable!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The lukewarm {{response}} to Monuments to an Elegy caused Corgan {{to change his}} plans for <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>Night.</b> The critic's reviews of Monuments to an Elegy, which holds a rating of 70/100 at Metacritic based on 31 reviews, were criticized by Corgan for being [...] "middling, muddling" [...] reviews and not offering a [...] "fair" [...] evaluation of the album, while also admitting he didn't even read any of the reviews. Corgan said: [...] "I thought for sure I would get really strong reviews for our new album , based on all the feedback I was getting. But I'm getting the same reviews I {{got back in the}} day, these kind of middling, muddling reviews that just won't fucking say: 'This is a fucking brilliant album from a brilliant artist,'" [...] and also elaborated that, [...] "It's not a three-star fucking record. Nobody believes it's a three-star record. Nobody! OK, these people obviously did, so maybe I shouldn't be so absolute. But I've been in this business for 25 years and there is nobody in it who believes this is a three-star record. Nobody!" [...] The original plan was for Monuments to an Elegy to be a pop/rock album and then be followed by an experimental [...] "weird, arty" [...] album, <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>Night.</b> However, the {{response to}} Monuments to an Elegy caused him to re-evaluate the <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>Night</b> demos and decided that, [...] "The Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't be an arty band anymore," [...] and elaborated, [...] "Monuments is me solving a problem of how to get The Smashing Pumpkins back into the mainstream. I had to solve that problem before I can solve problem two, which is where <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>Night</b> comes in. That's why I'd thought 'I'll do the thing I should do, then I'll do the thing I want to do.' But now what I want to do is kick people out of the way." [...] Corgan later revealed that the follow up to Monuments to an Elegy would no longer to be titled <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>Night.</b>|$|E

[...] Truffaut filled out the cast with Jean Dasté as Davenne's boss at The Globe, Antoine Vitez as a clergyman, Jean-Pierre Moulin as a widower that Davenne comforts in the film and Patrick Maléon as the {{deaf-mute}} child. Truffaut also cast technicians and personnel from his production company in small roles.|$|E
