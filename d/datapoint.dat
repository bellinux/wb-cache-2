2500|$|Rackspace {{entered the}} picture again in 2007. The company was rapidly {{outgrowing}} its newly leased corporate headquarters, {{which were in}} a building formerly used by <b>Datapoint</b> on the northwest side of San Antonio; seeking even more space, Rackspace bought the mall for $27 million. As part of its acquisition of Windsor Park, the city boundaries of San Antonio were modified to place [...] of land, including the former mall, into the suburb of Windcrest; that city had lost $100,000 in taxes each year since the mall's closure in 2005. Rackspace hired architect and urban planner Andrés Duany and renovated the former mall (now known as [...] "The Castle") for more than $100 million, having received a $22 million grant {{from the state of}} Texas. Renovations also added environmentally friendly features such as a rainwater cistern and dual flush toilets; in 2009, The Castle received LEED Gold certification. By 2012, 3,200 employees worked at the former mall site. The redevelopment of Windsor Park has attracted retail and multi-family residential development geared to the higher incomes of Rackspace employees (on average $69,000 a year, compared to $37,000 a year, the local average), and Rackspace is developing a neighborhood park around the site.|$|E

40|$|Large datasets, such as pixels and voxels in 2 D and 3 D {{images can}} usually be reduced during their {{processing}} to smaller subsets with less <b>datapoints.</b> Such subsets can be the objects in the image, features-edges or corners- or more general, regions of interest. For instance, the transformation from a set of <b>datapoints</b> representing an image, {{to one or more}} subsets of <b>datapoints</b> representing objects in the image, is due to a segmentation algorithm and may involve both the selection of <b>datapoints</b> as well as a change in datastructure. The massive number of pixels in the original image, points to a data parallel approach, whereas the processing of the various objects in the image is more suitable for task parallelism. In this paper we introduce a framework for parallel image processing and we focus on an array of buckets that can be distributed over a number of processors and that contains pointers to the data from the dataset. The benefit of this approach is that the processor activity remains focussed on the <b>datapoints</b> that need processing and, moreover, that the load can be distributed over many processors, even in a heterogeneous computer architecture. Although the method is generally applicable in the processing of sets, in this paper we obtain our examples from the domain of image processing. As this method yields speed-ups that are data-dependent, we derived a run-time evaluation that is able to determine if the use of distributed buckets is beneficial...|$|R

50|$|Released in June 1970, the {{programmable}} terminal called the <b>Datapoint</b> 2200 is {{the earliest known}} device that bears some significant resemblance to the modern personal computer, with a screen, keyboard, and program storage. It was made by CTC (now known as <b>Datapoint)</b> and was a complete system in a small case bearing the approximate footprint of an IBM Selectric typewriter. The system's CPU was constructed {{from a variety of}} discrete components, although the company had commissioned Intel to develop a single-chip processing unit; there was a falling out between CTC and Intel, and the chip Intel had developed wasn't used. Intel soon released a modified version of that chip as the Intel 8008, the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. The needs and requirements of the <b>Datapoint</b> 2200 therefore determined the nature of the 8008, upon which all successive processors used in IBM-compatible PCs were based. Additionally, the design of the <b>Datapoint</b> 2200's multi-chip CPU and the final design of the Intel 8008 were so similar that the two are largely software-compatible; therefore, the <b>Datapoint</b> 2200, from a practical perspective, functioned as if it were indeed powered by an 8008, making it a de facto microcomputer.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978 Inforex filed {{bankruptcy}} due to {{the inability}} to market the 5000 and 7000 product lines profitably. They were eventually purchased by <b>Datapoint.</b> However, <b>Datapoint</b> ran into financial hardships in 1985 and sold the company to Recognition Equipment in Dallas, who had a competitive product and converted Inforex's customers to that product. In 1988 Inforex's headquarters were closed.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, <b>Datapoint</b> ranked as a Fortune 500 company. Lead times were {{extending}} rapidly as demand for <b>Datapoint</b> products increased, leading to delivery delays and unhappy customers. Pressure to increase sales {{led to some}} questionable orders being accepted. Compounding this, many of the orders were simply placed to guarantee availability of the product at a future point when {{it was expected that}} actual orders would be in place. When these actual orders never materialized, the excess capacity and inventories initiated a financial collapse. Additionally, some of the actual customers went broke before paying their bills due to the general business slowdown. Such factors forced <b>Datapoint</b> to reverse sales or to record substantial bad debts, which caused the company to lose $800 million of its market capitalization in {{a matter of a few}} months in early 1982. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered <b>Datapoint</b> to stop this practice.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in [8, 9], the SVM-SGD algorithm quickly converges to the optimal solution {{due to the}} fact that the unconstrained problem (5) is convex games on very large datasets.

50|$|Subrandom {{numbers have}} an {{advantage}} over pure random numbers in that they cover the domain of interest quickly and evenly.

On the other hand, subrandom sets can have a significant lower discrepancy for a given number of points than subrandom sequences.|$|R
