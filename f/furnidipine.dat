The phase solubility profile was classified as A(L) -type, indicating the formation of 1 : 1 stoichiometric inclusion complex of <b>furnidipine</b> with beta-CyD. Based on the spectrophotometric absorbance's variations, a formation constant value, K-f, of 156 M(- 1) was determined. Electrochemical measurements using chronocoulometric experiments {{were used for the}} determination of the diffusion coefficients. In absence of beta-CyD, a diffusion coefficient value of 4. 32 x 10 (- 6) cm(2) s(- 1) was obtained for <b>furnidipine.</b> The addition of beta-CyD produced a decrease of 30 % for the diffusion coefficient.

40|$|AbstractPotassium-stimulated {{catecholamine}} {{release from}} superfused bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (70 mM K+ {{in the presence}} of 2 mM Ca 2 + for 10 s, applied at 5 -min intervals) was inhibited by the dihydropyridine <b>furnidipine</b> (3 μM) by 50 %. ω-Conotoxin MVIIC (CTx-MVIIC, 3 μM) also reduced the secretory response by about half. Combined CTx-MVIIC plus <b>furnidipine</b> blocked 100 % catecholamine release. 45 Ca 2 + uptake and cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations ([Ca 2 +]i) in K+-depolarized cells were partially blocked by <b>furnidipine</b> or CTx-MVIIC, and completely inhibited by both agents. The whole cell current through Ca 2 + channels carried by Ba 2 + (IBa) was partially blocked by CTx-MVIIC. Although ω-conotoxin GVIA (CTx-GVIA, 1 μM) and ω-agatoxin IVA (Aga-IVA, 0. 2 μM) partially inhibited 45 Ca 2 + entry, IBa and the increase in [Ca 2 +]i, the combination of both toxins did not affect the K+-evoked secretory response. The results are compatible with the presence in bovine chromaffin cells of a Q-like Ca 2 + channel which has a prominent role in controlling exocytosis. They also suggest that Q- and L-type Ca 2 + channels, but not N- or P-types are localized near exocytotic active sites in the plasmalemma...|$|E

40|$|Incubation of bovine adrenal chromaffin {{cells in}} high K+ (38 mM) during 24 - 48 h {{enhanced}} 2. 5 {{to five times}} the expression of SNAP- 25 protein and mRNA, respectively. This increase was reduced 86 % by <b>furnidipine</b> 9 (an L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker) but was unaffected by either w-conotoxin GVIA (an N-type Ca 2 + channel blocker) or w-agatoxin IVA (a P/Q-type Ca 2 + channel blocker). Combined blockade of N and P/Q channels with w-conotoxin MVIIC did, however, block by 76 % the protein expression. The inhibitory effects of <b>furnidipine</b> were partially reversed when the external Ca 2 + concentration was raised from 1. 6 to 5 mM. These findings, together {{with the fact that}} nicotinic receptor activation or Ca 2 + release from internal stores also enhanced SNAP- 25 protein expression, suggest that an increment of cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +],), rather than its source or Ca 2 + entry pathway, is the critical signal to induce the protein expression, The greater coupling between L-type Ca 2 + channels and protein expression might be due to two facts: (a) L channels contributed 50 % to the global [Ca 2 +], rise induced by 38 mM K+ in indo- 1 -loaded chromaffin cells and (b) L channels undergo less inactivation than N or P/Q channels on sustained stimulation of these cells...|$|E
30|$|Nimodipine (NIMB), a {{dihydropyridine}} {{calcium channel}} antagonist, has potent vasodilatory effect on cerebral vessels and increases cerebral blood flow. Nimodipine, in high doses (2 to 10 mg/kg), {{has been shown}} to improve memory retention and/or memory recall process in aged rats. The Food and Drug Administration has classified the side effects into groups based on dose levels given every 4 h. For the high dosage group (90 mg), less than 1 % of the group experienced adverse conditions including itching, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, neurological deterioration, vomiting, diaphoresis, congestive heart failure, hyponatremia, decreasing platelet count, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and deep vein thrombosis. The electrochemical reduction of 4 -nitrophenyl- 1, 4 -dihydropyridine compounds such as nifedipine, nitrendipine, nimodipine, nicardipine, and <b>furnidipine</b> in protic media [17] follows the general pattern of nitroaromatic compounds involving a single four-electron step producing the hydroxylamine derivative. However, the electrochemical reduction of nitrendipine, nimodipine, and nifedipine in mixed aqueous-DMF media resulted in the generation of the one-electron reduction product, the nitro radical anion [18].|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{established that}} <b>furnidipine</b> (FUR) and oxy dihydropyridines prevent rats mortality by strong {{reduction of the}} lethal arrhythmias in reperfusion. Therefore we decided to study the influence of three main metabolites (M- 2, M- 3, M- 8) of FUR on ischemia-and reperfusion- induced arrhythmias and hemodynamic parameters in rat model to examine their independent activity. The metabolites (M- 2, M- 3, M- 8) were given orally 20 mg/kg (24 and 1 h before ischemia). Mortality was significantly diminished in M- 2 and M- 3 treated groups with M- 3 preventing animal mortality entirely. All three examined substances significantly reduced the duration and incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) with M- 3, once again, completely preventing VF. Moreover, only M- 3 significantly decreased the duration of ventricular tachycardia but had no influence on their incidence. Through the occlusion and reperfusion periods, M- 2 and M- 3 were markedly less hypotensive than M- 8 and did not influence on heart rate. We conclude that two tested metabolites of FUR, M- 3 and M- 2 exhibited the most pronounced anti-arrhythmic effect being {{at the same time}} the most normotensive and therefore caused the most beneficial effects...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the reaction of}} a large series of pharmacologically significant 1, 4 -dihydropyridine (1, 4 -DHP) compounds with superoxide (O- 2 (. -)) in dimethylsulfoxide using differential pulse voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis. Methods. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to track the consumption of O- 2 (. -), and controlled potential electrolysis was used to electrogenerate O- 2 (. -). Results. With the addition of 1, 4 -DHP, the oxidation peak current of O- 2 (. -) decreased concentration dependently, suggesting that 1, 4 -DHP reacts with O- 2 (. -), that is, 1, 4 -DHP scavenges O- 2 (. -) in dimethylsulfoxide. Conclusions. A very easy and direct voltammetric procedure to study the relative reactivity of different 1, 4 -DHP with O- 2 (. -) is proposed. Using the proposed method {{we have found that}} all commercial 1, 4 DHP reacts with O- 2 (. -). The following order of rates was obtained: felodipine {{greater than or equal to}} vitamin E > isradipine > nimodipine > <b>furnidipine</b> > nitrendipine > nisoldipine > nifedipine. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the hydrogen at the N-position of 1, 4 -DHP compounds could be released as a proton in the presence of O- 2 (. -), thus the electrogenerated O- 2. - worked as a proton acceptor to 1, 4 -DHP...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación SciELOWe {{report a}} voltammetric study of several nitroaromatic {{compounds}} {{such as the}} drugs: Nifedipine, Nitrendipine, <b>Furnidipine</b> and Nisoldipine in multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) modified electrodes. All the compounds are strongly encapsulated in the three dimensional structure of the MWCNT and then reduced to the corresponding hydroxylamine derivatives. In {{the case of the}} modified electrode with MWCNT the answer in current are remarkably increased (approximately 40 times). This current multiplier effect is due to the nitro compounds are not only superficially adsorbed but this really encapsulated in the nanotube network covering the GCE. The nitro reduction peak was linearly dependent with the concentration of the nitroaromatic compound with detection limit (LOD) of 1. 2 ∙ 10 - 8 mol∙L- 1 and a quantification limits (LOQ) of 3. 9 ∙ 10 - 8 mol∙L- 1 for the case of Nitrendipine. All the studied nitrocompounds followed equivalents behaviours. Obviously from this result it is possible to postulate this technology as a very useful tool to develop analytical methods to determine these nitroaromatic drugs in real samples such as biological fluids. From the obtained results it is possible to conclude that for the studied 1, 4 -dihydropyridine- 4 -nitrobenzene substituted compounds a greater difficulty of reduction implies a greater ability to encapsulation.

40|$|Rat α 3 β 4 or α 7 {{neuronal}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) {{were expressed}} in Xenopus laevis oocytes, {{and the effects}} of various toxins and non-toxin Ca 2 + channel blockers studied. Nicotinic AChR currents were elicited by 1 [*]s pulses of dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP, 100 [*]μM) applied at regular intervals. The N/P/Q-type Ca 2 + channel blocker ω-conotoxin MVIIC inhibited α 3 β 4 currents with an IC 50 of 1. 3 [*]μM; the blockade was non-competitive and reversible. The α 7 currents were unaffected. At 1 [*]μM, ω-conotoxin GVIA (N-type Ca 2 + channel blocker) inhibited by 24 and 20 % α 3 β 4 and α 7 currents, respectively. At 1 [*]μM, ω-agatoxin IVA (a P/Q-type Ca 2 + channel blocker) did not affect α 7 currents and inhibited α 3 β 4 currents by only 15 %. L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers <b>furnidipine,</b> verapamil and, particularly, diltiazem exhibited a preferential blocking activity on α 3 β 4 nicotinic AChRs. The mechanism of α 3 β 4 currents blockade by ω-conotoxins and diltiazem differed in the following aspects: (i) the onset and reversal of the blockade was faster for toxins; (ii) the blockade by the peptides was voltage-dependent, while that exerted by diltiazem was not; (iii) diltiazem promoted the inactivation of the current while ω-toxins did not. These data show that, at concentrations currently employed as Ca 2 + channel blockers, some of these compounds also inhibit certain subtypes of nicotinic AChR currents. Our data calls for caution when interpreting many of the results obtained in neurons and other cell types, where nicotinic receptor and Ca 2 + channels coexist...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Our previous studies established cardio-pro-tective effects of <b>furnidipine</b> and its active metabolites called M- 2 and M- 3. The aim of current {{research was to}} compare the effects of single oral pretreatment with 20 mg kg- 1 of M- 2 and M- 3 on mortality, different forms of arrhythmias, blood pressures parameters and ST-seg-ment changes during occlusion (for 90 min) and reperfu-sion in the model of myocardial infarction in rats evoked by left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Additionally, the development of programmed cell death and biochemical parameters in blood serum were studied at 4 th day after infarction. Furnidipines ’ metabolites effec-tively reduced mortality index while did not markedly influence on blood pressures parameters, arrhythmias, ST-segment changes as well as biochemical parameters. Intriguingly, programmed cell death study (TUNEL) showed distinct increase {{in the amount of}} apoptotic nuclei in post-infarcted myocardium, granulation tissue and what is more in arteriolar walls after M- 2 and M- 3 application. Moreover, M- 2 {{turned out to be more}} powerful in stimu-lation of apoptosis in granulation tissue surrounding infarcted area whereas M- 3 presented balanced profile in this matter. Taking into account that programmed cell death plays positive role in post-infarcted heart healing, M- 2 presents itself as more attractive agent for oral pre-treatment in early stages of ischemia by non-stable indi-viduals due to its more specific action in stimulation repairing processes in granulation tissue as well as in arteriolar walls. While M- 2 and M- 3 are common metabolites present in degradation pathways of many widely used dihydropyridines in clinic, this key fact put the new outlook on understanding additional mechanism and effects of not only furnidipines ’ metabolites but also other dihydropyridines...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to reassess {{the set of}} voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel subtypes expressed by bovine adrenal chromaffin cells maintained in primary cultures. Previous views on the pharmacology of such channels had to be revised {{in the light of}} the novel data which arose from the use in this study of low and high micromolar concentrations of omega-agatoxin IVA, and low (2 mM) and high (10 mM) concentrations of the charge carrier Ba 2 +. Whole-cell Ba 2 + currents (IBa) through Ca 2 + channels were elicited in voltage-clamped chromaffin cells, with a holding potential of - 80 mV and depolarising pulses to 0 mV. Mean peak IBa was 425 pA in 2 mM Ba 2 + (59 cells) and 787 pA in 10 mM Ba 2 + (42 cells). In 2 mM Ba 2 +, omega-conotoxin MVIIC (3 microM) inhibited IBa by 79 %; in 10 mM Ba 2 +, the blockade developed much more slowly and reached only 44 %. A low concentration of omega-agatoxin IVA (20 nM) inhibited IBa by 9 %; 2 microM inhibited IBa by 60 %. This blockade was similar in low and high Ba 2 + concentrations. After giving <b>furnidipine</b> (3 microM) and omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM), 2 microM omega-agatoxin IVA inhibited the remaining current (about 40 - 45 %); this blockade was independent of the Ba 2 + concentration. The current could be fully blocked by the cocktail furnidipine/omega-conotoxin GVIA/high omega-agatoxin IVA, both in low and high Ba 2 + concentrations. The large Q-type channel component of IBa is blocked by micromolar concentrations of omega-agatoxin IVA and omega-conotoxin MVIIC. While solutions with a high Ba 2 + concentration strongly delayed the development of blockade by omega-conotoxin MVIIC, the blockade by high concentrations of omega-agatoxin IVA was equally effective in solutions with a low or a high Ba 2 + concentration. Hence, the use of appropriate Ba 2 + and toxin concentrations in this study reveals that P-type Ca 2 + channels are poorly expressed in bovine chromaffin cells; in contrast, a robust component of the current depends on Q-type Ca 2 + channels. An R-type residual current is not present in these cells...|$|E
