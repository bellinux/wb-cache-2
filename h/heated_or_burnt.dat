The action of the <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> cold on these materials may change their properties. This study aimed to evaluate the changes occurred in the surface roughness and Knoop microhardness of the dental restorative materials of freezing <b>or</b> <b>burnt</b> victims, supporting an adequate comparison with the antemortem data, helping on human identification process.|$|R
