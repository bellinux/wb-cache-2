5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E

Kratos encountered Midas in the Mounts of Aroania where the Spartan killed him by throwing {{him into a}} lava river — turning it to gold — which created a passage for Kratos. The character was voiced by Fred Tatasciore in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1993, Wallace's {{longtime}} girlfriend {{gave birth}} to his first child, T'yanna. Wallace had split with the girlfriend for some time before T'yanna's birth. Wallace wanted <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> complete her education, despite being {{a high school dropout}} himself. Wallace said that if his mother had promised him what he promised his daughter, everything she wanted, Wallace would have been not only a graduate but also {{at the top of his}} class. He continued selling drugs after the birth to support his daughter financially. Once Combs discovered this, he forced Wallace to quit.|$|E
5|$|Other {{witnesses}} for {{the plaintiffs}} included a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified {{that she had seen}} the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.|$|E

5|$|Pedro had {{formerly}} {{been the}} first Emperor of Brazil, as PedroI, and also King of Portugal, as PedroIV. He was succeeded on the Portuguese throne by his eldest daughter, MariaII, Maria Amélia's elder half-sister. The young Queen was the child of Pedro's first marriage to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria. In 1828, MariaII's crown was usurped by Dom MiguelI, Pedro's younger brother. Eager to restore <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> her throne, Pedro abdicated the Brazilian crown in April 1831 and departed for Europe with Amélie, who was pregnant with Maria Amélia.|$|E
5|$|Q'uq'umatz greatly {{expanded}} the K'iche' kingdom, first from Pismachi' and later from Q'umarkaj. At this time, the K'iche's were closely {{allied with the}} Kaqchikels. Q'uq'umatz sent <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> marry {{the lord of the}} K'oja, a Maya people based in the Cuchumatan mountains, somewhere between Sacapulas and Huehuetenango. Instead of marrying her and submitting to the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance, Tekum Sik'om, the K'oja king, killed the offered bride. This act initiated a war between the K'iche'-Kaqchikel of Q'umarkaj and the K'oja. Q'uq'umatz died in the resulting battle against the K'oja.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} {{scene of}} the wedding is not always depicted. Sometimes, only the principal participants are shown. Chola bronzes featuring only Shiva and Parvati {{as described in the}} wedding scene are found. South Indian sculptures, like those from Madurai, feature only the couple and Vishnu. In this configuration, Parvati is depicted in the centre with Vishnu on the left giving away her hand to Shiva on the right. Sometimes as in the Elephanta Caves, Parvati's biological father Himavan, instead of Vishnu, is depicted giving away <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> Shiva.|$|E

5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned {{with the reality of}} communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of his}} suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> Agrippa. This union {{produced}} five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also a}} measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5|$|Busch {{made contact}} with the artist {{association}} Jung München (Young Munich), met several notable Munich artists, and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung München newspaper. Kaspar Braun, who published the satirical newspapers Münchener Bilderbogen (Picture Sheets from Munich) and Fliegende Blätter (Flying Leaves), proposed a collaboration with Busch. This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live. An existing self-caricature suggests {{that at this time}} he had an intense relationship with a woman from Ammerland. His courtship with a seventeen-year-old merchant's daughter, Anna Richter, whom Busch met through his brother Gustav, ended in 1862. Busch's biographer, Diers, suggests that her father probably refused to entrust <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> an almost unknown artist without regular income.|$|E

5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, {{had taken over the}} last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women had virtually no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E
5|$|Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl {{was born}} in Germany on 22 August 1902. Her father, Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl, owned a {{successful}} heating and ventilation company and wanted <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> follow him into the business world. Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her {{to carry on the}} family name and secure the family fortune. However, her mother, Bertha Ida (Scherlach), who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's future was in show business. Riefenstahl had a younger brother, Heinz, who was killed at the age of 39 on the Eastern Front in Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> England {{the next year}} and declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Cooper was loaned out to MGM for the Civil War drama film Operator 13 with Marion Davies, about a {{beautiful}} Union spy who {{falls in love}} with a Confederate soldier. Despite Richard Boleslawski's imaginative direction and George J. Folsey's lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office. Back at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director Henry Hathaway, Now and Forever, with Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple. In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> the relatives who raised her, but is eventually won over by the adorable girl. Impressed by Temple's intelligence and charm, Cooper developed a close rapport with her, both on and off screen. The film was a box-office success.|$|E
5|$|Relative {{peace and}} {{stability}} prevailed for about eight years. Mindaugas used this opportunity {{to concentrate on the}} expansion to the east, and to establish and organize state institutions. He strengthened his influence in Black Ruthenia, in Polatsk, a major center of commerce in the Daugava River basin, and in Pinsk. He also negotiated a peace with Galicia–Volhynia, and married <b>his</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> Svarn, the son of Daniel of Galicia, who would later become Grand Duke of Lithuania. Lithuanian relationships with western Europe and the Holy See were reinforced. In 1255, Mindaugas received permission from Pope Alexander IV to crown his son as King of Lithuania. A noble court, an administrative system, and a diplomatic service were initiated. Silver long coins, an index of statehood, were issued. He sponsored the construction of a cathedral in Vilnius, possibly on the site of today's Vilnius Cathedral.|$|E
