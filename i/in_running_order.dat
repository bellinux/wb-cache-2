5|$|The Wheatcroft Collection, Leicestershire, UK. A private collector, Kevin Wheatcroft, {{is about}} to start a restoration/rebuild of a {{complete}} Tiger II. The project will include parts from many individual Tiger IIs, but many parts will be of new manufacture. Wheatcroft has stated that he has 70–80% of the original parts needed for a reconstruction and more parts are sourced continuously. Known and shown parts are a complete front glacis plate, 8.8 cm KwK 43 main armament, engine deck plates, approx. 1/3 hull (rear) in one part, a set of tracks, and approx. 2/3 of the left-side hull plate in two parts. The aim of the project is a complete Tiger II <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
25|$|Six {{of these}} engines survive, of which two were <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> and four in storage {{awaiting}} restoration.|$|E
25|$|The Model T {{employed}} some advanced technology, for example, {{its use of}} {{vanadium steel}} alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of materials engineering, and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.|$|E

25|$|These later, {{and much}} larger, {{compound}} Mallet locomotives were built by Ansaldo in Genova in 1938 to largely replace the earlier types, both the 440 Series and the unsuccessful 441 Series. The latter were simple locomotives (i.e., non-compound) and found liable {{to run out}} of steam on the heavy grades of the line. Four of them are still in existence of which three are <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} those bought from London Transport, which had been {{maintained}} by British Railways, were still <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> and were used on heritage railways with minimal work. No. 5764 (LT L95) was steamed the day it arrived at Bridgnorth on the Severn Valley Railway, being lit-up before it {{had been removed from}} the low-loader on which it was delivered. As of September 2014, Nos. 7752 (LT L94) and 5786 (LT L92) can be seen running in the maroon livery of London Transport, but No. 7715 (LT L99) is out of service.|$|E
25|$|The former council (325) {{was held}} in repute {{throughout}} the West, where its canons were in vigour together with those of Sardica, the complement of the anti-Arian legislation of Nicæa, and whose decrees had been drawn up originally in both Latin and Greek. The canons of the two councils were numbered <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order,</b> {{as though they were}} the work of but one council (a trait met with in divers Latin collections), which explains why the Council of Sardica is sometimes called œcumenical by earlier writers, and its canons attributed to the Council of Nicæa. The oldest versions of these canons quoted in the papal decretals are no longer extant.|$|E
2500|$|Since Norway {{was not one}} of the [...] "Big Four" [...] and was not {{the host}} of the 2009 contest, it was {{required}} to compete in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009. Alexander Rybak performed for Norway sixth <b>in</b> the <b>running</b> <b>order,</b> following Poland and preceding Cyprus, and secured a spot in the final on 16 May 2009. He performed 20th <b>in</b> the <b>running</b> <b>order,</b> following Albania and preceding Ukraine.|$|R

25|$|The German records {{after the}} Battle for the 28 October reveal the three {{divisions}} most affected, 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer and Littorio, were 271 tanks {{down on the}} total with which they had started the battle on the 23 October. This figure includes tanks out of action through mechanical failure {{as well as through}} mines or other battle damage, but by this time repairs and replacements were hardly keeping pace with daily losses. The surviving enemy tank states indicate that from the 28th to the 31st the two German divisions found it difficult to muster 100 tanks <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> between them, while Littorio had between 30 and 40.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Flyer was reconstructed at Seattle, renamed Washington {{and called}} {{up by the}} Navy for wartime service. By this time she had steamed over two million miles. After war service, she was {{returned}} to the Puget Sound Navigation Co. and maintained as a spare boat. She was also used for special excursions for about ten years. Despite the official change of name, apparently done to forestall rumors of unseaworthiness, the Washington continued to be known to her patrons as the Flyer. Every steamboat had a distinctive whistle, and people on the water or ashore knew by sound what vessel was near {{by the sound of}} the whistle. The Flyers whistle was preserved, and is now mounted on the only surviving Puget Sound wooden steamer, the Virginia V. Flyers compound steam engine was still <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Advantages of {{long-term}} use include rider {{familiarity with the}} bicycle and a mode of travel that is always nearby and instantly ready for use. The bicycle can be checked out like a library book, a liability waiver can be collected at check-out, and the bike can be returned any time. A Library Bike in a person's possession can be chosen for some trips instead of a car, thus lowering car usage. The long-term rental system generally results in fewer repair costs to the scheme administrator, as riders are incentivised to obtain minor maintenance {{in order to keep}} the bike <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> during the long rental period. Most of the long-term systems implemented to date are funded solely through charitable donations of second-hand bicycles, using unpaid volunteer labour to maintain, and administer the bicycle fleet. While reducing or eliminating the need for public funding, such a scheme imposes an outer limit to program expansion. The Arcata Bike Library, in California, has loaned over 4000 bicycles using this system.|$|E

500|$|... "One Tree Hill" [...] {{returned}} to live performances during The Joshua Tree Tour 2017, {{where it was}} played during the main set along with the entire Joshua Tree album <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order.</b> [...] The tour began in May 2017 and is scheduled to run through October 2017, with the band playing the full album at each concert. [...] Bono dedicated performances of the song to singer Chris Cornell, who died in May 2017, {{to the victims of}} the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, and to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Easton and Amos pump, a collection of steam and diesel engines with connections either to the area or to pumping have been assembled on site and regular steam days are held. The oldest item dates from the early 19th century, through to several Victorian engines and onward to the 20th century. These are housed in several different buildings and areas: the exhibition hall, the courtyard, the [...] "wiggly shed", the pump room and the engine house itself. Most of the machines are <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order,</b> although some are still awaiting restoration.|$|E
500|$|From {{their early}} days of {{spraying}} stencilled anti-war, anarchist, feminist and anti-consumerist graffiti messages in the London Underground and on billboards, Crass was involved in politically motivated direct action and musical activities. On 18 December 1982, the band helped co-ordinate a 24-hour squat in the empty west London Zig Zag club to prove [...] "that the underground punk scene could handle itself responsibly when it had to and that music really could be enjoyed free of the restraints imposed upon it by corporate industry". About 500 people attended; the bands playing (<b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order)</b> were Faction, D and V, Omega Tribe, Lack of Knowledge, Sleeping Dogs, the Apostles, Amebix, Null & Void, Soldiers of Fortune, the Mob, Polemic Attack, Poison Girls, Conflict, Flux of Pink Indians, Crass and DIRT.|$|E

500|$|During Reconstruction, Lewisville became home to Denton County's first cotton gin. Built in 1867, {{it could}} produce {{up to three}} bales per day. The Thirteenth Texas Legislature {{chartered}} the Dallas and Wichita Railroad (later the Missouri–Kansas–Texas) on terms requiring 20 miles of track to be <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> by July 1, 1875. Lewisville paid the company $15,000 {{to come to the}} city, with a promise of another $5,000 on completion. [...] The company fulfilled the deal by completing the railroad tracks to a point just south of Lewisville {{on the morning of the}} deadline, and the line began running full-time in 1881. Republicans in the Fourteenth Texas Legislature passed a law on April 30, 1874, prohibiting alcohol within two miles of the town. Many residents ignored the law, however, and the city retained as many as 17 saloons at one point. The population of the unincorporated town was 500 in 1888.|$|E
500|$|Lamplough {{held onto}} the J2X-C for a while, but {{eventually}} sold the car, which then {{passed through the}} hands of several owners before ending up in Canada. Although even conventional rivals such as the Toyota TS-010 were able to develop more downforce, the J2X-C {{was far from the}} end of its development, and various other companies had considered developing a similar style of car. Most manufacturers considered the radical bodywork just too great a risk, as Spice Engineering's lead designer, Graham Humphries, stated; [...] "With limited resources, it was decided instead to follow the more conventional route of further developing what we knew." [...] However, Le Mans Prototypes of the early 2000s and beyond, such as the Audi R8, the Lola B01/60 and the Lola B05/40 have all been said to use some of the lessons learned in the J2X-C. The J2X-C was, as of 2008, <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> having been fully restored, and ran in the 2007 Goodwood Festival of Speed, as part of the Group C 25th Anniversary celebration.|$|E

[...] The W2-class car was in {{continuous}} service in Melbourne for six decades before being purchased by MATA in 1986. [...] Matilda arrived in Portland, Oregon, by ship and was then trucked to Dallas. [...] Acquired <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order,</b> Matilda only required cosmetic modifications {{to give her a}} more North American appearance. [...] In 2008, the car was equipped with air-conditioning (eight roof-mounted units, powered by an inverter hidden under a seat).|$|E

2500|$|Although William Hedley is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} [...] "design" [...] of the locomotives, there is strong evidence that these issued from the aforementioned joint collaboration in which Christopher Blackett was the driving force with Timothy Hackworth playing a preponderant engineering role. Furthermore, it subsequently fell to Hackworth to maintain the locomotives <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> and improve performance. As time went on, Blackett became increasingly occupied by other outside interests and was often absent, leaving Hedley {{in charge of the}} mine; Hackworth found himself in conflictual situations due his Methodist activities and his refusal to work on the Sabbath, until he felt obliged to leave Wylam in 1816.|$|E
