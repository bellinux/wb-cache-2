5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal angina, digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), <b>hematuria</b> and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} on renal biopsy correlate with {{the severity of}} symptoms: those with asymptomatic <b>hematuria</b> may only have focal mesangial proliferation while those with proteinuria may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation. The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important prognostic factor in determining whether the patient will develop chronic renal disease.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (<b>hematuria</b> and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, <b>hematuria,</b> icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Bloody urine is termed <b>hematuria,</b> {{a symptom}} {{of a wide variety of}} medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|For {{an adult}} patient with {{isolated}} <b>hematuria,</b> tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and cystoscopy are usually done first {{to pinpoint the}} source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of <b>hematuria.</b> In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection can raise the suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic <b>hematuria</b> (i.e. without associated proteinuria and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A urinalysis will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. Proteinuria, usually less than 2grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated <b>hematuria</b> include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a hereditary disease associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{presentation}} (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic <b>hematuria,</b> {{which usually}} starts {{within a day}} or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic), as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross <b>hematuria</b> resolves after a few days, though microscopic <b>hematuria</b> may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides, although it can take many years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults.|$|E
25|$|Other false {{positive}} of high BAC and also blood reading {{are related to}} Patients with proteinuria and <b>hematuria,</b> due to kidney metabolization and failure.|$|E
25|$|Patients are {{referred}} to nephrology specialists after a urinalysis, for various reasons, such as acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, <b>hematuria,</b> proteinuria, kidney stones, hypertension, and disorders of acid/base or electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|In {{case reports}} of humans {{intentionally}} or accidentally ingesting {{high concentrations of}} copper salts (doses usually not known but reported to be 20–70nbsp&grams of copper), a progression of symptoms was observed including abdominal pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea, tachycardia, respiratory difficulty, hemolytic anemia, <b>hematuria,</b> massive gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, and death.|$|E
25|$|A smaller {{proportion}} (20-30%), {{usually the}} older population, have microscopic <b>hematuria</b> and proteinuria (less than 2 gram/day). These patients {{may not have}} any symptoms and are only clinically found if a physician decides to take a urine sample. Hence, the disease is more commonly diagnosed in situations where screening of urine is compulsory (e.g., schoolchildren in Japan).|$|E
25|$|Urinary tract infection*, {{specifically}} cystitis or bladder infection, {{is common}} in dogs and usually caused by bacteria. Signs include blood in the urine (<b>hematuria),</b> difficulty urinating (dysuria), and frequent urination (polyuria). The most common types of bacteria cultured from the urine of dogs with cystitis are E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.|$|E
25|$|Male gender, {{proteinuria}} (especially > 2 g/day), hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, older age, {{familial disease}} and elevated creatinine concentrations are markers {{of a poor}} outcome. Frank <b>hematuria</b> has shown discordant results with most studies showing a better prognosis, perhaps related to the early diagnosis, except for one group which reported a poorer prognosis. Proteinuria and hypertension are the most powerful prognostic factors in this group.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} of bothropic envenomation include immediate burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive {{swelling of the}} bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, ecchymosis, erythemia, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, melena, epistaxis, <b>hematuria,</b> intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure secondary to hypotension and bilateral cortical necrosis. There is usually some discoloration around the bite site, and rashes may develop on the torso or the extremities.|$|E
25|$|The {{red colour}} {{compound}} betanin is not broken {{down in the}} body, and in higher concentrations may temporarily cause urine or stools to assume a reddish colour, {{in the case of}} urine a condition called beeturia. Although harmless, this effect may cause initial concern due to the visual similarity to what appears to be blood in the stool, hematochezia (blood passing through the anus, usually in or with stool) or <b>hematuria</b> (blood in the urine).|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} clinical complication of scleroderma involving the kidney is scleroderma renal crisis. Symptoms of scleroderma renal crisis are malignant hypertension (high blood pressure {{with evidence of}} acute organ damage), hyperreninemia (high renin levels), azotemia (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells). Apart from the high blood pressure, <b>hematuria</b> (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be indicative.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{involvement}} {{leads to}} the symptoms of renal failure, which are non-specific but usually cause nausea, reduced appetite (anorexia), raised blood pressure (hypertension), and occasionally the various symptoms of electrolyte disturbance such as an irregular heartbeat. Some patients report <b>hematuria</b> (bloody urine) but this may only be detectable on microscopic examination of the urine. Increased amounts of protein in the urine may cause edema (swelling) of the skin (a combination of symptoms known as nephrotic syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Early {{prostate}} cancer usually has no clear symptoms. Sometimes, however, {{prostate cancer}} does cause symptoms, often {{similar to those}} of diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. These include frequent urination, nocturia (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, <b>hematuria</b> (blood in the urine), and dysuria (painful urination). A study based on the 1998 Patient Care Evaluation in the US found that about a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had one or more such symptoms, while two-thirds had no symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Between 60 and 80% of TSC {{patients}} have benign tumors (once thought hamartomatous, but now considered true neoplasms) of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas frequently causing <b>hematuria.</b> These tumors {{are composed of}} vascular (angio–), smooth muscle (–myo–), and fat (–lip-) tissue. Although benign, an angiomyolipoma larger than 4cm is at risk for a potentially catastrophic hemorrhage either spontaneously or with minimal trauma. Angiomyolipomas are found in about one in 300 people without TSC. However, those are usually solitary, whereas in TSC they are commonly multiple and bilateral.|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly {{progress to}} severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Hemorrhage causes bloody feces (melena) and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (<b>hematuria).</b>|$|E
25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include pain, oozing from the puncture wounds, local swelling that may increase {{for up to}} 36 hours, bruising that spreads from the bite site, blisters, numbness, mild fever, headache, bleeding from the nose and gums, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, <b>hematuria,</b> hypotension, nausea, vomiting, impaired consciousness and tenderness of the spleen. In untreated cases, local necrosis frequently occurs and may require amputation. In 12 fatal cases, {{the cause of death}} was sepsis (5), intracranial hemorrhage (3), acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis (2) and hemorrhagic shock (1).|$|E
25|$|The senior William Heberden first {{described}} {{the disease in}} 1801 in a 5-year-old child with abdominal pain, <b>hematuria,</b> hematochezia, and purpura of the legs. In 1837, Johann Lukas Schönlein described a syndrome of purpura associated with joint pain and urinary precipitates in children. Eduard Heinrich Henoch, a student of Schönlein's, further associated abdominal pain and renal involvement with the syndrome. In 1968, Jean Berger (1930–2011), a pioneering French nephrologist, with co-author, the electron microscopist Nicole Hinglais, {{was the first to}} describe IgA deposition in this form of glomerulonephritis and therefore it is sometimes called Berger’s disease.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects {{are the most}} striking. Hematemesis, melena, hemoptysis, <b>hematuria</b> and epistaxis also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop oliguria or anuria {{within a few hours}} to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute renal failure (ARF), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
25|$|STEC-HUS occurs after {{ingestion}} of {{a strain of}} bacteria expressing Shiga toxin(s), usually types of E. coli, that expresses verotoxin (also called Shiga-like toxin). E. coli can produce stx1 and/or stx2 Shiga toxins, the latter being more dangerous and {{a combination of both}} toxins in certain ratios is usually associated with HUS. These Shiga toxins bind GB3 receptors, globotriaosylceramide, which are present in renal tissue more than any other tissue and are also found in central nervous system neurons and other tissue. Children have more GB3 receptors than adults which may be why children are more susceptible to HUS. Cattle, swine, deer, and other mammals do not have GB3 receptors, but can be asymptomatic carriers of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria. Some humans can also be asymptomatic carriers. Once the bacteria colonizes, diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, typically follows. HUS develops about 5–10 days after onset of diarrhea, with decreased urine output (oliguria), blood in the urine (<b>hematuria),</b> kidney failure, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) and destruction of red blood cells (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia). Hypertension is common. In some cases, there are prominent neurologic changes.|$|E
25|$|Screening {{those who}} have neither {{symptoms}} nor risk factors for CKD is not recommended. Those who should be screened include: those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged > 60 years, subjects with indigenous racial origin, those {{with a history of}} kidney disease in the past and subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis. Screening should include calculation of estimated GFR from the serum creatinine level, and measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a first-morning urine specimen (this reflects the amount of a protein called albumin in the urine), as well as a urine dipstick screen for <b>hematuria.</b> The GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is derived from the serum creatinine and is proportional to 1/creatinine, i.e. it is a reciprocal relationship (the higher the creatinine, the lower the GFR). It reflects one aspect of kidney function: how efficiently the glomeruli (filtering units) work. But as they make up <5% of the mass of the kidney, the GFR does not indicate all aspects of kidney health and function. This can be done by combining the GFR level with the clinical assessment of the patient (especially fluid state) and measuring the levels of hemoglobin, potassium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Normal GFR is 90-120 mLs/min. The units of creatinine vary from country to country.|$|E
500|$|Purpura, {{arthritis}} and abdominal pain {{are known as}} the [...] "classic triad" [...] of Henoch–Schönlein purpura. Purpura occur in all cases, joint pains and arthritis in 80%, and abdominal pain in 62%. Some include gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a fourth criterion; this occurs in 33% of cases, sometimes, but not necessarily always, due to intussusception. The purpura typically appear on the legs and buttocks, but may also {{be seen on the}} arms, face and trunk. The abdominal pain is colicky in character, and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. There may be blood or mucus in the stools. The joints involved tend to be the ankles, knees, and elbows, but arthritis in the hands and feet is possible; the arthritis is nonerosive and hence causes no permanent deformity. Forty percent have evidence of kidney involvement, mainly in the form of <b>hematuria</b> (blood in the urine), but only a quarter will have this in sufficient quantities to be noticeable without laboratory tests. Problems in other organs, such as the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and lungs may occur, but is much less common than in the skin, bowel and kidneys.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with {{isolated}} <b>hematuria,</b> proteinuria < 1 g/day {{and normal}} renal function have a benign course and are generally just followed up annually. In cases where tonsillitis is the precipitating factor for episodic <b>hematuria,</b> tonsillectomy has been claimed {{to reduce the}} frequency of those episodes. [...] However, it does not {{reduce the incidence of}} progressive kidney failure. [...] Also, the natural history of the disease is such that episodes of frank <b>hematuria</b> reduce over time, independent of any specific treatment. Similarly, prophylactic antibiotics have not been proven to be beneficial. [...] Dietary gluten restriction, used to reduce mucosal antigen challenge, also has not been shown to preserve kidney function. Phenytoin has also been tried without any benefit.|$|E
2500|$|Less common manifestations include splenomegaly, <b>hematuria</b> and glomerulonephritis. [...] Headache, neck stiffness, and {{photophobia}} may occur. There {{have been}} three case reports suggesting meningitis or encephalitis.|$|E
2500|$|Acute {{kidney failure}} (either as a {{complication}} of the frank <b>hematuria,</b> when it usually recovers, or due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis which {{often leads to}} chronic kidney failure) ...|$|E
2500|$|Chronic {{kidney failure}} (no {{previous}} symptoms, presents with anemia, hypertension and other symptoms of kidney failure, [...] {{in people who}} probably had longstanding undetected microscopic <b>hematuria</b> and/or proteinuria) ...|$|E
2500|$|The mucosal lininig of {{the bladder}} {{could also be}} {{involved}} in approximately 5 {{percent of the children}} under going hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This causes <b>hematuria,</b> frequency, abdominal pain and thrombocytopnea ...|$|E
2500|$|From a young age, Pepys {{suffered}} from bladder stones in his urinary tract – a condition from which {{his mother and}} brother John also later suffered. He was almost never without pain, {{as well as other}} symptoms, including [...] "blood in the urine" [...] (<b>hematuria).</b> By the time of his marriage, the condition was very severe.|$|E
2500|$|Bladder stones {{may cause}} {{blood in the}} urine (<b>hematuria)</b> (giving the {{appearance}} that the animal is urinating blood) but sometimes {{there may be no}} signs at all. [...] Painful urination or straining to urinate are other signs. [...] Urinary tract infections are commonly associated with bladder stones. [...] Smaller stones may become lodged in the urethra, especially in male animals, causing urinary tract obstruction and the inability to urinate. [...] This condition causes acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, septicemia, and death within a few days.|$|E
2500|$|Since IgA {{nephropathy}} commonly presents without symptoms through abnormal {{findings on}} urinalysis, {{there is considerable}} possibility for variation in any population studied depending upon the screening policy. [...] Similarly, the local policy for performing kidney biopsy assumes a critical role; {{if it is a}} policy to simply observe patients with isolated bloody urine, a group with a generally favourable prognosis will be excluded. If, in contrast, all such patients are biopsied, then the group with isolated microscopic <b>hematuria</b> and isolated mesangial IgA will be included and ‘improve’ the prognosis of that particular series.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, IgA nephropathy, {{which was}} {{initially}} {{thought to be}} a benign disease, has been shown to have not-so-benign long term outcomes. Though most reports describe IgA nephropathy as having an indolent evolution towards either healing or renal damage, a more aggressive course is occasionally seen associated with extensive crescents, and presenting as acute kidney failure. [...] In general, the entry into chronic kidney failure is slow as compared to most other glomerulonephritides – occurring over a time scale of 30 years or more (in contrast to the 5 to 15 years in other glomerulonephritides). [...] This may reflect the earlier diagnosis made due to frank <b>hematuria.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{overproduction}} of {{uric acid}} is present at birth, {{but may not}} be recognized by routine clinical laboratory testing methods. The serum uric acid concentration is often normal, as [...] the excess purines are promptly eliminated in the urine. The crystals usually appear as an orange grainy material, or they may coalesce to form either multiple tiny stones or distinct large stones {{that are difficult to}} pass. The stones, or calculi, usually cause <b>hematuria</b> (blood in the urine) and increase the risk of urinary tract infection. Some victims suffer kidney damage due to such kidney stones. Stones may be the presenting feature of the disease, but can go undetected for months or even years.|$|E
