[...] "He can be {{considered}} as the genuine creator of the <b>fixed</b> <b>spaces</b> industry", says the magazine La fonderie typographique in 1899. These <b>fixed</b> <b>spaces</b> between words and lines, margins, etc., require great precision. He invents a new process, instead of cutting <b>fixed</b> <b>spaces,</b> pouring them into molds, which increases accuracy. In 1856, after his death, the company management is entrusted to a friend of his widow, Clémentine Dupont de Vieux Pont (wife Peignot, 1815-1897). She then settles beside her his son, Gustave Peignot (1839-1899), engineer of Arts et Métiers school.|$|R

25|$|Some filesystems {{restrict}} {{the length of}} filenames. In some cases, these lengths apply to the entire file name, as in 44 characters on IBM S/370. In other cases, the length limits may apply to particular portions of the filename, such as {{the name of a}} file in a directory, or a directory name. For example, 9 (e.g., 8-bit FAT in Standalone Disk BASIC), 11 (e.g. FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 in DOS), 14 (e.g. early Unix), 21 (Human68K), 31, 30 (e.g. Apple DOS 3.2 and 3.3), 15 (e.g. Apple ProDOS), 44 (e.g. IBM S/370), or 255 (e.g. early Berkeley Unix) characters or bytes. Length limits often result from assigning <b>fixed</b> <b>space</b> in a filesystem to storing components of names, so increasing limits often requires an incompatible change, as well as reserving more space.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{worked on}} a number of {{television}} science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, creator J. Michael Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralized location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of [...] " [...] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week", a <b>fixed</b> <b>space</b> station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the Foundation series, Childhood's End, The Lord of the Rings, Dune and the Lensman series, Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become Babylon 5.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{work has}} shown that spinal neurons are capable of discriminating between {{temporally}} regular and temporally irregular stimulation. These effects have been observed using an in vivo assay of spinal plasticity based on an instrumental learning task, in which response-contingent leg shock produces an increase in flexion duration. Exposure to temporally regular stimulation (<b>fixed</b> <b>spaced</b> stimulation; FT) promotes learning, and temporally irregular stimulation produces a learning deficit. The experiments in this dissertation were designed to test other properties of <b>fixed</b> <b>spaced</b> shock that promote spinal plasticity and the structure responsible for the FT effect. Experiment 1 focused on the minimum number of stimulations necessary to re-establish the capacity to learn (a component of the ?FT effect?), finding that 180 - 360 shocks produced a learning deficit and that additional training (540 - 900 shocks) allowed learning. Experiment 2 found that shock number, not duration of exposure determined whether the FT effect emerged. Experiment 3 investigated if the FT effect emerges after shock was presented in two sessions separated by 24 hrs, and showed that two bouts of 360 shocks yielded the FT effect. Further, the initial bout of <b>fixed</b> <b>spaced</b> shock had a long-term benefit (Experiment 4). The results of Experiment 5 suggested that omitting shocks from a train of FT stimulation has {{little effect on the}} benefit of <b>fixed</b> <b>spaced</b> shock treatment. Experiment 6 replicated this observation, showing that randomly deleting half of the shocks (from a 720 FT shock series) had no effect on learning. Further, this schedule also induces a lasting protective effect, blocking the learning deficit produced by variable spaced shock (Experiment 7). To explore whether a central system or a peripheral filter mediates the FT effect, Experiment 8 challenged spinal neurons by phase shifting the relation between <b>fixed</b> <b>spaced</b> stimulation applied to two dermatomes. The FT effect only emerged when stimuli occurred in an alternating pattern across dermatomes, implying regularity is abstracted by a central system. Experiment 9 surgically isolated central pattern generator (L 1 -L 2) from the portion of the spinal cord that mediates instrumental learning (L 4 -S 2), finding that disrupting the connections between these two regions eliminated the FT effect...|$|R

40|$|Compressive sensing-based {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) imaging has shown its superior capability in high-resolution image formation. However, most of those works focus on the scenes that can be sparsely represented in <b>fixed</b> <b>spaces.</b> When dealing with complicated scenes, these <b>fixed</b> <b>spaces</b> lack adaptivity in characterizing varied image contents. To solve this problem, a new compressive sensing-based radar imaging approach with adaptive sparse representation is proposed. Specifically, an autoregressive model is introduced to adaptively exploit the structural sparsity of an image. In addition, similarity among pixels is integrated into the autoregressive model to further promote the capability and thus an adaptive sparse representation facilitated by a weighted autoregressive model is derived. Since the weighted autoregressive model is inherently determined by the unknown image, we propose a joint optimization scheme by iterative SAR imaging and updating of the weighted autoregressive model to solve this problem. Eventually, experimental results demonstrated the validity and generality of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|In {{the absence}} of brain input, spinal systems can adapt to new {{environmental}} relations. For example, spinally transected rats given a legshock each time the leg is extended exhibit a progressive increase in flexion duration that minimizes net shock exposure, a simple form of instrumental learning. This capacity for learning is modulated by prior stimulation; both variable shock and inflammation produce a lasting inhibition of learning. An extended exposure to <b>fixed</b> <b>spaced</b> shock has no adverse effect on learning and opposes the consequences of variable shock. The present studies expand on these findings and demonstrate that fixed stimulation ameliorates the impact of peripheral inflammation. Spinally transected rats were administered 900 <b>fixed</b> <b>spaced</b> legshocks prior to (Experiment 1) or 1800 legshocks following (Experiment 2) a subcutaneous hindpaw injection of capsaicin. Learning was assessed 24 hr later. Treatment with fixed shock attenuated the capsaicin-induced inhibition of learning. These findings suggest that fixed stimulation promotes adaptive plasticity and may foster recovery after injury.
