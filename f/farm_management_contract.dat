Respondents predicted {{that the number of}} vaccinations would decrease substantially with optimal farm management, but would increase if farmers were allowed (under strict conditions) to vaccinate their own pigs. The results further indicated that the nature of financial compensation predicted the rate of vaccination.

The largest potential challenge of contracting out the heifer raising enterprise revolves around the potential for a moral hazard problem because of hidden action {{on the part of the}} custom heifer grower. A principal-agent framework was used to elicit contract terms which provide incentives for the custom heifer grower to perform accelerated growth without heifers becoming over-conditioned. In order to provide incentives to custom growers, heifers returned to the dairy farm should be compared in performance to other heifers of similar age. We solve for the price paid per pound of gain, price paid for inch of wither height above the average heifer on the operation, deduction per unit of body condition score over or under ideal body condition score, and percent of the value of milk production above the average milk production by herd peers.

40|$|The {{business}} environment of rice farming has deteriorated {{because of the}} continuous decline in rice prices since the late 1990 s. In regions where agricultural land is actively bought and sold,large-scale farmers have a heavier debt burden than small-scale farmers. Towards finding {{a way out of}} these circumstances, farmers have started“incorporated cooperative farm management”. This paper aims at identifying the improvements in <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> that are brought by incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management.</b> First,the historical background of such management is analyzed. In areas where large-scale rice farming predominates,smaller farmers have pursued organizational restructuring toward achieving incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management.</b> Being heavily indebted,these farmers formed cooperatives for shared use of farm machinery and joint ownership of farmland. These efforts, however,failed to ameliorate their cash-flow problems. Second,a survey shows that incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> has brought about positive results, including improvement of investment conditions. The rationalization of production that is achieved by incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> is characterized by several advantages: 1) Operating efficiency is enhanced because the lot size of each paddy field is increased and each different rice variety is grown collectively in adjoining paddy fields; 2) Competition between farm operations is avoided; 3) Fertilizer application management is upgraded because responsibilities are divided among farmers for various crop varieties;and 4) Farming on a larger scale offsets the risks of trial growing. Additionally,analysis was conducted to identify attitudinal and local conditions that affect the success of <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> improvement efforts. Third,analysis of management in terms of profitability and financial stability reveals that incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> helps to increase the value added as a result of modified use of paddy fields,rationalization of production and upgrading of <b>farm</b> <b>management.</b> It is also indicates that incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> provides each cooperative member with a level of income that enables debts to be paid off. Incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> also affords financial stability. In conclusion,incorporated cooperative <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> is a form of <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> by principal farmers in agricultural regions where agricultural land is actively bought and sold and farmers face difficulties in individually sustaining their farms...|$|R

40|$|Fifty {{years of}} Australian {{academic}} literature about <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> is surveyed and reviewed chronologically and methodologically. <b>Farm</b> <b>management</b> {{started as a}} field of academic inquiry during the 1940 s, {{and at the end}} of the first decade most of the major emphases which were to predominate over the ensuing decades had made their debut in the literature. Major emphases over the fifty years have been records and accounts, production economic thinking, linear programming, decision theory and systems simulation approaches. Overtime came increasing doubt about the usefulness of each of these emphases, and in the 1980 s journal writings about <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> declined greatly. Much academic work about <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> during the past fifty years lacked relevance because of a 'partial-farm management' orientation. This derives in part from a methodological focus which is too narrowly disciplinary, and insufficiently dynamic, and also from the imperative of specialisation for progress to be made in particular disciplines. The human element, the technology, the financial and taxation aspects, the dynamic, complex and uncertain nature of farming, factors beyond the farm gate, the processes of <b>farm</b> <b>management,</b> and the need for sound judgements about 'the numbers' are more important aspects of <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> than was implied by the emphases on records, production economics, optimal plans, quantitative decision analysis and systems modelling. The balance of the emphases on the various disciplines has to be appropriate for work in <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> to be relevant to problem solving. The traditional, relatively simple, <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> budgets have stood up well to tests of time because they enable the full dimensions of the problem to be brought into consideration.

There is a large variety of topics concerning <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> research and science. Important traditional topics with varying focuses are: description of forms of enterprises, operations research and analysis, cooperate planning, appraisal, site assessment, use of electronic media, analysis of new technologies and their results, and finally the individual farm analysis of agrarian policy measures. Recent topics are in particular: economic research on organic farming, farm economic questions in connection with biotechnology and genetic engineering, farm economic controlling, internal procuring and marketing policy, business relations, analysis of international competitiveness of farm businesses as well as enterprises in agribusiness, farm environmental economy, and economic examinations of agricultural institutions. As far as organisation is concerned, <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> economics should stay in future within agricultural faculties. <b>Farm</b> <b>management</b> economics should not be classified as part of business economics and should not be integrated in business science faculties.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of an ongoing study that explores <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> practices by Australian women cotton growers using <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> software, most particularly agricultural decision support systems (DSS). The research methodology is interpretive with multiple case studies of women cotton growers and industry professionals. Participants were {{selected on the basis of}} indicating an awareness of environmentally responsible and high technology farming practices. Data collection was principally by semi-structured in-depth interviews. The study is informed through a theoretical framework of structuration theory as a metatheory for probing the recursiveness of <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> and technology usage, and diffusion of innovations theory as a lower-level theory for analysing the characteristics of the software. Evidence from the study suggests that farm women intentionally select specific software modules for implementation depending on the attributes of the software. Further, while computer-based <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> systems, including agricultural DSS, are recognised media for technology transfer of industry research to farms, the study found the cooperation of farming partners to be essential in influencing effective reconstruction of <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> practices and software usage. The study also explores gender homophily, in particular the relationship between husband and wife as partners in a cotton farm business. It is apparent that gender differences and inequalities are still prevalent and indicative of "gender heterophily. " Nevertheless, in the main, communication between parties is harmonious, empathetic, and by definition homophilous, thus ensuring effective information exchange. A notable benefit of using decision support software is an enhanced critical awareness of existing <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> practices. Further, the women are empowered by increasing confidence to contribute in enterprising ways to a greater range of <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> tasks and to more innovative applications of computer-based <b>farm</b> <b>management</b> tools.
