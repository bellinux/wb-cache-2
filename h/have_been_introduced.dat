5|$|Before Ascension Island was colonised by Europeans in the 19th century, Johngarthia lagostoma was {{the only}} large land animal on the island. Since then, many species of mammal <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> to Ascension Island, and now compete with J.lagostoma; they include mice, rats and rabbits.|$|E

5|$|Of the 374 species {{included}} here, 63 are classed as {{rare and}} 94 as very rare as defined below. Thirteen <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> to North America and {{two have been}} extirpated.|$|E
5|$|Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied {{birds with}} short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. Seven {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in Tasmania, two of which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> and another three are vagrants.|$|E
50|$|Furcifer is a genus of {{chameleons}} whose member {{species are}} mostly endemic to Madagascar, but F. cephalolepis and F. polleni are endemic to the Comoros.

5|$|Specific sleep hygiene {{recommendations}} {{have changed}} over time. For example, advice to simply avoid sleeping pills was included in early sets of recommendations, but as more drugs to help with sleep <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced,</b> recommendations concerning their use have become more complex.|$|E
5|$|Three species {{occur in}} both New Guinea and Australia. Some species have {{widespread}} distributions, with the galah, for example, occurring {{over most of}} Australia, whereas other species have tiny distributions, confined to {{a small part of}} the continent, such as the Baudin's black cockatoo of Western Australia or to a small island group, such as the Tanimbar corella, which is restricted to the Tanimbar Islands of Indonesia. Some cockatoos <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> accidentally to areas outside their natural range such as New Zealand, Singapore, and Palau, while two Australian corella species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> to parts of the continent where they are not native.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} tools <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> to improve this situation. The first such tool was Apache's mod perl, {{which sought to}} address one of the most-common reasons that small Perl {{programs}} were invoked rapidly: CGI Web development. ActivePerl, via Microsoft ISAPI, provides similar performance improvements.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of animals and insects live in Texas. It is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of {{reptiles}} and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all. At least 12 species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> and now reproduce freely in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced,</b> {{and there}} is increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
5|$|Around twenty {{non-native}} {{species of}} flora <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> to Caroline Island via human contact. Among {{these are the}} vine Ipomoea violacea, which has begun to proliferate. Domestic cats and dogs introduced alongside a small homestead have driven the seabird population away from the islet of Monu Ata-Ata.|$|E

30|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) using conventional and diffusion-weighted sequences <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> {{as a valuable}} technique for the characterization of focal solid hepatic lesions [9 - 11]. Nowadays, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> in quantitative measurements {{as an adjunct to}} diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) [10, 11].|$|R

5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where {{it is likely to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced,</b> probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Different {{variants}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> {{catering to}} regional taste and requirements. A meethi (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast by the Arab diaspora in Barkas neighbourhood of the city. The chicken variant is less popular, {{even though it}} is lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat meat, is available at some eateries in Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|Finches are {{seed-eating}} passerine {{birds that}} are small to moderately large {{and have a}} strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Two species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> to Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Oryzomys peninsulae arrived at its recent locale in Baja California Sur. In 1922, Nelson {{suggested that it}} may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> from another part of Mexico in a shipment of farm products, but this hypothesis is disproved by the clear differentiation from other western Mexican Oryzomys that the species exhibits.|$|E
5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} mammals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> {{throughout the}} history of Puerto Rico. Indigenous settlers first introduced dogs and guinea pigs from South or Central America. Afterwards, Taínos introduced hutias as a food source from Hispaniola. When the Spanish colonized the island in the early 16th century, they introduced domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, goats, pigs, cattle, horses, and donkeys. Other species such as black rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus sp.) have been unintentionally introduced as stowaways, possibly since Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1493. More recently, species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> as a means of biological pest control. For example, the small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was introduced in the 19th century to control the damage caused by rats in sugar cane plantations. The introduction was a failure: the mongoose failed to control the rat population and instead contributed to the decline of native fauna such as the yellow-shouldered blackbird and possibly the elfin-woods warbler.|$|E
5|$|Several {{animal species}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> to Everglades waterways. Many {{tropical}} fish are released, the most detrimental being the blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), which builds large nests in shallow waters. Tilapia also consume vegetation which {{would normally be}} used by young native fishes for cover and protection.|$|E
