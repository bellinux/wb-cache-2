500|$|A quick {{shot of the}} [...] "IV" [...] tattoo inked on Beyoncé's left {{ring finger}} is shown (a {{reference}} to her album's title, 4), before she bathes in a tub of flowers as well as [...] berries and blows billows of smoke. As she continues to caress her upper-body, an array of light imagery is projected behind her, serving as a backdrop. During the second verse, the video begins to use symmetrical visual arts. Beyoncé appears {{standing in front of}} a purple background, draped by large and billowing garments. As the song progresses, her emotions are heightened; zoomed shots of tears trickling <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> are shown. A man appears behind Beyoncé and begins closely embracing her in endearment. The man is nondescript, and his muscular arms grip Beyoncé's body before taking her through a series of dips and bends, while he remains mostly in the background. With tears still rolling <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> Beyoncé chants to her love interest to make love to her on the song's vocal finale. As the guitar melodies close the song, Beyoncé is seen engulfed by the colorful light and special effects. The video ends with the camera returning to a glistening Beyoncé with blackened scenery in the background.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Aguilera with [...] "strawberry-blonde" [...] hair. It {{begins with}} a close-up of a gun barrel. Then, she slowly walks through a [...] "deserted" [...] bedroom and lies down in the room, which is filled with charcoal, while crying. She is seen with mascara streaming <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> As the scene moves on, Aguilera is fighting against a shirtless man, who is considered her lover. The clip ends as Aguilera takes off her shirt in an [...] "Inception-like dreamworld". Critical response to [...] "You Lost Me" [...] video was positive: Latina writer Mariela Rosario and UK magazine OK! noted that the clip was a comeback by Aguilera following the video for Bionic lead single [...] "Not Myself Tonight". Monica Hererra from Billboard also thought that it represents [...] "a kind of return to form for Aguilera". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Brad Wete thought that the video for [...] "You Lost Me" [...] "has some quality material". Similarly, MTV Buzzworthy's Chris Ryan complimented {{it as one of}} Aguilera's best videos ever.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E

50|$|The {{album cover}} {{portrait}} of Lear, with Tiffany-designed diamond tears running <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> is notable {{in the history}} of art and design as {{it was one of the}} first major assignments for French photographers Pierre et Gilles.|$|R
60|$|A streak, {{straight}} as a meridian, was visible <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> The blood {{had been brought}} almost to the surface, but was not quite through, that which had originally appeared thereon having possibly come from the horse.

But out of the eyes, slowly, there rolled a tear, that glittered in the moonlight as it ran <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|R
60|$|The little model {{looked up}} at him without a word. Now that the thin link which bound her to some sort of {{household}} gods had snapped, all the patience and submission bred in her by village life, by the hard facts of her story, and by these last months in London, served her well enough. She made no fuss. Hilary saw a tear roll <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|R
60|$|He was murmuring pretty {{words of}} endearment; {{carried away by}} emotion, his arm stole round her waist; he felt that if another tear came like a dewdrop rolling <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> he must kiss it away at its very source.
