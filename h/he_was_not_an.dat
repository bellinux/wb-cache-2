5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> elegant exponent. His normal {{language}} is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions... first, when depicting {{the measures of}} a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E
5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|The four theses {{stem from}} the synod of 1637, and herein Wheelwright portrays himself as an {{orthodox}} minister {{following the lead of}} such early reformers as Calvin, Zanchi, the Synod of Dort, Beza, Perkins and others. As his theses become repetitious of his propositions, they become abbreviated, and he returns to the accusations made in Short Story. He ends his work claiming that he was right all along, and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Antinomian.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Spruance {{became chief}} of staff to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) and Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPOA). In Halsey's {{continued}} absence, Kinkaid became commander of Task Force 16, built around the carrier , although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> aviator, and his experience with carriers had been restricted to commanding their screens at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway. In early July Kinkaid was briefed by Nimitz about plans for a landing in the Solomon Islands, codenamed Operation Watchtower. For this operation, Kinkaid's Task Force 16 would be one of three carrier task forces under Fletcher's overall command. To protect his flagship, Enterprise, Kinkaid had the battleship , heavy cruiser , antiaircraft cruiser , and five destroyers. The addition of the new battleship and its twenty /38 caliber dual-purpose guns greatly strengthened Task Force 16's antiaircraft defenses.|$|E
5|$|At the 1860 convention, Payne {{denounced the}} right of secession, and during the Civil War that began the next year, he was a staunch {{supporter}} of the Union. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> abolitionist, he opposed the further extension of slavery. During the war, Payne used some of his wealth to help equip Ohio regiments. He was 50 years old when the war began, too old to volunteer himself, but two of his sons served in the Union Army with his blessing. After the war, Payne continued his political activity, leading the Ohio delegation to the 1872 Democratic National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Horace Greeley. He campaigned on Greeley's behalf, raising his own political profile in the process. In 1874, Payne ran for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives from Ohio's 20th district, and was elected with a 2500-vote majority over the incumbent Republican, Richard C. Parsons.|$|E

In 1980, alpine and cross-country skier Kyrra Grunnsund and cross-country skier Peter Rickards {{became the first}} official competitors for Australia. The number of Australian athletes increased to three, five, five and six at the next four games, respectively, {{and all of the}} athletes were alpine skiers. The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002. Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has medalled at every games since then. All of the medals have been won in alpine skiing.|$|E

5|$|Franck's first paper there, co-authored with Edward Teller, was on {{photochemical}} processes in crystals. Hans Gaffron became his collaborator. They {{were joined by}} Pringsheim, who escaped from Belgium after the German invasion. Franck arranged a position for Pringsheim at his laboratory. Both his daughters and their families moved to the United States, {{and he was also}} able to bring out his elderly mother and aunt. He became a naturalised United States citizen on 21 July 1941, so <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> enemy alien when the United States declared war on Germany on 11 December 1941. His daughters still were, though, so they were restricted from travelling, and could not take care of their mother when she fell ill and died on 10 January 1942, although they were permitted to attend her funeral.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, who {{was born}} and raised in Garut, West Java, was trained as a {{journalist}} before moving to Batavia in 1941 to work for the state publisher of the Dutch East Indies, Balai Pustaka. While in Batavia, in 1945 he began associating with Chairil Anwar's literary group Republika. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence and the start of the Indonesian National Revolution, he fled to West Java and participated in events led by the Socialist Party of Indonesia led by Sutan Sjahrir. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> atheist, although his association with the party led some to draw that conclusion.

5|$|Norman Hilberry was {{associate}} director of the Metallurgical Project, and Richard L. Doan was appointed the Director of the Metallurgical Laboratory. While Doan was an able administrator, he had difficulty being accepted {{as the head of the}} laboratory, since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> academic. On 5 May 1943, Compton replaced him with Samuel K. Allison, and appointed Henry D. Smyth as {{associate director}}. Initially there were three physics groups, headed by Allison, Fermi and Martin D. Whitaker. Frank Spedding was in charge of the Chemistry Division. He was later succeeded by Herbert McCoy, and then by James Franck. Compton placed Robert Oppenheimer in charge of the bomb design effort in June 1942. In November 1942, this became a separate project, known as Project Y, which was located in Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's {{theological}} stance {{was gradually}} revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption {{and in the}} process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the veneration of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of excommunication. His attack on the claim that tithing was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact. This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> innovator and that the sole basis of his teachings was Scripture.|$|E

25|$|Huxley was {{comfortable}} with comparative anatomy, {{at which he}} was the greatest master of the day. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life.
