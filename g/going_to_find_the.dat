Flick {{was inducted into}} the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963 after being unanimously elected by the Veterans Committee (VC). When he received the call from Branch Rickey that he had been selected, Flick did not believe Rickey at first. He said that he did not even realize that he was being considered for election at the time. Flick's family had to convince him that the call was real. He was the oldest living inductee in Hall of Fame history. At his induction, the 87-year-old Flick said, [...] "This is a bigger day than I've ever had before.

2500|$|On {{the advice}} of his agent, Wesley Rose, Orbison left Monument in mid-1965 for a more lucrative {{contract}} with MGM Records, with Rose taking over as producer. Orbison did not ask for Porter on his recording sessions, and he did not have any hit songs with MGM. Years later, Porter said that, though he really liked Orbison, the singer [...] "never understood the engineer's contribution." [...] It was Rose's advice to leave Monument, and he was [...] "doing his job as a manager" [...] to get more money, but, said Porter, [...] "he didn't know that much about the music." [...] Porter felt that only with himself as engineer, Fred Foster as producer and Anita Kerr as arranger was Orbison <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> right combination.|$|E

2500|$|Shaw {{developed}} a reputation as an agitator for his aggressive play and verbal instigation while playing for the Chicago Blackhawks. He compared his playstyle to Boston Bruins player Brad Marchand, saying [...] "We're both agitators. We both play physical and we're always chirping."

2500|$|In {{the book}} Eiseley conveys {{his sense of}} wonder at the depth {{of time and the}} vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, {{reactions}} to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In The Immense Journey, Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. Marston Bates writes, [...] "It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> answers in human evolution until we have framed the right questions, and the questions are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations." ...|$|E
