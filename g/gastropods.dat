5|$|During the 19th century, strombid <b>gastropods</b> were {{believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid <b>gastropods</b> are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E

5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of <b>gastropods</b> from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater molluscs (52 <b>gastropods</b> and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are the mussels Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species of freshwater molluscs are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E
5|$|Strombid <b>gastropods</b> {{were widely}} {{accepted}} as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, {{a concept that}} persisted until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. This erroneous idea originated in the writings of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who classified strombids with other supposedly carnivorous snails. This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors, but were not supported by observation. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid <b>gastropods</b> are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Lobatus gigas is a specialized herbivore, that feeds on macroalgae (including red algae, such as species of Gracilaria and Hypnea), seagrass and unicellular algae, intermittently also feeding on algal detritus. The green macroalgae Batophora oerstedii is one of its preferred foods.|$|E

5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In <b>gastropods,</b> the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid <b>gastropods).</b> The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E

Other animals without blood included fish lice, hermit crabs, red coral, sea anemones, sponges, starfish and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.|$|E
5|$|Because {{almost all}} {{other species of}} amphidromine <b>gastropods,</b> such as ones within the genera Partula and Achatinella, have already become extinct, the genus Amphidromus, {{containing}} over 110 species, is uniquely useful {{for the study of}} the evolution of asymmetry in animals, and this is why the conservation of this genus is of essential importance to biologists.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gastropod</b> is a biotic {{component}} {{which is important}} in river ecosystem. <b>Gastropod</b> will respond the changes of physical and chemical condition of the river {{so that it can}} be the bio-indicator of the contamination. This research is aimed to know the diversity of <b>gastropod</b> as bio-indicator of contamination of leachate of Jatibarang dumping ground in Kreo river Semarang City. This research was conducted on April until June 2015. <b>Gastropod</b> sample was got using purposive sampling using Surber Net. <b>Gastropod</b> sampling was conducted in three station with three sampling spots in each station, physical-chemical factor measurement including temperature, brightness, pH, COD, DO and BOD was also conducted in every station. The analysis of research result showed that diversity index and the number of <b>gastropod</b> decreased in station which was contamined by leachate. The contaminated station was station II. Diversity index was 0, 66094 and the number of <b>gastropod</b> was 114 ind/m 2. This condition was different compared to station I which had not been contaminated. In station I, diversity index was 1, 03255 and the number of <b>gastropod</b> was 175 ind/m 2. So was the station which got the recovery, the station III, where diversity index was 0, 82691 and the number of <b>gastropod</b> was 140 ind/m 2.
