40|$|One major {{drawback}} {{of deception}} detection is its vulnerability to countermeasures, whereby participants wilfully modulate their physiological or neurophysiological response to critical guilt-determining stimuli. One {{reason for this}} vulnerability is that stimuli are usually presented slowly. This allows enough time to consciously apply countermeasures, once the role of stimuli is determined. However, by increasing presentation speed, stimuli can {{be placed on the}} fringe of awareness, rendering it hard to perceive those that have not been previously identified, hindering the possibility to employ countermeasures. We tested an identity deception detector by presenting first names in Rapid Serial Visual Presentation and <b>instructing</b> <b>participants</b> to lie about their own identity.

Thereafter, they performed two versions of the experiment with order of the experimental versions balanced across participants. In the immediate-response version of the experiment, we <b>instructed</b> <b>participants</b> to press the spacebar immediately after detecting the critical moment of ball contact.

In the delayed-response version of the experiment, we <b>instructed</b> <b>participants</b> to indicate whether they had seen the critical moment of ball contact after each trial, using a rating scale ranging from 1 (sure no) to 6 (sure yes). Our instruction explaining the task to the participants contained drawings of a player performing a throw-in and just releasing the ball as well as of a player kicking a ball and just touching the ball with the toe of the shoe in order to make sure that participants understood what we meant by the critical moment of ball contact. Each experimental version consisted of 40 different clips (trials) with trial order randomized for each participant. The association of clips to conditions was balanced across participants, that is, each clip occurred equally often within each condition across all participant.

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and {{is not to be}} disseminated broadly. Three experiments examined the role of study-phase retrieval (reminding) in the effects of spaced repetitions on cued recall. Remindings were brought under task control to evaluate their effects. Participants studied 2 lists of word pairs containing 3 item types: single items that appeared once in List 2, within-list repetitions that appeared twice in List 2, and between-list repetitions that appeared once in List 1 and once in List 2. Our primary interest was in performance on between-list repetitions. Detection of between-list repetitions was encouraged in an n-back condition by <b>instructing</b> <b>participants</b> to indicate when a presented item was a repetition of any preceding item, including items presented in List 1. In contrast, detection of between-list repetitions was discouraged in a within-list back condition by <b>instructing</b> <b>participants</b> only to indicate repetitions occurring in List 2. Cued recall of between-list repetitions was enhanced when instructions encouraged detection of List 1 presentations. These results accord with those from prior experiments showing a role of study-phase retrieval in effects of spacing repetitions.

40|$|The traditional, patient-based {{method of}} {{teaching}} colonoscopy is being increasingly supplanted by surgical simulation. At present, however, {{there is no}} well-established simulation-based training curriculum for colonoscopy, and {{little is known about}} what variables best facilitate skill acquisition in this context. The primary aim of the present research was to investigate the effect of instruction in the acquisition of a complex psychomotor skill involved in colonoscopy: looping management. A secondary aim was to examine the association between innate abilities (specifically, hand-eye coordination and visual-spatial ability) and overall looping management skill. Participants (n = 47) were tested under a mixed experimental design, completing 10 trials on a physical model colonoscopy simulator after being assigned to either receive or not receive instruction on looping management. In addition to the surgical simulations, participants completed the Gibson Spiral Maze test of hand-eye coordination and the MRT-A test of visual-spatial ability. Three indices of looping management skill were assessed: loops solved, segment completion rate, and time in sigmoid. Contrary to hypotheses, non-instructed participants did not evidence better performance over time on the three dependent measures compared to <b>instructed</b> <b>participants.</b> Overall, however, and against predictions, <b>instructed</b> <b>participants</b> solved a greater percentage of loops than their non-instructed counterparts.
