5|$|Over {{four years}} after Cold Feet ended, ITV {{executives}} were {{still looking for a}} series that could comfortably replace it. On his appointment as chairman of ITV plc in 2007, Michael Grade announced that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> ITV network to be broadcasting long-running series like Cold Feet to attract the younger, upmarket viewing demographic.|$|E
5|$|Bush became {{dissatisfied}} with Colonel Marshall's failure {{to get the}} project moving forward expeditiously, specifically the failure to acquire the Tennessee site, the low priority allocated to the project by the Army {{and the location of}} his headquarters in New York City. Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.|$|E
5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>The</b> enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E

"Godolphin wouldn't stand that. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> {{gloom of}} Haxard's death {{to remain in}} unrelieved inkiness at <b>the</b> end. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> people to go away {{thinking}} of Godolphin, and how well he did the last gasp. He wouldn't stand any love business there. He would rather not have any in the play." ...|$|R

5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, partly due to the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey and partly because of the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2008, Samaras {{signed for}} Scottish Premier League club Celtic on a six-month loan deal, {{with the club}} having an option to buy him {{at the end of}} his loan spell. He said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> move because he needed to be playing first team {{football}} to get into the Greece squad for Euro 2008. He also said that he was attracted to the fact that he would regularly be able to play in European competition with Celtic.|$|E
5|$|Pei {{also drew}} {{inspiration}} from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, {{he called for a}} rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.|$|E

5|$|Ross said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> {{piece to}} exude organic forms, {{drawn from the}} city and its surroundings. The choice of magenta and yellow paint for the jets was a move to offset the city's stereotypical {{overcast}} skies. The choice of jets was a reference to the city's aviation history; its use of a non-aggressive and bird-like arrangement (itself a reference to the city bird, the Blue heron) was a counter to the inherent aggressiveness of jets as a symbol.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Montague Haltrecht {{suggests}} that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext {{to abandon the}} Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged {{that he had had}} a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the DC Graphic Novel Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography. Glen Morgan stated that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> episode to show that The Smoking Man was the most dangerous human being alive. The episode was originally intended to end with The Smoking Man killing Melvin Frohike, but the show's executive staff vetoed the idea.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>The</b> liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in Canada, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations {{during the summer and}} autumn of 1999. In January 1999, Travolta flew his private Boeing 727 on a secret visit to Montreal to scout out locations for shooting. The film was reported to have been the most expensive production shot in Canada up to that point. It was also reported that the production costs would have been twice as high had the film been shot in the United States. Almost every shot in the film is at a Dutch angle, because, according to Roger Christian, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> film to look like a comic book.|$|E
2500|$|Having all {{of these}} tracks at once gives a sound {{designer}} or audio engineer {{a great deal of}} control over how <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> car to sound. [...] In order to make the car more ominous or low, he can mix in more of the tailpipe recording; if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> car to sound like it is running full throttle, he can mix in more of the engine recording and reduce the interior perspective. [...] In cartoons, a pencil being dragged down a washboard may be used to simulate the sound of a sputtering engine.|$|R

Sisko takes on leadership of the revolt, trying to ensure that no one gets hurt, and understanding that at the resolution of the revolt Gabriel Bell must die. He makes demands to the governor, insisting they be given airtime to express their grievances. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> Sanctuary Districts closed and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> people to be given opportunities to earn an honest living.|$|R

5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other.|$|E

5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, when Naruto was {{reaching}} its climax, Kishimoto envisioned {{the idea of}} Naruto becoming a father. This resulted in the creation Boruto Uzumaki, Naruto and Hinata's first child. Kishimoto wanted Boruto to act like his father, {{but at the same}} time, have differences between each other. Despite not wishing to reveal much about Boruto due to developments of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, he added that Boruto is not as direct as Naruto. In the 2015 film , Kishimoto developed Boruto and Naruto's relationship from his relationship with his sons. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> film to depict the father and son relationship between Boruto and Naruto.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East was confident of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals {{would have to come}} up with £100 million a year to better their offer. Parry was undecided as to which bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea of a football channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they later did.|$|E
