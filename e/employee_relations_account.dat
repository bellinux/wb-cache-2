40|$|A buy-out is a {{fundamental}} change in the structure of ownership that may affect the way <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> develop within an organisation. Little is known about the impact of buyouts upon <b>employee</b> <b>relations.</b> This paper aims to address this gap. We focus on two main questions. First, what are the effects of a buy-out on <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> in an organisation? Second, does the national institutional context affect the impact of buy-outs on <b>employee</b> <b>relations?</b> The paper reports changes to <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> in buy-outs in the contrasting institutional environments of the UK and the Netherlands. Overall, we find that buy-outs positively affect HR practices with increases in training, employee involvement, the number of employees and pay levels. The positive effects appear to be significantly stronger in a less institutionalised environment like the UK than the more institutionalised environment of the Netherlands. Buy-outs raised HRM practices in the UK to a level closer although still below that of Dutch buy-outs. HRM;comparative analysis;buy-outs;institutional theory;agency theory;employee relations...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the association of}} <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> with the occurrence of onset of financial distress. We argue that if adverse economic conditions arise, firms that have maintained good <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> will {{be more effective in}} obtaining temporary labor concessions. As a result, firms with good <b>employee</b> <b>relations,</b> to the extent they are dependent on labor in the conduct of business operations, should be more likely to avoid the onset of future financial distress.

It is based on a representative survey of US subsidiaries and indigenous firms in the UK. The cross-sectional comparison with indigenous UK firms confirmed a distinct US country-of-origin imprint in <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> patterns in US subsidiaries. However, the magnitude of such an effect cautions against assumptions of popular stereotypes and reflects, inter alia, the diversity of <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> approaches among US parent companies as well as developments in the UK industrial relations landscape over the last decades. The intra-US analysis revealed the importance of both the level and type of industry internationalisation in shaping the strength and nature of the country-of-origin influence. On the basis of the findings, the article highlights lessons to be learned for the study of cross-border policy-transfer issues in MNCs...|$|R

5000|$|Industrial {{relations}} is a multidisciplinary field that studies the employment relationship. Industrial {{relations is}} increasingly being called employment <b>relations</b> or <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> {{because of the}} importance of non-industrial employment relationships; this move is sometimes seen as further broadening of the human resource management trend. Indeed, some authors now define human resource management as synonymous with <b>employee</b> <b>relations.</b> Other authors see <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> as dealing only with non-unionized workers, whereas labor relations is seen as dealing with unionized workers. Industrial relations studies examine various employment situations, not just ones with a unionized workforce. However, according to Bruce E.

40|$|Purpose â€“ The paper {{seeks to}} examine the {{evolution}} of, and assesses current trajectories of change in, the Algerian <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> system. Design/methodology/approach â€“ The paper reviews a range of literature on <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> in Algeria and draws on the authors' research {{over the years in}} the field, including recent interviews with unions' representatives. Findings â€“ The paper provides evidence to suggest that the Algerian system of <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> is a product of interactions and intersections between historical circumstances and different institutional arrangements and configurations to enable the state to hold together its power and control over unions. The paper shows how the preferential treatment of the UGTA by the government created an uneven playing field favouring the UGTA over independent unions. Research limitations/implications â€“ A major limitation of the paper is lack of strong empirical evidence. Practical implications â€“ The paper suggests that the single most important factor determining unions' ability to manoeuvre is the continuing support they obtain from the government and its institutions. The analysis provides practical suggestions for independent unions. Originality/value â€“ To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper on recent developments in <b>employee</b> <b>relations</b> in Algeria...|$|R
