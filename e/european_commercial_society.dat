40|$|Sentimental Fictions of Empire” {{traces the}} {{relations}} between the English and French sentimental novel and the eighteenth-century exploration of the non-Western world. Eighteenth-century writers on empire borrow images of the sentimental family, its benevolent head and virtuous women, to rescript relations of domination and property in terms of the innocent mastery of affect and reciprocity. The thesis draws on travel writings, political philosophy, natural histories, law tracts, and marriage treatises to examine how images of women crafted in the sentimental novel work to consolidate Enlightenment oppositions between civilized and savage, person and property, European and other. As emblems of a domestic sphere purportedly exempt from the proprietary interests of commercial empire, sentimental women screen contradictions between the polite, civilized ideals of the Enlightenment and the exploitative nature of colonial practices. Chapter one, “Civilization 2 ̆ 7 s Discontents in Graffigny 2 ̆ 7 s Lettres dune Péruvienne,” addresses {{the role of women in}} four-stages theories of graduated progress, which paradoxically depict women simultaneously as sign of a society 2 ̆ 7 s advancement and cause of its decadence. The novel 2 ̆ 7 s Peruvian heroine questions the civilized values of <b>European</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> by demonstrating how French property relations produce vacuous women. The second chapter, “The Properties of Femininity: Clarissa and the Caribbean Slavewoman,” examines the ways white and African women destabilize systems of classification by confounding hierarchies of race and gender. As the juxtaposition of Clarissa with the prostitutes in the Sinclair brothel suggests, and the presence of a growing population of ‘mixed race’ children in the colonies demonstrates, sexuality and reproduction tamper with the gender and racial classifications that maintain property. Chapter three, “Tahiti and the Problem of Jouissance ” takes up the overlapping language of sexual and personal property through the two senses of the word jouissance: as sexual ecstasy and the right of property use. Focusing on late eighteenth-century texts on demography and marriage, I examine how the notion of a world without private sexual and material property haunts both the seduction plot and the utopian community of Rousseau 2 ̆ 7 s Nouvelle Héloïse. ...|$|E

40|$|Adam Smith {{is almost}} {{certainly}} history’s most famous advocate of <b>commercial</b> <b>society,</b> but hefrankly admits that the relentless pursuit of wealth is a major obstacle to tranquility and content-ment and hence that, at first glance, the higher living standards that people “enjoy ” in <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> seem to come only {{at the cost of}} their happiness. I argue that the solution to this apparent paradox can be found in Smith’s account of the positive political effects of commerce: dependence and insecurity are the chief obstacles to happiness and have been the hallmarks of most of human history, and so the alleviation of these ills in <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> constitutes a great step forward. Money really cannot buy happiness, but the liberty and security that <b>commercial</b> <b>societies</b> tend to provide help to assuage the greatest sources of misery. In the eighteenth century, when commercial soci-ety in the fullest sense was first emerging, thinkersas disparate as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Justus Möser blamed this kind of society for making people miserable in the name of prosperity, for encouraging people to continually toil and chase after material goods that could never truly satisfy them (cf. Muller 2002). Such criticisms have, if anything, multiplied over time: despite (or perhaps because of) the unprece-dented living standards of today’s <b>commercial</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} changing {{ideas of}} labouring-class consumption in eighteenthcentury England. Recent {{social and economic}} history has rewritten eighteenthcentury England {{in terms of the}} formation of a <b>commercial</b> <b>society.</b> Against this backdrop, intellectual and cultural historians have uncovered the formation of concepts and practices appropriate for a civilised <b>commercial</b> <b>society.</b> Yet, in spite of the growing evidence that they were increasingly participating in the developing world of goods, little work has focused on the public discussion of the labouring classes' consumer desires. The study is based on the close analysis of pamphlet literature discussing the labouring classes. It tracks the ideas through which the propertied classes viewed labouring-class consumption and attempted to determine the exact status and function of their desires in a <b>commercial</b> <b>society.</b> From within an early eighteenth-century position which viewed the appetites of the poor as being a species of luxury, the thesis tracks the emergence of categories and concepts that made it possible to recognise the labouring classes' consumer desires as part of <b>commercial</b> <b>society's</b> progressive development. In the later years of the century, this optimism faded as the interests of capital accumulation and the demands of labourers were increasingly recognised to be contradictory. Ultimately, the thesis argues that we cannot understand the ideological representation of the needs and desires of the poor without also tracing the changing conceptualisation of their labour, {{in the same way that}} we cannot understand the formation of a <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> without reference to proletarianisation and the attack on customary culture. The coalescing practices of a <b>commercial</b> <b>society,</b> and their ideological expression, rested upon the ever greater alienation of the labouring classes, from their human needs and powers...|$|R

40|$|Adam Smith {{is often}} {{thought to be}} an unequivocal {{advocate}} of capitalism based on unfettered self-interest. Against this caricature, I argue that his attitudes towards <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> are, in fact, more ambivalent. To ground this claim, I outline Smith’s account of ambition, a passion responsible for the dynamism of commercial economies but deleterious to individual happiness, {{and focus on the}} rhetoric Smith deploys in his portraits of three ambitious characters: the poor man’s son, the ambitious man, and the prudent man. Next, I challenge alternative interpretations. In particular, I contest Samuel Fleischacker’s view that Smith no longer sees ambition, motivated by vanity, as the driving force behind economic growth in <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> by the time he writes the Wealth of Nations and, thus, is not meaningfully ambivalent. In the last section, I draw on recent work by Amelie Rorty to argue that Smith’s ambivalence towards <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> is both appropriate and constructive...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{interpretation of}} Adam Smith {{is that he}} is a prophet of commercialism. The liberal capitalist reading of Smith is consistent with the view that history culminates in <b>commercial</b> <b>society.</b> The first part of the article develops this optimistic interpretation of Smith's view of history. Smith implies that <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> is the end of history because 1) it supplies the ends of nature that he identifies; 2) it is inevitable; and 3) it is permanent. The second part of the article shows that Smith has some dark moments in his writings where he seems to reject completely such teleological notions. In this more civic humanist mood he confesses that <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> does not supply the ends of nature, nor is it inevitable, nor is it permanent. Both views exist in Smith and the commentator is forced to choose between passages in Smith's work in order to support a particular interpretation of the former's view of history.

Five thinkers from the Scottish Enlightenment [...] Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, and John Millar [...] confronted this problem. First, they questioned whether some aspects of individualism constitute genuine problems at all. For instance, their analysis of conspicuous consumption or luxury indicated that it could inspire an individual 2 ̆ 7 s virtue by sensitizing him to the beautiful and the fitting. Second, they pointed out that <b>commercial</b> <b>societies</b> exhibit conflicting tendencies. Commerce can bring benefits in the wake of its problems [...] and not just the material benefits of wealth or liberty, but also intangible benefits that can ultimately exert moral influence over the individual. They drew attention to how markets can multiply the number of social ties held by each individual and can also alter the nature of those ties in the direction of greater interdependence. Third, some of them analyzed the conditions under which <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> 2 ̆ 7 s more positive tendencies might prevail in the end. Fourth, they suggested government policies that might nudge <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> in the direction of greater virtue...|$|R

40|$|In general, {{societies}} {{are divided into}} agricultural and industrial societies. This study presents perspectives on decelerating agricultural societies. Agricultural demand and supply play major roles {{in the development of}} societies. Three theories that describe an agricultural society and its deceleration patterns are described: the neo-classical production function and those articulated by Johnston and Mellor as well as induced innovation by Hayami and Ruttan. Two important cases of decelerating agricultural societies, medieval England and the U. S., are investigated through an examination of the process of agricultural society deceleration and ultimate replacement by an industrial society. The limitations of decelerating agricultural societies, with a focus on structural problems,impacts on industrial structure, and problems of agriculture in market and non-market areas, are discussed. The position of agriculture as described by economic development theory is established by analyzing the stages of economic development, the theory ofstructural change, and the theory of leading industry. Finally, the transition from an agricultural to a <b>commercial</b> <b>society</b> is described with a focus on the formation,development, value creation, and structural limitations of a <b>commercial</b> <b>society.</b> Agricultural development, agricultural <b>society,</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>society,</b> decelerating society, economic growth, induced innovation, simple reproduction. ...|$|R
