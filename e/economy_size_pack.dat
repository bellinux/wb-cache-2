40|$|The {{existing}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the relationship between}} <b>economy</b> <b>size</b> and performance has been inconclusive. This paper employs stochastic frontier analysis to estimate economic measures of efficiency for the telecommunications sectors of 139 economies and examine their relationship with <b>economy</b> <b>size.</b> Simultaneously, it controls for the effects of competition in telecommunications, privatization of state-owned providers, independent regulators, and the quality of political institutions on sector performance. The findings suggest that <b>economy</b> <b>size</b> has a positive but decreasing impact on sector performance. Small economies have an incentive to grow to improve sector performance, though larger size is not a sufficient condition for efficiency. Sector policy and the quality of polity may contribute significantly to sector performance. <b>Economy</b> <b>size</b> Performance Telecommunications Policy Polity Stochastic frontier analysis...|$|R

While the former two are important determinants of the shadow economy, I find no evidence to prove any significant impact of distraints on the shadow <b>economy</b> <b>size.</b> As for the country’s particular regions, I find that those surrounding big cities, especially Prague, have, on average, a smaller shadow <b>economy</b> <b>size,</b> whereas regions in the borderlands (former Sudetenland) suffer from a larger shadow economy...|$|R

This study aims to investigate leaf decomposition {{at very low}} pH in the acidic Banyupahit-Banyuputih river originating from the acidic crater lake Kawah Ijen in Indonesia. Leaf decomposition experiments were carried out for 200 days in the acidic river at pHs of approximately 0. 7, 2. 3 and 3. 0 and in the neutral Kali Sengon river, using leaves from teak, Tectona grandis, and bamboo, Bambusa sp. Two different types of leaf packs were used: fine mesh <b>size</b> <b>packs</b> were used to exclude macroinvertebrates and coarse mesh <b>size</b> <b>packs</b> allowed macroinvertebrate colonization.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} estimations of {{the informal}} <b>economy</b> <b>size</b> in Bolivia from an application of a Dynamic General Equilibrium Model. The parameter estimation is performed using maximum likelihood method to obtain, as an intermediate result, a latent variable estimation {{of the informal}} <b>economy</b> <b>size.</b> This procedure is new, as the estimate {{of the size of}} the informal economy using a dynamic structural model represents an alternative study area to latent variable models which assume relationships without a strong support in theory (MIMIC models). The results suggest that the size of the informal economy represents 60 % of Bolivian GDP in 2010 and that the trend has been decreasing in the last decade. In addition, we simulated four alternative policies to reduce the size of the underground economy. Some of them allow to identify surprising response mechanisms which allows to analyze the flow of workers from the informal sector into the formal sector and vice versa. The research, besides quantifying the informal <b>economy</b> <b>size,</b> tries to provide a tool and methodology for evaluating alternative policy scenarios related to fiscal policy and labor mobility in a framework of an economy with a large informal sector and evasion. ...|$|R
