40|$|The {{esterification}} of {{propionic acid}} with isobutanol {{in the presence}} of Amberlyst- 15 as a catalyst was studied. <b>Isobutyl</b> <b>propionate</b> synthesized in this reaction has the fragrance of rum and is used in the food industry. The experiments were carried out in a stirred batch reactor at temperatures from 318 K to 348 K. As a solvent, 1, 4 dioxan was used. The effects of the amount of catalyst used, the reaction time, the stirring speed, and the reaction temperature on the synthesis of <b>isobutyl</b> <b>propionate</b> were investigated. It was observed that solid-liquid external mass transfer resistance resulting from various stirring speeds was absent. It was also found that the reaction depended on temperature. A pseudohomogeneous model for Amberlyst- 15 was developed from the experimental data. The activation energy and the equilibrium constant of this reaction were calculated to be 52. 03 kJ. mol− 1 and 5. 19, respectively. The expression of the reaction rate as a function of temperature was determined for the synthesis of <b>isobutyl</b> <b>propionate...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{esterification}} reaction of propionic acid with isobutyl alcohol to produce <b>isobutyl</b> <b>propionate</b> and water was studied. The performance of esterification reaction was compared {{by using the}} batch process and the pervaporation assisted hybrid process which performs the reaction and separation simultaneously. A polyvinyl alcohol–polyethersulphone (PVA–PES) hydrophilic polymeric membrane {{was used in the}} study to separate water and also to shift the equilibrium. The influence of process parameters such as catalyst loading, molar ratio of acid to alcohol, reaction temperature and ratio of membrane area to initial reaction volume (S/V) was studied. The results showed that the pervaporation assisted esterification process gave more conversion than the batch process of esterification. The membrane showed high selectivity to the removal of water in the propionic acid, isobutyl alcohol, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>propionate</b> and water mixture. Moreover, the conversion of propionic acid was enhanced by enhancing the catalyst amount, molar ratio of acid to alcohol, reaction temperature and S/V ratio...|$|E

Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of Porapak-Q-trapped volatiles with both flame ionization (FID) and electroantennographic detection (EAD) using male or femaleR. phoenicis antennae revealed several EAD-active compounds. They were identified as: ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> ethyl butyrate, and ethyl isobutyrate. In field experiments in the La Me Research Station, Côte d'Ivoire, ethyl propionate (50 mg/ 24 hr) but not all esters combined (50 mg/ 24 hr each) significantly increased capture ofR. phoenicis in pheromone-baited (3 mg/ 24 hr) traps. One kilogram of 1 - to 3 -day-old palm tissue was significantly more effective than ethyl propionate in enhancing pheromone attraction. Superior attraction of palm tissue {{may be attributed to}} additional as yet unknown semiochemicals. Alternatively, release rates and/or ratios of synthetic volatiles differed from those of palm tissue at peak attraction.
