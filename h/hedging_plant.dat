500|$|Persoonia linearis {{is useful}} as a <b>hedging</b> <b>plant</b> and {{responds}} well to pruning. Its foliage {{has been used in}} floral arrangements, and its colourful bark is a horticultural feature. It is a fairly easy plant to grow in gardens, but is rarely seen due to difficulties in propagation. Germination from seed is low, and can take many months. Once established it can tolerate extended dry periods and is hardy to frosts. Optimum growing conditions are part shade and a well-drained acid soil, though P.linearis grows readily in full sun. Persoonias in general are sensitive to excessive phosphorus, and grow without fertiliser or with low-phosphorus slow-release formulations. They can also become deficient in iron and manganese. First cultivated in England in 1794 from seed, it was also reportedly propagated from cuttings; Andrews described it as a [...] "handsome greenhouse plant, continuing to flower through the autumnal months and producing good seeds." [...] Joseph Knight reported that cuttings would be successful as long as material was [...] "judiciously chosen", and that plants had set seed on occasion.|$|E
