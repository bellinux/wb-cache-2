Available {{online at}} DOI: 10. 1109 /EIDWT. 2012. 46 It has been {{accepted}} by Cloud Computing vendors that retrieving data from a cloud environment once they have been deleted is next to impossible. This constitutes a major hurdle for the digital forensics examiner as it greatly limits the pool of potential evidence that could be collected during an investigation. In this concept paper we will discuss {{a different approach to}} the above problem that spans across two different worlds: the world of digital forensics and the world of artificial intelligence. Block-based hash analysis works by calculating a hash value for each block of the target file that would be allocated a sector or cluster to store its data. The block hashes are then stored in a map <b>file.</b> The <b>examiner</b> then searches secondary memory areas to see if they contain blocks matching those contained in the map <b>files.</b> The <b>examiner</b> then has the ability to rebuild any file whose blocks have been located. The processes of hash-map calculation and analysis in the case of graphic images is accomplished using a single, dual-purpose EnScript in EnCase. Where a suspect file has been partially but not completely located the script will produce a PNG graphic showing exactly which blocks of the graphic have been located. This technique is extremely time and processor intensive, and does not work for unknown broken files. We hypothesize that we can use Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map algorithms in order to classify broken chains of previously unknown files, and in the future reconstruct them in order to be examined by the digital forensic examiner using the block-based hash analysis technique. ?? 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{complete}} and accurate identification of fatal occupational injuries among the US {{work force is}} {{an important first step}} in developing work injury prevention efforts. Numerous sources of information, such as death certificates, Workers' Compensation files, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) <b>files,</b> medical <b>examiner</b> records, state health and labor department reports, and various combinations of these, have been used to identify cases of work-related fatal injuries. Recent studies have questioned the effectiveness of these sources for identifying such cases. METHODS: At least 10 studies have used multiple sources to define the universe of fatal work injuries within a state and to determine the capture rates, or proportion of the universe identified, by each source. Results of these studies, which are not all available in published literature, are summarized here in a format that allows researchers to readily compare the ascertainment capabilities of the sources. RESULTS: The overall average capture rates of sources were as follows: death certificates, 81 %; medical examiner records, 61 %; Workers' Compensation reports, 57 %; and OSHA reports 32 %. Variations by state and value added through the use of multiple sources are presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of 10 state-based studies summarizes the effectiveness of various source documents for capturing cases of fatal occupational injuries to help researchers make informed decisions when designing occupational injury surveillance systems...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} was {{the number}} 1 cause of poisoning deaths in the United States from 1980 through 1988, with the highest rates reported in the western states. We studied unintentional deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning in New Mexico during this period using the multiple-cause mortality files from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and data from the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator (OMI). We compared the nationally available NCHS data with the more detailed OMI data to determine the sensitivity of NCHS data for the surveillance of this preventable cause of death. The NCHS data were 88 % sensitive in identifying deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and had a positive predictive value of 81 % when compared with OMI data. Half of the unintentional carbon monoxide-related deaths were attributable to a home heating mechanism of some sort, 46 % involved motor vehicle exhaust, and at least 42 % were associated with alcohol use. We conclude that available NCHS data are a sensitive source of surveillance information about unintentional deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Autopsy records (n = 5, 871) from the medical <b>examiner's</b> <b>files</b> at Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia were examined and 495 persons (8. 4 %) were identified with positive toxicologic findings for cocaine. Of these, six subjects (1. 2 %) had total thrombotic occlusion, involving primarily the left anterior descending coronary artery. The mean number of adventitial mast cells per coronary segment and the degree of atherosclerosis were determined. These observations were compared with findings in age- and gender-matched subjects who died from cocaine overdose and in patients who had sudden cardiac death (acute thrombosis) without a history of illicit drug abuse. There were significantly more mast cells in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis than in the other groups. The number of mast cells showed a significant correlation with the degree of cross-sectional luminal narrowing (r = 0. 68) in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis but not in subjects with sudden death due to thrombosis (r = 0. 34, p 75 % cross-sectional area luminal narrowing) despite a mean age of 29 ± 2 years. These findings suggest that adventitial mast cells may potentiate atherosclerosis and vasospasm, thrombosis and premature sudden death in long-term cocaine abusers...|$|R
40|$|Naloxone {{administration}} {{is an important}} component of resuscitation attempts by emergency medical services (EMS) for opioid drug overdoses. However, EMS providers must first recognize the possibility of opioid overdose in clinical encounters. As part of a public health response to an outbreak of opioid overdoses in Rhode Island, we examined missed opportunities for naloxone administration and factors potentially influencing EMS providers' decision to administer naloxone. We reviewed medical <b>examiner</b> <b>files</b> on all individuals who died of an opioid-related drug overdose in Rhode Island from January 1, 2012 through March 31, 2014, underwent attempted resuscitation by EMS providers, and had records available to assess for naloxone administration. We evaluated whether these individuals received naloxone as part of their resuscitation efforts and compared patient and scene characteristics of those who received naloxone to those who did not receive naloxone via chi-square, t-test, and logistic regression analyses. One hundred and twenty-four individuals who underwent attempted EMS resuscitation died due to opioid overdose. Naloxone was administered during EMS resuscitation attempts in 82 (66. 1 %) of cases. Females were nearly three-fold as likely not to receive naloxone as males (OR 2. 9; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 7. 0; p-value 0. 02). Additionally, patients without signs of potential drug abuse also had a greater than three-fold odds of not receiving naloxone (OR 3. 3; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 9. 2; p-value 0. 02). Older individuals, particularly those over age 50, were more likely not to receive naloxone than victims younger than age 30 (OR 4. 8; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 17. 4; p-value 0. 02). Women, older individuals, and those patients without clear signs of illicit drug abuse, were less likely to receive naloxone in EMS resuscitation attempts. Heightened clinical suspicion for opioid overdose is important given the recent increase in overdoses among patients due to prescription opioids.

40|$|Handwriting and {{signature}} {{comparisons are}} frequently performed in forensic investigations of documents. Mistakes in conclusion {{might be due}} to lack of sufficient documentation and information. Many factors can affect handwriting and signature. These factors are divided into two groups: dependent or independent of the individual at the time the handwriting or signature is made. Therefore, the situations leading to differences between individuals and in the individual’s own handwriting and signature should be determined. Currently, average life expectancy and quality have increased due to the developments in health services. Thus, an increasing number of elderly people are engaged in an active daily life and trade. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) can develop in the elderly; this is a condition that could alter handwriting and signature considerably over time. In forensic document examination, comparing the document in question containing handwriting or signature with the original documents prepared before the document in question was prepared is important. However, if alterations have developed secondary to a disease, the documents prepared before and after the disease affected the individual should be assessed together. Likewise, in the present case, the examiners making comparisons using handwriting and signatures from different periods reached entirely different conclusions. The case is a bill prepared in 1994. The payee of the bill is a male born in 1925 and diagnosed with AD shortly before his death in 1998. The indebted person in the bill is the payee’s spouse. For the assessment of handwriting and signature, the first endorsement consisting of the handwritten name and signature was used. Several expert reports regarding the same document had been commissioned; these reached different views. The document was sent to The Council of Forensic Medicine to assess the identification and the previous reports. After re-evaluation, the handwriting was declared to belong to the payee. In this study, the reason that the experts delivered opposing opinions on the identification of a document handwritten by a person with AD after being referred to court was investigated. Based on the judicial <b>file,</b> the document <b>examiners</b> did not have the opportunity to evaluate all factors affecting the handwriting or signature of the individual, and an adequate number of handwriting and signature examples were not collected for comparison. Consequently, the examiners reached differing opinions. Thus, the above-mentioned factors are necessary to derive a satisfactory and accurate opinion regarding the identification of handwriting or signature.

40|$|Executive Summary Background In North Carolina, {{the number}} of deaths from unintentional drug overdoses has {{increased}} more than 300 percent in just over a decade, from 279 in 1999 to 1, 140 in 2011. An increasing proportion of these deaths come from prescription drugs as opposed to illicit drugs. In particular, prescription opioids are involved in a majority of unintentional drug overdose deaths. Prescription drug overdose deaths are preventable, yet the death toll continues to increase. This dramatic increase is a relatively new phenomenon and the regulatory structure around prescription drugs differs in important ways from the one around illicit drugs. With that in mind, the goal {{of this paper is to}} examine and evaluate the current public health surveillance systems and law enforcement records with regard to unintentional prescription drug overdoses in North Carolina. In particular, it looks at the extent to which these systems record information about the source of the drugs involved in the overdose. Before we can design effective interventions to reduce unintentional overdoses, we need to know how victims obtain the drugs that contribute to their deaths, as well as whether and where that information exists. Policy Options There are many paths through which those at risk of a fatal prescription drug overdose may obtain the drugs that contribute to their deaths, including through legitimate prescriptions; doctor shopping; non-legitimate prescriptions (“pill mills”); receiving, purchasing, or stealing from family or friends; and purchasing on the street. Each path requires a different type of intervention; therefore, determining the relative importance of each path will guide recommendations for improving existing policies or implementing new ones. Several programs have already been implemented in North Carolina, each primarily addressing one source. These include Project Lazarus (legitimate prescriptions), the North Carolina Controlled Substances Reporting System (CSRS) (doctor shopping), the State Bureau of Investigation’s Diversion and Environmental Crimes Unit (non-legitimate prescriptions and purchasing on the street), and Operation Medicine Cabinet (receiving or stealing from family or friends). Data and Methods Using a data set compiled by the North Carolina Division of Public Health’s Injury and Violence Prevention Branch, I analyzed the characteristics of the unintentional pharmaceutical-related overdose deaths in North Carolina from 2010. This data set included information from death certificates, medical <b>examiner</b> <b>files,</b> and controlled substance prescription records. The analysis included categorizing cases according to the number and currency of controlled substance prescriptions as well as according to the types of drugs contributing to death. I also looked for evidence of diversion among the cases. This included identifying doctor shopping using three different criteria as well as identifying other types of diversion from information available in the medical examiner narratives. Finally, I evaluated how providers, pharmacists, and the State Bureau of Investigation are using the North Carolina Controlled Substance Reporting System. Results Of the 707 cases that were analyzed, unintentional prescription overdose victims were more likely to be male, white, and/or between the ages of 35 and 54. Over half of the cases (57 percent) had at least one current prescription for a controlled substance at the time of death. Additionally, of those who did have at least one current prescription, 72 percent had a current prescription for a drug that also contributed to their deaths. Opioids were by far the most common type of drug to contribute to death. Overall, opioids contributed to 94 percent of deaths, followed by benzodiazepines at 28 percent. In fact, all of the top ten specific drugs (e. g., oxycodone, alprazolam) to contribute to death were either an opioid or a benzodiazepine. Opioids and benzodiazepines were also more likely to contribute to death for those cases who had at least one current prescription for a contributory drug than for those who did not. The three doctor shopping criteria produced widely varying estimates, from a low of 16 cases using medical examiner narratives to a high of 252 cases using a criterion of filling prescriptions from at least five different prescribers in one year. The medical examiner narratives contained information about diversion sources for 78 cases, the most common source mentioned being receiving or stealing from family or friends. Fewer than half of the cases were looked up in the CSRS by anyone in the year before their deaths, which may have contributed to excessive prescriptions. Conclusions and Policy Implications Although North Carolina currently has a system in place that is intended to ensure that controlled substances are prescribed and used safely, unintentional overdoses from these drugs continue to increase. Though they are not definitive, these results provide at least preliminary evidence about where the system is failing, which can in turn guide potential policy changes. The following recommendations are based on my evaluation of the current public health surveillance system and law enforcement records: •	Promote and evaluate increased use of the CSRS among prescribers and pharmacists when prescribing or dispensing an opioid or benzodiazepine. •	Develop criteria to identify unusual or suspicious patterns of prescribing by providers. •	Develop police investigation guidelines for collecting consistent information related to intent and to the source of the contributing drug(s). •	Create a comprehensive surveillance system to monitor and analyze prescription drug overdose trends over time. However, any policy to reduce overdose deaths should minimize a “chilling effect,” which would unnecessarily restrict access to these drugs for those who have a legitimate need for them. Additionally, a comprehensive strategy to reduce overdose deaths should also attempt to reduce spillover from prescription drug overdoses to heroin overdoses, as well as address the demand side of prescription drug abuse...|$|R
