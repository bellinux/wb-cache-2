In this field the technique of <b>gold</b> <b>tooling</b> had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.

50|$|A Western {{style of}} {{ornament}} {{based on the}} Islamic arabesque developed, beginning in late 15th century Venice; it has been called either moresque or western arabesque (a term with a complicated history). It {{has been used in}} a great variety of the decorative arts but has been especially long-lived in book design and bookbinding, where small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day. It is seen in <b>gold</b> <b>tooling</b> on covers, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page.

50|$|In the 19th century, hot {{stamping}} became a popular method of applying <b>gold</b> <b>tooling</b> or embossing in book printing. The first patent for {{hot stamping}} {{was recorded in}} Germany by Ernst Oeser in 1892. Originally used on leather and paper, the method became a popular means of marking plastic from the 1950s on. It {{is also one of}} the most commonly used methods of security printing.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of Ratcliff's career, he did plain bookbinding using leather from domestic sheep and calves. He decorated the covers with fashions of blind tooling typical of the time period. Later Englishman Ratcliff departed from the normal bookbinding practices and used higher quality and more sophisticated methods, including pasteboard covers instead of wooden boards, and imported Morocco leather instead of domestic leather. He also used marbled end papers instead of plain end papers and did <b>gold</b> <b>tooling</b> instead of blind tooling. The work of typical American colonial bookbinders was crude when compared to Ratcliff's.|$|E

She worked on commissioned projects and for exhibitions, and her work was noted for her use of <b>gold</b> <b>tooling</b> and blind tooling. Some of her most significant works were the binding of a book to present to Queen Alexandra in 1906, and the binding and decoration of an illuminated address presented {{by the city of}} Dunedin to the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward in 1908.|$|E

5000|$|De Picques is {{acknowledged}} to have created {{some of the}} finest decorative bindings of his era.France was taking over from Italy as the center of artistic bookbinding during the early sixteenth century. Political upheaval in Italy, the Sack of Rome in 1527, and the French occupation of Milan had caused innovations such as <b>gold</b> <b>tooling</b> to reach to France, where they were swiftly embraced and refined. The Franco-Ottoman alliance brought high-quality morocco leather and an influx of highly proficient gilders. French bookbinders began manufacturing gold-tooled books in 1507.

50|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover. Few crafts can give as much satisfaction as bookbinding—from making a cloth cover for a paperback, or binding magazines and newspapers for storage, or to the ultimate achievement of a fine binding in full leather with handmade lettering and <b>gold</b> <b>tooling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This Museo Galileo {{microscope}} is {{a compound}} microscope made of cardboard, leather and wood, and is inserted in an iron support with three curved legs. The outer tube {{is covered in}} green vellum decorated with <b>gold</b> <b>tooling.</b> There are three lenses (an objective lens, a field lens, and an eyepiece), all double-convex. The objective measures 11 mm in diameter and has a thickness of 3.5 mm. The glass is clear with few imperfections; the edge is ground {{and there are some}} fine chips. The field lens (diameter 30 mm, thickness 4.7 mm) is in a cell that pushes {{into the bottom of the}} inner tube. The glass is amber-green, with air bubbles, and has a ground edge that is chipped; the eyepiece, with an aperture of 24 mm, also has some bubbles; it is protected by a wooden cap that screws onto the mount. The instrument is attributed to Giuseppe Campani, an Italian optician and astronomer who lived in Rome during the latter half of the 17th century, known as an expert lens grinder and instrument maker. Compound microscopes such as this first appeared in Europe around 1620 including one demonstrated by Cornelis Drebbel in London (around 1621) and one exhibited in Rome in 1624.|$|E
