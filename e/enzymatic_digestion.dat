Gel-based size selection is not recommended for this method since it can cause melting of DNA double strands and DNA damage as the results of UV exposure.

40|$|Ephedra sinica polysaccharides {{have been}} {{reported}} to possess important activities, so quality evaluation of polysaccharides from the genus Ephedra is urgent. In this study, <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestions</b> were performed to establish multiple saccharide fingerprints by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-TQ-MS/MS) based on a multiple-reaction monitoring in negative mode. Under optimum UPLC-ESI [...] TQ-MS/MS conditions, excellent separation and quantification of 21 constituents were achieved within 20 min on a solid core column with a 1. 6 μm particle using pre-column derivatization with a PMP reagent. This method, coupled with <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestions</b> and principal component analysis, has been successfully applied to characterize and discriminate Ephedra polysaccharides attributed to different species and plant parts. The results suggest that the proposed analytical strategy could achieve a quality evaluation of plant polysaccharides from traditional Chinese medicines...|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{process for}} use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°–60°C in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestion</b> may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground {{with little or no}} washing or hulling.|$|E
500|$|Usage of {{the term}} amino acid in the English {{language}} is from 1898. Proteins were found to yield amino acids after <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestion</b> or acid hydrolysis.

2500|$|For plasmid manipulations, other site-directed {{mutagenesis}} techniques have been supplanted largely by techniques {{that are highly}} efficient but relatively simple, easy to use, and commercially available as a kit. [...] An example of these techniques is the Quikchange method, wherein a pair of complementary mutagenic primers are used to amplify the entire plasmid in a thermocycling reaction using a high-fidelity non-strand-displacing DNA polymerase such as pfu polymerase. [...] The reaction generates a nicked, circular DNA. [...] The template DNA must be eliminated by <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestion</b> with a restriction enzyme such as DpnI, which is specific for methylated DNA. [...] All DNA produced from most Escherichia coli strains would be methylated; the template plasmid that is biosynthesized in E. coli will, therefore, be digested, while the mutated plasmid, which is generated in vitro and is therefore unmethylated, would be left undigested. Note that, in these double-strand plasmid mutagenesis methods, while the thermocycling reaction may be used, the DNA need not be exponentially amplified as in a PCR. Instead, the amplification is linear, and it is therefore inaccurate to describe them as a PCR, {{since there is no}} chain reaction.|$|E

Complex mixtures of APTS-labeled neutral and acidic N-glycans were resolved using capillary zone electrophoresis coupled with laser-induced fluorescence detector. All separations were carried out on a polyacrylamide coated capillary with reduced electroosmotic flow. N-glycan pools released from several standard glycoproteins were analyzed in order to generate a migration time database used for the identification of N-glycans released from more complicated samples. In addition, <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestions</b> using specific and non-specific exoglycosidases were used to positively identify glycan isomeric structures...|$|R
2500|$|The {{remarkable}} {{stability of}} cyclotides {{means that they}} have an exciting range of potential applications centred on either their intrinsic biological activities or the possibility of using the CCK motif as a scaffold for stabilizing biologically active epitopes. [...] Interest in these has recently intensified with the publications of a chemical methodology capable of synthetically producing cyclotides with high yields, and the amenability of the CCK framework to amino-acid substitutions. [...] But for molecules to be useful in a therapeutic setting they require useful biopharmaceutical characteristics such as resistance to proteolysis and membrane permeability. The membrane interactive surface area and moment of the cyclotides are determinants in the prediction of their biological activities. A recent study on related cystine knot proteins as drug candidates showed that cystine knots do permeate well through rat small intestinal mucosa relative to non-cystine knot peptide drugs such as insulin and bacitracin. Furthermore, <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestion</b> of cystine knot peptide drugs was associated with only a few proteases and it was suggested that this limitation may be overcome by mutating out particular cleavage sites. Thus, certain cystine knot proteins satisfy the basic criteria for drug delivery and represent exciting novel candidates as scaffolds for peptide drug delivery. [...] The diverse range of intrinsic activities of cyclotides also continues to hold promise {{for a wide range of}} applications in the agricultural fields against insects and nematodes, especially those from Clitoria ternatea.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{methodology for}} predicting the time-course of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestions</b> is described. The model is {{based solely on}} the enzyme's subsite architecture and concomitant binding energies. This allows subsite binding energies to be used to predict the evolution of the relative amounts of different products during the digestion of arbitrary mixtures of oligomeric or polymeric substrates. The methodology has been specifically demonstrated by studying the fragmentation of a population of oligogalacturonides of varying degrees of polymerization, when digested by endo-polygalacturonase II (endo-PG II) from Aspergillus niger.

40|$|AbstractThe {{complete}} {{amino acid}} sequence of protein S 14 from the small subunit of Bacillus stearothermophilus was determined by N-terminal sequence analysis and by sequencing of overlapping peptides obtained from <b>enzymatic</b> <b>digestions.</b> Protein S 14 consists of 60 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 7148 Da. It has a high content of basic amino acids and a predicted isoelectric point of 11. 46. Protein S 14 contains two pairs of cysteines in the carboxyl-terminal region, presumably linked by two sulphur bridges. A comparison between protein S 14 of B. stearothermophilus and homologous proteins from other organisms revealed highly conserved carboxyl-termini for this protein in eubacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes...|$|R

40|$|Three {{antigenic}} fractions {{from the}} cell walls of eight strains of mycobacteria were studied.

The CWT antigens, as compared with purified protein derivatives (human), were relatively species (group) -specific in both double immunodiffusion and guinea pig skin tests; in the latter, the reactions resembled those of delayed hypersensitivity.

Clear differences between the MAV- 1 (FL) and MAV- 2 (K 87) genomes were observed after cleavage with restriction enzymes such as BglII, EcoRI, and PaeR 7. Fast electrophoresis of DNA fragments in miniature agarose slab gels allowed rapid and unequivocal identification of the MAV strains.
