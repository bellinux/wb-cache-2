40|$|We {{present a}} model that leads to an {{equilibrium}} with characteristics similar to the following stylized facts observed in retail markets: (a) Retailers advertise only selected brands; (b) Often low priced advertised brands are understocked; (c) <b>In-store</b> <b>promotions</b> are biased towards more expensive substitute brands. Together these practices constitute illegal bait and switch. Is this phenomenon necessarily harmful to consumers and to the economy? We show that bait and switch can benefit consumers because utility is created through <b>in-store</b> <b>promotions</b> and price competition is enhanced.

40|$|This thesis focuses {{primarily}} on two <b>in-store</b> <b>promotions</b> currently {{used as a}} marketing strategy by Norwegian Seafood Council to spread the awareness of Norwegian salmon. Due to {{the uncertainty of the}} effects of these promotions on the average Chinese consumers’ purchase behavior and attention, the authors have decided to conduct a research to find out which of these are the most cost-efficient, and how Norwegian Seafood Council may improve their <b>in-store</b> <b>promotions</b> in order to reach a greater audience. The core structure of this thesis (the data collection) is based on the Model of Consumer Behavior, which represents the factors influencing the consumer purchase behavior. Through the information collected and the results of the research {{it is clear that the}} <b>in-store</b> <b>promotions</b> do not support the sales of salmon, as previously believed by Norwegian Seafood Council. One of the reasons may be the noise in the communication process and the lack of differentiation from other promotional activities. Additionally, most of the purchase decisions are made prior to purchase, so that the promotion on Point-of-Sale may continue to be unrewarded. Due to this statement, Norwegian Seafood Council needs to focus on reaching the potential salmon consumers prior to their shopping trip, and use the Point-of-Sale activities to enhance the learning process for the consumer, thus increasing brand awareness. This will allow Norwegian salmon to become a part of the consumer’s evoked set. Furthermore, the activity's design needs to be in accordance with Norwegian Seafood Council’s desired activity results in order for the message to come across clearly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} consumer purchase behavior and <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion</b> proneness across five promotion types. The model was tested with data collected from a consumer survey, {{carried out in the}} high/low Croatian hypermarket setting.

Higher consumer deal-proneness was associated with promotion planning (except for advertised brands and free samples), <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion</b> search and purchases of promoted items (except for special island displays). Contrary to expectations, action store loyalty was positively related to deal-proneness. The framework provided helps retailers predict consumer response to <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion</b> and their purchases depending on deal-proneness, as the starting point in designing promotion campaign and enhancing the store competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is {{initiated by the}} phenomenon of competitive rivalry between the two giant convenience stores (Alfamart and Indomaret) in Indonesia. Alfamart must strive to improve the patronage intention of its customers {{so that they do}} not switch to its main competitor, Indomaret. The purpose of the research was to compare patronage intention and store image between Alfamart and Indomaret. Additionally, this research clarified the influence of the components in the retail mix, which were <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion,</b> store atmosphere, convenience, and merchandise between Alfamart and Indomaret in the formation of store image and its impact on patronage intention. The research methods were independent t-test and path analysis. Independent t-test aimed to find differences that occurred between Alfamart and Indomaret especially the differences in the components of the retail mix, store image, and patronage intention. Meanwhile, path analysis was to determine the effect of the retail mix to store image and patronage intention. After processing the data, it is shown that both variables which are the components of the retail mix, store image, and patronage intention are surpassed by Alfamart. In Alfamart, there are significant influences of <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion,</b> convenience, and merchandise to the store image and patronage intention. Similarly, <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion,</b> merchandise, and store image have direct influence on patronage intention. Meanwhile, for Indomaret, there is the influence of the <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion,</b> convenience, and merchandise to store image and patronage intention with conditions that store atmosphere and store image have a direct influence on the patronage intention...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{competition}} {{caused by}} globalization, high growth of some emerging markets and stagnation of developed economies motivate Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) manufacturers to drive {{their attention to}} emerging markets. These companies are expected to adapt their marketing activities to the particularities of these markets in order to succeed. In a country classified as emerging market, regions are not alike and some contrasts can be identified. In addition, divergences of marketing variables effect can also be observed in the different retail formats. The retail formats in emerging markets can be segregated in chain self-service and traditional full-service. Thus, understanding the effectiveness of marketing mix not only in country aggregated level data {{can be an important}} contribution. Inasmuch as companies aim to generate profits from emerging markets, price is an important marketing variable in the process of creating competitive advantage. Along with price, promotional variables such as in-store displays and price cut are often viewed as temporary incentives to increase short-term sales. Managers defend the usage of promotions as being the most reliable and fastest manner to increase sales and then short-term profits. However, some authors alert about sales promotions disadvantages; mainly in the long-term. This study investigates the effect of price and in-store promotions on sales volume in different regions within an emerging market. The database used is at SKU level for juice, being segregated in the Brazilian northeast and southeast regions and corresponding to the period from January 2011 to January 2013. The methodological approach is descriptive quantitative involving validation tests, application of multivariate and temporal series analysis method. The Vector-Autoregressive (VAR) model was used to perform the analysis. Results suggest similar price sensitivity in the northeast and southeast region and greater <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion</b> sensitivity in the northeast. Price reductions show negative results in the long-term (persistent sales in six months) and <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion,</b> positive results. <b>In-store</b> <b>promotion</b> shows no significant influence on sales in chain self-service stores while price demonstrates no relevant impact on sales in traditional full-service stores. Hence, this study contributes to the business environment for companies wishing to manage price and sales promotions for consumer brands in regions with different features within an emerging market. As a theoretical contribution, this study fills an academic gap providing a dedicated price and sales promotion study to contrast regions in an emerging market...|$|E

We demonstrate that the key reason behind this development was most probably the massive <b>in-store</b> <b>promotions</b> that were decreasing the price gap between private labels and branded products. Managerial implications of these findings for both manufacturers and retailers within the region are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Recently, many {{commodity}} groups have shifted promotion expenditures from generic advertising to non-advertising {{activities such as}} <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion</b> programs. Accordingly, corresponding evaluation methods {{need to be developed}} to identify the benefits of these non-advertising programs. We develop a general framework to assess product sales performance of in-store shelf-space management programs in retail stores. The framework was applied to the evaluation of dairy case management programs in the Northwestern Hudson Valley market, New York. Simulation results on fluid milk product sales indicate that preferred product locations vary between smaller convenience stores and larger supermarket retailers. On average, the dairy case management program was estimated to improve product sales 6 to 10 % at the retailer level. [Econlit subject codes: M 300, Q 130 ] © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Marketing is {{essential}} to influence consumers’ impulsive purchasing behavior and due to the fast development of both electronic and mobile commerce new ways of advertising have emerged. Mobile marketing is a channel {{that has the potential}} to be more effective than traditional mass media channels since it allows organizations to build personal relationships with their customers. The purpose of this thesis is to examine how different mobile marketing channels can influence consumers’ desire to purchase clothes impulsively online. This research is of descriptive and explanatory character and in order to answer the research purpose a quantitative study was conducted, where a questionnaire was randomly distributed to people in the city center of Luleå. The results suggest that individuals with a positive view towards SMS- and in-app advertising also react positively to online <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion.</b> Thus, the interactive effects between these promotional channels increase individuals’ general online impulsive purchasing tendency.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that many {{consumer}} goods manufacturers believe that their promotions are not well executed in retail stores. One common concern is that in-store promotions are not synchronized with television and online advertising campaigns. In recent years, RFID has been actively promoted as a tool to improve <b>in-store</b> <b>promotion</b> execution. This paper presents the results of a study in which promotional displays were tagged with RFID tags and tracked as they moved from a retail distribution center to a number of different retail stores. The analysis shows that only 28 % of all displays are placed on the shop floor within +/- 3 days of the official promotion launch. Our analysis suggests that by adjusting the timing of the delivery to the store the performance could be improved such that 87 % of all displays are present on the shop floor within this time frame. The results confirm that RFID is a useful diagnostics tool to measure promotion execution performance and to identify business process shortcomings. The results also suggest that a continuous measurement via RFID is not required to improve performance...|$|E
