About [...] of equipment was hauled to the base from the ice shelf. The base was prefabricated and only required the modules to be connected at site. New infrastructure included a new generator, <b>emergency</b> <b>station,</b> garage, provision stores, container ramps for equipment and fuel, and more laboratories. At the same time, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute established a meteorological station at Troll.|$|E
2500|$|... "Instruction No. 12" [...] {{was issued}} on 17 September and covered {{equipment}} {{to be carried}} into action, the attachment of a troop of Light Horse to Major-General Harold Walker, the Divisional commander, to carry orders and restrictions {{on the use of}} telephones in the front line, intended to obstruct German eavesdropping. Instructions [...] 18 September and the start of the attack, covered late changes, such as reserving the use of telephones to unit commanders and the provision of two wireless tanks, for the south-east corner of Glencorse Wood for local use and as an <b>emergency</b> <b>station</b> for both Australian divisions.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Allies {{were having}} {{problems}} as well. From 10:00 to 18.40, 72 land-based bombers of the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) {{from the mainland}} attacked their fleet. Unlike the dive-bombers favored by the Germans, Italian bombers operated in formations at high altitudes {{during the early stages}} of the war, about twelve thousand feet. While scores of bombs were dropped by the Italians, a single hit on [...] represented the outcome of two major attacks. This was a serious hit on the bridge, killing the captain, six officers and eleven ratings. In addition, three officers and six ratings were wounded. The forward fire control and the steering equipment was destroyed, and for the rest of the battle, she would be commanded from the <b>emergency</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{locate the}} road <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> in Fars {{province}} based on using spatial multi-criteria decision making (Delphi method). Methods: In this study, the criteria affecting {{the location of}} road <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> have been identified through Delphi method and their importance was determined using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). With regard {{to the importance of}} the criteria and by using Geographical Information System (GIS), the appropriateness of the existing stations with the criteria and the way of their distribution has been explored, and the appropriate arenas for creating new <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> were determined. In order to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the stations, Moran’s Index was used. Results: The accidents (0. 318), placement position (0. 235), time (0. 198), roads (0. 160), and population (0. 079) were introduced as the main criteria in location road <b>emergency</b> <b>stations.</b> The findings showed that the distribution of the existing stations was clustering (Moran’s I= 0. 3). Three priorities were introduced for establishing new stations. Some arenas including Abade, north of Eghlid and Khoram bid, and small parts of Shiraz, Farashband, Bavanat, and Kazeroon were suggested as the first priority. Conclusion: GIS is a useful and applicable tool in investigating spatial distribution and geographical accessibility to the setting that provide health care, including <b>emergency</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of service, Metrolink had plans to extend the line north to the Antelope Valley but these plans were expedited by almost 10 years following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The earthquake caused {{the collapse of the}} freeway connector of State Route 14 (the Antelope Valley Freeway) onto Interstate 5 (the Golden State Freeway) at the Newhall Pass interchange, forcing all traffic to use the parallel 2 lane truck bypass that was unaffected by the quake. With funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency the Southern California Regional Rail Authority constructed an emergency extension of the line to Lancaster to help relieve the traffic bottleneck. The U.S. Navy Seabees construction battalion and crews from the L.A. County Public Works Department were able to construct the stations in just a few days, compared to the normal three to six months. <b>Emergency</b> <b>stations</b> in Lancaster and Palmdale were both built in just three days and Metrolink started operating trains one week after the earthquake struck. Over the next five weeks additional <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> were added in Sylmar/San Fernando, Vincent Grade/Acton and Santa Clarita (Via Princessa). While most of the <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> have since been replaced with permanent stations, the Via Princessa station still uses the same platform built after the earthquake.|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} {{planning of}} <b>emergency</b> service <b>stations</b> is crucial, {{especially in the}} populated cities with heavy tra±c conditions such as Istanbul. In this paper, we propose a Backup Double Covering Model (BDCM), {{a variant of the}} well-known Maximal Covering Location Problem, that requires two types of services to plan the <b>emergency</b> service <b>stations.</b> The objective of the model is to maximize the total population serviced using two distinct <b>emergency</b> service <b>stations</b> in di®erent time limits where the total number of stations is limited. We propose a Tabu Search (TS) approach to solve the problem. We conduct an extensive experimental study on randomly generated data set with di®erent parameters to demonstrate the e®ectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we apply our TS approach for planning the <b>emergency</b> service <b>stations</b> in Istanbul...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the states of health care personnel, working at 112 <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> in the province of Artvin, to encounter with regarding forensic cases and determine their practices aimed at recognizing, protecting, and reporting the evidences that may affect the forensic process. Materials and methodsThis descriptive study was conducted with nurses and emergency medicine technicians working at 112 <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> in Artvin between January 2013 and February 2014. ResultsOf 141 health personnel that constituted sample of the study, 48. 9 % were nurses, 9. 9 % emergency medicine technicians, and 41. 1 % ambulance and emergency care technicians. The rate of feeling sufficient in coping with forensic cases and incidents was 20. 6 %. There was a lower rate of receiving education about the approach towards forensic cases (15. 6 %). In the study, the frequency of encountering with at least one forensic case was 88. 7 %. Traffic accidents (72. 5 %), suicides (41. 5 %) and assaults (41. 5 %) were among the most frequent reasons of forensic cases. The practices of nurses were more successful in woundings by firearms compared to other health personnel (p <  0. 05). The rate of recognizing the evidences was 81. 6 – 96. 5 %. Almost one fourth of the personnel had no sufficient information about storing and protecting the evidences. ConclusionsThe personnel working at 112 <b>emergency</b> <b>stations</b> in the province of Artvin frequently encounter with forensic cases. The personnel with higher educational level and nurses have more successful practices in forensic cases. Health personnel have approaches that may negatively affect the solution of forensic cases...|$|R
