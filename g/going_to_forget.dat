500|$|... "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] {{was written}} by Mexican {{songwriter}} Roberto Belester for Bronco's album Salvaje y Tierno (1991). Belester composed songs for several well-known Mexican bands such as Los Yonic's and Los Bukis. The song tells of a protagonist who is leaving his lover and tells her that he is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> her. In 1993, Mexican singer-songwriter Cristian Castro covered the song on his second studio album, Un Segundo en el Tiempo, which was produced by Alex Zepeda and released as the lead single from the album. According to Castro, he bought Salvaje y Tierno after hearing [...] "Que No Quede Huella" [...] {{on the radio and}} wanted to cover [...] "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] when he listened to it on the CD. [...] The music video for Castro's cover was produced by Jorge Guerrero Fox Garza and filmed in Cuernavaca which features shots of Castro alone in an old country house near the fireplace and outside on the field remembering a woman he loved.|$|E
500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was convinced that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

I've just chatted about fjords, or whatever they are, but one of these days---- No. I won't do it. I {{want to stay here}} in Seattle a few days, and take you on jolly picnics, but---- Would you rather I didn't even do that?

5000|$|On July 5, Orioles {{designated}} hitter Nelson Cruz went 3-for-3 {{with a double}} off of Lackey.

He entered his club to play from five <b>to</b> seven, before <b>going</b> home <b>to</b> dinner, <b>forgetting</b> for those two hours whatever was distasteful in his life, as though the game were a beneficent drug for allaying the pangs of moral discontent.|$|R

60|$|Being an {{energetic}} individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was hot, {{and before the}} blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel, they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. He was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this {{was a relief to}} his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the 'poor, dear fellow was <b>going</b> away <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> his trouble, and come home happy'. Of course, he smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable.|$|R
5000|$|There's a {{song called}} Coma that's like 11 minutes 45 seconds long with no chorus. And I think {{there was only one}} verse that somewhere it repeats itself. It's Slash's baby. It's his monster. The song used to be called Girth.But I started writing about when I OD'ed 4 years ago. The reason I OD'd was because of stress. I couldn't take it. And I just grabbed the bottle of pills in an {{argument}} and just gulped them down and I ended up in the hospital.
