50|$|An annuity {{with only}} a {{distribution}} phase is an <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity,</b> single premium <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> (SPIA), payout annuity, or income annuity. Such a contract is purchased with a single payment and makes payments until {{the death of the}} annuitant(s).|$|E
50|$|An <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> is an annuity {{for which}} the time between the {{contract}} date and {{the date of the}} first payment is not longer than the time interval between payments.

40|$|Retirement {{security}} for Americans {{is one of}} the most critical public policy and personal financial issues and will be for decades in the future. Individuals that retire today can live an additional 30 or even 40 years with less secure income as corporations shift to defined contribution plans to fund retirement. Based on the life cycle savings hypothesis, <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> should be appealing to retirees because they insure against the risks of outliving retirement assets by converting funds into a lifelong stream of income. However, research has found that retirees are reluctant to annuitize their wealth. This study examined the attitudes of Utah State University employees toward annuitization of retirement assets and explored the relationship between employee characteristics and their attitudes toward <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities.</b> Data for this study were collected through an online questionnaire emailed to Utah State University employees who participate in a defined contribution plan. The survey gathered information on retirement portfolio losses, expected longevity, financial confidence, familiarity with annuities, and attitudes toward <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities.</b> A total of 744 individuals answered the survey for a response rate of 43. 2 %. Based on the results of independent t tests, there were statistically significant differences between the attitudes of women and men toward <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities.</b> Women held more positive attitudes toward <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> than men, and women who had taken a retirement planning class had more positive attitudes than women who had not attended a retirement class. In contrast, men who had attended a retirement class expressed less positive attitudes toward <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> than men who had not. Male overconfidence in their investment knowledge and skills may explain this finding. A Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a negative correlation between risk aversion and attitudes toward annuities. As investment risk tolerance decreases, attitudes toward <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> become more positive. An analysis of variance found that individuals with longer than average life expectancies had more positive attitudes toward <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> than subjects with shorter than average life expectancies. Surprisingly, individuals who claimed to be most familiar with <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> showed the least positive attitudes toward annuities. Income and assets, marital status, and financial confidence were not statistically significantly related to attitudes toward annuities. Implications for consumers, financial professionals, educators, and policymakers were drawn from the results of the study...|$|R

5000|$|The {{overarching}} {{characteristic of}} the <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> {{is that it is}} a vehicle for distributing savings with a tax-deferred growth factor. A common use for an <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> might be to provide a pension income. In the U.S., the tax treatment of a non-qualified <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal (which part is not taxed) and income (which is taxed at ordinary income rates, not capital gain rates). Immediate annuities funded as an IRA do not have any tax advantages, but typically the distribution satisfies the IRS RMD requirement and may satisfy the RMD requirement for other IRA accounts of the owner (see IRS Sec 1.401(a)(9)-6.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "annuity," [...] {{as used in}} {{financial}} theory, is most closely related to what is today called an <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity.</b> This is an insurance policy which, {{in exchange for a}} sum of money, guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments. These payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives, or even whichever is longer. It is also possible to structure the payments under an <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments, usually bond and equity mutual funds. Such a contract is called a variable <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity.</b> See also life annuity, below.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Although it {{has been}} proved {{theoretically}} that annuities can provide optimal consumption during one’s retirement period, retirees’ reluctance to purchase annuities is a long-standing puzzle. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to use behavioral model to analyse the low demand for <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The authors employ Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which contains both loss aversion and probability transformations, to analyse the annuity puzzle. Findings – The authors show that Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) can explain the unattractiveness of <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities.</b> It also shows that retirees would be willing to buy a long-term deferred annuity at retirement. By considering each component from CPT in turn, the loss aversion is found to be the major reason that stops people from buying an annuity; while the survival rate transformation is an important factor affecting the decision of when to receive annuity incomes. Originality/value – This paper identifies CPT as one of the reasons for the low demand of <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities.</b> It further suggests that long-term deferred annuities could overcome behavioral obstacles and become popular among retirees...|$|R

5000|$|Because <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> {{generally}} {{provide a}} series of guaranteed payments, the annuity company normally matches its liabilities with government bonds and other high grade bonds, and the market yield available on these bonds largely determines the retail pricing of the annuities.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} current tax {{treatment}} of non-qualified <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> and distributions from tax-qualified retirement {{plans in the}} United States. First, we describe how <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> held outside retirement accounts are taxed. We conclude that the current income tax treatment of annuities does not substantially alter the incentive to purchase an annuity rather than a taxable bond. We nevertheless find differences across different individuals in the effective tax burden on annuity contracts. Second, we examine an alternative method of taxing annuities that would avoid changing the fraction of the annuity payment that is included in taxable income as the annuitant ages, but would still raise the same expected present discounted value of revenues as the current income tax rule. We find that a shift to a constant inclusion ratio increases the utility of annuitants, and that this increase is greater for more risk averse individuals. Third, we examine how payouts from qualified accounts are taxed, focusing on both annuity payouts and minimum distribution requirements that constrain the feasible time path of nonannuitized payouts. We describe briefly the origins and workings of the minimum distribution rules and we also provide evidence on the fraction of retirement assets potentially affected by these rules. ...|$|R

40|$|This article compares wealth {{management}} strategies for individuals in retirement, focusing on trade-offs regarding wealth creation and income security. Specifically, it compares the following six strategies: (1) systematic withdrawal from mutual funds, (2) fixed payout <b>immediate</b> life <b>annuity,</b> (3) <b>immediate</b> variable <b>annuity</b> for life, (4) variable annuity plus guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (VA+GMWB), (5) mix of withdrawals from {{mutual funds and}} fixed payout <b>immediate</b> life <b>annuity,</b> one-time wealth split at retirement, and (6) mix of mutual fund withdrawals and fixed payout life annuity, gradual annuitization at certain ages. Systematic withdrawals from mutual funds usually give opportunities for greater wealth creation {{at the risk of}} large investment losses and income shortfalls. Fixed and variable life annuities forgo bequest considerations and distribute the highest incomes. A variable annuity with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (VA+GMWB) somewhat addresses both income need and wealth preservation. Mixes of mutual funds and fixed life annuities deliver solutions broadly similar to, and even more flexible than, a VA+GMWB strategy...|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> contract, an {{individual}} {{would pay a}} lump sum or a series of payments (sometimes called annuity considerations) to an insurance company, and in return pay the annuitant a series of periodic payments {{for the rest of}} their life.

50|$|This type of <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> {{pays the}} {{annuitant}} for a designated {{number of years}} (i.e., a period certain) and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up (for example, it {{might be used to}} fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy).

There is potential for arbitrage when the annuity is exchanged for a single premium <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> (SPIA), and the proceeds of the SPIA are used to fund a permanent death benefit using Universal Life.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{solvency}} requirements for life annuities portfolios and funded pension plans. Particular emphasis {{is devoted to}} longevity risk, i. e. the risk arising from uncertainty in future mortality trends. This risk must be faced by insurance companies and pension plans that have guaranteed lifelong payoffs. Solvency is investigated referring to <b>immediate</b> <b>annuities,</b> and hence the so-called decumulation phase is addressed. To assess solvency, assets are compared with the random present value of liabilities. Several requirements are considered, each leading to a required asset level that must be financed both with premiums (or contributions) and capital allocation. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Immediate</b> <b>annuities</b> are a {{compulsory}} {{feature of}} certain pension saving schemes in some countries, {{where the government}} grants tax deductions, provided that savings are paid into a fund which can only (or mainly) be withdrawn as an annuity. The Netherlands has such schemes and United Kingdom used to until A day. From 2003 the tax deduction in the Netherlands is only allowed if, without additional savings, the old age income would be less than 70% of the current income.

50|$|Indexed annuities are {{retirement}} savings vehicles {{and are not}} meant for short term savings. Most indexed annuities do provide a penalty-free amount that may be withdrawn each year (for example, the right to withdraw 10% of the annuity’s value per year). These products may also waive surrender charges if the policy is annuitized (converted into an <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> that would generate income payments over a specified period of time which is elected by the policyholder). Some annuities provide additional riders to have surrender charges waived (generally at no additional cost) in the event the annuitant is confined {{to a nursing home}} or is diagnosed with a terminal illness.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{possible}} phases for an annuity, one phase {{in which the}} customer deposits and accumulates money into an account (the deferral phase), and another phase in which customers receive payments for {{some period of time}} (the annuity or income phase). During this latter phase, the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time, such as five years, or continue until the death of the customer(s) (the [...] "annuitant(s)") named in the contract. Annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time, such as ten years. Annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities. An annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase; such a contract is called an <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity.</b> Note this is not always the case.|$|E
5000|$|These {{difficulties}} were {{compounded by}} the fact that very often the settlement would continue on ad infinitum through the process of resettlement. The son's eldest son who was entitled to the fee tail could by barring the entail create a fee simple and bring the settlement to an end. He was not entitled to his interest in possession until his father died. While his father lived he could not bar the entail unless his father consented to it. His father would be reluctant to give his consent as this would mean the land would pass outside the family. Obviously the son would be in need of money to sustain him until he became entitled in possession. A compromise would be reached which would enable the land to remain in the family but at the same time satisfy the son's need for cash. The father and son would bar the entail but there would be a resettlement of the land which usually took the form of a conveyance to the father for life, to the eldest son for life remainder to his eldest son in tail. Ie the fee tail was passed back another generation. As part of the settlement the eldest son would be granted an <b>immediate</b> <b>annuity</b> on the land or a lump sum. If the family fell on hard times, these resettlements meant that the deterioration of the land and the impoverishment of the landowners continued for generation after generation.|$|E
