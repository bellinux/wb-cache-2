5|$|In other jurisdictions, {{courts have}} applied {{standards}} {{of judicial review}} more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen whether selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 2016, the KES 56 billion (USD 560 Million) Greenfield Terminal Project was {{terminated}} by Kenya Airports Authority because the contractor failed to secure funds thus ending Kenya's dream {{of having the}} largest terminal in Africa. <b>It</b> however <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen whether future administrations like the Grand Coalition Government of 2008-2013 will re-activate the project which is necessary for Nairobi and Kenya's future aviation needs in the 2020s, 2030's and beyond. <b>It</b> also <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen whether the new KAA Managing director Johnny Andersen who was appointed in mid 2016 will have {{a vision for the}} airport beyond the 2030s.|$|R

25|$|An {{approval}} for a hospital for Crystal Lake was given by the board in Springfield, but has since met opposition. Illinois State law forbids {{the construction of new}} hospitals with less than 100 beds. The proposed Crystal Lake Hospital would hold 80-95 beds and be run by a Wisconsin corporation. Opposition from hospitals in Lake Barrington, Woodstock, McHenry, and Elgin were immediately voiced and <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen just when the hospital will be built.|$|E

25|$|Proteomic {{work done}} on binding {{partners}} of Ksr2 {{suggests that the}} CNKSR2/KSR2 complex {{may play a role}} in mediating crosstalk between the MAPK, Pi3K and insulin pathways. It was found to form a complex with MEK1 (Erk2, p38), MEK2, cdk4, PI3k, the phosphatases PP2A and PP^, and also various translational, ribosomal, transport and structural proteins. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> established how many of these are affected by CNKSR2, and whether this remains true for Ksr2 in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Courts {{in several}} jurisdictions {{including}} Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK {{have followed the}} Tameside decision and recognized error of material fact as a distinct ground of judicial review.

25|$|In forests where rattan grows, its {{economic}} value can help protect forest land, by providing {{an alternative to}} loggers who forgo timber logging and harvest rattan canes instead. Rattan {{is much easier to}} harvest, requires simpler tools and is much easier to transport. It also grows much faster than most tropical wood. This makes it a potential tool in forest maintenance, since it provides a profitable crop that depends on rather than replaces trees. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen whether rattan can be as profitable or useful as the alternatives.|$|E
25|$|In the Solar System, {{the inner}} planets are terrestrial, {{and the outer}} ones are gas giants, but discoveries of extrasolar planets suggest that this {{arrangement}} may not be at all common: numerous Jupiter-sized bodies {{have been found in}} close orbit about their primary, disrupting potential HZs. However, present data for extrasolar planets is likely to be skewed towards that type (large planets in close orbits) because they are far easier to identify; thus <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen which type of planetary system is the norm, or indeed if there is one.|$|E
25|$|The {{recently}} discovered inscription for Nefertiti as queen in Regnal Year 16, if verified, {{seems to make}} clear {{she was still alive}} and still queen. What Egyptologists will make of <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, but with proof of her alive in Year 16, it could be seen as supporting her candidacy as Neferneferuaten. On the other hand, advocates for Smenkhkare may make the case that since she attested as queen just before the start of Akhenaten's final regnal year, then Smenkhkare {{is more likely to be}} Akhenaten's successor.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> also <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{seen whether}} the insider-outsider {{division}} that economists observe in European labor markets {{means that the}} young, precarious, non-voting, and non-owning outsiders have fundamentally conflicting aims with respect to older insiders, who tend to work full-time, long-term contracts, enjoy relatively high pension benefits and who command a disproportionate weight in European public opinion and political debate.|$|R
