2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric <b>hand</b> <b>drills.</b> Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|E

5000|$|The Indus Valley Civilization {{has yielded}} {{evidence}} of dentistry being practiced {{as far back}} as 7000 BC. This earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. Cavities of 3.5 mm depth with concentric groovings indicate use of a drill tool. The age of the teeth has been estimated at 9000 years. In later times, mechanical <b>hand</b> <b>drills</b> were used. Like most <b>hand</b> <b>drills,</b> they were quite slow, with speeds of up to 15 rpm. In 1864, British dentist George Fellows Harrington invented a clockwork dental drill named Erado. [...] The device was much faster than earlier drills, but also very noisy. In 1868, American dentist George F. Green came up with a pneumatic dental drill powered with pedal-operated bellows. James B. Morrison devised a pedal-powered burr drill in 1871.|$|E

50|$|Overseen by Crozet, the {{crossing}} {{was accomplished by}} building four tunnels, including the 4273 ft Blue Ridge Tunnel {{near the top of}} the pass. With construction proceeding from either side a decade before the invention of dynamite, the complex was dug though solid granite with only <b>hand</b> <b>drills</b> and black powder. The tunnel was less than 6 in off perfect alignment when it was holed through on December 29, 1856.|$|E

50|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, many {{attachments}} could commonly {{be purchased}} to convert corded electric <b>hand</b> <b>drills</b> into a range of other power tools, such as orbital sanders and power saws, more cheaply than purchasing conventional, self-contained versions of those tools (the greatest saving being {{the lack of an}} additional electric motor for each device). As the prices of power tools and suitable electric motors have fallen, however, such attachments have become much less common. A similar practice is currently employed for cordless tools where the battery, the most expensive component, is shared between various motorised devices, as opposed to a single electric motor being shared between mechanical attachments.|$|E
50|$|In 1912 advance work on {{the base}} tunnel through the Jura began. In four years an 8 km-long tunnel was built. During the half century since the summit tunnel was completed, {{tunnelling}} methods had fundamentally changed. <b>Hand</b> <b>drills</b> {{had been replaced by}} machines and horses had been replaced by smokeless locomotives. In addition, as a precaution, a powerful pump station was built to with any flooding of the tunnel. On 8 January 1916 the new line was opened. The Läufelfingen line with its summit tunnel became a side line and the Sissach-Gelterkinden Bahn tram—which had opened between Sissach and Gelterkinden on 16 May 1891—closed.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to those hand tools listed above, the marble sculptor would {{use a variety of}} hammers - both for the striking of edge tools (chisels and <b>hand</b> <b>drills)</b> and for striking the stone directly (Bocciarda a Martello in Italian, Boucharde in French, Bush Hammer in English). Following the work of the hammer and chisel, the sculptor will sometimes refine the form further through the use of Rasps, Files and Abrasive Rubbing Stones and/or Sandpaper to smooth the surface contours of the form.To achieve a high-lustre polish on marble a very fine abrasive, tin oxide, is used following the use of pumice or finer grits of sandpaper.|$|E

50|$|The quarry began {{operation}} in the 19th century {{and much of the}} labor was that of Irish immigrants using <b>hand</b> <b>drills,</b> hammers and chisels. In 1878, Hugh Sisson acquired the property and began using the latest equipment available: steam powered derricks, shovels, and diamond bit drills. Stone was loaded onto wagons and pulled by oxen to the nearby Northern Central Railway in Cockeysville until the quarry site itself was connected to the rail in 1866. The dolomitic marble, known to geologists as the Cockeysville Marble, from the quarry was used widely within the eastern United States, including the Washington Monument in Baltimore and the one in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional {{climbing}}, or trad climbing, is a {{style of}} rock climbing in which a climber or group of climbers place all gear required to protect against falls, and removes it when a passage is complete. Traditional bolted face climbing means the bolts were placed on lead and/or with <b>hand</b> <b>drills.</b> The bolts tend to be much farther apart than sport climbs. For example, a trad bolted routes may have bolts from 15-75 feet apart. A sport route may have bolts from 3-10 feet apart, similar to a rock climbing gym. The term seems to be coined by Tom Higgins in the piece [...] "Tricksters and Traditionalists" [...] in 1984. A trad climber is called a traditionalist.|$|E

50|$|The company {{became one}} of the nation's largest {{wholesale}} enterprises with nationally known quality brands, among which Blue Grass was the most readily recognizable. John Primble knives, developed by an employee of the company, became a Belknap brand with its own division, made in Louisville between 1947 and 1985 by the John Primble Belknap Hardware Co. The Crusader manufacturing brand of Belknap included contractors' shovels, hammers, hatchets, axes, drawing knives, carpenters' pincers, planes, screw drivers, <b>hand</b> <b>drills,</b> wrecking bars, bit braces, auger bits, chisels, pliers, wrenches, tin snips, and tin ceilings. Other popular Belknap manufactured products included rifles, guns, padlocks, lawn mowers, and bicycles. Belknap inventory in the vast warehouse spaces grew larger and larger, and the Belknap neon sign could be seen from miles away.|$|E

50|$|A {{line was}} built from Muswellbrook to Denman in 1915 and then {{extended}} to Sandy Hollow and Merriwa in 1917. The section between Sandy Hollow and Merriwa {{has been closed}} since 1988. The Sandy Hollow Line between Sandy Hollow, Gulgong and Maryvale, (between Wellington and Dubbo), was originally surveyed in 1860 as a more easily graded crossing of the Great Dividing Range than the Blue Mountains line nearer to Sydney. It was not commenced, however, until 1937, when it began as an unemployment relief scheme of the NSW Government, achieving infamy for having no modern mechanical devices used on it, other than trucks carrying concrete for the tunnels and bridge piers, all other work being done with picks, shovels, <b>hand</b> <b>drills,</b> horses and carts. Construction continued through World War 2 at a desultory pace, held up by money, labour and especially steel shortages, only to be abandoned unfinished, approximately 92% complete, {{a few years later}} in 1951. The line crosses the Great Dividing Range by following the Goulburn River and Bylong Valleys from Sandy Hollow to Bylong, with a tunnel under Cox's Gap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>drill</b> is {{the most}} {{widespread}} among indigenous cultures, characterized {{by the use of}} a thin, straightened wooden shaft or reed to be spun with the hands, grinding within a notch against the soft wooden base of a fire board (a wooden board with a carved notch in which to catch heated wood fibers created by friction). This repeated spinning and downward pressure causes black dust to form in the notch of the fireboard, eventually creating a hot, glowing coal. The coal is then carefully placed among dense, fine tinder, which is pressed against it as one blows directly onto the coal until the tinder begins burning and eventually catches into flame. The advantage of the <b>hand</b> <b>drill</b> technique is that it requires no rope.|$|R
25|$|Lip and {{spur drill}} bits are also {{effective}} in soft plastic.
