40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an example}} of <b>demedicalization</b> in U. S. society by examining how 10 lay midwives described their work in attending home births. Committed to childbirth as a family event {{as opposed to a}} medical one, they tried to accomplish this by reallocating knowledge and responsibility among participants and by working to keep birth at home "natural, " relegating childbirth technology to a position of last resort before transporting women to the hospital. The midwives determined limits to their use of such technology according to their respective interpretations of collec-tively held norms. This work suggests that definitions of <b>demedicalization</b> rest upon two related bases: (1) participants abandoning their reliance upon the "techno-logical fix; " and (2) experts becoming educators in a context of shared knowledge and responsibility. Childbirth at home is an extraordinary example of the current <b>demedicalization</b> of U. S. society (Fox, 1977). It challenges the structure of obstetrical care by denying the necessity of physicians as primary attendants at normal births, and by involving mothers and fathers as responsible par-ticipants. It also challenges the cultural understanding of normal birth as a medical event requir-ing the routine use of technology, by emphasizing birth as a natural physiological process belong-ing to the family. Advocates of home birth maintain that hospital technology applied to ordinary childbirth is not only unnecessary but very likely damaging to both mother and child (Arms...|$|E
40|$|Youth antisocial {{behaviour}} (ASB) {{is frequently}} {{considered to be}} displayed by children and adolescents who suffer from behavioural disorders. Consequently, attempts to reduce ASB have increasingly comprised mental health inter-ventions. Moreover, early signalling of children at risk and early prevention of behavioural problems are regarded as crucial remedies. Critical investigations of these developments, however, are in particular concerned with the con-sequentmedicalization of society and the behaviour exhibited by infants, children and adolescents. Consequently, the new Dutch youth law even refers to <b>demedicalization</b> as a central aim. From an ethical point of view, this article critically discusses themeaning and relevance of themedicalization reproach {{in the context of}} ASB. The aim is to show that the term medicalization (M) can reasonably be attached to three different developments: the biomedical turn (M 1), an increase in (forensic) youth mental health care (M 2) and early signalling and prevention (M 3). The ethical implications of these developments, however, are diverse, referring to both risks and benefits. By itself, neither the term medicalization nor <b>demedicalization</b> carries a self-evident normative meaning. Therefore, a careful ethical ana-lysis is needed to reveal which social developments are actually recommendable or disadvantageous...|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} of empowerment and <b>demedicalization</b> have {{been central to}} the formulations of rehabilitation and social service practices as well as case management, a core community support service provided to people with psychiatric disabilities. This study describes empowering and demedicalized practices in mental health case management. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} thirty leaders in the mental health consumer movement and five professionals. Twenty-five categories of such practices were developed and are presented. Findings have implications for both the nature of the interaction between case manager and client and for program structures, activities, and missions...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} comparison of two relatively new occupational groups working in maternity care: International Board Certified Lactation Consultants and DONA International birth doulas. Using 150 hours of ethnographic observation and 72 interviews with lactation consultants, doulas, clients, and health care professionals, I examine {{their role in the}} maternity care system, including the impact of medicalization on their approaches to creating change in maternity care practices and the meaning and function of their caring labor, as well as the negotiation of paid caring relationship with their clients. I find that, in order to balance their occupation’s foundational goals of <b>demedicalization</b> with their role as the clinical managers of breastfeeding, lactation consultants engage in medicalization and <b>demedicalization</b> simultaneously, but some aspects of their medicalization (e. g., medical control) are actually used to demedicalize (e. g., depathologize). This adds the new concept of “medicalizing to demedicalize” to the literature. I also find that lactation consultants and doulas represent more than a simple transfer of care from family to market because of the impact of medicalization on childbirth and breastfeeding. They are taking on an entirely new role - the role of advocates and guides to the medical maternity system, a system that is often difficult to navigate for women who wish to avoid medical interventions during childbirth and breastfeeding. However, despite this need for an advocate and guide, lactation consultants and doulas still have difficulty being paid to care, due to the “hostile worlds” perspective that sees true caring and paid services as incompatible. This creates tension for lactation consultants and doulas between their passion for supporting mothers and their need to earn income for themselves and their families...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} sheltering practice and social medicalization in the primary care. It begins with a revision about social medicalization and mentions some influences concerning {{the organization of the}} Brazilian primary care. It also indicates that the ground of receptivity proposal was provided by those influences. It argues the potentiality to accomplish the sheltering with a <b>demedicalization</b> and interdisciplinary action and its reverse effect, when restricted simply to emergency medic care. There are hereby suggested changes in the management and organization of routines, agendas as well as collective and individuals activities of the professionals with the intention to reduce medicalization. The conclusion favors the expansion of experimentation on sheltering as a strategy in dealing with unexpected events and with primary care spontaneous demand, always watching out for its medicalization potential...|$|E
40|$|A {{diagnosis}} of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) often signals the quintessential “difficult patient” status to clinicians, {{with at least}} one scholar arguing the condition itself was created to name and group difficult patients. While patients who are deemed difficult are often dispreferred for care, does this have an impact on their overall status as medicalized patients who have successfully achieved a sick role? This study relies on (n = 22) in-depth interviews with mental health clinicians in the United States from 2012 to evaluate how they describe patients with BPD, how the {{diagnosis of}} BPD affects the treatment clinicians are willing to provide, and the implications for patients. My findings suggest patients with BPD are routinely labeled “difficult,” and subsequently routed out of care through a variety of direct and indirect means. This process creates a functional form of <b>demedicalization</b> where the actual diagnosis of BPD remains de jure medicalized, but the de facto or treatment component of medicalization is harder to secure for patients...|$|E
40|$|My paper, in fable form, {{addresses}} some of {{the conditions}} in the United States and in Canada which reduce the ability {{of members of the}} community from making improvements in their health and changes to the health care system. If health is to become a resource for everyday life, a social process is involved which implies the <b>demedicalization</b> of health. To facilitate this process, the power of definition of health cannot be controlled by the medical profession. For what is health is context specific to the individual and to the community. Community participation in all aspects of health care is an essential process to help redefine health. The efforts to reach the target 'Health For all by the Year 2000 ' will not be successful if research methods, funding and practice are based on the biomedical model alone. By limiting choices open to members of the community on the development of their competence in health care, achievement of 'Health For All' is obstructed. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The study {{falls under}} the field of {{identity}} construction under consumer culture theory. The main objective {{of this study is}} to investigate how consumers construct their identities based on the ideology of Training for Warriors. Methodology This research is qualitative by its nature and falls under constructivism. Seven interviews with Finnish Training for Warriors members with different age, gender and length of membership were interviewed and the transcripts of these interviews composed the empirical data of the research. Data was then analyzed with thematic discourse analysis. Key findings The study shows that Training for Warriors ideology is present when people discuss their lives. It recognizes three main aspects in life; redefining one’s identity, managing health and well-being, and managing the feeling of imperfection, as main aspects under the influence of the ideology. These aspects are the affected by the perception of body, views about medicalization and <b>demedicalization</b> and through the marketplace the ideology creates...|$|E
40|$|Turkel, Gerald M. BDSM (also {{known as}} kink) has been stigmatized through medicalization and legal control {{since the late}} 19 th century. However, the recent {{publication}} of the DSM- 5 has significantly changed the definition of Paraphilia, {{which used to be}} the catch-all diagnostic category for atypical sexual behaviors. This change in the DSM has affected many court decisions by way of excluding past experiences with kink as evidence. Through the analytic lenses of contextual constructionism and Foucaultian theory, this study utilized multiple sources of qualitative data to tap into the ever- changing social contexts and power politics of medicalization and <b>demedicalization</b> of kink. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} shifting social and technological contexts have produced what Anthony Giddens terms "institutional reflexivity" that reshapes the organizational behaviors of both institutions of social control social movement organizations, as well as the outlook of sexual politics in contemporary society.

40|$|International audienceThe feminist {{movement}} was from its {{start in the}} 19 th century involved {{in the struggle for}} better health care for women. The first feminists aimed at better information on birth control and sexuality. The second feminist wave focused on the unequal division of power roles between men and women. A lot of the problems women experienced could be seen as a consequence of their subordinate role in society. At the end of the 1980 s and in the 1990 s, the discipline women and health or women and medicine was developed. In this introduction to the theme, the developments in this discipline are described. The starting points of the new discipline followed the principles of ‘women's health care'. These principles can be summarized as the emphasis on control and autonomy by the patient, <b>demedicalization,</b> the importance of the psychosocial context of complaints, empowerment of women and good information and communication. The central issue of the article is: what is the actual scientific state of the art and what important changes have been made on the subject gender and health? The article ends with ideas for future research...|$|E
40|$|The almost {{absolute}} {{dominance of}} the medical (biological, clinical) model of disability in our science and research practice dealing with disability {{is a very serious}} obstacle to the reform of social welfare and educational institutions. Hence it deserves to be subjected to thoroughgoing criticism. The view that terms are mere names for objective substances independent of the researcher is prevalent, and it essentialises the systems of classification. The translation of the author’s mental constructs into the status of physical substances is mediated by the common sociopolitical and ideological framework of the society in which he or she works. The whole process is hidden behind increasingly complicated methodological procedures providing the illusion of scientific objectivity. Various postparadigmatic movements in social and human science rightly point to the role of language/discourse in reflections of reality. This article proceeds from the assumption that hegemony, oppression and power relations are woven into attractive forms of narration by means of which the scientists (unconsciously) legitimize status hierarchy and material inequality, which is particularly evident in a kind of human diversity that is usually ascribed the attribute of disability. We should search for the way out by merging "top-down reform" - a <b>demedicalization</b> of the current disability concept and the corresponding terminological apparatus - with "bottom-up reform" - fundamental changes in society itself through political action...|$|E
40|$|This work aims {{to chart}} {{an issue of}} woman's {{negative}} experiences {{in connection with a}} delivery in context with current problems of our obstetrics. The object of this work is to explain a character of feelings and mentations of women in childbeds and their sensations of actions connected with a delivery. Another intention of this work is to find out what is a possible influence of these actions on future woman's determinations of future gravidity and a place of delivery. Theoretical part of this work attends to history of obstetrics, but its basic aim is to explain all important terms and processes which have sequences on theoretical part of the work. Contents of some chapters in the theoretical part of the work are identical with discussed current problems of our obstetrics where there is a brisk discussion about a necessity of changes which would lead to its humanization and <b>demedicalization.</b> An exploratory study in the practical part of the work is divided in two parts. The first inquiry stage uses quantitative research methodology. The recognized population are 204 women whose characters and number of negative experiences in the connection with a delivery and their satisfaction with care in maternal hospital were investigated by the form of a questionary.

40|$|Hymenoplasty is {{a medical}} {{procedure}} done to alter {{the shape of the}} hymen membrane. Dutch women of predominantly Muslim migrant ancestry resort to the surgery to maintain the appearance of premarital virginity. This dissertation research studies hymenoplasty as a social phenomenon. It asks: how do the interconnecting issues of gender, religion and migration play out during interactions between doctors and Dutch patients of migrant ancestry in the medical and institutional context of hymenoplasty in the Netherlands? Findings were collected from 2012 and 2015 through participant observations of 70 hymenoplasty consultations in medical establishments in the Netherlands. These observations were complemented with interviews with hymenoplasty providers and patients as well as with people of similar ancestry with the surgery seeking women. Written as a collection of journal articles, this dissertation addresses the issue of variability of treatment, <b>demedicalization</b> of the ‘broken’ hymen, patients’ rhetoric of religion, national identity as medical recommendations, and women empowerment as topics of analysis. By closely paying attention to exchanges between hymenoplasty seeking women and medical professionals, this study posits that patients’ identity markers shape the course of interactions between them and the doctors. Ultimately, differences between doctors and patients, including gender, religion and migration history, are not only brought to light during hymenoplasty consultations in medical institution, but they are also specifically addressed and treated as integral aspects of both patients’ motivation for the operation as well as the cornerstones of their problems which, when dealt with, will lead to the surgery seeking women’s ‘salvation’...|$|E
40|$|In 1973, {{homosexuality}} was offically demedicalized. However, {{the effects}} of this change on the therapeutic relationship between psychiatrists and their gay or lesbian clients has been largely unexplored. Using clients' perspectives obtained through in-depth interviews, this study examines how psychiatric control was perceived to operate in the therapeutic relationship between six gay men and three lesbians and their psychiatrists. Employing Michel Foucault's concept of objectification, the findings of this thesis indicate that, as perceived by the clients, the primary means that psychiatrists used to police them was medicalization. Clients perceived psychiatrists as attempting to impose their definitions of 'normal' sexual behavior through the following strategies of policing: defining homosexuality as a problem, normalization (conversion), denial, avoidance, hostility, lack of support, and sexualization of the homosexual. Although some psychiatrists appear to be becoming more accepting of a homosexual lifestyle, {{the findings of this study}} indicate that the clients perceived their psychiatrists as continuing to treat homosexuality as a form of deviance in spite of official <b>demedicalization.</b> This perceived stance is partly attributable to the psychiatrists' apparent lack of knowledge about homosexual-related matters. Nevertheless, the psychiatrists' approach did not foster a therapeutic atmosphere perceived as safe by the clients. Hence, most clients were unable to get their needs as gay men and lesbians met. In response to the perceived homophobic or heterosexist attitudes of their psychiatrists, some clients were silenced. Most of the clients, however, responded with various strategies of resistance, including: formulating their own definitions of their problems, self-educating, withholding relevant personal information, educating psychiatrists about homosexual-related matters, refusing treatment, terminating therapy, and speaking out about negative therapeutic experiences. Overall, clients' resistance operated in a dialectical manner. Clients' acts of resistance emerged out their needs to retain a sense of themselves when confronting psychiatric definitions of homosexuality which they perceived as challenging their very identities as gay men or lesbians. The knowledge gained from their resistances came to inform and ultimately strengthen the clients' sense of themselves...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the activities of}} associations of parents who have futokoji, or school absentees (I will use the acronym AFPs for these associations). The purpose is to explore {{the role of the}} narrative community in constructing the futoko problem. The approach to the analysis is drawn from Bernstein's theoretical frameworks, "pedagogic codes" and "pedagogic device. " The data used in this study was collected by participant observation of the three APFs in Tokyo and from interviews with their members. I begin by focusing on the pedagogic code of the APFs. Pedagogic codes consist of classification and framing. Classification refers to "what, " and framing to "how" meanings are put together. Communication in APFs is regulated by these dual values of the pedagogic code. While strong classification and framing regulate communications between the APFs and the outside, weak classification and framing within the APFs themselves regulate communications among the members. This characteristic of the APFs protects the families of futokoji from being stigmatized, and encourages them to narrate their experiences with their children. In effect, the activities of the APFs bring about a process of restorytelling, which is the focus of narrative therapy. Secondly, I examine how the pedagogic device regulates the practice and discourse of the APFs. By recontextualizing local knowledge among the members and using expertise mainly derived from clinical psychology and psychiatry, the APF's pedagogic device constructs a specific image of futoko as a "journey, " and two types of identity, which Bernstein terms therapeutic identity and prospective identity. These instructional discourses are embedded in the regulative discourse which creates order and relationship between the family and the experts on psychology, psychiatry and education. Members of the APFs carry out re-storytelling in opposition to the expertise which stigmatizes their families and children as deviant. However, it is the expertise that helps the APFs create their own narration and their particular image of futoko. Based on these results, this study concludes that APF's activities reflect an ambivalent relationship with expertise and an oscillation between medicalization and <b>demedicalization,</b> the control of "deviancy" and the creation of an alternative society...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} simultaneous trends towards increasing and decreasing medical intervention in childbirth. Using the medicalization literature as a theoretical framework, I use a mixed-methods approach {{to explore how}} both the medical community and laypeople think about and plan for childbirth. First, the midwifery and obstetrics literatures from the past 35 years are reviewed to provide a medical and scientific context for the trends seen in childbirth over this time period. Second, descriptive and logistic regression analyses of the Center for Disease Control's Natality dataset, a census of U. S. birth certificate data, provide a picture childbirth trends {{and an understanding of}} the relationship between maternal characteristics and medicalized and natural births. Third, 35 qualitative interviews were conducted with pregnant women, focusing on their plans for their children's birth. The interviews also address the factors that influence women's plans and choices for childbirth, thus providing {{a better understanding of the}} social factors that affect birth plans. The key finding of this research is that most women would prefer to be able to have the "best of both worlds" - the ability to experience childbirth as a natural process for as long as is safe and comfortable, combined with immediate access to the medical skills and technology that can assist them and their babies in an emergency. The quantitative analyses demonstrate that alternatives to a mainstream model of childbirth are on the rise, even while these alternatives continue to represent only a small fraction of births. The increase in midwifery use while rates of hospital births remain relatively consistent suggests that many midwife-attended births are taking place in hospitals. These data support the finding that women like the idea of a natural birth, but also want to have ready access to trained doctors, surgeons, and the best medical care available in case something goes wrong. There can be no doubt that childbirth, on the whole, had become a highly medicalized process. However, despite the fact that women want childbirth to be recognized as a natural process, there is no true movement for the <b>demedicalization</b> of childbirth. That is, women are not suggesting that medical intervention be removed entirely from childbirth. Instead, there need to be more options available to women, thus enabling them to give birth in a way that is comfortable and respectful of their preferences and goals, while simultaneously maintaining ready access to additional intervention, should it be necessary. Implications for future research in childbirth and other fields of study are discussed. Dissertatio...|$|E
