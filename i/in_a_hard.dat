5|$|In the UK, a toffee apple is a {{traditional}} confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are candy apples (coated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> shell of crystallized sugar syrup), and caramel apples, coated with cooled caramel.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{started from}} the second row of the grid at the German Grand Prix, but was into the lead soon after the start.

He took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix three weeks later, and was soon engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola's induction system during a pit stop, costing him {{three and a half}} minutes. Caracciola won his second race of the season at the Swiss Grand Prix. Despite heavy rain which made the Bremgarten Circuit slippery and hazardous, Caracciola set a new lap record, at an average speed of , and cemented his reputation as the Regenmeister.|$|E

5|$|Many soundtracks and {{arranged}} albums of Uematsu's game scores have been released. Pieces from his video game works {{have been performed}} in various Final Fantasy concerts, where he has worked with Grammy Award-winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of these performances. From 2002 to 2010, he was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> rock band with Square Enix colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito called The Black Mages, in which he played electronic organ and other keyboards. The band played various arranged rock versions of Uematsu's Final Fantasy compositions. He has since performed with Earthbound Papas, which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Black Mages were a Japanese {{instrumental}} {{rock band}} formed in 2002 by Nobuo Uematsu, Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito, who were three video game composers for Square Enix. The band arranged Uematsu's Final Fantasy video game series-based compositions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> rock style often similar to progressive metal, achieved {{with the additional}} use of synthesizers. Since its inception, the band had expanded to six members {{with the addition of}} Keiji Kawamori, Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda. In August 2010, Uematsu announced the band had been disbanded, but he would continue to perform rock arrangements of his music as a part of another similar band, known as the Earthbound Papas.|$|E
5|$|The Königsberg-class cruisers had a {{standard}} crew of 21officers and 493enlisted men. This later increased to 23officers and 588591enlisted men, and during World War II, the crew size rose to between 820 and 850 officers and men. The ships carried {{a number of}} smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, one cutter, and one dinghy. The ships were moderately good sea boats, but {{had the potential to}} capsize if internal stores were improperly loaded, and suffered from a slight lee helm. They heeled up to twenty degrees with the rudder hard over. They were nevertheless very maneuverable and lost little speed in a head sea. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> turn, they lost up to 20percent speed.|$|E

5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, {{which contains}} {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E
5|$|Davidson was {{in strong}} all round {{form in the}} 1961–62 Australian season, which was a purely {{domestic}} one. Against Victoria in Sydney, he scored 106 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> hitting innings with the tail. He made 58 of the 59runs added in a last wicket partnership with Doug Ford, the other being a leg bye. The partnership lasted only 44 balls and Davidson managed to farm the strike and face 41 of these. The effort helped {{to set up a}} ten-wicket win. The following week against Western Australia in Perth, he made 108 after New South Wales had slumped to 6/38 to help the visitors recover to 218. New South Wales struggled in their second innings and Western Australia needed only 175 for victory. However, Davidson took his career best innings bowling figures of 7/31 to bowl out the hosts for 106 and seize a victory. In both matches against Queensland, Davidson took four quick wickets in the second innings to secure narrow victories after bold declarations. New South Wales won the Shield in that season with 64 of a maximum possible 80 points, playing aggressive cricket under Benaud. It was their ninth title in a row. Davidson was a key factor in the dominance, scoring 521runs at 40.07 and taking 42 wickets at 13.62.|$|E
5|$|Once the Elector and his co-commander, Marshal Marsin, {{knew of the}} Allies' objective, they {{dispatched}} Count d'Arco with {{an advance}} force of 12,000 men from their main camp at Dillingen to strengthen and hold the Schellenberg heights above the town. Rejecting a protracted siege, Marlborough decided in favour of a quick assault, before the position could be made impregnable. After two failed attempts to storm the barricades, the Allied commanders, acting in unison, finally managed to overwhelm the defenders. It had taken just two hours to secure the bridgehead over the river <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> fought contest, but following the victory, momentum was lost to indecision. The deliberate devastation of the Elector's lands in Bavaria failed to bring Max Emanuel to battle or persuade {{him back into the}} Imperial fold. Only when Marshal Tallard arrived with reinforcements to strengthen the Elector's forces, and Prince Eugene of Savoy arrived from the Rhine to bolster the Allies, was the stage finally set for the decisive action at the Battle of Blenheim the following month.|$|E
