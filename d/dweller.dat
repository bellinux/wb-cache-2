5|$|In the {{original}} Fallout by Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment, the protagonist player character, the Vault <b>Dweller,</b> first encounters the feral Dogmeat in Junktown. Dogmeat's former owner (an unnamed man closely resembling Max Rockatansky) {{died at the}} hands of thugs hired by a local gangster named Gizmo. If the player character feeds Dogmeat or is wearing a leather jacket, Dogmeat will follow them and fight in their defense. According to the series' canon, Dogmeat was adopted by the Vault <b>Dweller</b> on 30 December 2161, and killed by a force field barrier during the Vault Dweller's assault on the Master's Military Base on 20 April 2162. Dogmeat was supposed to appear in the canceled film adaptation of the game as well.|$|E
5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the <b>dweller</b> in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study focused}} on the {{participation}} of rural <b>dwellers</b> in selected Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) activities in south-west Nigeria. Variables considered in the study include demographic characteristics of rural <b>dwellers</b> such as age, gender, marital status, religion, and educational attainment in NGO activities, level of participation of rural <b>dwellers,</b> the perceived benefit derived from NGOs activities were determined and the constraints faced by the rural <b>dwellers</b> in NGOs activities were investigated. Three hundred and eighty seven rural <b>dwellers</b> {{were randomly selected from}} three NGOs operating in south west Nigeria. The selected NGOs were Nigerian integrated Rural Accelerated Development Organisation (NIRADO), community Women and Development (COWAD), and Farmers Development Union (FADU). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through interviews and focus group discussion (FGDs) respectively. The result showed that majority (95. 6 %) of the rural <b>dwellers</b> were youth, particularly in the case of NIRADO, COWAD and FADU rural <b>dwellers</b> were mostly females and married. Most of the rural <b>dwellers</b> had limited formal education, but NIRADO rural <b>dwellers</b> were generally of lower education than COWAD and FADU rural <b>dwellers.</b> NIRADO activities were directed to mainly education and training while those of COWAD and FADU focused upon health, agriculture, skill development, basic education and training and income generating activities. The constraints experienced by rural <b>dwellers</b> in NGO activities were lack of finance and transportation. The results revealed further that the total benefit derived from the NGO activities had a significant relationship wit...|$|R

Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|In the Vedic-era literature, {{only three}} ashramas (life stages) were mentioned, with Brahmacharya (student) {{as the first}} stage and the Grihastha (householder) as the second stage. The third stage of life, in the Vedic texts, {{combined}} Vanaprastha (retired or forest <b>dweller)</b> and Sannyasa (renunciation) as one ashrama. According to Soti Shivendra Chandra, a scholar at the Rohilkhand University, the separation of Vanaprastha and Sannyasa as two different stages of life is first mentioned in the Jabala Upanishad. However, Patrick Olivelle, {{a professor at the}} University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which likely is a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female <b>dweller</b> in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E

30|$|The study {{evaluated}} {{determinants of}} consumption intensity of leafy AIVs in {{rural and urban}} <b>dwellers</b> using the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. Findings indicated a higher consumption intensity of leafy AIVs in rural <b>dwellers</b> compared to urban <b>dwellers</b> {{with a mean of}} four and two times a week, respectively. Higher diversity of leafy AIVs at retail outlets increased their consumption intensity in both rural and urban <b>dwellers.</b> In urban <b>dwellers,</b> formal employment of the household cook reduced the consumption intensity of leafy AIVs while increased distance to retail outlets had a contrary effect. In rural <b>dwellers,</b> elderly decision-makers with more information on AIVs’ medicinal benefits increased vegetable consumption intensity. However, large households with a greater proportion of income allocated for food use reduced vegetable consumption intensity.|$|R

5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment <b>dweller</b> unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena mainly {{occurs in}} the dry regions of western Madagascar, but has also been {{recorded}} in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast, and is found up to 1300m (4300ft) above sea level. It mainly occurs in forests, but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it. An obligate cave <b>dweller,</b> it is known to roost in large colonies, with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also contained an estimated 10,000 Paratriaenops furculus. The effective population size of the species {{is estimated to be}} about 121,000. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) form the main component of its diet, but it also eats Coleoptera (beetles) and Hemiptera (bugs) and fewer members of some other insect orders. It is unclear how the ecological niches of Triaenops and the less frequently captured Paratriaenops furculus are separated, as both eat lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are major}} {{differences}} in transport energy consumption between cities; an average U.S. urban <b>dweller</b> uses 24 times more energy annually for private transport than a Chinese urban resident, and almost {{four times as}} much as a European urban <b>dweller.</b> These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking, cycling, and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including urban density and urban design.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} density was 5.44 inhab/km² in 2007. There were 8,872 urban <b>dwellers</b> and 2,267 rural <b>dwellers.</b> The population has declined by about 4,000 people since 1980.|$|R
30|$|Descriptive and summary {{statistics}} between the {{rural and urban}} <b>dwellers</b> varied (Table  1). On average, rural decision-makers were significantly elderly and less educated. Rural <b>dwellers</b> had more members with wider experience in AIV consumption and allocated larger proportions of income for food use. While access to a greater diversity of leafy AIVs was higher in urban <b>dwellers,</b> distance to preferred market outlets was significantly longer in rural areas. Moreover, rural <b>dwellers</b> were more informed about the medicinal benefits associated with indigenous vegetables, and the perceived retail prices for leafy AIVs were more affordable.|$|R

We examine the nature of government wage differentials for female workers separately for city <b>dwellers</b> and non-city <b>dwellers.</b> A bivariate selectivity approach is used which recognizes the endogeneity of the government worker status variable and the union choice variable in the wage formation process.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Humanities, Political Studies, 2014 Eviction of farm <b>dwellers</b> {{by farmers}} and landowners in post-Apartheid South Africa has {{increased}} {{at an alarming}} rate. The consequences of being evicted can be devastating for the livelihood of farm <b>dwellers</b> as it is often accompanied {{by the loss of}} work, income and homes, the loss of access to land for food production, generating urban slums and displacement areas not within reach of municipal basic services as well as other negative effects such as the breakdown of family and social structures and disruptions to children’s education. Plus land security is important for poor farm <b>dwellers</b> usage to produce their own food and complement low farm wages. The livelihood strategies of farm <b>dwellers</b> have been affected by the introduction of the 1997 Extension of Security tenure legislation, which aims at protecting and restoring the land rights of farm <b>dwellers</b> working in farms. Farmers and landowners responded to legislation reforms by evicting farm <b>dwellers</b> off their land. The ESTA legislation has not been implemented effectively and has failed to restore the land rights of evicted farm <b>dwellers</b> and protect those facing the risk of eviction. It has only served to disadvantage those it was supposed to protect. It is therefore important to protect those made worse off by legislation and identify factors keeping the poorest farm <b>dwellers</b> vulnerable and struggling to survive. The research would focus on the impact of the Extension of Security Tenure land legislation on farm <b>dwellers</b> evictions in selected areas of Mogale and Randfontein Local Municipalities under the Westrand region in Gauteng...|$|R
