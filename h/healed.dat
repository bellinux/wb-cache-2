5|$|A {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens {{has been described}} from Montana with <b>healed</b> tyrannosaur-inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae. The fact that the damage seems to have <b>healed</b> suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur's attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation. There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a Triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus {{in the form of}} partially <b>healed</b> tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor. Since the Triceratops wounds <b>healed,</b> it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns.|$|E
5|$|Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, {{was found in the}} Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, in the spring of 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found to have many bone pathologies, including broken and <b>healed</b> ribs, a broken (and <b>healed)</b> neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head, {{about the size of a}} Tyrannosaurus tooth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{specimen}} has {{a poorly}} <b>healed</b> fracture {{of the right}} fibula, which left a large callus on the bone. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 54 foot bones referred to Gorgosaurus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.|$|E

25|$|<b>Healing</b> time is {{prolonged}} for higher stage ulcers.

50|$|Scarless wound <b>healing</b> is {{a concept}} based on the <b>healing</b> or repair of the skin (or other tissue/organs) after injury {{with the aim of}} <b>healing</b> with subjectively and {{relatively}} less scar tissue than normally expected.

5|$|At Simpson's next race, the four-day Grand Prix d'Eibar, {{his first}} in Spain, his knee injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but {{was forced to}} quit during the {{following}} stage. His injury had not <b>healed,</b> even after treatment by various specialists, but for financial reasons {{he was forced to}} enter the Tour de France with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in his knee, which reduced the inflammation. Once <b>healed,</b> he competed in the road world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Benedict of Peterborough quotes in his Miracula S.

40|$|The crack <b>healing</b> process during {{hot rolling}} has been investigated. According to the {{experimental}} results, the crack <b>healing</b> process goes through four stages: crack surface contact, locally <b>healing</b> discontinuously, <b>healing</b> zone expanding, and global <b>healing.</b> On the basis of above results, the mechanism of crack <b>healing</b> is established. A new concept of crack contact depth is proposed. When the crack contact depth {{is less than a}} critical value, the continuity of crack is broken by the action of atoms near crack surfaces which might be caused by the movement of dislocation during deformation, and a local zone <b>heals,</b> then the <b>healing</b> zone expands...|$|R

After {{analysis of the data}} from taped interviews the essential structure of the experience of <b>healing</b> was determined. Many similarities were found with literature and previous studies. <b>Healing</b> is described as a process, requiring active participation and effort through which a person becomes more aware with a higher consciousness, a sense of self worth and a feeling of serenity and joy.

40|$|Wound and its <b>healing</b> {{process are}} thought to be {{complicated}} process in the world. In fact, a wound <b>heals</b> in an orderly effective and in a systematic manner. The process of wound <b>healing</b> can be divided into four distinct phases but seen to be overlapping with each other. To distinguish the various phases of wound <b>healing</b> biological markers are used. Although the wound is accidental or surgical, it follows the basic <b>healing</b> procedure and the factors governing the <b>healing</b> of wound are also the same. This review describes the details regarding the wound and its types, phases of <b>healing,</b> biological process involved in normal and pathological wound <b>healing.</b> The feature of the review article is that we have touched the unseen aspects of nutrition support in wound <b>healing.</b> Nutritional deficiencies can impede wound <b>healing,</b> and several nutritional factors required for wound repair may improve <b>healing</b> time and wound outcome.

40|$|Self <b>healing</b> {{of asphalt}} mixes {{is known for}} more than four decades. However, it is a complex {{phenomenon}} which depends on the duration of the rest period, temperature, crack size, etc. In order to quantify the self <b>healing</b> behaviour of asphalt mixes, a test setup was proposed in this research using an asphalt beam on an elastic foundation. Within this setup, a notched asphalt beam was glued on a low modulus rubber foundation, and a symmetric monotonic load was applied with loading–unloading–healing–reloading cycles. The rubber foundation was used to avoid permanent deformation and to ensure a controllable <b>healing</b> process. Experimental results indicate that the beam on elastic foundation (BOEF) setup is capable for self <b>healing</b> investigations of asphalt mixes. The <b>healing</b> process was quantified by the recovery of the strength and the recovery of the crack opening displacement. The time, temperature and crack size dependency of the self <b>healing</b> behaviour were observed over the <b>healing</b> periods. Moreover, a self <b>healing</b> model was proposed to decompose the self <b>healing</b> phenomenon observed in the BOEF <b>healing</b> tests. It is shown that {{at the beginning of the}} <b>healing</b> period the delayed visco-elastic <b>healing</b> is the main reason of the recovery of the crack opening displacement and the viscous <b>healing</b> is important for <b>healing</b> after longer time/higher temperature.
