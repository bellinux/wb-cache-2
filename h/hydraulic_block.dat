40|$|A {{common problem}} {{in the design of}} {{hydraulic}} systems is the pressure losses caused by movement of viscous liquid in individual elements of hydraulic circuits. These losses have negative effects on the overall efficiency of hydraulic systems and thus their overall operation. There is a change in temperature of working fluid and components (elements) of circuit due to the result of the mentioned losses. This master thesis is focused on the heat generation (output) in hydraulic cubes of a linear integrated hydraulic cubes (here in after LIHJ) which is the prototype of hydraulic lifting equipment. Losses, arising during the operation LIHJ in pipes and in hoses, can be determined numerically and experimentally. Most of hydrostatic transmitters and others hydraulic components are almost always supplied with the necessary documentation which contains all the necessary information such as experimental characteristics, etc. However problematic parts are the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>blocks</b> which are specific to their size and function. Of course, each manufacturer must prepare technical documentation including characteristics which are important for trouble-free operation of the hydraulic system. The main aim of this work is to determine pressure losses and the heat generation (output) in the hydraulics blocks by program which is used for creating geometry and computing using software like Ansys Fluent, which is based on the finite element method. If these calculations could be compared with experimental measurement technically, then heat generation (output) in both the cubes will be evaluated towards other hydraulic components and the whole system (device). The simulation results will be implemented in software which is used for calculation of heat generation in LIHJ at different operating modes and loads. Furthermore, these results will be the basis for the design of geometry of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>blocks</b> with low pressure losses which will reduce energy consumption of the device. At the end of this thesis, some advanced methods for the manufacturing of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>blocks</b> are briefly introduced, namely the method 3 -D casting...|$|R

40|$|Salt {{deposits}} {{are commonly}} regarded as ideal hosts for geologic energy reservoirs. Underground cavern construction-induced damage in salt {{is reduced by}} self-healing. Thus, studying the influencing factors on such healing processes is important. This research uses ultrasonic technology to monitor the longitudinal wave velocity variations of stress-damaged rock salts during self-recovery experiments under different recovery conditions. The influences of stress-induced initial damage, temperature, humidity, and oil on the self-recovery of damaged rock salts are analyzed. The wave velocity values of the damaged rock salts increase rapidly during the first 200 h of recovery, and the values gradually increase toward stabilization after 600 h. The recovery of damaged rock salts is subjected to higher initial damage stress. Water is important in damage recovery. The increase in temperature improves damage recovery when water is abundant, but hinders recovery when water evaporates. The presence of residual <b>hydraulic</b> oil <b>blocks</b> the inter-granular role of water and restrains the recovery under triaxial compression.

40|$|Scour control {{downstream}} of hydraulic structures is {{an important}} topic in <b>hydraulic</b> engineering. <b>Block</b> ramps or rock chutes are often used to control scour downstream of hydraulic structures and have the peculiarity to be ecofriendly. Although these structures assure great energy dissipation, the rapid passage from supercritical to subcritical flow at the toe results in a scour hole with geometric parameters {{that have to be}} evaluated in order to avoid foundation problems. For this reason, the analysis of the scour process and the comprehension of the hydrodynamic mechanisms on which it is based are extremely important. In this paper, the results of systematic experimental tests are shown that analyze both the influence of the stilling basin tailwater depth and the ramp toe stabilizing structures, for both uniform and nonuniform channel bed materials. In fact, block ramps are generally stabilized by inserting piles or micropiles at the toe. The upper edge level of piles or micropiles was found a relevant parameter for the scour hole geometry. Simple novel relationships that account for tailwater depth, pile position, and bed material gradation are developed to evaluate the main lengths of the scour hole, in the case in which a free hydraulic jump in a mobile bed occurs. These simple relationships give engineers helpful instruments in block ramp design...|$|R

40|$|A fully nonlinear, nonhydrostatic {{numerical}} model is utilized {{to investigate the}} generation of Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) upstream of the Knight Inlet sill. While an upstream hydraulic jump initiates the ISW generation and both hydraulic jump and upstream influence contribute to the generation, {{it is found that}} upstream influence is dominant and the hydraulic jump is not necessary for the ultimate generation of ISWs. Decreasing the tidal forcing or upstream sill width may render the flow subcritical (i. e., the hydraulic jump disappears) and ISWs can be generated by nonlinear steepening of long wave disturbances induced by upstream influence. Increasing the tidal forcing or upstream sill width may generate a <b>hydraulic</b> jump <b>blocking</b> strong upstream propagating disturbances. The jump subsequently becomes a turbulent bore and later disperses into a train of ISWs as the tide relaxes. Further increase in the tidal forcing may sweep the turbulent bore downstream and a train of ISWs is emitted upstream toward the end of waning tide. By reducing the stratification strength by 1 order of magnitude, the near-sill flow is in the transcritical regime and ISWs are resonantly generated over the lee side slope. Connections to the internal tide release mechanism at Luzon Strait and to the unsteady lee wave model are also discussed. The present work provides some more insights into the ISW generation process at Knight Inlet and the connection between the generation mechanism at Knight Inlet and that at Luzon Strait is identified...|$|R

40|$|Many European {{countries}} tend {{to shift}} from constructing combined sewer systems to separate ones, in order to optimise wastewater treatment efficiency and reduce CSO impact on surface waters. An economic design minimises maintenance requirements by aiming at self-cleansing pipes. However, providing the necessary slopes for self-cleansing sanitary sewer pipes often is unfeasible in flat regions, resulting in {{an increased risk of}} loss of <b>hydraulic</b> capacity or <b>blocking.</b> To reduce these risks, flushing tanks can be installed in the sewer system. Where most other researchers contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the hydraulics of flushing, this paper rather tries to formulate a methodology to design and test flushing devices in sanitary sewer systems using standards and hydrodynamic simulations. Therefore, several aspects that require consideration when incorporating flushing devices into a sanitary sewer system are discussed. For instance, when flushing sanitary sewers the increase in discharge has to be explicitly considered. A Belgian case study is used to investigate the suitability of the developed methodology.

40|$|The {{presence}} of an hydraulic structure in a river affects the natural sediment threshold process creating localized discontinuity in river morphology. A correct structure design has to solve two main problems: it has to assure the structure stability {{in order to preserve}} its hydraulic functionality and it has to tend to minimize the structure impact on the river body in order to not cause morphologic variations which can be incompatible with the natural biological processes. For this reason in the last few decades block ramps have been extensively studied as they have the peculiarity to be both eco-friendly structures and assure a greater energy dissipation than other traditional structures. Recent studies analyzed both the scour process downstream of them and their stability, highlighting that four main failure phases can be distinguished: incipient motion, local failure, global and ultimate failure, respectively. In case of a failure the ramp configuration changes and some blocks are transported downstream. Although the block ramp can loose its original <b>hydraulic</b> functionality, the <b>blocks</b> transported downstream can have a protective effect on the scour hole in the stilling basin.

The challenge of managing this complex hydrology hinges, in part, on understanding and quantifying how processes interact to support the groundwater and surface water systems. Here, we use the integrated hydrologic platform ParFlow-CLM to simulate hourly 1  km gridded hydrology over 1 year to study un-impacted groundwater–surface water dynamics in the basin. Comparisons of simulated results to observations show the model accurately captures important regional-scale partitioning of water among streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET), snow, and subsurface storage. Analysis of this simulated Central Valley groundwater system reveals the seasonal cycle of recharge and discharge {{as well as the}} role of the small but temporally constant portion of groundwater recharge that comes from the mountain block. Considering uncertainty in mountain <b>block</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity, model results suggest this component accounts for 7 – 23  % of total Central Valley recharge. A simulated surface water budget guides a hydrograph decomposition that quantifies the temporally variable contribution of local runoff, valley rim inflows, storage, and groundwater to streamflow across the Central Valley. Power spectra of hydrograph components suggest interactions with groundwater across the valley act to increase longer-term correlation in San Joaquin River outflows. Finally, model results reveal hysteresis in the relationship between basin streamflow and groundwater contributions to flow.

We use 3 -D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data, elec-tromagnetic (EM) surveys, resistivity soundings, and hand-augered borings to characterize the 3 -D architec-ture of fluvial deposits on a floodplain of the Pisca-tiquis River, near South Sebec, Maine. Field-scale sur-veys made across the entire floodplain were used to map the depth to the glacially eroded bedrock surface and the thickness of the overlying sediments, which consist of glaciomarine clay, fluvial sands and silts, and over-bank deposits. An EM conductivity anomaly in the cen-ter of the floodplain defines the position of a ridge in the glaciomarine clay deposit. This ridge separates hor-izontally bedded sand and silt deposits in the northern half of the floodplain from inclined point-bar sand and silt deposits in the southern half of the floodplain. The orientation and spacing of the lateral accretion surfaces (or bounding layers) within the point-bar deposits in the southern part of the floodplain were measured in a 3 -D GPR survey conducted over a 50 -m 2 grid. The geomet-rical parameters defining the internal architecture of the point-bar deposits are used to estimate anisotropy ratios for the principal components of the <b>block</b> <b>hydraulic</b> con-ductivity tensor.

Optional engines included the 302-2V (standard on GT and Brougham models), 351W-2V, the new 351 Cleveland available with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor, and the new 429-4V 385 Series V8 (standard on the Cobra models). It {{should be noted that}} selecting the 351-2V on the option list could have resulted in the buyer receiving either the 351W-2V or the 351C-2V; both shared the same power rating and VIN code. The 429-4V was available in three different versions. The first was the 429 Thunder Jet, the standard engine for the Cobra, rated at [...] Next was the 429 CJ (Cobra Jet), rated at , which included a 2-bolt main <b>block,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> lifters, a 700 CFM Holley or 715 CFM Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, and was available with or without Ram Air. The top 429 option was the 429 SCJ (Super Cobra Jet), rated a , and was part of the [...] "Drag Pack" [...] option. Selecting the [...] "Drag Pack" [...] option turned a 429 CJ into a 429 SCJ. The drag pack required either the 3.91:1 or the 4.30:1 axle ratio, and included a 4-bolt main engine block, forged pistons, 780 CFM Holley carburetor, engine oil cooler, and a solid lifter cam. The [...] "Detroit Locker" [...] rear differential was included when the 4.30:1 axle was ordered while the [...] "Traction-Lock" [...] limited-slip differential was included with the 3.91:1 axle. The 429 SCJ was available with or without Ram Air induction, both versions sharing the same power ratings. Ram Air induction was also optional on the 351C-4V. The Ram Air option was revised to include a new [...] "shaker hood" [...] where the scoop was attached {{to the top of the}} air cleaner assembly, and protruded through a hole in the hood. The 'shaker' nickname came from the fact that it vibrated, or shook, when the engine was running. A 3-speed transmission was standard on all models except the Cobra. The Cruise-O-Matic and 4-speed transmissions remained options.|$|R
40|$|This project {{involves}} {{implementing a}} new technology, microforming, in a headbox {{to produce an}} isotropic sheet with significant reductions in the MD/CD stiffness ratio (increasing CD specific STFI) and improved sheet uniformity. Microforming involves generating axial vorticity (i. e., swirl) prior to the converging nozzle of the headbox by retrofitting an existing tube block with swirl generation devices referred to as Vortigen system. The Vortigen system developed in this project is a retrofit technology to a <b>hydraulic</b> headbox tube <b>block.</b> The tubes in the tube block are re-designed to generate axial vorticity (or swirl) in the tubes. This type of flow results in higher intensity small-scale turbulence in the forming jet at the slice. The net effect, as demonstrated in pilot and commercial trials, is improvement in formation and surface smoothness, lower MD/CD tensile ratio, and consequently, higher CD strength properties such as CD STFI, Ring Crush and tensile or breaking length. The objective of this project is to implement microforming by developing the retrofit technology for generation and on-line control of axial vorticity in the tubes to optimize turbulent scale and intensity, and consequently, fiber network structure properties in the sheet. This technology results in significant improvements in the performance and capital effectiveness of the paper machine (PM) {{for a fraction of}} the cost to replace a headbox. In this project we have developed and demonstrated the concept of generating axial vorticity to control the fiber orientation in the converging zone of the headbox, and to produce a sheet with isotropic fiber orientation. The technology developed here has been demonstrated in static form on several pilot trials and two series of commercial trials. The economic feasibility of this technology is based primarily on fiber savings in cases where a more isotropic fiber orientation can be used to reduce the basis weight of the product. Even a 5 % decrease in basis weight will results in substantial savings covering the cost of a commercial retrofit in 6 months or less in a medium size machine. The project also resulted in significant amount of information on fiber orientation in turbulent flow and in a converging nozzle where the results can be used in other applications, such as formation of composite materials. Several MS and Ph. D. students and postdoctoral associates have been trained as part of this project...|$|R
