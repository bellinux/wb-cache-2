40|$|Adult {{polycystic kidney}} disease (APKD) is a single-gene {{autosomal}} dominant genetic disorder leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD, meaning kidney failure). It is associated with mutations {{in at least two}} genes, APKD 1 and APKD 2, but diagnosis is mostly by ultrasonography. We propose a model for critical illness (CI) insurance and estimate rates of onset of ESRD from APKD using two studies. Other events leading to claims under CI policies are included in the model, which we use to study (a) <b>extra</b> <b>premiums</b> under CI policies if the presence of an APKD mutation is known, and (b) the possible costs arising from adverse selection if this information is unavailable to insurers. The <b>extra</b> <b>premiums</b> are typically very high, but because APKD is rare, the possible cost of adverse selection is low. However, APKD is just one of a significant number of single-gene disorders, and this benign conclusion cannot be assumed to apply to all genetic disorders taken together. Moreover, ignoring known genetic risks in underwriting sets a precedent that could have unintended consequences for the underwriting of nongenetic risks of similar magnitude...|$|R

50|$|The First General Meeting {{was held}} at the London Tavern and the second in the house of J.Hartley and Son, at 137 Leadenhall Street - the latter being the first address to be officially {{recorded}} as ‘the offices of the Society’.The first prospectus was published in the Shipping Gazette and aroused widespread interest “offering advantages to the seafaring portion of the community, which no office has yet attempted.” The reaction was favourable and many shipping companies showed interest - P&O at once declared their intention to establish a superannuation scheme with the Society. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company having initially declined the proposal, were soon to change their minds. Even with such interest the Marine and General Directors were convinced that they could offer still lower rates for marine life risks than those they had originally announced. A closer study of the limited marine mortality data was undertaken as well as a review of the current practice of other Life Offices. In terms of the mortality data they concluded that mortality among seafarers was approximately 50 per cent higher than among comparably select ‘ordinary’ lives. In terms of the practice of other Life Offices, the Marine and General Directors found ample evidence that backed up the original claim that marine life assurance had been previously neglected.Royal Exchange, London for example had no such risks on their books, but were they to accept any they would require an <b>extra</b> <b>premium</b> of £2 per cent (1852) for European sea risk and considerably more for the Cape, Australia and the West Indies.
