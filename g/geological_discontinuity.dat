In addition to applying non-smooth constraints, we further constrain the inverse problem to obtain models within prescribed physical bounds. The optimization with non-smooth regularization and physical bounds is solved using an interior point method.

The rock mass was characterised considering different structural data collection techniques and mapping scales. Modifications were made to the traditional sampling methodologies to better determine the observed <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> within primary copper ore. It was found that few open <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities,</b> mainly the widely spaced large scale sub-vertical faults, are observed within primary ore, and this could be in agreement with the observed “competent” and “massive” rock mass behaviour at the mine site. The study also found a high frequency of small scale stockwork veins (cemented joints), which define at least three semi-orthogonal set orientations mine wide. The faces of caved rock blocks found in the production level draw points were also characterised and an empirical criterion to define weak discontinuities that define caved blocks was established. From these observations, it can be concluded that the <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> (veins) having less than 1 / 3 of hard minerals as infill (hard mineral means Mohs scale of hardness ≥ 4) and thickness greater than or equal to 2 mm may also be the weaker path where a competent rock mass fail under caveinduced stress conditions. This empirical definition was applied for the structural data collected from different geological units and mine sectors of the El Teniente mine. The results allowed a differentiation of several geotechnical units where traditional rock mass classifications schemes failed. The observed rock mass behaviour during caving operations was back analysed to correlate with the new geotechnical units defined using that empirical definition. The back analysis studies included the rock damage as mine overbrake in mine drive at the undercut level, fragmentation performance, and mine seismicity recorded within a rock volume completely caved. A mine scale finite element numerical model was also built to assess the stress state around excavations during caving propagation.

Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was carried out traversing across and along the quartz reef at Kothur village, Hyderabad, India.

40|$|Rockbursts {{may cause}} damages to {{underground}} openings and to equipment, and constitute a major hazard {{to the safety}} of mine workers. One method {{that can be used to}} evaluate if there is a rockburst potential is to compare the stiffness of the failed rock with that of the surrounding rock mass. This method has been applied successfully in the past to rockbursts involving fracturing of the rock mass. This thesis deals with the development of a similar approach for rockbursts involving a violent slip along major <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> To evaluate the post-peak shear stiffness of a discontinuity, a new non-linear constitutive model for rock joint was developed. This model is based on two exponential formulations expressing the two phenomena taking part in the shearing process: friction resistance along surfaces and shearing of asperities. Compared with test results, the model showed a correlation factor (R 2) of 0. 90. The model was then implemented in an existing boundary element code to evaluate the interaction between underground openings and nearby <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> Verification of the implementation was done by reproducing direct shear tests on a discontinuity. Parametric analyses were performed on the new model that highlighted the most important parameters. Methods to obtain the different stiffnesses involved in the violent slip process were developed. Examples of applications were given to illustrate the proposed methods. Finally, an alternative method to evaluate the fault-slip rockburst potential was developed. This new method relies on a linear analysis and the calculation of a new index called the Out-of-Balance Index or OBI. The OBI showed some agreement with the stiffness approach...|$|R
40|$|Filled joints in rock mass pose {{a number}} of {{constructional}} problems. When filled joints are reckoned to be critical to an engineering structure, their behaviours are often studied using expensive in-situ testing and complex full-scale physical modelling. This is because sampling of an undisturbed filled joint {{is almost impossible to}} undertake. As such, a means of anticipating the behaviour and characteristics of this critical <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuity</b> is important. One method to predict the behaviour of filled joint is through systematic classification based on its essential components, particularly those features that control the behaviour of the joint under shear and compressive load. Exposed filled joints in granite rock in Lahat, Perak, have been selected for the field study. The field assessments indicate there are several components of filled joint that exhibit certain geological and mechanical characteristics which can be identified and assessed in the field and laboratory. For the infilling material, the essential features include thickness, weathering grade and texture. For the host joint blocks, the features include texture and roughness of the joint surface and weathering degree of the blocks. The weathering grade of the infill and joint blocks are geological characteristics that can be graded according to the standard classification system. The samples of infilling were further evaluated in the laboratory using index and characterisation tests like sieving, compression and shear tests. This study has shown that there are several essential components of filled joint {{that can be used to}} predict its behaviour. These components can be easily characterised and evaluated in the field and laboratory. The characteristics of the infilling material and roughness of joint surface are among the features that control the behaviour of filled joint, and subsequently can be used as classification index for predicting the joint behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Amazonia {{contains}} the largest remaining tracts of undisturbed tropical forest on earth, {{and is thus}} critical to international nature conservation and carbon sequestration efforts. Amazonian forests are notoriously difficult to study, however, due to their species richness and inaccessibility. This has limited efforts to produce the accurate, high-resolution biodiversity maps needed for conservation and development. The aims of the research described here were to identify efficient {{solutions to the problems}} of tropical forest inventory; to use these methods to identify floristic patterns and their causes in western Amazonia; and propose new means to map floristic patterns in these forests. 	Using tree inventories in the vicinity of Iquitos, Peru, I and a colleague systematically evaluated methods for rapid tropical forest inventory. Of these, inventory of particular taxonomic groups, or taxonomic scope inventory, was the most efficient, and was able to capture a majority of the pattern observed by traditional inventory techniques with one-fifth to one-twentieth the number of stems and species. Based on the success of this approach, I and colleagues specifically evaluated two plant groups, the Pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies) and the Melastomataceae (a family of shrubs and small trees), for use in rapid inventory. Floristic patterns based on inventories from either group were significantly associated with those based on the tree flora, and inventories of Pteridophytes in particular were in most cases able to capture the majority of floristic patterns identified by tree inventories. These findings indicate that Pteridophyte and Melastomataceae inventories are useful tools for rapid tropical forest inventory. 	Using Pteridophyte and Melastomataceae inventories from 138 sites in northwestern Amazonia, combined with satellite data and soil sampling, I and colleagues studied the causes of vegetation patterns in western Amazonian forests. On the basis of these data, we identified a floristic discontinuity of at least 300 km in northern Peru, corresponding to a 15 -fold difference in soil cation concentrations and an erosion-generated geological boundary. On the basis of this finding, we assembled continent-scale satellite image mosaics, and used these to search for additional discontinuities in western Amazonia. These mosaics indicate a floristic and <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuity</b> of at least 1500 km western Brasil, driven by similar erosional processes identified in our study area. We suggest that this represents a chemical and ecological boundary between western and central Amazonia. 	Using a second network of 52 pteridophyte and soil inventories in northwestern Amazonia, we further studied the role of geology in generating floristic pattern. Consistent with earlier findings, we found that two widespread geological formations in western Amazonia differ eight-fold difference in soil cation concentrations and in a majority of their species. Difference in elevation, used as a surrogate for geological formation, furthermore explained up to one-third of the variation in plant species composition between these formations. Significant correlations between elevation, and cation concentrations and soil texture, confirmed that differences in species composition between these formations are driven by differences in soil properties. On the basis of these findings, we were able to use SRTM elevation data to accurately model species composition throughout our study area. 	I argue that Amazonian forests are partitioned into large-area units on the basis of geological formations and their edaphic properties. This finding has implications for both the ecology and evolution of these forests, and suggests that conservation strategies be implemented on a region-by-region basis. Fortunately, the methods described here provide a means for generating accurate and detailed maps of floristic patterns in these vast and remote forests. Dissertatio...|$|E

One of the two sites also comprises a metre-wide dolerite dyke. Weathering processes appear to be at the origin of fissures development and of a related enhanced local hydraulic conductivity, both in the quartz reef and in the surrounding granite. The weathering profile in the granite (saprolite and fissured layer) is characterized by an abrupt deepening of the weathered layers in the granite near the contact and in the quartz reef itself. Therefore, the weathering profile shows a 'U'-shape geometry with, among others, the verticalization of the granite's fissured layer. The hydraulic conductivity of this verticalized layer is on average 5 x 10 - 6 m/s and storativity about 10 - 3 (-). The hydraulic conductivity of the fissured quartz is 4 to 6 x 10 - 6 m/s and its storativity about 3 to 5 x 10 - 4 (-). Both media are also characterized by a matrix hydraulic conductivity (10 - 7 to 10 - 9 m/s) and by a significant heterogeneity in hydrodynamic properties that generates preferential flow paths along the sub-vertical fissures parallel to the reef axis. A special attention has been paid for characterizing this heterogeneity. The weathering of the dolerite dyke, however, results in a local low hydraulic conductivity, which consequently does not enhance either the thickness of weathered granite layers or its hydraulic conductivity. The obtained results complete the conceptual hydrogeological model developed for weathered granite aquifers in characterizing the relationships between weathering processes and hydrodynamic properties near <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities...</b>|$|R

However, when the injection rate is overbalanced, the producer wells—instead of receiving enhanced recovery of oil—are bypassed by much of both the flood and its oil sweep. When injection rates are underbalanced, producer wells neither receive much effect of any oil sweep as the flooded area shrinks to a small region (independent of the total flood-time).

The main results show large water-table fluctuations caused by monsoon recharge and pumping, high spatial variability in well discharges, and a decrease of well yields as the water table decreases. Groundwater chemistry is also spatially variable with the existence of aquifer compartments within which mixing occurs. The observed variability and compartmentalization is explained by geological heterogeneities which {{play a major role}} in controlling groundwater flow and connectivity in the aquifer. The position of the water table within the fracture network will determine the degree of connectivity between aquifer compartments and well discharge. The presented aquifer conceptual model suggests several consequences: (1) over-exploitation leads to a drop in well discharge, (2) intensive pumping may contribute to the hydraulic containment of contaminants, (3) groundwater quality is highly variable even at local scale, (4) <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> may be used to assist in the location of drinking-supply wells, (5) modeling should integrate threshold effects due to water-table fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Slope {{failure is}} very common {{phenomenon}} in hilly regions, especially in young techno active mountainous like Himalayas. It is hazardous because of the accompanying progressive movement of the slope-forming material. In order to minimize the landslide effects, slope failure analysis and stabilization requires in depth understanding of the process that governs {{the behavior of the}} slope. The present article mainly deals with the analysis of the stability of road cut slopes of Rudraprayag Area, Uttarakhand, India. The area experiences local as well as regional slides every year. Extensive field study was carried out along the road cut slopes. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the various Physio-mechanical properties of rock mass. These properties have been used as input parameters for the numerical simulation of slope using FLAC 3 D (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) including <b>geological</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> The computed deformations and the stress distribution along the failure surface are compared with the field observations. The study indicates that the overall slope is unstable except at the location E where slope is critically stable. The effects of instability have been thoroughly considered and remedial measures have been recommended...|$|R
