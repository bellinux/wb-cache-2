5|$|The 1983 Longhorns {{finished}} with a 61–14 record and were ranked as the number one team in the nation by Collegiate Baseball Magazine. That season, the Texas team featured four future MLB pitchers: Capel, Clemens, Bruce Ruffin, and Schiraldi. In the 1983 College World Series, Capel allowed <b>four</b> <b>hits</b> in a complete game against the Michigan Wolverines as the Longhorns advanced to the World Series finals.

The championship was the fourth World Series title in University of Texas history, and their first since 1975. Capel finished {{the season with a}} 13–1 record and a 2.98 ERA.

5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a rebound in Zito's {{pitching}} performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended {{the season with}} an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 {{had it not been}} for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on <b>four</b> <b>hits,</b> striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E
