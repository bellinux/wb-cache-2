40|$|To date, {{nearly all}} {{international}} {{effort in the}} field of accidental explosion consequence determination has been aimed at the quantification of the effects of a <b>Hazard</b> <b>Division</b> (HD) 1. 1 event in an explosives storage facility. Until the commencement of the program of work described here, little {{attention has been paid to}} the consequences of the ignition of stacks of <b>Hazard</b> <b>Division</b> 1. 2 ammunition either in or out of storehouses. In 1989 NATO AC/ 258 agreed that a program of trials should be carried out to investigate the consequences of an HD 1. 2 event with the aim of revising the current NATO quantity-distance relationships and placing them on a firmer footing. The program of trials to investigate the effects of the initiation of 105 mm TNT loaded ammunition stacked in the open was commenced in 1991. A report on the results obtained at the time was given at the 25 th seminar and interim conclusions were drawn. The program of trials on the TNT loaded ammunition has now been completed and further analysis of the results carried out. The conclusions of the analysis are reported. At the same time, the need was identified to extend the database of effects to examine the consequences o...|$|E

Currently, for quantity-distance purposes, HD 1. 2 ammunition is treated differently than HD 1. 1 items. The data base of HD 1. 2 effects suggests that this difference is not appropriate. Based on this data base, proposed changes to the US quantity-distance criteria for HD 1. 2 ammunition have been developed. This paper will describe those proposed changes.

In the literature, these distributions are described in terms of the corresponding conditional hazard function, referred as <b>division</b> <b>hazard</b> rate. In this work we propose a simple but effective way to estimate the <b>division</b> <b>hazard</b> by using extended Cox modeling. We investigate the convergence to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain describing the sequence of growing cells and we prove that, under reasonable conditions, the proposed estimators of the <b>division</b> <b>hazard</b> rates are asymptotically consistent.

40|$|Recent {{experience}} with disasters and {{terrorist attacks in}} the US indicates that {{state and local governments}} rely on the federal sector for support after disasters occur. But these same governments are responsible for investing in infrastructure designed to reduce vulnerability to natural and man-made <b>hazards.</b> This <b>division</b> of responsibilities – regional governments providing protection from disasters and federal government providing insurance against their occurrence – leads to the tensions that {{are at the heart of}} our analysis. We show that when the federal government is committed to full insurance against disasters, regions will have incentives to under-invest in costly protective measures. We derive the structure of the optimal second-best insurance system when regional governments choose investment levels non-cooperatively and the central government cannot verify regional investment choices. Normally (though not always) this will result in lower intergovernmental transfers and greater investment. However, the second-best transfer scheme suffers from a time-inconsistency problem. Ex-post, the central government will be driven towards equalizing rather than the second-best grants, which results in a type of soft budget constraint problem. Sub-national governments will anticipate this and reduce their investment in protective infrastructure even further. We discuss these results in light of recent disaster policy outcomes in the US. insurance, disasters, federalism, transfers, grants...|$|R

But these same governments are responsible for investing in infrastructure designed to reduce vulnerability to natural and man-made <b>hazards.</b> This <b>division</b> of responsibilities – state governments providing protection from disasters and federal government providing insurance against their occurrence – leads to the tension that {{is at the heart of}} our analysis. We explore these tensions building on the model of Persson and Tabellini (1996). We show that when the federal government is committed to full insurance against disasters, states will have incentives to underinvest in costly protective measures. We then show that when the central government cannot verify state investment choices, the optimal insurance system would be designed to reward states that succeed in avoiding disasters and punish those that do not, thereby giving states an incentive to increase investment in protective infrastructure. However, this raises the question of whether the central government can credibly commit to such a scheme, and we find in a simple political model that it cannot. In our political model, the central government will decrease transfers ex-post if a state provides protective infrastructure that increases its expected uncertain income, generating a soft-budget constraint for states. This provides an additional incentive for states to underinvest in protective infrastructure. We discuss these results in light of disaster policy in the US. ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>hazards</b> of {{administrative}} <b>divisions</b> complicated {{the life of}} the new royal chapel. Built {{on the edge of the}} Sonian Forest, at the place called [...] "petit Waterloo", it depended on the parish of Sint-Genesius-Rode and partly on the Diocese of Mechelen. Most of the hamlet, [...] "grand Waterloo", was within the parish of Braine-l'Alleud, in the Diocese of Namur. To avoid split loyalties, the priest at Braine wanted to merge the chapel into his parish and, despite opposition, he temporarily managed to save the old priest at St. Genesius Rode the long and dangerous trip across the forest. The death of Rode's priest brought the question up again, with the Habsburg government Brussels keeping a firm hand on the nomination of the chapel's rector, since it was a royal foundation paid for by the Spanish government. Despite fierce proposals, the priest at Braine was separated in favour of Guillaume-Albert Le Roy, who had been chaplain for 3 years.|$|R

Lectures were done directly in school so that students could be easily lead by the scientist in a trip towards knowledge. We tested the procedure in 16 different schools spanning the whole range of school education and involved 42 classes for more than a thousand students and highlight that the interest towards the topics we deal with in the project might not be directly linked to the geology of the area where addressed people live.
