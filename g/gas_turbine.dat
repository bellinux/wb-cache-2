5|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s saw several {{countries}} experimenting with <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> trains. The UAC TurboTrain {{had been in}} revenue service in the United States and Canada since 1968, with mixed results. British Rail began testing the APT-E in 1972; {{for a variety of}} reasons, British Rail did not pursue <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> propulsion.|$|E
5|$|A non-supercharged {{version of}} the Merlin using a larger {{proportion}} of steel and iron components was produced for use in tanks. This engine, the Rolls-Royce Meteor, in turn led to the smaller Rolls-Royce Meteorite. In 1943, further Meteor development was handed over to Rover, in exchange for Rover's <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> interests.|$|E

5|$|The {{state also}} has a hydro power station on the Gumti River. The {{combined}} power generation from these three stations is 100–105MW. The North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO) operates the 84MW Agartala <b>Gas</b> <b>Turbine</b> Power Plant near Agartala. As of November 2014, another thermal power plant is being built at Monarchak.|$|E
5|$|Till 2014, Tripura was a power deficit state. In late 2014, Tripura reached surplus {{electricity}} production capacity by using its recently discovered natural gas resources, and installing high efficiency <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> power plants. The state has many power-generating stations. These {{are owned by}} Tripura State Electricity Corporation (TSECL), natural gas-powered thermal power stations at Rokhia and Baramura, and the ONGC Tripura Power Company in Palatana. The ONGC plant has a capacity of 726.6 MW, with the second plant's commissioning in November 2014. It is the largest individual power plant in the northeast region.|$|E
50|$|In 1969 two W191 (17,000 kW) <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> {{were sold}} for {{installation}} in East Dammam, Saudi Arabia. (These units were built by Werkspoor, in the Netherlands).

5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars at either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 {{there had}} been plans for a £130 million {{combined}} cycle <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> power station {{on the site of}} the Ever Ready battery factory to the West of the site of the North station. AES Electrical applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for permission to build the station, which would have been twice as efficient as the coal-fired Stella stations and the first major electricity generation site built in Tyne and Wear in over 40years. The station would have had a generating capacity of 350MW. It would have taken three years to build, and created 400construction jobs, as well as 40full-time jobs after construction. But the proposal was opposed by the coal mining industry and dropped.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{experience}} had found Blackburn's Firebrand strike fighter {{to be far}} from suited to carrier operations. In particular, the pilot sat near the wing's trailing edge, looking over a very long and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing. The Firecrest had also been rendered obsolete {{by the arrival of}} <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> engines, and while Blackburn did draw up proposals for turboprop-powered derivatives of the Firecrest, (as the B-62 (Y.A.6) with the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine), these went unbuilt, with orders instead going to Westland for the Wyvern. The two flying prototypes remained in use until 1949, being sold back to Blackburn in 1950, and were later scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The Turboliners were {{a family}} of <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> {{trainsets}} built for Amtrak in the 1970s. They {{were among the first}} new equipment purchased by Amtrak to update its fleet with faster, more modern trains. The first batch, known as RTG, were built by the French firm ANF and entered service on multiple routes in the Midwestern United States in 1973. The new trains led to ridership increases wherever used, but the fixed consist proved a detriment as demand outstripped supply. The high cost of operating the trains led to their withdrawal from the Midwest in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{have improved}} creep strength {{with the addition}} of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation superalloys, ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.|$|E
5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National <b>Gas</b> <b>Turbine</b> Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E

5|$|Dunston Power Station {{refers to}} a pair of {{adjacent}} coal-fired power stations in the North East of England, now demolished. They were built on the south bank of the River Tyne, in the western outskirts of Dunston in Gateshead. The two stations were built on a site which is now occupied by the MetroCentre. The first power station built on the site was known as Dunston A Power Station, and the second, which gradually replaced it between 1933 and 1950, was known as Dunston B Power Station. The A Station was, in its time, {{one of the largest in}} the country, and as well as burning coal had early open cycle <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> units. The B Station was the first of a new power station design, and stood as a landmark in the Tyne for over 50years. From the A Station's opening in 1910 until the B Station's demolition in 1986, they collectively operated from the early days of electricity generation in the United Kingdom, through the industry's nationalisation, and until a decade before its privatisation.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} flight lieutenant on 1 August 1943, McAloney {{was sent}} to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as the specialist officer on American and <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> jet engines. The following November, he was dispatched to Dutch New Guinea to rectify issues being experienced with Pratt & Whitney engines in operations by aircraft of the 1st Tactical Air Force. He returned to Australia and his position with Technical Services in December, and saw out the remainder of the war in this post. McAloney decided he wanted to remain in the Air Force on the cessation of hostilities, and subsequently sought a permanent commission in the post-war RAAF. Having continued on a short-service commission in the meantime, his application was ultimately approved in September 1948 and he was granted the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. His younger brother, Robert Simpson McAloney, also saw service with the RAAF in the Second World War. He had enlisted in late 1937 and rose to the rank of warrant officer before his discharge in 1946, his final posting being to No.1 Communication Unit.|$|E
