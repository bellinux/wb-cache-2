50|$|The {{bridge was}} built by {{contractor}} Daelim Industrial Co., LTD, at a contract price of 40.3 million USD. Concrete pylon height with typical H-shape is 103m and constructed by auto climbing form. The main span of 327m across the lake is constructed using the free cantilever method and the side span of 57.5m is constructed by the full staging method.The combination of composite section (reinforced concrete deck and I-shaped steel girder) for the center span and concrete section for side spans applied to the bridge because of decreasing effect of weight balance. Concrete pylon has typical H-shape. The leg shape beneath the superstructure level, on the other hand, needs to be narrow <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> to make the size of foundation smaller mainly for less rock excavation at foundation locations and better handling of construction unit(caisson) considering the site condition. Cable is MSS(Multi Strand System) as 2 planes semi-fan. An extra pier support in each side span has been applied. To maximize the counter weight effect by concrete girder at side span, {{it is necessary to}} make the side span heavier as possible and not to have excessive bending moment by increasing dead load at the same time. Here, the extra pier support gives more opportunity for having more weight and stiffness in side span without resulting in excessive bending moment in girders and pylons.|$|E
5000|$|In a Rolling Stone interview, McCartney {{explained}} how the song came about: I originally cut {{it on my}} farm in Scotland. I went into the studio each day and just started with a drum track. Then I built it up bit by bit without any idea of how the song {{was going to turn}} out. After laying down the drum track, I added guitars and bass, building up the backing track. I did a little version with just me as the nutty professor, doing everything and getting into my own world like a laboratory. The absent-minded professor is what I go like when I'm doing those; you get so into yourself it's weird, crazy. But I liked it.Then I thought, 'Well, OK, what am I going to do for the voice?' I was working with a vari-speed machine with which you can speed up your voice, or take it <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> That's how the voice sound came about. It's been speeded up slightly and put through an echo machine I was playing around with. I got into all sorts of tricks, and I can't remember how I did half of them, because I was just throwing them all in and anything that sounded good, I kept. And anything I didn't like I just wiped.

50|$|Like {{the classic}} rivalry between Marshfield Columbus, Eau Claire Regis has had great games against Pacelli. The rivalry was as good, ranging from 1961 to 1999.

Although the two teams are no longer in the same conference, they met in 2002 and 2003, both games being in the WIAA playoffs.

However, in the semifinals Regis edged Pacelli in a close 21-14 contest, ending a great season for the Cardinals. The following year, the two teams met again, this time it was all Regis, defeating the Cardinals 24-0.

His second publication, and first novel, Unknown Rider (1995), was a fictional manifestation of his experience achieving the title “Fighter Pilot”.

Itch explains that 'it's about hoping that kids can hear it and realise that although it seems doom & gloom, the answers lie with them and the power lies with kids, the power to change their lives and transform their lives, be whoever they want to be is down to them {{at the end of the}} day.' ...|$|E

When the two head down to the basement, Shelby stops when she sees Matt's dead body lying on the basement floor. She begins to freak out again and Dominic pulls Shelby into the secret passage. Once inside the passage, Shelby and Dominic are attacked by the Chen family and flee back inside the basement. Shelby and Dominic barely escape the Chen family and Shelby begins to break down further, fearing that there is no escape for them. As they attempt to flee the house, Thomasin and her mob, the Piggy Man, and the skittering creature attack, leading to both Shelby and Dominic being severely wounded.

Following DreamWorks Animation's reorganization in early 2015, the studio {{announced that the}} film would be produced outside of the studio's pipeline at a significantly lower cost. It was instead animated at Mikros Image in Montreal, Canada, and therefore looks identical to Pilkey's artwork, as well as differently than most of DWA's films. A month later, Letterman left the project but came back as an executive producer, and David Soren, the director of Turbo, entered talks to direct the film. During production, Pilkey got {{to work closely with}} Soren. He was relieved that Soren was directing since he was a fan of Turbo. In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Pilkey said: [...] "Once I met David, it was like a huge load fell off my back; I was like, 'I don't even have to think about this anymore. Just send me a couple of tickets to the premiere.'" [...] Commenting back, Soren said, [...] "In a way, the controversy over the books ended up being liberating for the film. Normally on an animated movie you're trying to appeal to every possible demographic, and often that results in your content being watered <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> Obviously we hope we get as wide of an audience as possible. But it's likely that if people have issues with the books they may have issues with the movie too, and we didn't feel like we needed to waste a lot of time trying to rope them in.

Ulrich Weinzierl praised the author in the German newspaper Die Welt: “Ludwig Laher ventured into very delicate issues. In his new book ‘Herzfleischentartung’ he explores the repressed history of the Nazi camp of St. Pantaleon in his home-state in Upper Austria. The fact-faithful narrator is superior to all historians, because he knows how to use the cynicism of the Nazi jargon and phrases of the files productively in his chronicle"."In addition to the well-founded historical knowledge of the author of this book developed through meticulous work, it is the language that is especially impressive. Dynamic and provided with numerous openings, the reader not only gets insights into historical processes but also in a possible world of thought of the perpetrators. And that is exactly what has impressed me about this book so much. As a reader you have to constantly look out for the author. He takes one by the hand and leads you to places and events, which one would never have exposed himself/herself to. With a very slightly translucent, sage and sometimes even witty language, he seduces one to lay <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> the emotional defenses that one has rightly placed for such literature and achieves even in causing feelings of disbelief and dismay in jaded people. A book whose reading has been difficult, but I would not want to miss it a moment."The book has, in the countries where it was published, almost always found great acceptance among critics. In Austria, it is now widely used as a school reading.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 25. Gordon got a push from teammate Jimmie Johnson to jump {{ahead of}} teammate Dale Earnhardt, Jr. After five laps, the field bunched up {{to form a}} single file train riding the top line around the track.

The second caution of the race flew on lap 47 for a huge crash that began in turn 2 and continued down the backstretch. Paul Menard and Kurt Busch went to the outside and inside of Trevor Bayne that got his car aero loose exiting turn 2 and turned up into the wall. Joey Logano, trying to avoid hitting Bayne, got rear-ended and turned by Kasey Kahne. He turned down into Landon Cassill who came up {{right in front of}} Kyle Larson and destroyed the front of the No. 42 car. He hit him again going backwards riding the wall. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. hooked Larson into the wall turning down the track trying to avoid him. Greg Biffle turned down onto the apron to avoid hitting Logano, but he overcorrected and turned up into the outside wall. He came across the nose of Kevin Harvick and dented the nose of his car. Biffle's car turned back down towards the runoff area and got t-boned by David Ragan. Danica Patrick was hit by the unyielding Almirola No. 43 car and spun out {{at the start of the}} wreck trying to avoid Bayne. She suffered minimal if any damage due to her incredible car control and continued onward. Matt DiBenedetto drove through the center of the wreck and spun out trying to avoid hitting Larson. He too suffered minimal if any damage and continued the race. The 15 cars caught up were Justin Allgaier, Aric Almirola, Trevor Bayne, Greg Biffle, Alex Bowman, Kurt Busch, Landon Cassill, Matt DiBenedetto, Brendan Gaughan, Kevin Harvick, Kasey Kahne, Joey Logano, Danica Patrick, David Ragan, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Tony Stewart and Josh Wise. [...] "It felt like the 27 (Menard) was really tight on our door and it sucked us around," [...] Bayne said. [...] "Our car was a little loose, but we had a fast racecar today. I hate that a lot of cars got torn up. Maybe I could have got <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> before the 27 (Menard) came by, but it all happened so fast." [...] "I didn't see a whole lot," [...] said Larson. [...] "I saw the No. 6 (Bayne) get sideways in front of me. I don't know if somebody got in to him or not, or if he just got the air taken off of him. From there just trying to miss the wrecks and I thought I was going to clear it all then the No. 40 (Cassill) started coming back up the track and I clipped him. It's tough. We haven't had many very good runs this year and then I missed that race in Martinsville, so these bad finishes aren't really helping us out for points." [...] "Just one of those things at Talladega - if you’re not up in the top-two or three or if you’re not running 38th to 40th then you’re very subject to being involved in some accidents like that," [...] Ragan said. [...] "Just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but had a good run with the 18 guys. Have to thank everybody at Joe Gibbs Racing for the opportunity and wish it would have worked out a little bit better.” David Gilliland opted not to pit under the caution, The field was stopped down the back stretch as the race was red-flagged.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{my first}} {{experience}} of travelling with a fellow passenger in a compartment of an English train, and I admit now that I was as yet ignorant of the proper method of conduct. Later on I became fully conversant with the rule of travel as understood in England. I should have known, of course, that I must on no account speak to the man. But I should have let <b>down</b> the window <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> in such <b>a</b> way as to make a strong draught on his ear. Had this failed to break down his reserve I should have placed a heavy valise in the rack over his head so balanced that it might fall on him at any moment. Failing this again, I could have blown rings of smoke at him or stepped on his feet under the pretence of looking out of the window. Under the English rule {{as long as he}} bears this in silence you are not supposed to know him. In fact, he is not supposed to be there. You and he each presume the other to be a mere piece of empty space. But let him once be driven to say, [...] "Oh, I beg your pardon, I wonder if you would mind my closing the window," [...] and he is lost. After that you are entitled to tell him anything about the corn crop that you care to.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second season}} of The O.C. {{continues}} {{to follow the}} tumultuous romantic relationships between Ryan and Marissa, Seth and Summer, and Sandy and Kirsten. Josh Schwartz, the show's creator, stated that in Season 2, the show would [...] "no longer be about Ryan's past; now it's {{going to be about}} Ryan's future," [...] and that this season would [...] "slow <b>down</b> the storytelling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> ... and evolve the characters." [...] For example, the story closely follows Ryan in his advanced physics class, where tension is created between him and another student, Lindsay, who presumes that Ryan will be useless as a lab partner, who thus prevents him from contributing to the work that must be submitted. Ryan's character begins to grow when he stands up to Lindsay and convinces her to allow him to contribute, forcing them to work together to complete the assignment. They later become involved romantically, creating extreme complications and relational shifts amongst the now [...] "Cooper-Nichol" [...] family. The Bait Shop becomes a prominent social destination for the teenage characters. A number of recurring characters are introduced, such as D.J., Lindsay Gardner, Zach Stevens, and Alex Kelly, with whom the main characters form a variety of relationships. Ryan's brother, Trey Atwood, gets out of jail and threatens to bring Ryan's old life into his new one. Sandy and Kirsten also face new conflicts after drifting apart during the summer. Season 2 ends with Marissa shooting Trey after Ryan confronts him for attempting to sexually assault Marissa.|$|R
5000|$|The band began {{formally}} {{recording the}} album in February 2012. The album was self-produced, and recorded in Connolly's private recording home-based studio. Connolly stated this approach came with both its benefits and its difficulties: ...being a singer recording {{in your own}} house in a neighborhood, which is very interesting. It {{was probably the most}} bizarre recording schedule I’ve ever been on. Actually tracked the vocals from about 8:30 in the morning till about 11:00/11:30/noon, somewhere around there, {{because it was the only}} time of the day where I could get complete quiet in the neighborhood. It’s either that or UPS trucks or here comes the landscapers <b>down</b> the street...It’s <b>a</b> great concept to go, “Yeah, yeah, we’re just going to make a record in the house,” then all of a sudden you start doing it and, wait a minute, turn the Wii off, I can hear Just Dance coming through. And the landscapers are definitely in a couple of songs for sure. I heard it and we buried it enough..But just coming to terms with the sound of your voice and doing it here at home, kind of where I can do it by myself and critique the shit out of it, it’s tough when you step out for the first time and you go, I need to become a lead singer. How do you do that? So I had to really kind of sit <b>down</b> and do <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of homework and figure out what my strengths were, things I did better than others, what you want to do but don’t want to [...]|$|R
