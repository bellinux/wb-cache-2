5|$|At another crop outpost in Tunisia, the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder {{remains a}} threat, as he {{explains}} what Mulder has {{found out about the}} virus. He then <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened.|$|E
5|$|Jeff, {{eager to}} get away, {{deliberately}} stirs a fight among the group, then leaves once more to get the test answers. Dr. Duncan <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group is in turmoil, and Britta promises {{to go out with}} him if he can restore order. He does this through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E
5|$|During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk as {{he comes}} {{backstage}} during the interim between his part in Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E

500|$|The {{television}} advertisement {{consisted of}} a boy who is shown playing the first Wizards & Warriors game when a Conan the Barbarian-lookalike enters his room after having defeated a monster and <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> copy of Ironsword. After describing the brief plot and shortly showing clips of the game, the Conan-lookalike leaves his room while exclaiming, [...] "The fate {{of the world is}} in your hands! Back vile beast!". At the end of the commercial, after briefly playing Ironsword, the boy opens the door in his room, only to find his dog, who now has smoke coming from his behind.|$|E
500|$|According to Reiser, Cameron {{cast him}} against type as a villain. The actor said that Cameron failed to {{introduce}} Burke as a surprising villain {{because of his}} suspicious demeanor and dialogue in his first scenes. In Alien Woman: The Making of Lt. Ellen Ripley, a 2004 literary analysis of the Alien franchise, Jason Smith and Ximena Gallardo-C. describe Burke as a [...] "monster" [...] who is the by-product of organizational culture and willing to have Ripley and Newt impregnated for capital gain because of their [...] "'natural' wombs". In a deleted scene during Ripley's incursion into the Alien hive, shown in the 2010 Blu-ray edition of the Alien Anthology, she discovers a cocooned Burke who reveals {{that he has been}} impregnated; he begs Ripley to kill him, but instead she <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> grenade for him to detonate.|$|E
500|$|Peter and Lois {{are leaving}} a doctor's office when actor Ryan Reynolds asks them for directions. He seems very appreciative of Peter. The next morning Peter notices that Ryan has moved in across the street, taking Cleveland Brown's former residence. Ryan says he's filming {{for a movie}} nearby. Peter attends Ryan's housewarming party that night, at which Ryan tickles him and {{requests}} that he return the favor. [...] Later that week, they go out to dinner, but Peter immediately exits the restaurant when Ryan tries to kiss him. The next day, Peter tells Lois he believes Ryan is gay but Lois rejects the idea. Peter confronts Ryan, who replies that he is only attracted to Peter's spirit {{in the way that}} a man is attracted to a woman. Angered by Peter's accusation, Ryan orders him to leave and that they can never talk again—but <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> cell phone so they can [...] "always talk".|$|E

500|$|The show {{features}} various references {{relating to}} music, media, film, and other pop cultural phenomenon. Character Dr. Edwin Jenner was {{modeled after the}} English physician Edward Jenner, {{a pioneer in the}} eradication of smallpox. The episode title is an acronym for Test Subject 19, a patient that was examined by Jenner for clinical research. As [...] "TS-19" [...] comes to a close, one can hear the song [...] "Tomorrow Is a Long Time" [...] (1971) by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan play in the background. The Washington Post Liz Kelly suggested that it could have referred to the seemingly long hiatus that proceeded after the season finale. Jenner later reveals to the group that the symptoms of the walker virus are evocative to that of meningitis. As Rick desperately tries to break out of a nearly incinerating Centers for Disease Control and Prevention building, Carol <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> grenade, which was the same grenade that Rick had found in a tank in the series premiere, [...] "Days Gone Bye". The opening and concluding scenes of [...] "TS-19" [...] are reminiscent of the American television series Lost.|$|E
500|$|On {{the stairs}} of the church, King Stanisław August Poniatowski (17) is ascending. Matejko was not very fond of Poniatowski, and he portrayed him in a rather pompous posture, with his hand {{extended}} to be kissed, and {{in the company of}} numerous pretty ladies, supporting his reputation as a [...] "lady's man". Poniatowski's inclusion in the procession is one of Matejko's artistic liberties, as he had arrived at the church before the procession. A woman <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> laurel wreath (18); sources have identified her as the Courland princess Dorothea von Medem (Dorothea Biron) or Róża z Martynkowskich, wife of former Warsaw mayor Jan Dekert. Behind her (leftmost in the group of two women, with only her face showing) stands Elżbieta Grabowska (19), the king's mistress and mother of his children. Bowing at the church doors is the former mayor of Warsaw, Jan Dekert (20). He is accompanied by his daughter Marianna (in a yellow dress, facing away from the viewer) taking a prominent position near the king (38). Dekert's inclusion in the painting is another example of Matejko taking liberties with history, as he died in October 1790; he was an important burghers figure associated with the Free Royal Cities Act, which was incorporated into the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Ninja Gaiden {{features}} a ninja named Ryu Hayabusa who seeks revenge {{for the death}} of his father and gradually finds himself involved in a sinister plot that threatens the entire world. The story opens with Ryu's father Ken being killed in a duel by an unknown assailant. After the duel, Ryu finds a letter written by Ken which tells Ryu to find an archeologist named Walter Smith in America. Before Ryu can find Walter, Ryu is shot and kidnapped by a mysterious young woman; she <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> demonic-looking statue before releasing him. Ryu then finds Walter, and Walter tells him of the demon statues he and Ken had found in the Amazon ruins. Walter tells Ryu of an evil demon named Jashin, that [...] "SHINOBI" [...] defeated and whose power was confined into two [...] "Light" [...] and [...] "Shadow" [...] demon statues. Ryu shows Walter the [...] "Shadow" [...] demon statue given to him from the woman, but during their conversation, a masked figure, named Basaquer, suddenly breaks into the cabin and steals the Shadow statue. Ryu gives chase, defeats the masked figure, and retrieves the statue; but when he returns he finds that Walter is dying and the Light statue is missing. Right after Walter dies, three armed men confront Ryu and tell him to come with them.|$|E
6000|$|Walter bent on one knee, and {{the queen}} <b>handed</b> to <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sword of the best Spanish steel, which was the prize given by {{the city to the}} victor. The king <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> heavy purse of gold pieces, saying: ...|$|R

2500|$|Jake {{is confronted}} by Sherry at an art gallery; she is curious {{why he did}} not call her, but again Jake does not seem interested. Charlie then <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{printout}} of Sarah's dating profile and tells Jake he has a date with her {{the next day at}} a dog park. The date proves to be awkward: Jake shows up with a borrowed terrier and offends Sarah when he begins to analyze her profile. Even worse, he reveals that the dog is not really his. When she accuses him of being deceptive he points out that the requirement was [...] "Must love dogs," [...] not [...] "Must own a dog." [...] Sarah leaves abruptly but agrees to see him again.|$|E
2500|$|At dinner, Nest is {{introduced}} by her grandfather to a traveler named John Ross, who has recently come to town. [...] He {{claims to have}} known Nest's mother, but his true purpose for being in Hopewell is to track and defeat the demon. [...] John is a [...] "Knight of the Word", charged with helping preserve the balance between the Word (the representation of goodness and light in the world) and the Void (the summation of evil and darkness). [...] After his post-graduate work, John traveled to Wales and happened upon a glade called Fairy Glen in the country around Betws-y-Coed. [...] He is met by the Lady (the voice of the Word) and learns {{that he is the}} descendant of Owain Glyndŵr, a great Welsh [...] "patriot and warrior" [...] who served the Word. [...] John was then charged by the Lady [...] to embrace the Word and fight against the Void whenever he is called on. [...] After returning to America, he is visited by a Native American named O'olish Amaneh, who reminds him of his oath and <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> rune-engraved staff of great magic. [...] Upon taking the staff, John's leg is crippled as a reminder that he is dependent upon the staff, and through it, the Word.|$|E
2500|$|Sophia [...] "Sophie" [...] Aubrey meets Jack Aubrey in Post Captain, {{the second}} novel, {{when he is}} ashore in England due to the Peace of Amiens. She is the eldest of the three Williams sisters. She is {{described}} as very beautiful, fair, tall and with a perfect complexion. She and Maturin develop a close friendship lasting {{to the end of}} the series. Sophia followed Maturin's advice to tell Aubrey her true feelings, which advice proves wise. Her similar advice to Maturin to propose to Diana Villiers is dismissed by Maturin in Post Captain, and he misses the moment (later said also by Villiers in HMS Surprise). She grows in the courage of her convictions, agreeing to meet Aubrey aboard HMS Lively in Post Captain to agree not to marry anyone else; at Madeira (HMS Surprise) by travelling on a frigate with his friend Heneage Dundas as captain; en route, the frigate, and thus Sophia, sees some action. She is Jack's wife beginning in the fourth novel, The Mauritius Command. Her upbringing and values ensure that she does not share Aubrey's history of affairs, and they have a happy marriage and three children (twin girls, Charlotte and Fanny, and a boy, George). Sophia proves to be very competent at keeping accounts, in addition to successfully managing a household whose main provider (Jack) is often absent for months at a time. She is the stable person in his life. Sophia has two younger sisters, Cecelia and Frances, who appear in Post-Captain and are mentioned in HMS Surprise. Cecelia's young daughter is raised with her twin cousins, as Cecelia travels with her husband, in The Mauritius Command. Frances is said to be having a child in Ulster in book seven of the series, The Surgeon's Mate (112). Sophia meets her husband's son from a youthful romance when, full grown, he seeks out his father for his blessing in The Reverse of the Medal. This meeting does not upset her; she <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> note to bring to her husband in the event the two meet at the West Indies station. In The Letter of Marque, Sophia visits fictional Shelmerston to train and otherwise aid the newly hired purser for the privately owned ship Surprise.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} about supper at an expensive restaurant which had always appealed to Henry's imagination. Earnest devourer as he was of the solids of literature, he had tasted {{from time to time}} its lighter face--those novels which begin with the hero supping {{in the midst of the}} glittering throng and having his attention attracted to a distinguished-looking elderly man with a grey imperial who is entering with a girl so strikingly beautiful that the revellers turn, as she passes, to look after her. And then, as he sits and smokes, a waiter comes up to the hero and, with a soft 'Pardon, m'sieu!' <b>hands</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> note.|$|E
