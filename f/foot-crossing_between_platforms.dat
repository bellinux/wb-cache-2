30|$|The used {{model in}} a {{microprocessor}} development gains its efficiency {{from a great}} overlapping <b>between</b> <b>platforms,</b> tools, and OS. First between OS and tools, as most main frame OS offer specifically adapted tools to support their API. Also <b>between</b> tools and <b>platform,</b> as an example RISC processors have an instruction set specifically adapted to the output of most compilers. Finally, <b>between</b> <b>platform</b> and OS then, by integrating some OS related component into hardware, MMU {{is an example of}} such an overlapping. As for microprocessors, for FGDRAs the keypoint to maximize efficiency of a design model is the inter-overlapping <b>between</b> <b>platforms,</b> tools, and OS.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the application of Virtualization Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) and migration of vTPM states and develop a simulation migration model <b>between</b> <b>platforms.</b> TPM Emulator, software based TPM was used as the benchmark for the proposed vTPM. A vTPM instances <b>between</b> <b>platforms</b> based on modified TPM Emulator has been proposed in this study to reduce problem of migration vTPM states <b>between</b> <b>platforms.</b> The effect of different combination of UNIX domain socket and TCP socket on the platforms of the developed simulation migration model was studied and the effectiveness and shortcoming of TPM Emulator were highlighted. Results were compared between previous TPM Emulator running instances on single host <b>platform</b> and <b>between</b> <b>platforms.</b> It was discovered that modified TPM Emulator can perform the vTPM instances not only in single host <b>platforms</b> however includes <b>between</b> <b>platforms.</b> In addition, the use of simulation migration model was also proposed and investigated, named as Virtual Machine Monitor Management (vTPM Manager) to handles vTPM state life cycles. Simulation migration vTPM states results demonstrated that vTPM instances are able to be created and saved <b>between</b> <b>platforms.</b> Furthermore, from the case studies of vTPM challenges showed that the proposed simulation migration could be used as an alternative platform to adequately identify adequate and complete models for vTPM states life cycles...|$|R
