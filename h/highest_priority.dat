Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult. In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War Manpower Commission. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their <b>highest</b> <b>priority.</b>|$|E
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the <b>highest</b> <b>priority.</b> Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E

The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} in data {{transmissions}} that some information {{is more important than}} others. This is especially true in space communications where mission critical information or science data are <b>high</b> <b>priority.</b> In this work, we propose a simple yet constructive scheme to send <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data reliably and efficiently using Luby Transform (LT) codes. The new proposed scheme modifies the conventional LT encoder to send <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data as a degree 1 and 2 so that <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data can be quickly resolved and very likely recovered before a decoder stops. Preliminary results show that a carefully designed degree distribution of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> data increases the likelihood of receiving <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> information while having negligible performance impact on data with lower priority. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with the conventional LT approach with the same parameters under a range of erasure error rates...|$|R

40|$|Consider {{a single}} server retrial {{queueing}} system with second optional service under pre-emptive priority service {{in which two}} types of customers arrive in a Poisson process with arrival rate λ 1 for low priority customers and λ 2 for <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers. In this model the server provides two types of services (i. e) Essential Service and Second Optional Service. The essential service will be given first to both low <b>priority</b> and <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers. This second optional service will be extended to only <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers if they demand. The service times of essential service follow an exponential distribution with parameters µ 1 and µ 2 for both low and <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers respectively. The service time of second optional service for <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers follows an exponential distribution with parameter µ 3. The retrial is introduced for low priority customers only. Let K be {{the maximum number of}} waiting spaces for <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> customers in front of the service station. The <b>high</b> <b>priorities</b> customers will be governed by the Pre-emptive priority service. The access from orbit to the service facility is governed by the classical retrial policy.

The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated.

By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that the Green Line to Anacostia would open in July 1986. But in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints.

40|$|Initial {{detection}} of plant pests (includes diseases) is often {{made by the}} growers and consultants that work directly with crops; this form of detection {{is referred to as}} general surveillance. General surveillance activities have an important role in plant biosecurity for the early {{detection of}} pests and for demonstrating area freedom. In the Western Australian grains industry, reports of suspect <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests to the state Department of Agriculture and Food is the main form of general surveillance. There is little information on the level of knowledge of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests in the grains industry in Western Australia and the ability of members to detect <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests if they were present. This study details a survey of members of the grains industry to determine their knowledge of the signs of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> grains pests and the likelihood that they would detect a <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pest if it were present in grain or crops. Knowledge of the signs of the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> grain diseases, Karnal bunt and Barley stripe rust, were found to be higher than those of the <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> insect pests, Khapra beetle and Russian wheat aphid. A wide range of responses was collected from respondents' self-rated likelihood of detecting each of these pests and diseases in crop or harvested grain. However, respondents were more confident in their ability to detect the two plant diseases than the two insect pests. The {{results of this study suggest}} that further training in recognition of the signs and symptoms of <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> grains pests is required to increase the ability of members of the grains industry to confidently detect and differentiate <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> pests from common pests in the course of routine activitie...|$|R

One of these wings would be equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks and the other with Spitfires. In March Group Captain Clive Caldwell, the RAAF's highest-scoring flying ace of the war, reluctantly accepted command of the projected Spitfire wing after his request for a transfer to Europe was rejected by Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones.

40|$|A {{wireless}} ad-hoc {{network is}} a self-organized wireless network without fixed or backbone infrastructure. All nodes have routing capability and use peer-to-peer packet transmission or forward packets to other node using multi hop communication.

In this paper, a modified QoS routing protocol using directional antenna has been proposed. <b>High</b> and normal <b>priority</b> can be assigned based on type of traffic. All the nodes in the path used by <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> flow are reserved as <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> flow for that flow and normal priority flow will avoid the paths used by <b>high</b> <b>priority</b> flows.
