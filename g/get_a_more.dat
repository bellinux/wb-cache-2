During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women allocated to the Army. He attempted to do so without Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be impossible. In September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men allocated to the three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up the matter with Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 allocated to the three services.|$|E

25|$|Although Warner had {{intended}} to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, {{they were unable to}} do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Ball's vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together line by line in order to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pitch-perfect performance (this method is a lot more obvious on the soundtrack CD, where you can often hear a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line that sounds like two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original master copies caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original release's mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVD's audio track.|$|E
25|$|Though both {{manufacturers}} {{have a broad}} product range in various segments from single-aisle to wide-body, their aircraft do not always compete head-to-head. Instead they respond with models slightly smaller or bigger than the other in order to plug any holes in demand and achieve a better edge. The A380, for example, {{is designed to be}} larger than the 747. The A350XWB competes with {{the high end of the}} 787 and the low end of the 777. The A320 is bigger than the 737-700 but smaller than the 737–800. The A321 is bigger than the 737–900 but smaller than the previous 757-200.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a fourth type of {{generating}} {{a small sample}} of solutions is included in and. An example of interactive method utilizing trade-off information is the Zionts-Wallenius method, where the decision maker is shown several objective trade-offs at each iteration, and (s)he is expected to say whether (s)he likes, dislikes or is indifferent with respect to each trade-off. In reference point based methods (see e.g.), the decision maker is expected at each iteration to specify a reference point consisting of desired values for each objective and a corresponding Pareto optimal solution(s) is then computed and shown to him/her for analysis. In classification based interactive methods, the decision maker is assumed to give preferences in the form of classifying objectives at the current Pareto optimal solution into different classes indicating how the values of the objectives should be changed to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> preferred solution. Then, the classification information given is taken into account when new (more preferred) Pareto optimal solution(s) are computed. In the satisficing trade-off method (STOM) three classes are used: objectives whose values 1) should be improved, 2) can be relaxed, and 3) are acceptable as such. In the NIMBUS method, two additional classes are also used: objectives whose values 4) should be improved until a given bound and 5) can be relaxed until a given bound.|$|E

Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script.

Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, [...] "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world {{and they were going to}} emigrate and go to another country." [...] Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for [...] "Waterloo Sunset" [...] lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: [...] "We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> unique feel for the record.

[...] The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it [...] "the most beautiful song in the English language", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as [...] "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".|$|E
