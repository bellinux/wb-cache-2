40|$|B-AMC (Broadband Aeronautical Multi-Carrier communications) is a {{proposal}} for a future aeronautical communica-tions system to be operated in the aeronautical L-band. B-AMC is {{based on the results of}} the Broadband-VHF (B-VHF) project, although, due to the different spectrum allo-cation and propagation conditions in the L-band, basic physical layer parameters had to be adapted. In that process, the physical layer has been redesigned such as to support air to ground (A/G) communication as well as direct air to air (A/A) communication without requiring a <b>ground</b> <b>relay</b> station. The B-AMC system has been de-signed to coexist with Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) in terms of interference and duty-cycle. As a result of the physical layer adaptations a different approach for the higher layers has been required. The revised B-AMC data link layer is based on the experience gained during the B-VHF project. One key issue for the revision was the conceptional shift from primarily supporting digital voice to optimised data communications. The other design goals were the definition of a data link protocol stack capable of fulfilling the stringent requirements of the aeronautical environment – providing high performance, low latency and low duty cycle.

This study seeks to evaluate the performance trade-offs from a System-of-Systems (SoS) perspective between various UAV communications architecture options in the context two missions: tracking ballistic missiles and tracking insurgents. An agent-based discrete event simulation is used to model a sensor communication network consisting of UAVs, military communications satellites, <b>ground</b> <b>relay</b> stations, and a mission control center. Network susceptibility to cyber attack is modeled with probabilistic failures and induced data variability, with performance metrics focusing on information availability, latency, and trustworthiness. Results demonstrated that using UAVs as routers increased network availability with a minimal latency penalty and communications satellite networks were best for long distance operations. Redundancy {{in the number of}} links between communication nodes helped mitigate cyber-caused link failures and add robustness in cases of induced data variability by an adversary. However, when failures were not independent, redundancy and UAV routing were detrimental in some cases to network performance. Sensitivity studies indicated that long cyber-caused downtimes and increasing failure dependencies resulted in build-ups of failures and caused significant degradations in network performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the usage}} of Optical fibers and optical devices are evolved. Optical system {{has been used in}} many {{applications}} including space communication, which is satellite communication system. Laser technology is one of the advance optical technologies on satellite communication that is using optical wireless system. This chapter will discuss about the laser’s application in satellite and how it works. Space-based, free-space optical communications is a concept that has been around for many years. In the last few years, however, there has been impressive activity to bring the concept to fruition in civilian and government non-classified projects. Today's market for space-based optical communications is primarily inter-satellite links (ISLs) which are the main focus of this chapter. There is also a place for high data rate (many Gbps) space-earth links, though propagation effects due to the atmosphere and weather make this a much more difficult link. Laser satellite communication (LSC) which is an optical wireless system, uses free space as a propagation medium for various applications such as inter-satellite communication or satellite network. An LSC system includes a laser transmitter and an optical receiver. Space to space crosslink’s will afford information transfer to even the most remote site on earth without the expense of intermediate <b>ground</b> <b>relay</b> stations. Laser crosslink will enable this transfer of data between satellites at rates compatible with the ground fiber networks. This is an exciting era for space laser communications.

40|$|The {{advances}} in microelectronics have made small satellite technology an effective alternative to large and expensive satellites by decreasing space mission costs, without greatly reducing the performance. Small satellites can be launched in close formation flying patterns to perform coordinated measurements of remote space missions. This will allow {{a cluster of}} small satellites {{to be used to}} collect data from multiple points and time, thereby providing spatial and temporal resolutions that cannot be achieved with a single, conventional large satellite. There are three different formation flying patterns under study; Leader-Follower (A-Train), Cluster and Constellation. Inter-satellite communication eliminates the use of expensive <b>ground</b> <b>relay</b> stations and ground tracking networks. When satellites fly in constellations, using inter-satellite communications, it’s not necessary to sink all the data from each of the small satellite to ground, thus eliminating the need of intermediate ground stations for sending data. The small satellite formation control problems, particularly, attitude and relative position can be solved using inter-satellite communication by exchanging the attitude and relative position information among the small satellites. It can also provide timing synchronization. Therefore, inter-satellite communication plays a vital role when small satellites fly in close formations. This presentation aims to propose and validate inter-satellite communication protocols for distributed small satellite networks. We investigate the possibility of implementing a feasible Medium Access Control (MAC) and routing layer protocols for the three different formation flying patterns. A modified MAC and routing protocols particularly the Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) with Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) protocol are analyzed. Our proposed system performance is evaluated using throughput, access delay and end-to-end delay by running extensive simulations. The throughput of the system is deﬁned as the fraction of the total simulation time used for a valid transmission. For the Leader-Follower formation ﬂying pattern the maximum throughput we can achieve using the proposed protocol is about 23 % and for Cluster formation pattern, the maximum throughput is found to be 11 %. Average access delay and end-to-end delay are less for Leader-Follower formation pattern compared to the Cluster formation ﬂying pattern. We are currently working on the Constellation formation pattern. We have investigated the three types of formation for which we will describe the relative merits of each formation. The decision of which formation flying pattern has to be used depends on the mission architecture, e. g. number of satellites, orbits, power, etc...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{advances}} {{in the field of}} digital protection, more and more utilities are using microprocessor based relays for protection of power system equipment However, the protection philosophy remains the same. The present practice of protection is to analyze all the abnormal operating conditions in advance and to set the relays considering all the Contingencies.

40|$|The use of {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{that serve}} as aerial base stations is expected to become predominant in the next decade. However, in order for this technology to unfold its full potential {{it is necessary to}} develop a fundamental understanding of the distinctive features of air-to-ground (A 2 G) links. As a contribution in this direction, this paper proposes a generic framework for the analysis and optimization of the A 2 G systems. In contrast to the existing literature, this framework incorporates both height-dependent path loss exponent and small-scale fading, and unifies a widely used ground-to-ground channel model with that of A 2 G for analysis of large-scale wireless networks. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal UAV height that minimizes the outage probability of a given A 2 G link. Moreover, our framework allows us to derive a height-dependent closed-form expression and a tight lower bound for the outage probability of an A 2 G cooperative communication network. Our results suggest that the optimal location of the UAVs with respect to the ground nodes does not change by the inclusion of <b>ground</b> <b>relays.</b> This enables interesting insights in the deployment of future A 2 G networks, as the system reliability could be adjusted dynamically by adding relaying nodes without requiring changes in the position of the corresponding UAVs...|$|R
