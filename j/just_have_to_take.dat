40|$|The module {{presented}} in this project is about a sensor that mesuares the slope of an object. This is a parallax mechanism that is very usefull and has many aplications. The MX 2125 sensor works without any external influence. This mechanism composed of a square receptacle with an calorific element warms up a bubblle of gas detected by 4 temperatures sensors. Wich changes their temperature depending on how near they are from the gas bubble. We chose this project because it is very interesting to find aplications and show that theire devices can be controlled with microcontrolers in different programming languages. In our case Mikrobasic Pro. We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use two microcontrollers because and four CCP modules, two per each one. The outputs of the sensor are pwn signals. For this reason we made a program that mesures {{the width of the}} pulse using two interruptions, one for the upgoing transition and another one for the downgoing one.

5000|$|Further {{contributing}} to the crisis with the heavy losses taken by the 1st Canadian Army in the Battle of the Scheldt, in what was easily the most difficult and bloody battle fought by the Canadians in north-west Europe with for example the Black Watch regiment and the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry regiment both suffering 50% causality rates while fighting by {{the banks of the}} river Scheldt in October 1944. As more and more Canadians were killed or wounded during the Battle of the Scheldt without anyone to replace them, the survivors were required to do more with less, which imposed major psychological strains on the front-line infantry. Many soldiers were psychologically broken by the stress of the bloody fighting by the Scheldt, falling victim to battle exhaustion as they curled up in a fetal position and refused to move, which made the manpower shortages even worse. Such were the shortages of manpower that the Army refused to provide proper treatment for men suffering from battle exhaustion, giving them the shortest possible period of rest and treatment before sending them back to the front, a policy criticised by the Army's psychiatrists as inhumane. One soldier, Major Ben Dunkelman of the Queen's Own Rifles regiment wrote at the time: [...] "We knew why leaves were so scare. Thanks to Prime Minister Mackenzie King's handling of the Conscription issue at home". Another soldier serving in Italy, Brigadier Bill Murphy wrote to his wife: [...] "I personally will never cast another Liberal vote as long as King as {{anything to do with the}} party. Of the armies in Italy, only that of Canada has no provisions for home leave", the reason for which was [...] "that there are no men to replace them-except the Zombie Army.
