25|$|Some {{priests in}} some parishes (six out of 80) bless {{permanent}} faithful relationships. Permission is {{granted by the}} bishop only when a priest requests it, and a parish has decided by majority vote, {{that they want to}} be a place of blessing. Ingham says of the practice: <b>I</b> <b>insist</b> only that those on all sides of the issue respect one another and that everyone should maintain the order of the church. Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be a church that accommodates differences.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} trial Eiffel had {{announced}} his intention to resign from the Board of Directors of the Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel, and did so at a General Meeting held on 14 February, saying [...] "I have absolutely decided to abstain from any participation in any manufacturing business from now on, and {{so that no one}} can be misled and to make it most evident that I intend to remain absolutely uninvolved with the management of the establishments which bear my name, <b>I</b> <b>insist</b> that my name should disappear from the name of the company." [...] The company changed its name to La Société Constructions Levallois-Perret, with Maurice Koechlin as managing director. The name was changed to the Anciens Etablissements Eiffel in 1937.|$|E
2500|$|... "Demand of {{yourself}}! How {{much do you}} {{demand of}} yourself of what I'm talking about? Not even 10 percent, some of you. ... I {{want to know how}} you can dedicate yourself to your forthcoming positions in the musical world, when you can't dedicate yourself right now to what you're doing in a simple little march. ... The world is full of people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right—most of the time. Nobody's perfect! When are you going to start to demand of yourself what I demand of myself? When {{are you going to be}} as uncompromising with what you do as I am uncompromising in what I hear and what <b>I</b> <b>insist</b> on? When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day. And I don't only mean 5 minutes of 10; I mean 10 minutes out of 10; I mean 60 minutes out of an hour, 24 hours a day, at least all of your waking hours. ... I don't want it just about right! To me, just about right is terrible! ... Now, nobody's killed when you play a half-note as a dotted quarter. But you might, from learning to play a half-note a full half-note, make the difference in the lives of 50,000 little kids. ... You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know—a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is—they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.” ...|$|E
