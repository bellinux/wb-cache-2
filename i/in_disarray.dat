5|$|After {{his victory}} over Crixus, Gellius moved northwards, {{following}} the main group of slaves under Spartacus who were heading for Cisalpine Gaul. The army of Lentulus was deployed to bar Spartacus' path, and the consuls hoped to trap the rebel slaves between them. Spartacus' army met Lentulus' legion, defeated it, turned, and destroyed Gellius' army, forcing the Roman legions to retreat <b>in</b> <b>disarray.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans <b>in</b> <b>disarray,</b> they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now <b>in</b> <b>disarray.</b> Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy who was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Due to the unrelenting {{losses and}} stories of Greek atrocities in Tripolis, the Sultan became desperate and in 1824 {{he called on}} his Viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to aid him. Ali promised to aid him in return for cession of the island of Crete, Cyprus, as well as making his son Ibrahim Pasha, Pasha of the Peloponnese. After his offer was accepted, Ali sent his son {{in command of the}} expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were <b>in</b> <b>disarray</b> because of {{political}} rivalries which had caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son Panos was killed, and his nephew Nikitaras forced to flee.|$|E
5|$|In May 1800 Napoleon, by {{then the}} undisputed leader of France, brought his troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14June his army met the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo (near Alessandria). Austrian troops were {{initially}} successful; by mid-morning they were {{in control of the}} field of battle. Their commander, Michael von Melas, sent this news south towards Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived in late afternoon, and Napoleon attacked the tired Austrians. As Melas retreated <b>in</b> <b>disarray</b> with the remains of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message. The Neapolitans abandoned Rome, and the city spent the next fourteen years under French domination.|$|E

Suddenly the fog lifted and the Poles caught sight of dense ranks of the Spanish cavalry, and two batteries of horse artillery as well. Colonel Konopka, seeing great predominance of the enemy, gave the only possible order which was to retreat toward the main French force.|$|R
40|$|Myofiber disarray'' {{defines a}} nonparallel {{arrangement}} of cardiac myocytes. The {{presence of a}} sufficient quantity of myocardial fibers showing this change {{is considered to be}} a specific histological feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, small zones of myofiber <b>disarray</b> are found <b>in</b> both cardiac hypertrophy and other pathological conditions. Recently, we demonstrated an altered pattern of desmin intermediate filaments <b>in</b> <b>disarrayed</b> myofibers from specimens of HCM. To test the hypothesis that desmin alterations might be specific for cardiomyopathy, we performed an immunohistochemical study on myocardial surgical samples from 11 patients with HCM and from 12 patients with tetralogy of Fallot (toF) on 14 endomyocardial biopsy specimens (EMBs) from transplant recipients with myofiber disarray surrounding areas of scarring (previous biopsy site) and on speciments of four autoptic hearts with severe acquired left ventricular hypertrophy. Disarrayed myofibers from all specimens of HCM showed the following abnormalities in the pattern of desmin intermediate filament distribution: (1) decrease or loss of labeling of intercalated discs and Z bands, (2) longitudinal arrangement of desmin intermediate filaments, and (3) intense, granular staining of several myocytes. This spectrum of desmin alterations was never observed <b>in</b> <b>disarrayed</b> myofibers <b>in</b> specimens of toF or acquired myocardial hypertrophy or in EMBs. Altered distribution of desmin intermediate filaments seems to be specific to myofiber <b>disarray</b> <b>in</b> HCM and it may play a role in the altered myocyte arrangement in HCM.

5|$|Leo the Wise died in 912, and {{hostilities}} soon resumed as Simeon {{marched to}} Constantinople {{at the head}} of a large army. Though the walls of the city were impregnable, the Byzantine administration was <b>in</b> <b>disarray</b> and Simeon was invited into the city, where he was granted the crown of basileus (emperor) of Bulgaria and had the young emperor Constantine VII marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered Adrianople. The Empire now faced the problem of a powerful Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople, as well as having to fight on two fronts.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1567, in a swoop {{known as}} the Surprise of Meaux, Huguenot forces {{attempted}} to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris <b>in</b> <b>disarray.</b> The war was ended by the Peace of Longjumeau of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. The Surprise of Meaux marked {{a turning point in}} Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where Calvinists and rebels were put to death in the thousands.|$|E

5|$|San Martín's {{column was}} the first one to reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon fire from the ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and the speed of the cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating <b>in</b> <b>disarray</b> under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E

The miquelets and armed peasants, however, fired on them from the south and killed up to 70 French soldiers. According to Charles Sévin, marquis de Quincy, a contemporary French artillery general and military historian of Louis XIV's reign, Juigné's corps was able to retreat to Olot in good order. On the other hand, the local 19th-century Catalan historian Esteve Paluzie i Cantalozella claimed that the French troops fled <b>in</b> <b>disarray,</b> leaving 150 prisoners to the Catalans, which they carried to Sant Esteve d'en Bas under a heavy escort.|$|E

5|$|The {{apparent}} {{panic in}} Polish ranks convinced Muraviev to renew his assault with fresh forces, despite the losses his columns had suffered. Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 {{from the north}} and captured a brickyard and yet another fortified inn, the Karczma Żelazna directly to its rear. Its garrison offered only light resistance before retreating <b>in</b> <b>disarray.</b> The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of {{a large part of the}} second line of Polish defences.|$|E

5|$|As {{had been}} the case at Northwestern, Notre Dame's {{football}} program {{was in a state}} of flux when Parseghian arrived. While Notre Dame built a proud history under Rockne and Frank Leahy, its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster. The team had finished 5–5 in 1962 under Joe Kuharich, who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame's administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich's surprise departure at the end of that season to become supervisor of officials in the National Football League, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, left the program <b>in</b> <b>disarray.</b> Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. Notre Dame managed only a 2–7 finish that year.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00 {{that evening}} {{a large number}} of South Koreans were {{retreating}} <b>in</b> <b>disarray</b> through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the Australians. The South Korean 6th Division later regrouped in positions behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the Chinese main effort against Seoul, the Chinese 118th Division continued its secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating South Koreans. Racing down the northeast running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the Australian positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, and most likely unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the Chinese vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting as they approached a long, low north-south running ridge that rose like an island in the mouth of the valley.|$|E
5|$|By February 1864, Admiral Bonard had {{accumulated}} sufficient reinforcements to attack and seize Định's main strongholds in the Tan Hoa and Gò Công areas. He inflicted heavy casualties on the partisans and {{forced them to}} retreat <b>in</b> <b>disarray.</b> Định reorganised his troops and procured more firearms from the local Chinese in order to resume his guerrilla campaign. He attempted to widen his support base by distributing leaflets {{as far as the}} regional centres of Saigon and Mỹ Tho, calling on nghĩa quân from other provinces to join the common struggle. By this time, the French were able to keep Định and the other resistance leaders constantly on the move, aided by a growing network of local informants. In 1863, a famine had broken out, and resistance forces were increasingly unable to find food. With the court providing no practical support, the French gradually wore down the partisans. Định retreated into the marshes of Bien Hoa, where he attempted to reorganise his forces.|$|E
