40|$|For {{satellite}} communications, propagation effects due to {{the atmosphere}} are a critical system factor. This contribution presents monthly single and joint parameter statistics of 20 GHz beacon attenuation, <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> temperature, radiometer derived attenuation and rain rate.

40|$|The {{operation}} and problems involved with two <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> meters {{installed in the}} Catalina Mountains near Tucson, Arizona are discussed. The instruments were installed at two different locations on Mt. Lemon. It was found that when photometric conditions prevailed, a positive correlation existed between the outputs of the two instruments. In particular, the strongdiurnal effect, in which the <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> increases abruptly at sunrise and falls markedly after sunset, was reproduced by both instruments. Discrepancies in data recorded by the two instruments are analyzed and possible causes for the discrepancies are proposed...|$|R
5000|$|On October 18, 2010, Myspace Transmissions {{released}} a live EP {{of the band}} playing five tracks from Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> {{as well as a}} cover of the Nirvana song, [...] "Scentless Apprentice".|$|R

In a sparse array the <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> contribution is from the convolution of the sky with the element patterns whereas for a dense array it is given by the convolution with the array beam. The relative merits of the sparse and dense arrays for Radio Astronomy applications are discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a recent effort to compare the <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> power {{received}} by broadband dipole antennas at LWA frequencies as predicted by simulation and given by measurement are summarized. The simulation method, which combines results from a full-wave simulation of a given antenna design with a properly frequency-scaled all-sky map of radio continuum to generate predicted drift scans is first described. The measurement approach, which consists of conducting calibrated total power measurements of the antenna design {{over an extended period}} of time, is described. The measured and simulated drift scan results are then compared to determine the level of absolute agreement achieved between the two. Finally, conclusions are given. Drift Scan Simulation Approach The predicted variation in received <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> with time is calculated in the usual manner by convolving simulated radiation patterns for an antenna with an all-sky map. In particular, the equivalent noise temperature due to <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> for a lossless antenna at a given time, t (in LST), is given by the following expression [1] 1 TANT, lossless () t = ∑∑M(, i j) U (θφ,) cosb U (θφ,) cos...|$|R

30|$|The trigger {{system of}} the HESS Phase-I project is devised {{in order to make}} use of the {{stereoscopic}} approach: simultaneous observation of interesting images must be required in order to store a specific event [2]. This coincidence requirement reduces the rate of background events, that is, events that may be assimilated to night <b>sky</b> <b>noise.</b> It is composed of two separate levels (L 1 and the central trigger).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, initially, the {{essential}} measurement method of the DLRweather radar is described. In the following, some polarimetric signatures from natural and artificial targets (polarimetric DLR weather radar and JPL SAR measurements) are considered. The interpretation of these polarimetric signatures include: {{qualitative and quantitative}} meteorological deductions, estimation of attenuation along a satellite path and the polarization dependence of radiometric <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> temperature {{in the presence of}} precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> {{spectrum}} {{are used}} to characterize perturbations in the ionosphere. Observations were made at the same sidereal time on multiple days using a calibrated broadband dipole and radio spectrometer covering 80 to 185 MHz. In this frequency range, an ionospheric opacity perturbation changes both the electron thermal emission from the ionosphere and the absorption of the <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> background. For the first time, these changes are confirmed to have the expected spectral signature and {{are used to}} derive the opacity and electron temperature associated with the perturbations {{as a function of}} local time. The observations were acquired at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia from 18 April 2014 to 6 May 2014. They show perturbations that increase at sunrise, continue during the day, and decline after sunset. Magnitudes corresponding to an opacity of about 1 percent at 150 MHz with a typical electron temperature of about 800 K, were measured for the strongest perturbations.

40|$|The {{status of}} the Olympus Propagation Experiment of the Communications Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada, is briefly summarized. Path {{attenuation}} measurements at multiple frequencies correlated with concurrent dual polarized radar data provide a unique method to investigate propagation effects. An experiment of this type is being implemented by the Communications Research Centre (CRC) {{on the grounds of}} the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa. Beacon receivers monitor signals from the Olympus satellite at 12. 5, 19. 77, and 29. 66 GHz at a path elevation angle of 14. 2 deg. <b>Sky</b> <b>noise</b> radiometers operating near the same frequencies and pointed along the same path provide additional propagation information. A colocated dual-polarized 9. 6 -GHz radar probes the precipitation state on the path, permitting identification of precipitation regimes that cause the observed impairments. The Olympus experiment configuration is displayed pictorially. Information on path propagation phenomena can be deduced by correlating the radar, beacon, and <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> data. Melting layer effects and propagation losses for higher time percentages are prime interests. Data collected by Diversitel Communications during equipment verification tests are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study has been}} performed {{on a series of}} typical fluctuation events. Curves are shown, establishing a relationship between the fluctuations variance and the 35 GHz <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> temperature. The study of fluctuations superimposed on attenuation has also been undertaken, but no definite results have been obtained yet. A careful analysis of the events yields as a conclusion that the fluctuations affect neither the discrimination nor the phase of the signals. Spectra have been calculated, confirming earlier conclusions. Anglai...|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{their musical}} career, but {{particularly}} {{with respect to}} their first album Juturna, the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has been a large influence on Circa Survive. The album's hidden track is based on the Mark Z. Danielewski novel House of Leaves, lending it an unofficial title. Lyrically, their third album Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> is based on Green's struggles with mental illness, with many of the lyrics written during his voluntary three-week stay in a mental health facility.|$|R
40|$|Based on a joint {{analysis}} of the data from 10 midlatitude decameter radars the effects are investigated during 80 x-ray flares in the period 2013 - 2017. For the investigation nine mid-latitude SuperDARN radars of the northern hemisphere and Ekaterinburg coherent decameter radar of ISTP SB RAS are used. All the radars work in the same 8 - 20 MHz frequency band and have similar hardware and software. During the analysis the temporal dynamics of noise from each of the radar direction and for each flare is investigated separately. As a result, on the basis of about 13000 daily measurements we found a strong anticorrelation between noise power and x-ray flare intensity, that allows to use short-wave <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> to diagnose the ionospheric effects of x-ray solar flares. It is shown that in 88. 3 % of cases an attenuation of daytime decameter radio noise is observed during solar flare, correlating with the temporal dynamics of the solar flare. The intensity of decameter noise anticorrelates well (the Pearson correlation coefficient better than - 0. 5) with the shape of the X-ray flare in the daytime (for solar elevation angle > 0) in 33 % of cases, the average Pearson correlation over the daytime is about - 0. 34. Median regression coefficient between GOES 0. 1 - 0. 8 nm x-ray intensity and daytime sky-noise attenuation is about - 4. 4 · 10 ^ 4 [dB· m^ 2 /Wt]. Thus, {{it has been shown that}} measurements of the decameter <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> level at midlatitude decameter radars can be used to study the ionospheric absorption of high-frequency waves in the lower ionosphere during x-ray solar flares. This can be explained by the assumption that the most part of decameter <b>sky</b> <b>noise</b> detected by the radars can be interpreted as produced by ground sources at distances of the first propagation hop (3000 km).

50|$|Circa Survive quickly made a {{name for}} {{themselves}} in the indie music scene in little over two years with their 2005 debut album, Juturna, and second album, On Letting Go, released in 2007. Both albums were released on Equal Vision Records. Their third album, Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise,</b> was released via Atlantic Records in 2010, to critical acclaim. After parting ways with Atlantic Records, the band's fourth album, Violent Waves, was released independently in 2012. Their fifth album, Descensus, was released by Sumerian Records in 2014.|$|R
40|$|Commissioning of SCUBA- 2 {{included}} {{a program of}} skydips and observations of calibration sources intended to be folded into regular observing as standard methods of source flux calibration and to monitor the atmospheric opacity and stability.

Novel techniques for analysing on-sky performance and atmospheric conditions are presented, along with results from the calibration observations and skydips. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, after mixing for Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> was {{completed}} in February, Circa Survive began performing shows in the midwest United States in March, often accompanied by Good Old War and The Christmas Lights. The band performed at the annual SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, from March 18 to 24. They also performed in Anaheim at the Hoodwink Festival on March 26 and at The Bamboozle on March 27. One month later, following the release of Blue <b>Sky</b> <b>Noise</b> on April 20, Circa Survive embarked on an extended tour with Coheed and Cambria and Torche, beginning in Charlotte, North Carolina, on April 22 and ending on May 29 in Atlantic City. On June 19, 2010, Circa Survive performed at Santa Monica Beach at the Pac Sun Beach Ballyhoo event, which was shut down early due to overcrowding before the band could perform their last two songs. After an eleven-day U.S. west coast tour in late July, Circa Survive embarked on a September European tour with Middle Class Rut, beginning in Hamburg, Germany, on September 6 and ending in Nottingham, England, on September 18. Their show in London on September 15 was streamed live over the Internet and attracted more than 43,000 viewers online.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} angle modifier (IAM) of a {{solar thermal collector}} for diffuse irradiance is usually determined under the simplifying assumption of <b>isotropic</b> <b>sky</b> and ground radiance. It is applied as one constant collector parameter, independent from slope or weather conditions. The simulation model introduced here considers the varying anisotropy of sky radiance. To create realistic distributions, the approach of Brunger and Hooper is used. Three modes are possible: Mode 1 calculates separate IAMs for anisotropic sky (for every time step) and isotropic ground. Mode 2 calculates separate IAMs for <b>isotropic</b> <b>sky</b> and <b>isotropic</b> ground (once per simulation). Mode 3 uses a user-specified isotropic IAM-value for the collector hemisphere. The model is applied to a stationary, double-covered process heat flat-plate collector with one-sided CPC booster reflector (RefleC). This collector shows a biaxial and asymmetric IAM for direct irradiance. It is found that, compared to anisotropic modeling, the simplified isotropic model is undervaluing the annual output of this collector by 13. 7 % for a constant inlet temperature of 120 °C in Würzburg, Germany. At 40 °C inlet temperature the undervaluation is 9. 3 %. For the basis flat-plate without reflector the undervaluation is 7. 5 % at 120 °C and 3. 3 % at 40 °C. An annual irradiation distribution diagram shows that {{this is due to}} an underestimation of diffuse irradiation from directions with high direct irradiation. Detailed results reveal that for RefleC the IAM for anisotropic diffuse sky radiance can vary by up to approx. 25 percentage points during one day. It is concluded that isotropic modeling of diffuse irradiance can be expected to significantly undervalue the annual output of all non-focusing solar thermal collectors. Highest relevance is found for high collector slopes, complex IAMs and at low-efficiency operation. The optimal collector slope is almost not affected. Accuracy of existing models can be increased by applying Mode 2...|$|R
40|$|Accurately {{computing}} {{solar irradiance}} on external facades {{is a prerequisite}} for reliably predicting thermal behavior and cooling loads of buildings. Validation of radiation models and algorithms implemented in building energy simulation codes is an essential endeavor for evaluating solar gain models. Seven solar radiation models implemented in four building energy simulation codes were investigated: (1) <b>isotropic</b> <b>sky,</b> (2) Klucher, (3) Hay-Davies, (4) Reindl, (5) Muneer, (6) 1987 Perez, and (7) 1990 Perez models. The building energy simulation codes included: EnergyPlus, DOE- 2. 1 E, TRNSYS-TUD, and ESP-r. Solar radiation data from two 25 days periods in October and March/April, which included diverse atmospheric conditions and solar altitudes, measured on the EMPA campus in a suburban area in Duebendorf, Switzerland, were used for validation purposes. Two of the three measured components of solar irradiances - global horizontal, diffuse horizontal and direct-normal - were used as inputs for calculating global irradiance on a south-west façade. Numerous statistical parameters were employed to analyze hourly measured and predicted global vertical irradiances. Mean absolute differences for both periods were found to be: (1) 13. 7 % and 14. 9 % for the <b>isotropic</b> <b>sky</b> model, (2) 9. 1 % for the Hay-Davies model, (3) 9. 4 % for the Reindl model, (4) 7. 6 % for the Muneer model, (5) 13. 2 % for the Klucher model, (6) 9. 0 %, 7. 7 %, 6. 6 %, and 7. 1 % for the 1990 Perez models, and (7) 7. 9 % for the 1987 Perez model. Detailed sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo and fitted effects for N-way factorial analyses were applied to assess how uncertainties in input parameters propagated through one of the building energy simulation codes and impacted the output parameter. The implications of deviations in computed solar irradiances on predicted thermal behavior and cooling load of buildings are discussed...|$|R
