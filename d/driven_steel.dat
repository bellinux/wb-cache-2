5000|$|Mini-piles {{have the}} {{greatest}} use where ground conditions are very variable, where access is restrictive, where environmental pollution aspects are significant, and where structural movements in service must be minimal. [...] Mini-piled underpinning is generally used when the loads from the foundations need {{to be transferred to}} stable soils at considerable depths - usually in excess of 5 m. Mini-piles may either be augured or <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> cased, and are normally between 150 mm and 300 mm in diameter. Structural engineers will use rigs which are specifically designed to operate in environments with restricted headroom and limited space, and can gain access through a regular domestic doorway. They are capable of constructing piles to depths of up to 15 m. The technique of minipiling was first applied in Italy in 1952, and has gone through a plethora of different names, reflecting worldwide acceptance and expiration of the original patents.The relatively small diameter of mini-piles is extremely distinctive of this type of underpinning and generally uses anchoring or tie backs into an existing structure or rock. Conventional drilling and grouting methods are used for this method of underpinning. These mini-piles have a high slenderness ratio, feature substantial steel reinforcing elements and can sustain axial loading in both senses. [...] The working loads of mini-piles can sustain up to 1000 kN loads.In comparison to Mass Concrete Underpinning, the engineering aspect of mini-piles is a bit more involved, including rudimentary engineering mechanics such as statics and strength of materials. These mini-piles must be designed to work in tension and compression, depending on the orientation and application of the design. In detail, attention with design must be paid analytically to settlement, bursting, buckling, cracking, and interface consideration, whereas, from a practical viewpoint, corrosion resistance, and compatibility with the existing ground and structure must be regarded.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that results of many {{instrumented}} pile load tests {{have been reported in}} the literature, it is difficult to find well-documented instrumentation procedures that can be used when planning a load testing programme. A load test programme designed to investigate various aspects of the design and behaviour of <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> piles is discussed in the present paper. Although the literature contains information on load testing of instrumented piles driven in either sand or clay, limited information is available regarding their axial load response in transitional soils (soils composed of various amounts of clay, silt and sand). Results are presented for fully instrumented axial load tests performed on an H pile and a closed-ended pipe pile driven into a multilayered soil profile consisting of transitional soils. In addition, the load testing planning, the instrumentation of the piles, the testing methods and the interpretation of the pile testing data are discussed in detail in the context of this and other load testing programmes described in the literature, in order to illustrate the various steps...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{presence}} of uncertainties, errors inevitably arise with the estimations of pile settlement. To properly consider serviceability requirements in limit state design, it is necessary to characterize the performance of commonly used settlement prediction models. In this work, information from 64 cases of long <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> H-piles from field static loading tests in Hong Kong is utilized to evaluate the errors of three settlement prediction models for single piles: two elastic methods and a nonlinear load-transfer method. Commonly adopted soil parameters recommended in two Hong Kong design guidelines are used to reflect the uncertainty arising from evaluation of soil properties. The model error is represented by a bias factor. A conventional statistical analysis was first conducted to study the variability of model bias. A regression analysis method was then proposed as a supplemental analysis of model bias when only limited test data were available or when the measured settlement data distribute in a large range. Both methods result in very similar mean biases. The mean bias of each prediction model tends to vary with the load level and the bearing stratum at the pile toe; while the coefficient of variation of model bias only varies in narrow ranges...|$|E

40|$|How {{the design}} and actual {{founding}} depths of foundations correspond to the variability of geological conditions {{has long been a}} concern. This paper evaluates the spatial variability characteristics of as-built and estimated founding depths of <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> H piles with reference to the spatial variability characteristics of geologic profiles at a weathered soil site in Hong Kong. Spatial variability characteristics are evaluated in terms of variance and scale of fluctuation. The variability of three founding depth indicators, i. e., the depth of Grade-III bedrock, the depth of standard penetration test blow count "N" of 200 blows/ 0. 3 m (SPT- 200), and the depth of completely decomposed granite over the site was estimated. It is found that pile founding depths exhibit greater variations than those of the geologic profiles due to the presence of design model errors, judgment errors, and construction effects. The as-built founding depths are mostly between the SPT- 200 profile and the Grade-III bedrock profile. The variances of as-built pile length are similar to those with depth of SPT- 200 but less than those with depth of Grade-III bedrock. The scale of fluctuation of as-built pile length is on the order of 20 m when kriging is used and 10 m when kriging is not used, which are less than those with depths of SPT- 200 and Grade-III bedrock. © 2010 ASCE...|$|E
40|$|H-piles {{are widely}} used to support bridge piers and foundations, {{particularly}} those founded on relatively weak subsoil layers. The piles are forcefully driven to stronger layers to transfer the load of the entire structure to the bearing strata. <b>Driven</b> <b>steel</b> H-piles are designed to effectively interact with their surrounding environment {{in and out of}} the ground without failure. Standard practices such as AASHTO/LRFD and state codes regulate the load bearing capacity and drivability of H-piles to ensure safe performance during their service life. This thesis investigates the feasibility of installing H-piles considering the limitations on the driving stress to achieve the design capacity (αASFy). Effects of parameters related to the soil-pile-hammer system have been studied. The gradual development of standard practices regulating the properties of H-piles related to material type, cross section geometry, pile length, and driving stress is discussed focusing on AASHTO/LRFD and PennDOT revisions to AASHTO. The results of a comprehensive parametric study carried out on the soil-pile-hammer system for 50 ksi driven H-piles are presented. 126 base scenarios, and 15 sensitivity analyses were constructed and analyzed using computer program GRLWEAP. In addition, 11 benchmark scenarios were considered to validate the study methodology approach using field data provided by PennDOT. An additional application of H-piles as driven ‘extended piles’ under combined axial and lateral load is briefly discussed and the effects of soil-pile interaction on the performance of pile is investigated...|$|E
40|$|In Hong Kong, <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> H-piles are {{commonly}} used to support high-rise buildings. In a dissoluted marble site that is classified as a scheduled area in Hong Kong, the rockhead is highly variable and thick layers of weak materials such as debris flow materials are found. Very large pile penetration (e. g. larger than 100 m) was needed to achieve the required pile capacity. Given the special ground conditions and the flexibility of such very long piles, a serious concern arose about pile verticality. Pile bending during driving {{has been known for}} a long time. The induced lateral movements of a pile may enlarge the cavity along which the pile shaft travels. A reduction of horizontal effective stress may then occur and the pile capacity and stiffness may be adversely affected. Two test piles were installed in the site, with final pile lengths of 157 m and 164. 5 m, respectively. Verticality of the piles up to a penetration depth of 82 m was carefully monitored during pile driving by using inclinometers instrumented on the piles. In one case, the pile toe was found to have deviated 2. 2 m away from the expected pile axis. High strain dynamic tests were conducted at several penetration depths to investigate the integrity and performance of the 'deflected' piles. In this paper, details of the field monitoring and testing program are reported and several "whys" are explored in an attempt to understand the observed pile behaviour...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that steel {{consumption}} has {{a significant impact on the}} development of societies. A growth in steel consumption is often considered as an indicator of economic development. The purpose of this thesis is to examine how China's steel consumption is related to the rapid economic growth, and in which direction the Granger-causality is running. The study covers the period between 1970 and 2011. The time series analysis consists of three different econometric tests. The results show that both time series are non-stationary and integrated of order one. The analysis of cointegration between these time series indicates that steel consumption and economic development in China has a long-term equilibrium relationship. This study finds unidirectional Granger-causality running from economic development to steel consumption, which means that it is the rapid economic development in China that <b>drives</b> <b>steel</b> consumption. On the other hand, the growth in steel consumption has no significant effect on China's economic development. Validerat; 20130625 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|Large lateral {{movements}} of a pile during impact driving can cause yielding {{of the surrounding}} soil. When this happens, the effective stresses between the soil and the pile wall diminish, and the pile shaft resistance decreases. A piling project {{was carried out in}} a marble area in Hong Kong, where highly variable rockhead contours and deep depressions filled with weak soil deposits were found. Many steel H-piles were driven to depths of more than 100 m, and the verticality of such long piles was a concern. A pile test program consisting of four <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> H-piles with pile lengths up to 164. 5 m was conducted. Verticality monitoring and dynamic pile tests at several penetration depths were performed. This paper aims at interpreting the verticality of the four long piles, studying the relevance of pile verticality to the encountered geological features, and studying the effect of pile verticality on the pile capacity. The maximum lateral pile movement during driving was up to 8. 7 m at a depth of 100 m, and the maximum local pile inclination reached 0. 139. The lateral {{movements of}} the piles during driving well matched the rockhead inclination and soil conditions. Both one-way sway and two-way cyclic sway of the test piles were observed. Cyclic sway was shown to cause more severe reduction of the pile shaft resistance than one-way sway. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) GT. 1943 - 5606. 0000707.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a procedure to determine resistance factors for newly developed pile products through an example of the rotational intrusion steel pile (RI pile). RI pile is a newly developed steel pile product which has the vane type tip structure to resist reliably against vertical load and to intrude easily by rotating itself. Moreover, the RI pile is environment-friendly, i. e. reduce waste soil and less construction noise, because of the rotating intrusion method. The construction can be done with the small pile driving equipment and the pile can be reliably founded into the bearing ground by monitoring and controlling the torque value during installation. For these reasons, the RI-pile is expected to have the superior bearing capacity against vertical loads. However, the RI-pile has not been adopted in many construction projects yet because the current design method requires applying the same safety factor neglecting the level of the uncertainty of each pile type. In this study, 64 loading test data are gathered to quantify the model error of the RI-pile assisted by Public Works Research Institute (PWRI). Then, Reliability analysis is conducted based on our proposed reliability analysis scheme (GRASP) to specify the reliability level of the current design. Furthermore, the partial factor updating procedure according to the newly developed the RI pile is formulated based on the design value method. From the results, the partial factor is determined and applied to compare the RI steel pile to the traditional piles, i. e. cast in pile and <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> pile. The difference in construction cost among the three piles has become less, and the RI pile is less expensive when the rate of the pile tip resistance is high...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} vibrations in a single passenger car wheel to identify road fiction. The peak in the transfer function of wheel speed to brake torque variations at the lowest resonance frequency (~ 32 Hz) is strongly influenced by the 'constraint' provided by the road surface. A model of the wheel with its rotational inertia {{in contact with the}} road via the tyre is developed. The inflated tyre carcass provides the stiffness in all directions, here mainly the rotational motion of the wheel, combined with the forward motion of the vehicle is considered. The tyre to road interaction includes the effect of saturation in the force versus brake slip characteristic. After linearization it can be proven that the local derivative of the slip characteristic has a consistent influence on the dynamic behaviour of the tyre. Where the local derivative tends to zero, the maximum achievable brake force is reached. Therefore, assessing the local derivative of the brake force versus slip curve is vital for optimal braking. The phenomenon is also studied in a laboratory environment, with a single braked wheel, running on an electrically <b>driven</b> <b>steel</b> drum of 2. 5 m diameter. Special attention is needed for the instrumentation of the wheel rotational speed. To reach the required sample rate and resolution in wheel speed information, the data-acquisition counts the duration of an encoder period. Since this wheel speed signal becomes available at encoder flanges, it needs to be resampled to create data that is synchronous with the input brake pressure and -torque and -force data, typically sampled at 512 Hz. For some conditions and road surfaces (bare steel and 'safety walk paper') both the relation between local derivative and resonance gain and the application of this relation as a friction identification methodology will be assessed...|$|E
