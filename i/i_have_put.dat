The writer commented, [...] "Everything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> into it is based entirely on fact. It just happens to be a story that not many people are {{familiar}} with."

500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we owe it to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and I only hope that women who have experienced it will think I have given it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E

500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I {{do not have to be}} convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that." ...|$|E
500|$|Fantastics {{circulation}} {{was about}} 37,000 when White took over; only about 4 {{percent of this}} was subscription sales. [...] Cohen's wife filled the subscriptions from their garage, and according to White, Cohen regarded this as a burden, and never tried to increase the subscription base. [...] Despite White's efforts, Fantastics circulation fell, from almost 37,000 {{when he took over}} as editor to less than 24,000 in the summer of 1975. [...] Cohen was rumored to be interested in selling both Fantastic and Amazing; among other possibilities, both Roger Elwood, at that time an active science fiction anthology editor, and Edward Ferman, the editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, approached Cohen with a view to acquiring the titles. [...] Nothing came of it, however, and White was not aware of the possible sales. [...] He was working at a low salary, with unpaid help from friends to read unsolicited submissions—at one point he introduced a 25-cent reading fee for manuscripts from unpublished writers; the fee would be refunded if White bought the story. [...] White sometimes found himself at odds with Cohen's business partner, Arthur Bernhard, due to their different political views. [...] White's unhappiness with his working conditions culminated in his resignation after Cohen refused his proposal to publish Fantastic as a slick magazine, with larger pages and higher quality paper. [...] White commented in an article in Science Fiction Review that he had brought to the magazines [...] "a lot of energy and enthusiasm and a great many ideas for their improvement ...Well, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> into effect nearly every idea which I was allowed to follow through on ... and have spent most of my energy and enthusiasm." [...] Cohen was able to persuade him to stay for another year; in the event White stayed for another three.|$|E

2500|$|The {{willingness}} {{to commit suicide}} before accepting defeat was a key Nazi idea during the Second World War.

2500|$|Two years later, {{following}} {{a move to}} London, March finished his third novel, The Tallons, the second in his [...] "Pearl County" [...] series. Reviews in the UK were generally positive, {{more so than in}} the United States. Psychological problems that had already bothered him in Germany worsened in London, and he became a patient of psychoanalyst Edward Glover, who was able to cure March's throat paralysis, diagnosing it as a hysterical condition. (March dedicated The Tallons to him, [...] "as a slight recompense for the gray hairs <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> in his head".) While in London March became acquainted with a number of literary characters, leaving more of his Waterman work to his subordinates. In 1937, he returned to the US and within two years resigned his position to concentrate more on his writing, which by then was a full-time occupation; he had been paid partly in stock and could live well off the dividends. 1937, Simmonds notes, was an important year—it marked the high point of his productivity as a short-story writer, and the magazine The American Mercury took up Company K for a reprinting. In 1943, he completed his most ambitious and critically acclaimed novel, The Looking-Glass, the final book in his [...] "Pearl County" [...] series; Bert Hitchcock, literature professor at Auburn, called it March's [...] "finest literary achievement".|$|E
