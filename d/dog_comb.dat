50|$|Back at the station, Lieutenant Oakes (Garry Chalk) warns Sarah {{that she}} needs solid {{evidence}} to accuse the powerful Richmond. Holder shows her a newspaper that features Richmond's affairs with pictures, saying that the women all look like Rosie. They meet with Meg Connell (Camille Sullivan), Gwen's predecessor on Richmond's campaign. She admits to {{having an affair with}} Richmond. The detectives then check out gas stations along the casino route. Holder speculates that Richmond waited to refuel until his tank was nearly empty and suggests visiting a station near the park that is not on their list. The manager (Kevin McNulty) at a station bordering the park recalls the campaign car—and the screams of a girl before the driver sped away. Sarah deduces that Rosie broke free and escaped into the forest behind the station. Police soon arrive with search <b>dogs</b> to <b>comb</b> the forest.

40|$|AbstractA novel spot-on {{formulation}} combining permethrin, pyriproxifen and dinotefuran (Vectra 3 D™ spot-on {{solution for}} dogs) was evaluated in adult Beagle dogs {{in a study}} to determine adulticidal efficacy, egg laying inhibition and viability of Ctenocephalides felis felis eggs (development and emergence of fleas from the collected eggs). Prior to treatment sixteen dogs were checked {{for their ability to}} keep fleas 24 hours after infestation and were allocated to treatment groups: 8 dogs served as untreated controls, and 8 dogs were treated once with the tested formulation. The spot on was administered respecting the laboratory recommendations at a dosage of 65 – 126 mg/kg of permethrin; 8. 9 – 17. 4 mg/kg of dinotefuran and 0. 8 – 1. 5 mg/kg of pyriproxyfen. Each dog was infested with 100 adult cat fleas ready to lay eggs after 72 hours spent feeding on cats. Dogs were infested 24 hours after treatment and then weekly during 63 days. Eggs were collected and counted 24 hours after each infestation and <b>dogs</b> were <b>combed</b> 48 hours after each infestation. Fleas were counted and removed. Collected eggs were placed in incubator to study their development in larvae and into newly emerged adults. A single treatment provided 99. 7 % adulticidal efficacy on fleas within 48 hours after treatment and controlled re-infestations for up to 30 days (efficacy > 96. 20 %, p< 0. 05). The egg laying inhibition was over 92. 3 % for up to 29 days (p< 0. 05). The adult emergence inhibition remained 100 % during 8 weeks after treatment and was 99. 8 % nine weeks after treatment (p< 0. 001) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{clinical trial}} was performed to determine the duration of efficacy of a new oral insecticide formulation of spinosad for the control of experimentally induced Ctenocephalides canis infestations in dogs. Twelve Beagle dogs (two groups of six) {{were used in the}} study. Dogs in the treated group received spinosad tablets per os on D 0 at the commercial dosage. All dogs were infested with 100 fleas on Days – 7, – 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. The <b>dogs</b> were <b>combed</b> four hours after each infestation and fleas were counted and replaced on the coat. 24 hours after each infestation fleas were combed, counted and removed. The efficacy of the formulation was calculated four and 24 hours after the treatment and then four and 24 hours after each new infestation. The mean number of fleas on the control dogs was respectively between 65. 1 and 83. 3 at four hour counts and between 58. 3 and 75. 3 at 24 hour counts. The product was well tolerated. The treatment controlled the fleas already present on the skin with 81 % efficacy at four hours and 100 % efficacy at 24 hours. For the weekly infestations, the speed of action of the product was high: at four hours the efficacy was 100 % at D 7, 96 % at D 14, 74 % at D 21, 42 % at D 28, 12. 90 % at D 35 and 12. 8 % at D 42. The efficacy evaluated 24 hours after each infestation was approximately 100 % during three weeks then 90 % at D 39, 81. 4 % at D 36 and 80. 4 % at D 43. A single dose of the new spinosad tablet formulation should control flea populations in dogs for four weeks as indicated in the claim (evaluation performed at 48 h for the registration). Spinosad tablet is the first product administered per os which acts so long and so quickly against adult fleas...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} {{reported}} here, the pioneer fipronil/(S) -methoprene topical product (FRONTLINE® PLUS, Merial Limited, Duluth, GA) was compared to the oral spinosad product (COMFORTIS® Elanco, Greenfield, IN) for efficacy against adult fleas and preventing egg production. The product presentations, doses and labelling were the one applicable in the USA. Using a standard protocol, 200 cat fleas of mixed sex were applied to dogs on Days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. <b>Dogs</b> were <b>combed</b> to remove fleas 24 hours post-infestation, the fleas were counted, collected, and then reapplied to each dog following completion of their respective count. At 48 hours post-infestation, comb counts were performed and fleas were removed. No fleas were collected from any dog in the fipronil/(S) -methoprene group at any 24 or 48 hours post-infestation assessment throughout the six weeks study, yielding a preventive efficacy of 100 %. For the spinosad treatment, efficacy was 100 % at 24 hours and 48 hours through Day 16, and thereafter declined. The results observed in the spinosad-treated dogs were highly variable between animals. At the 24 and 48 hours counts following the Day 21 infestation, only five of eight spinosad-treated dogs (62. 5 %) were flea-free. Following the Day 28 infestation, spinosad efficacy fell to 85 % and 89 %, for the 24 hours and 48 hours counts, and only two dogs (25 %) were flea free, compared to 100 % flea-free dogs in the fipronil/(S) -methoprene group. No fleas were collected from the fipronil/(S) - methoprene treated dogs throughout the entire study, therefore, no eggs were collected at any time from any dog in the group. However, in the spinosad group adult fleas were found on dogs starting on Day 21 and by Day 30, 42 eggs were collected from one dog that had 107 adult fleas counted at 48 hours. At Day 37 and Day 49, more than 100 eggs were collected from each dog in the spinosad-treated and control groups...|$|R

Efficacy of fluralaner flavored chews (Bravecto (R)) {{administered}} to dogs against the adult cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis felis and egg production. Parasites & Vectors, 8, 7. doi: 10. 1186 /s 13071 - 015 - 0965 - 4 Background: Fluralaner {{is a potent}} insecticide and acaricide with rapid and persistent efficacy. This study measured the efficacy of fluralaner flavored chews (Bravecto (R), Merck Animal Health) {{administered to}} dogs against adult Ctenocephalides felis felis and egg production. Methods: Twelve purpose-bred dogs were randomly allocated to two groups of six dogs each. Dogs in treatment group 1 were administered a single fluralaner flavored chew to achieve a minimum dose of at least 25 mg/kg while treatment group 2 served as untreated controls. On Days - 2, 28, 56, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, and 120 post-treatment, each dog was infested with approximately 200 unfed cat fleas, C. felis felis (KS 1 strain). Forty-eight hours after treatment and 48 h after each infestation, eggs were collected over a 3 -h period, counted and viability determined. <b>Dogs</b> were <b>combed</b> to remove any remaining fleas. Results: Treatment of dogs with oral fluralaner provided a 100 % reduction in flea counts 48 h after treatment and within 48 h of every post-treatment infestation through Day 122. Egg production from fluralaner treated dogs was reduced by 99. 9 % (two eggs from one dog) within 48 h after treatment {{and not a single}} egg (100 % efficacy) was thereafter collected from treated dogs. Adult flea counts and egg production from the fluralaner-treated dogs were significantly lower than for non-treated controls at all post-treatment evaluations (P < 0. 001). The two eggs collected from the single treated dog 48 h after treatment did not produce any adult fleas. As no additional eggs were collected from treated dogs, no viability assessment was performed. Conclusions: A single oral dose of fluralaner flavored chews provided 100 % efficacy against repeated flea infestations on dogs for 4 months. Fluralaner reduced egg production of activity reproducing female fleas by 99. 9 % and then killed every single female flea before any eggs could be produced following each subsequent re-infestation for the entire 122 -day evaluation period...|$|R
40|$|Flea infestations of pets {{continue}} to persist {{due to the}} lack of knowledge of flea biology and ecology. It is not unusual that pet owners believe regular hygiene, such as shampooing their dogs can replace regular insecticidal treatment. The objective of this study was to compare in a flea simulated environment, modelling exposure similar to that found in a home, that the use of regular physiological shampoo does not control fleas adequately when compared to a long acting topical formulation. Three groups of six dogs were formed: one untreated control group, one group treated monthly with the topical formulation of fipronil/(S) -methoprene, and a third group treated weekly with a hygiene shampoo. All dogs were infested with adult unfed Ctenocephalides felis fleas (200 ± 5) on Days - 28 and - 21. Each animal’s sleeping box was fitted with a plastic cup mounted to the inside roof of the box. The sleeping bench of each animal was covered with a carpet to accommodate flea development. The dogs were maintained in their kennels throughout the study. In order to maintain the environmental flea challenge, C. felis pupae (100 ± 5) were placed in the plastic cup in each animal’s sleeping box on Days - 14, - 7, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. The <b>dogs</b> were <b>combed</b> and fleas counted weekly on Days - 1, 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, and 51. The fleas were placed immediately back on the dogs. On Day 60, fleas were counted and removed. Flea infestations in the untreated control group at each count averaged between 46. 2 and 74. 2 fleas throughout the study. The average number of fleas infesting dogs was significantly different (p < 0. 05) between the untreated and the two treatment groups and between the two treatment groups at all counts throughout the two months study (Days 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 51 and 60). The efficacy was never below 99. 1 % in the fipronil/(S) -methoprene group, and efficacy in the shampoo group was never above 79. 2 %. Weekly shampooing in treatment group 3 was intentionally delayed after Day 42, to evaluate wether missing a weekly bath would affect the flea population. The Day 48 data indicate that forgetting or delaying a single weekly shampooing resulted in a clear increase in flea numbers and a significant decrease in efficacy from 68. 2 % to 34. 8 %. The fipronil(S) /methoprene treatment allowed a continuous control as demonstrated by the high efficacy against fleas, and also the number of flea-free dogs on seven of the nine weekly assessments, in spite of what was essentially a continuous flea challenge model...|$|R
