40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> {{is derived from}} the {{recognition}} that when resources are used for one project, opportunities to use these resources are sacrificed elsewhere. Typically when workers are hired by a project, they are giving up one set of market and non-market activities for an alternative set. The <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of labor (EOCL) is the value to the economy of the set of activities given up by the workers including the non-market costs (or benefits) associated with the change in employment. When determining the EOCL, {{it is important to remember}} that labor is not a homogeneous input. It is perhaps the most diverse factor of production in any economy. In this chapter we will examine how the EOCL is estimated in an economy that contains markets for many different types of labor occupations, with variations by region, by quality of employment opportunities (e. g., pleasant, unpleasant, permanent, temporary, etc.) that affect the EOCL used by a project. supply price of labor, labor externalities, temporary jobs, permanent jobs, migration, protected sector, open sector, quasi voluntary unemployment, unemployment insurance...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of labor has been {{estimated}} using the supply price approach under {{a wide variety of}} labor market conditions and types of job. This approach is shown to be equivalent to the marginal product of labor foregone approach, when the latter can be estimated accurately. The primary reliance of the supply price approach on the wage rates demanded under the labor conditions of the project greatly facilitates the estimation of this economic parameter for use in the economic valuation of projects. A methodology has been outlined in detail to account for several adjustments that may need to be made to this supply price to reflect special labor market characteristics and distortions. Most of these factors, such as income taxes and unemployment insurance compensation, are straightforward and easy to estimate. Other issues dealing with the quality of the jobs {{and the nature of the}} unemployment present require a more detailed examination of the labor market. Once these values have been determined, they are used to adjust the supply price to arrive at an estimate of the <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of labor for a particular skill on a particular project. labor, economic opportunity costs, supply- price approach...|$|E

40|$|Predicted {{climate change}} {{represents}} {{a major challenge}} to conservation over the 21 st Century and beyond. Currently, conservation is largely reliant upon static Protected Areas (PAs) to conserve uncommon species. However, evidence from past climate change events suggests that species distributions are dynamic and alter in relation to species’ bioclimate envelopes. Adapting PA networks to cope with projected changes in species distributions is a vital role of conservation biology. The sub-Saharan Africa Important Bird Area (IBA) network is designed to protect sites containing significant proportions of the populations of congregatory species, species which have restricted ranges or species of global conservation concern found on the continent. Here I explore {{ways in which the}} IBA network can be adapted to the impacts of climate change. Data of present species ranges and simulations of future range shifts for 1608 bird species for the time periods 2011 - 2040, 2041 - 2070, 2071 - 2100 were used. Initially, using a reserve selection algorithm (RSA), I created optimal PA networks of one- and quarter-degree cells for present and future time periods. I then created near-optimal reserve networks using IBAs alone, or permitting the selection of additional land-areas. Finally, I incorporated <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of land into the RSAs to assess how to adapt the network to climate change in the most economical way. The results showed that while some areas of Africa will undergo a large reduction in their importance to a complementarity-based PA network (such as West Africa), other areas will increase in importance (East and Southern Africa). Selected PAs often coincided with areas of currently recognised importance to conservation in both present and future projected scenarios. However, the selection of sites in these areas generally increased over the century. The number of additional sites needed to complement the IBA network and reach conservation targets also increased over time. The areas of increased importance were, on the whole, areas of increased <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> to conservation and therefore the acquisition costs of PAs selected in the future may be greater than those selected for the present. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{investment}} project usually lasts for many years, hence its appraisal requires {{a comparison of}} the costs and benefits over its entire life. For acceptance, the present value of the project's expected benefits should exceed the present value of its expected costs. Among a set of mutually exclusive projects, the one with the highest net present value (NPV) should be chosen. This criterion requires the use of a discount rate {{in order to be able}} to compare the benefits and costs that are distributed over the life of the investment. The discount rate recommended here for the calculation of the economic NPV of projects is the <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of capital for the country. If the economic NPV of a project is greater than zero, it is potentially worthwhile to implement the project. This implies that the project would generate more net economic benefits than the same resources would have generated if used elsewhere in the economy. On the other hand, if the NPV is less than zero, the project should be rejected on the grounds that the resources invested would have yielded a higher economic return if they had been left for the capital market to allocate them to other uses.

The limitations of such modeling also are discussed. Overall, the results suggest improvements to system operation and water allocations with a statewide expected value potentially as high as $ 1. 3 billion/year. Significant improvements in performance appear possible through water transfers and exchanges, conjunctive use, and various operational changes to increase flexibility. These changes also greatly reduce costs to agricultural and urban users of accommodating environmental requirements.

We found that, using optimization, 60 % of current caribou range can be protected (including 17 % in existing parks) while maintaining access to over 98 % of the value of resources on public lands. The trade-off between minimizing cost and minimizing demographic risk factors was minimal because the spatial distributions of cost and risk were similar.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of civil wars occur in economically less developed countries, as measured by GDP per capita. This paper assesses two suggested explanations for this: one emphasizing that poverty facilitates rebel recruitment due to lowered <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of rebelling, and the other highlighting that low accessibility and state capacity give political and military opportunity for organizing insurgency. I argue that the latter account is more powerful. Low accessibility is vital not only to rebel survival; it also enables rebels to obtain control over remote settlements, which facilitates the effective use of persuasion, coercion, organization, and economic rewards for mobilizing recruits and other resources. Although low economic opportunity costs can ease recruitment, {{it may not be}} essential if such tools are available. The argument is supported by a quantitative analysis covering 133 countries from 1989 - 2006. Countries experiencing civil war were distinguished more by low accessibility (measured by road density, telephone density and % urban of the population) than by depth of poverty (measured by the mean income of the poorest decile).

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to model the <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of alternative harvest restrictions aimed at conserving and sustaining ecological functions of vernal pools. The simulations performed incorporate a series of economic and ecological factors in order to determine: alternative configurations of canopy cover around the ponds which could produce similar adoption costs, in both a non-spatial and a spatially defined forest structure, optimal harvest schedules when a mix of tree species is being introduced on the studied landscape, as well as the sensitivity of this schedule to different stumpage prices. Methodologically, the results in this study are based on several dynamic optimization simulations performed in MATLAB. The analysis of the first group of simulations indicates the possibility of using tabu search for constrained rotational forestry and allows for comparing various levels of adoption costs as a step in suggesting improved Best Management Practices guidelines, which will minimize <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> while maintaining conservation of amphibian populations. The results of the second series of simulations suggest that, while harvesting decisions are somewhat robust to the introduction of species which reach maturity faster or are sold on the market at higher prices, there are indications that the optimal harvest schedules are more sensitive to growth patterns and price combinations under certain starting conditions. The main finding of {{the last part of the}} study consists in determining alternative harvesting configurations that generate similar adoption costs, while most likely having different impacts on amphibian populations. ^ The purpose of this research was to contribute to the advancement of literature in the ecosystem management of forests. A forest manager adopting BMPs will lose economic rents, and the existing literature is currently inadequate to support comprehensive evaluation of the decisions affecting the balance between sustaining the revenues from the production of market goods (timber) and sustaining ecosystem functions of vernal pools. The main policy implication of this study is that decision makers can use the results of such simulations in order to identify management guidelines options which are equivalent in terms of adoption costs, but would result in the most effective ecological responses. ...|$|R

The misperception that control of global warming is costly rests on the mistaken assumption that the investment allocation of the world economy without mitigation measures is efficient, but in the presence of an externality the world economy is not on its effi-ciency frontier. Once the externality is corrected, global warming presents no novel issues of the distribution of economic welfare between generations that are not already inherent in other investment choices. The costs of greenhouse gas mitigation can be shifted to future generations by reduc-ing conventional investment, rather than by reducing current standards of living. This suggests financing investments in greenhouse gas emission, including compensation of current generations for the necessary substitu-tion away from carbon intensive energy, through borrowing. The question of the appropriate intergenerational discount rate to apply to the bene-fits of greenhouse gas emission mitigation is irrelevant to global warming policy.

Heavy reliance on subsidies {{will not only}} exacerbate rapidly rising water demand, but will also place considerable burden on national budgets as substantial amount of water {{will have to be}} supplied by very costly desalination plants. Even though newer and more cost efficient desalination technologies have become available, water subsidies alone could use up to 10  % of oil revenues in some GCC countries by 2025 (Brook et al. 2006; UN Water 2012). While agriculture consumes around 60 – 90  % of water, it accounts for only 2 – 7  % of GDP in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. The agriculture sector is much more insignificant in Bahrain and Qatar with less than 1  % of GDP while still using around 50 – 60  % of water. Irrigation water is generally used in a wasteful manner, mainly through usage of traditional flooding and furrow irrigation techniques and for cultivating low value, high water-consumptive crops, without considering its <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> for potable and urban/industrial purposes. In this predominately desert region, losses can exceed 50  % of pumped groundwater (Håkan and Jägerskog 2006). Generous subsidies for agriculture have enabled farmers to produce crops which have low returns to water, such as forage crops, alfalfa, and low value-added vegetables grown in open fields (FAO 2007). These subsidies distort costs and revenues, and many of the agricultural activities in the Arabian Gulf countries are financially profitable only because of government subsidies and incentives, notwithstanding the high opportunity cost of water. In May 2012, at the global summit for water in the oil and gas sector, the undersecretary of the Ministry of Environment and Water announced that the UAE will be investing US $ 13.89 billion in new desalination plants and distribution networks from 2012 to 2016 (EIU 2010; Malek 2013).

According {{to a number of}} international studies, nature conservation in this region should be given a high priority. While Cape York is sparsely settled, it is not, however, a complete wilderness. Mining, cattle ranching, forestry, fishing, tourism and land use by Aborigines, frequently conflict with nature conservation in this region. But most of the land currently belongs to the Crown (State), even though Crown title is now subject to counter-claims by Aborigines following the Mabo case which is outlined, and most is held as leasehold by its users. In theory, leasehold from the Crown should give considerable scope for altering land use in the region, and instituting a system of conservation networks in the area based on core protected areas, such as those suggested by the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland. Nevertheless, strategic land use planning for Cape York Peninsula is difficult because knowledge about the stock of natural resources and current land uses in the region is very imperfect, and conflicts between interest groups at the regional, State and national level are unlikely to allow for easy harmonious resolutions of land use disputes. But an encouraging sign in favour of nature conservation as a land use in Cape York Peninsula is its low <b>economic</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost,</b> except where it comes into conflict with mining. Net returns from extensive pastoralism appear to be negative and economic returns from forestry are low. Tourism could be compatible with conservation.
