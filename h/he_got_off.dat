5|$|The Giants' record rebounded to 9–7 in 1984, and Taylor had {{his fourth}} All-Pro season. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> {{to a quick}} start, {{recording}} four sacks in a September game. In the playoffs the Giants defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16–13, but lost 21–10 to the eventual champion 49ers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|He {{was sent}} to Belgian Second Division side Royal Antwerp on a loan spell. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a bad start at the club and asked to return to Old Trafford after being abused by Antwerp {{supporters}} outside the Bosuilstadion, {{and had to be}} talked into staying by manager Regi Van Acker. Following this start the club then won 15 matches in a row and Higginbotham become popular with the fans. However, the season ended with defeat in a play-off game, and after the final whistle there was an alleged attack on referee Amand Ancion by teammate Ronnie Wallwork. Higginbotham was subsequently banned from football for a year for his involvement. In September 1999, a Belgian court reduced Higginbotham's ban to four months. Ancion maintained that Wallwork had grabbed him by the throat and that Higginbotham had headbutted him. Higginbotham always maintained his innocence, stating that he had tried to intervene peacefully after Wallwork had confronted Ancion in an aggressive manner. Alex Ferguson believed the player's innocence and handed both players four-year contracts as the club appealed their suspensions.|$|E

5|$|Before Mota {{ever played}} for the Red Sox, however, he was traded again to the Cleveland Indians. He {{struggled}} in his time with the Indians in 2006 and was designated for assignment by them in August. The New York Mets acquired him, and Mota improved mightily upon joining them. Following the season, he became a free agent, but he again signed with the Mets. After struggling in 2007, he {{was traded to the}} Milwaukee Brewers. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a poor start with Milwaukee in 2008 but improved in the second half. Following the season, Mota became a free agent and signed with the Dodgers again. He had his best year since 2004 and became a free agent again after the season. For {{the first time in his}} career, in 2010 he signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. After making the team out of spring training, Mota won his first career World Series despite struggling at times during the season. Following the season, he signed another minor league contract with the Giants and made the team out of spring training again. During the 2012 season, Mota became one of three players in league history to fail a drug test twice when it was shown he tested positive for Clenbuterol, a performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
25|$|Shutt's batting was {{extremely}} poor: in 24 innings at first- and second-team level he scored {{a total of}} just 35 runs. His highest score was a mere 8, and he failed to score on 17 occasions; indeed, {{in the middle of}} his career <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the mark only twice in a series of 14 consecutive innings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Tom,--who scorned {{to tell a}} lie in any matter {{concerning}} Ayala. [...] "It was me. I struck Colonel Stubbs, and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> me <b>off</b> at {{the police}} office." ...|$|R

25|$|Going into spring {{training}} in , newly acquired Kevin Kouzmanoff was slated {{for the job}} at third base. This left Branyan as a bench player going into the season. Branyan addressed the issues stating that {{he just wanted to}} play, no matter the circumstances. However, Branyan was seen as a good option if Kouzmanoff failed to produce at third base and at the plate. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a slow start out of {{spring training}}.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his disappointing season at Villarreal, he agreed with the club in June 2008, to search the market for a {{possible}} transfer. The Spanish sportspaper Marca immediately linked him together with Dutch side Feyenoord. This was at first denied by Tomasson as pure speculation. The speculations, however soon turned out to be true. In July 2008, he left Villarreal on a free transfer, and returned to Feyenoord on a new three-year contract. Here <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a great start with four goals in three games. But unfortunately this was followed by a long time injury from the end of September until the end of January. And because of that, he could only play a total of 14 games for Feyenoord in 2008–09.|$|E
25|$|After Charlton {{had turned}} down his request {{to become a}} Director, he became an advisor at Bristol City in January 1957, he took over as {{caretaker}} manager in January 1958 {{for a short while}} after Pat Beasley had left the club. When new Bristol boss Peter Doherty took over, Seed moved to manage Millwall in the early months of 1958. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a terrible start at The Old Den going nine matches without a win. The team eventually finished 23rd in Division Three South having to apply for re-election. The following season saw Millwall playing in the new Football League Fourth Division eventually finishing 9th. Seed stepped down as Millwall manager {{at the end of the}} 1958–59 campaign but stayed with the club as advisor and then as a club director. He continued as a director of Millwall until his death on 16 July 1966, aged 71.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his career}} in the Shu government, Meng Guang was notorious for making public outbursts on {{numerous}} occasions and for being very unbridled in his speech. As a result, his colleagues generally disliked or detested him. There were also instances where he carelessly divulged state secrets (probably due to a slip of the tongue) and discussed politics in inappropriate settings. However, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> lightly because he held much prestige among the literati for his status as a learned Confucian scholar. Meng Guang's behaviour had a huge negative impact on his career: he never made it to higher positions – his highest appointment was Minister of Finance (大司農) – and never received any honours/privileges (e.g., a marquis title). Two of his colleagues, Minister of Ceremonies Xin Cheng (鐔承) and Minister of the Household Pei Jun (裴儁), were younger and less experienced than him, yet they made it to positions higher than his.|$|E
25|$|Questions {{surfaced}} {{about the}} value of the instruments he had donated to the Smithsonian and the NJSO. Although the instruments were all old and valuable, several unnamed experts determined them not to be the instruments he represented them as, and not to be as valuable as he claimed. He was said to have invented histories for the instruments to explain away doubts or to increase their worth. On April 13, 2004, Axelrod was indicted in federal court in New Jersey, accused of funnelling millions of dollars into Swiss bank accounts over 20 years without paying taxes. The following April 21, he failed to appear for his arraignment, having fled to Cuba. He was arrested in Berlin on June 15, 2004 as <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> a plane from Switzerland, and then extradited to the United States. On March 21, 2005 he was sentenced in U.S. court to 18 months in prison for tax fraud.|$|E
25|$|After <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> {{the phone}} with Irsay, Hudnut called his {{neighbor}} and friend, John B. Smith, after the deal was finalized. Smith was {{the chief executive officer}} of Mayflower Transit, an Indiana-based moving company, and Hudnut asked him to assist the team in their move. Smith sent fifteen Mayflower trucks to Owings Mills and they arrived at the Colts' facility at around 10 p.m. The reasoning for the late hour of the move was out of fear that the Maryland House of Delegates would also approve the eminent domain bill the State Senate had, which would have resulted in the team being seized the next morning once Maryland Governor Harry Hughes signed the bill into law. Workers loaded all of the team's belongings and the trucks left for Indianapolis. Within eight hours of the Mayflower trucks' arrival in Owings Mills, the Colts were completely gone from Baltimore. Later that day, the House of Delegates indeed passed the bill by a count of 103–19 and Governor Hughes signed it, but by that time it was too late.|$|E

25|$|He didn't {{run again}} until September, when he contested the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster and started as the odds-on favourite. Fordham held {{him up at}} the rear of the field, but had to start riding him before they had turned into the {{finishing}} straight. As the six-runner field entered the final furlong Lord Clifden had almost caught leaders Armagnac and Early Purl. He then overtook them inside the last furlong and won by half a length from Armagnac, with Early Purl a further three lengths back in third place. Two days later Lord Clifden raced in a sweepstakes of £10 each with £100 added. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a bad start, losing several lengths to the rest of the field as Volturno went into the lead. Lord Clifden closed up on the field as they turned into the straight. At the one-furlong pole Fordham asked him for an effort and stride by stride he caught Bohemia, who was then leading, and just overtook him at the line to win by a head. Queen Bertha finished third, three lengths behind the front two.|$|E
25|$|Souray's offence {{began to}} improve {{following}} his trade to the Canadiens. At {{the time of}} his trade from the Devils, he had just eight points, all assists. He finished with three goals in 19 games as a Canadien to tie his career best for goals in a season, and establish a new career best for points (11) in 71 combined games. More importantly, he began using his dangerous shot more often once he arrived in Montreal. In 2000–01, injuries limited him to just 52 games, 19 less than the previous year, but Souray still managed to match his previous season's career bests in goals (3), assists (8) and points. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a good start in 2001–02, threatening to surpass his previous offensive highs, as he tallied three goals and five assists in just 34 games while fighting through an injury-plagued campaign. 2001–02 also saw him record his first career power play goal, as the Canadiens began to realize the value of having a player on the point who could consistently shoot the puck as hard as Souray. However, he suffered a wrist injury that plagued him throughout the year, and though he would play through it much of the season, Souray would eventually shut it {{down at the end of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|Powell next competed at the DKF Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway {{where he}} powered to a splendid victory with a wind-aided 9.72s. A week later, he competed at the Golden Gala in Rome, Italy, where he overcame {{a very poor}} {{reaction}} time at the start to take another victory in a World Leading time of 9.82s.It was reported that Powell ended his six-year contract with leading sports brand, Nike, due to sponsorship problems and rumours spread {{that he has a}} new contract with fast upcoming Chinese sports brand, Li-Ning. Asafa next competed in the 200m of the Jamaican Senior Trials where he won the final in 19.97s, his second fastest ever. There, for the first time, he promoted his new Li Ning outfit. Powell next competed in Gateshead where <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a terrific start, but lost to fast finishing Tyson Gay, who took the victory in 9.94s to Powell's 9.96s in a strong 1.7m/s headwind. Powell was not very disappointed as he mentioned that he got too relaxed, thus allowing Gay to outdo him in the final strides. The next race in Paris against Usain Bolt was a disappointing one. Although he had a good start, Bolt caught him at halfway point, and Asafa began to lose his fluent running form. He finished 2nd to Bolt in 9.91s, 0.07s slower than his rival, also into a slight headwind. Asafa said that he had a very bad race, which he hoped to improve in his upcoming races. Unfortunately for Powell, there was not a 'next race' for him. He picked up strains from his Paris meeting which aggravated to hamstring and back problems. Powell missed his next two outings where he was scheduled to clash against Bolt and Gay. Powell ended his splendid 2010 season on a disappointing note although he expressed satisfaction on the races that he competed for the year.|$|E
