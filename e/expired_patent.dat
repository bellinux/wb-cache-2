His first and most successful patents concerning flour-milling proved the most problematic to defend, and Evans' battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal patent law. His original patent for his automated flour-mill expired in January 1805, but Evans believed that the fourteen year patent term was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it. In January 1808 An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans was passed and signed by President Jefferson, a long-time admirer of Evans's work. The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his <b>expired</b> <b>patent</b> and giving it another fourteen year term— Evans was delighted, but the move was to highly problematic, particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans's designs in the intervening three year period between the patent terms, as many millers had waited for Evans's patent to expire before upgrading their mills.|$|E

[...] By the 1940s, over 500 related sulfa drugs were produced. Medications in high demand during World War II (1939–45), these first miracle drugs, chemotherapy of wide effectiveness, propelled the American pharmaceutics industry. [...] In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (Gramicidin, developed by René Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.) [...] After World War II, Cornelius P.

Although {{when the market}} for sail cloth started to dip, Michael Nairn for instance began to focus more towards floorcloth, which he started to produce in his new purpose built Scottish floorboard factory at Pathhead Sands, famously nicknamed [...] "Nairn’s folly" [...] for what would become universally known as linoleum.

Although the Michael Nairn & Co Ltd have since become famous, for their Trade Mark and being the world producers of the cloth. The cloth made from cork, wood flour and linseed oil, saw production conicide with the jute mills of Dundee - with some already present in the town, particularly the West Bridges Mill in Linktown.

The Nairns, as a family, became philanthropists bequeathing land for public and commercial use, {{over the course of several}} decades, as [...] "good deeds" [...] to the citizens of Kirkcaldy, with examples such as two public parks (Beveridge and Ravenscraig) and a museum, art gallery and library complex. Other industries such as coal, pottery, flour, malt, printing, light electrical engineering and furniture manufacturing flourished. Carpets, whose production coincided with linoleum, were also made in the town for a brief time by the firm Victoria Carpets until they moved their production to Kidderminster in 1901. The burghs of Pathhead, Linktown, Gallatown and Sinclairtown were also officially merged into the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1876.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea was}} not {{implemented}} in the USA until 1962, when it was used by U.S. military ships during a blockade of Cuba after the patent had expired. Perhaps owing to this lag in development, the patent was little known until 1997, when the Electronic Frontier Foundation gave Lamarr a belated award for her contributions. In 1998, an Ottawa wireless technology developer, Wi-LAN Inc., acquired a 49% claim to the long <b>expired</b> <b>patent</b> from Lamarr for an undisclosed amount of stock (Eliza Schmidkunz, Inside GNSS). Lamarr's and Antheil's frequency-hopping scheme shares some concepts with modern spread-spectrum communication technology, such as Bluetooth, COFDM used in Wi-Fi network connections, and CDMA used in some cordless and wireless telephones. Blackwell, Martin, and Vernam's 1920 patent Secrecy Communication System (1598673) seems to lay the communications groundwork for Kiesler and Antheil's patent, which employed the techniques in the autonomous control of torpedoes.|$|E

40|$|Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co. {{may be the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s most {{versatile}} and influential trademark decision. Justice Brandeis 2 ̆ 7 opinion contained language that {{is now at the}} core of the statutory test for whether a term should be unprotected because consumers understand the term as the generic name for the product on which it is used. That same language guides courts seeking to determine whether a mark has acquired the degree of secondary meaning necessary to support trademark protection. Plaintiffs seeking to establish trademark rights in a product shape must demonstrate that the shape in question is not 2 ̆ 2 functional 2 ̆ 2 according to a standard that has its roots in Kellogg. And defendants seeking to parry claims that the design of their product is confusingly similar to the design of a once-patented product habitually invoke Kellogg to support a competitor 2 ̆ 7 s right to copy the subject matter of an <b>expired</b> <b>patent.</b> The scope of Kellogg 2 ̆ 7 s influence might, at first blush, seem surprising. The Court was confronted by a relatively narrow issue of trademark and unfair competition law, and to a large extent was revisiting an issue it had decided forty years earlier. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion was also quite short. To understand its significance, one must be aware of the full range of philosophical reasons that motivated Justice Brandeis, including opposition for broad intellectual property rights, a concern for competition, and support for a misrepresentation-based model of unfair competition law. And one must also delve into the intense commercial rivalry in the cereal industry - a rivalry conducted by an odd mix of evangelists armed with even odder theories about nutrition and health. Ultimately, because a variety of rationales were offered by the Court for a conclusion upon which most would agree, the precise scope of the opinion has never been fully clear. These (perhaps purposeful) ambiguities might have prevented the opinion contributing to the clear development of areas of law that were directly addressed by the Kellogg Court. This partially explains the irony that the current Supreme Court has cited Kellogg in a number of trademark cases for a series of different propositions, but did not cite the case in the most recent effort to tackle the very question at issue in Kellogg (the scope of trademark protection for a product covered by an <b>expired</b> <b>patent).</b> By the same token, however, Justice Brandeis 2 ̆ 7 quiet efforts to supply a more fundamental (and long-term) statement about the philosophy of trademark and unfair competition law may have allowed the opinion to achieve significance, both judicially and legislatively, well beyond the narrow context of the type of case the Court was deciding. And those efforts to articulate a philosophy for trademark and unfair competition law, which do not spring as obviously from the text of the Kellogg opinion, but instead are more readily apparent from historical context, may also be important in the years ahead as scholars and policymakers consider whether trademark law has inappropriately become a law against misappropriation...|$|E
40|$|Background: During {{the last}} three decades {{tremendous}} {{progress has been made in}} the discovery and development of a lot of new molecules in many pharmaceutical areas. These families of real innovative treatment comprise "originator" molecules (first molecule released, which can be under patent or with <b>expired</b> <b>patent),</b> as well a "generic" version of those originator molecules, whose patent has expired. Usually the patent expires 15 – 20 years after the creation of the originator molecule. Main objective: This research focuses on the effects of the arrival of generic and or therapeutic competitors on the market, in terms of impact on the market share and prices. Methodology: Between 2005 and 2007 we follow three classes of medicinal products in the cardiovascular area: ACE inhibitors, sartans and statins. They have been studied on the Bulgarian market because there is no regulation in the country stimulating the generic market. The official database of the Bulgarian Health Insurance Fund was used to test our two hypotheses concerning the impact of the generics on market share and prices. To test our hypotheses, a t-test analysis, Kolmogorov Smirnov, one and two way ANOVA analyses were performed. Results: Our results confirm that the generic competition, in general, changes the market. These changes decrease the price of the medicines. The generic competition is not regulated in the country and this fact could negatively influence our study because it does not correspond to world trends. Furthermore, our results confirm that the creation of a sustainable generic pharmaceutical market requires active regulatory and marketing measures at all levels including incentives for manufactures, physicians and dispensers...|$|E
