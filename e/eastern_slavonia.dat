5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear {{because of a}} lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia.</b> He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{suffered}} heavy {{military and}} civilian casualties. The Croatian side initially reported 1,798 killed in the siege, both soldiers and civilians. Croatian general Anton Tus later stated that about 1,100 Croatian soldiers were killed, and 2,600 soldiers and civilians were listed as missing. Another 1,000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek, according to Tus. He noted that the fighting was so intense that losses in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> between September and November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties from that year. According to figures published in 2006 by the Croatian Ministry of Defence, 879 Croatian soldiers were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates Croatian casualties at around 4,000 to 5,000 dead across <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia.</b> The 204th Vukovar Brigade lost over 60 percent of its strength in the battle. Croatian officials have given figures of 2,000 killed, 800 missing, 3,000 taken prisoner and 42,852 made refugees in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> as a whole.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> was gravely {{impacted}} {{throughout this}} period, {{starting with the}} Dalj massacre of August 1991; fronts developed around Osijek and Vinkovci in parallel to the encirclement of Vukovar.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} {{increased to}} about 20,000 as Serb refugees {{from other parts}} of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards. Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves. The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia's</b> revived oil industry. Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid.|$|R

5|$|The ICTY also indicted Goran Hadžić, the Croatian Serb {{political}} {{leader in the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> region {{and head of the}} SAO <b>Eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> Baranja and Western Syrmia government declared by the Croatian Serbs in the region at the time before it merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The charges include war crimes of persecutions, extermination, murder, imprisonment, torture, inhumane acts and cruel treatment, deportation, forcible transfer of population, wanton destruction and plunder of property. Hadžić died in July 2016, before his trial could be completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} situation in the area did not change until 1995. That year, Croatia militarily defeated the Croatian Serbs in offensives codenamed Flash and Storm, in May and August respectively. That left <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> as the last remaining Croatian Serb-held area. Gradual restoration of the area to Croatian rule was agreed upon in November through the Erdut Agreement, and the United Nations Transitional Administration for <b>Eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) peacekeeping mission was deployed to implement the agreement.|$|E
5|$|Also in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> the Lovas {{massacre}} {{occurred in}} October and the Erdut massacre in November 1991, {{before and after}} the fall of Vukovar. At the same time, the Škabrnja massacre occurred in the northern Dalmatian hinterland; it was largely overshadowed by the events at Vukovar.|$|E

50|$|The area {{surrounding}} the Black Sea is {{commonly referred to}} as the Black Sea Region. Its northern part lies within the Chernozem belt (black soil belt) which goes from <b>eastern</b> Croatia (<b>Slavonia),</b> along the Danube (northern Serbia, northern Bulgaria (Danubian Plain) and southern Romania (Wallachian Plain)) to northeast Ukraine and further across the Central Black Earth Region and southern Russia into Siberia.|$|R
5000|$|Swabians settled also in <b>eastern</b> Croatia (<b>Slavonia</b> and Syrmia), and {{southern}} and western Hungary, including {{part of what}} is now Serbia and Romania (the Danube Swabians, Satu Mare Swabians, Banat Swabians and Swabian Turkey) in the 18th century, where they were invited as pioneers to repopulate some areas. They also settled in Russia, Bessarabia, and Kazakhstan. They were well-respected as farmers.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions in the republic worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) weapons to miminize the possibility of resistance {{following the}} elections. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. They established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman's policy of pursuing independence for Croatia. Milan Babić, a dentist from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. Knin's police chief, Milan Martić, established paramilitary militias. The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina, a self-declared state incorporating the Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia. In March 1991, the SAO Krajina authorities backed by the Serbian government started to consolidate control over Serb-populated areas of Croatia. The move resulted in a bloodless skirmish in Pakrac and the first fatalities in the Plitvice Lakes incident. By early May, the conflict also escalated in the region of <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> culminating in the Battle of Borovo Selo, just to the south of the village of Dalj. On 25–26 June, Croatian Serbs in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> established the SAO <b>Eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> Baranja and Western Syrmia (SAO SBWS), declaring it an autonomous political entity.|$|E
5|$|In August 1995, {{following}} Operation Storm, Croatia regained {{control of}} territories previously held by Croatian Serb forces, {{with the exception}} of eastern Slavonia—the region around Erdut. <b>Eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> was gradually transferred to Croatian control based on the Erdut Agreement signed on 12 November 1995, and the transfer, facilitated by United Nations peacekeepers, was completed on 15 January 1998.|$|E
5|$|One final attempt, {{organised}} by Babić, {{was made}} to revive the Z-4 Plan on 16 August. This initiative called for negotiating each point of the plan and extending the autonomous areas to <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia.</b> However, Ahrens and Stoltenberg considered any talks between Croatia and the exiled, discredited leaders of the RSK impossible. When they consulted Šarinić about the initiative, he dismissed any possibility of negotiation.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Serbs and Croats spread to <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were fired at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles were fired at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians {{and led to a}} surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|Armed clashes in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> {{gradually}} intensified as the JNA committed {{significant new}} units to the Battle of Vukovar, including the 453rd Mechanised Brigade, the 1st Proletarian Guards Mechanised Division, and the 252nd Armoured Brigade. During the initial {{stage of the}} battle, the JNA bypassed a number of Croat villages southeast {{of the city of}} Vukovar—including Lovas. In late September 1991, the easternmost Croatian positions in the area ran along a line connecting the villages of Nijemci–Ilača–Lovas and those were defended by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade and the 109th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Detainees {{who were}} not {{suspected}} of involvement with the Croatian armed forces were evacuated from Vukovar to other locations in Serbia and Croatia. The non-Serb population of Vukovar and the surrounding region was systematically ethnically cleansed and at least 20,000 of Vukovar's inhabitants were forced to leave the town, adding to {{the tens of thousands}} already expelled from across <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia.</b> 2,600 people disappeared {{after the fall of the}} town, of whom around 550 are still missing. There were also incidents of war rape, for which two soldiers were later convicted.|$|E

5|$|Serbian {{authorities}} charged four persons {{associated with}} former Croatian Serb {{authorities in the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> with war crimes committed in Lovas, consisting of four JNA officers and six {{former members of the}} Dušan Silni paramilitaries. The trial started in 2008. In 2012, the group was convicted of killing of 70 Croat civilians and sentenced to a total of 128 years in prison. Devetak received a prison term of 20 years, while the others received prison sentences ranging from four to fourteen years. However, in 2014, the court of appeals ordered a new trial.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{responded by}} {{launching}} a major offensive in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> {{from where it}} intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb. The army did not bypass Vukovar, because they wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines.

50|$|In 1736, Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich (1665-1743), the Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire and Prince-Archbishop of Mainz, {{purchased}} a Vukovar manor in Syrmia, in the <b>eastern</b> Kingdom of <b>Slavonia,</b> then {{part of the}} Habsburg Monarchy ruled by Emperor Charles VI. The castle was originally built between 1749 and 1751 by the Archchancellor's descendants of the German Catholic noble House of Eltz and was gradually extended over time. The estates near the Military Frontier were, however, exposed to raids by Ottoman troops and local Hajduk paramilitary forces.|$|R
50|$|King Stephen II did not father any sons, and his sister's son Saul was proclaimed heir to {{his throne}} {{instead of the}} blind Duke Béla. When King Stephen II died on March 1, 1131, his blind cousin managed {{nevertheless}} to acquire the throne. King Béla II (1131-1141) strengthened his rule by defeating King Coloman's alleged son, Boris, who endeavoured to deprive him of the throne with foreign military assistance. King Béla II occupied some territories in Bosnia, and he conceded the new territory in appanage to his younger son, Ladislaus. Henceforward, members of the Árpád dynasty governed southern or <b>eastern</b> provinces (i.e., <b>Slavonia,</b> and Transylvania) of the kingdom instead of the Tercia pars regni.|$|R
5|$|The ZNG {{successfully}} defended Hrvatska Kostajnica until mid-September. In August, Croatian Serbs acting {{under the}} operational {{control of the}} JNA clashed with the ZNG around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia.</b> Fighting in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia</b> led to ZNG blockades of JNA barracks in those cities and limited fighting against the garrisons there. In western Slavonia, the Croatian Serb militia attempted to advance into Daruvar but were held back by the ZNG {{in the area around}} Okučani and south of Pakrac before the JNA formed a buffer zone there. Following this fighting, Croatia was denied use of major transport routes between Zagreb and Slavonia. In northern Dalmatia, the JNA initiated several clashes with the ZNG and coordinated its advances with Croatian Serb forces. These attacks culminated in the capture of Kijevo on 26 August and the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September. The capture of the bridge severed the last remaining road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. In the summer of 1991, the performance of the ZNG was poor because it lacked manpower and weapons, and exerted inadequate command and control. The professional ZNG troops were better trained than their opponents, {{with the exception of the}} Knin special police set up by the Serbian State Security Service.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} the Velepromet camp formed part of three {{different}} ICTY indictments, although none resulted in a conviction. In the trial of Slobodan Milošević, the charges brought against Milošević by the ICTY prosecutors included unlawful confinement, imprisonment, torture and inhumane acts against Croat and other non-Serb civilians, including one hundred detainees held in the Velepromet camp. Milošević died before his trial was completed. Vojislav Šešelj, {{the leader of the}} Serb Radical Party, associated with the White Eagles paramilitaries, was charged with the unlawful confinement and killing of at least six people at the Velepromet camp who were buried in a mass grave near the site of the Ovčara massacre, near the village of Grabovo south of Vukovar, as well as an unspecified {{number of people in the}} brick yard adjacent to the Velepromet camp. He was acquitted of all charges in 2016. Goran Hadžić, a Croatian Serb policial leader in <b>eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> who held the office of President of SAO <b>Eastern</b> <b>Slavonia,</b> Baranja and Western Syrmia, was charged with the unlawful confinement and murder of the 17 people in Velepromet who were later buried within the compound. His trial was abandoned in 2014 as a result of Hadžić being diagnosed with terminal cancer.|$|E
5|$|Violence erupted {{again in}} early May 1995. The RSK lost {{support from the}} Serbian {{government}} in Belgrade, {{partly as a result}} of international pressure. At the same time, the Croatian Operation Flash reclaimed all of the previously occupied territory in Western Slavonia. In retaliation, Serb forces attacked Zagreb with rockets, killing 7 and wounding over 200 civilians. The Yugoslav army responded to the offensive with a show of force, moving tanks towards the Croatian border, in an apparent effort to stave off a possible attack on the occupied area in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Slavonia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tensions between Croats and Serbs {{increased}} steadily through 1990 and 1991 {{following the}} electoral victory of Croatia's nationalist Croatian Democratic Union party, led by Franjo Tuđman. Many Serbs were deeply unhappy {{about the prospect}} of living as a minority in an independent Croatia. In the summer of 1990, they took up arms in the largely Serb-populated regions of inland Dalmatia, calling the breakaway region [...] "SAO Krajina", sealing roads and effectively blocking Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia. The insurrection spread to the <b>eastern</b> region of <b>Slavonia</b> in early 1991, when paramilitary groups from Serbia itself took up positions in the region and started to expel non-Serbs from the area, reportedly associated with the Serbian Radical Party.|$|R
40|$|The intima-media {{thickness}} (IMT) of carotid arteries is {{a marker}} of subclinical atherosclerosis associated with risk factors for atherosclerosis and a predictor of vascular disease. The {{aim of the research}} was to determine the correlation of IMT and age, and above normal IMT values in healthy adults in <b>Slavonia</b> (<b>eastern</b> Croatia). The study included 275 subjects of both sexes, aged between 20 and 79, who had no clinical manifestations of vascular disease or presence of major risk factors for atherosclerosis (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking). Ultrasonic measurement of IMT in the B-mode was performed on far walls of the carotid arteries on both sides at three locations (common and internal carotid artery, carotid bifurcation). At all three sites of measurement a high correlation between the IMT values and age was found in both sexes, including the maximum for IMT of carotid bifurcation (men r= 0. 92, women 0. 91). Upper normal values (75 th percentile) IMT of common carotid arteries were determined for the ten-year age groups. It is the same {{for both men and women}} in age groups both 20 - 29 and 30 - 39 (0. 41, 0. 46 mm). On the other hand, in age groups 40 - 49, 50 - 59, 60 - 69 and 70 - 79 upper normal values for men are 0. 57, 0. 62, 0. 77 and 0. 96 mm, and for women 0. 50, 0. 57, 0. 71 and 0. 81 mm. Our study in healthy adults in <b>Slavonia</b> (<b>eastern</b> Croatia) established a clear connection between carotid IMT and age, which implies a need for taking the age as an essential factor into account when conducting researches that involve the IMT...|$|R
2500|$|Operation Flash was a {{strategic}} victory for Croatia {{resulting in the}} capture of a [...] salient held by RSK forces centred {{in and around the}} town of Okučani. The town, which sat astride the ZagrebBelgrade motorway and railroad, had presented Croatia with significant transport problems between the nation's capital Zagreb and the <b>eastern</b> region of <b>Slavonia</b> as well as between non-contiguous territories held by the RSK. The area was a part of United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO) Sector West under the United Nations Security Council peacekeeping mandate in Croatia. The attacking force consisted of 7,200 HV troops, supported by the Croatian special police, arrayed against approximately 3,500 RSK soldiers. In response to the operation, the RSK military bombarded Zagreb and other civilian centres, causing seven fatalities and injuries to 205.|$|R
