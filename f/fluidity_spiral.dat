40|$|Following a scene-setting {{introduction}} are detailed {{reviews of}} the relevant scientific principles, thermal analysis as a research tool {{and the development of}} the zinc-aluminium family of alloys. A recently introduced simultaneous thermal analyser, the STA 1500, its use for differential thermal analysis (DTA) being central to the investigation, is described, together with the sources of support information, chemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, ingot cooling curves and <b>fluidity</b> <b>spiral</b> castings. The compositions of alloys tested were from the binary zinc-aluminium system, the ternary zinc-aluminium-silicon system at 30 %, 50 % and 70 % aluminium levels, binary and ternary alloys with additions of copper and magnesium to simulate commercial alloys and five widely used commercial alloys. Each alloy was shotted to provide the smaller, 100 mg, representative sample required for DTA. The STA 1500 was characterised and calibrated with commercially pure zinc, and an experimental procedure established for the determination of DTA heating curves at 10 °C per minute and cooling curves at 2 °C per minute. Phase change temperatures were taken from DTA traces, most importantly, liquidus from a cooling curve and solidus from both heating and cooling curves. The accepted zinc-aluminium binary phase diagram was endorsed with the added detail that the eutectic is at 5. 2 % aluminium rather than 5. 0 %. The ternary eutectic trough was found to run through the points, 70 % Al, 7. 1 % Si, 545 °C; 50 % Al, 3. 9 % Si, 520 °C; 30 % Al, 1. 4 % Si, 482 °C. The dendrite arm spacing in samples after DTA increased with increasing aluminium content from 130 m at 30 % to 220 m at 70 %. The smallest dendrite arm spacing of 60 m was in the 30 % aluminium 2 % silicon alloy. A 1 kg ingot of the 10 % aluminium binary alloy, insulated with Kaowool, solidified at the same 2 °C per minute rate as the DTA samples. A similar sized sand casting was solidified at 3 °C per minute and a chill casting at 27 °C per minute. During metallographic examination the following features were observed: heavily cored phase which decomposed into ' and '' on cooling; needles of the intermetallic phase FeAl 4; copper containing ternary eutectic and copper rich T phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} melt {{superheat}} and oxide inclusions on the fluidity {{of a commercial}} A 356 alloy has been investigated. Fluidity measurements have been performed by means of Archimedean spiral in sand moulds. The specific testing method and the experimental apparatus show a good reproducibility. Metallographic and image analysis techniques {{have been used to}} quantitatively examine the microstructural changes and the amount of defects occurring {{at the tip of the}} spirals. The results reveal that oxide films increase the variability in the fluidity results obtained at the same apparent experimental conditions. A long permanence in the holding furnace and the introduction of some turbulence during sampling increase the oxide formation and entrapment in the molten bath, thus decreasing the repeatability of the fluidity results. The fluidity increases linearly with superheat and it extrapolates to zero at the temperature corresponding to a fraction solid of about 23 %. The initial Ti content in the alloy produces an independent crystallization during freezing of the <b>fluidity</b> <b>spirals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cast {{aluminium}} alloy-mica particle composites {{were made}} by dispersing mica particles in a vortex produced by stirring the liquid Al- 4 wt% Cu- 1. 5 wt% Mg alloy and then casting the melt containing the suspended particles into permanent moulds. <b>Spiral</b> <b>fluidity</b> and casting fluidity of the alloy containing mica particles in suspension were determined. Both the <b>spiral</b> <b>fluidity</b> and the casting fluidity of the base alloy were found to decrease {{with an increase in}} volume or weight percent of mica particles (of a given size), and with a decrease in particle size (for a given amount of particles). The fluidities of Al- 4 wt% Cu- 1. 5 wt% Mg alloys containing suspended mica particles were found to correlate very well with the surface area of suspended mica particles. The regression equation for <b>spiral</b> <b>fluidity</b> Y (cm) as a function of surface area of mica particles per gram of spiral X (cm 2 g– 1) at 700 ° C was found to be Y= 42. 62 – 0. 42 X with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9634. The regression equations for casting fluidity Yprime (cm) as a functiono of surface area of mica particles per gram of fluidity test piece Xprime (cm 2 g– 1) at 710 and 670 ° C were found to be Yprime= 19. 71 – 0. 17 Xprime and Yprime= 13. 52 – 0. 105 Xprime with correlation coefficients of 0. 9194 and 0. 9612 respectively. The percentage decrease in casting fluidity of composite melts containing up to 2. 5 wt% mica with a drop in temperature is quite similar to the corresponding decrease in the casting fluidity of base alloy melts (without mica). The change in fluidity due to mica dispersions has been discussed in terms of changes in viscosity of the composite melts. However, the fluidities of these composite alloys containing up to 2. 5 wt% mica are adequate for making a variety of simple castings including bearings for which these alloys have been developed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recycling of {{aluminum}} alloys often decrease fluidity, consequently influence the castability of the alloy. In this study, the fluidity of Al-Zn alloys, {{such as the}} standard A 713 alloy with and without scrap addition has been investigated. The scrap added was comprised of contaminated alloy turning chips. Fluidity measurements were performed with double <b>spiral</b> <b>fluidity</b> test consisting of gravity casting of double spirals in green sand moulds with good reproducibility. The influence of recycled alloy on fluidity has been {{compared with that of}} the virgin alloy and the results showed that the fluidity decreased with the increase in recycled alloy at minimum pouring temperatures. Interestingly, an appreciable improvement in the fluidity was observed at maximum pouring temperature, especially for coated spirals...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Cr {{addition}} on the fluidity of aluminum (LM 6) alloy {{has been investigated}} by <b>spiral</b> <b>fluidity</b> test. Presence of 0. 1 wt. % Cr decreased fluidity of melt due to formation of sludge. In fact Cr changes the morphology of the intermetallic phase from β-intermetallics less harmful polyhedral morphology (α-intermetallics). The β-phases have largest surface to volume ratio, hence they have the largest interfacial region with the melt and are the most detrimental intermetallic to drop off the fluidity. In Cr-containing alloys the effect of α-phase is less detrimental than β-phase to the fluidity. On the other hand sludge formation and consuming Si and shifts the local chemical composition of the melt to the aluminum side of the phase diagram which has lower fluidity than eutectic and hypereutectic compositions...|$|R
40|$|Water model {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} develop a two-stage stirring method for obtaining higher yields and a more uniform distribution of graphite particles in copper alloys. This was followed by several melts for synthesis of copper-graphite alloys in which Ti {{was used as a}} wetting agent to improve the wettability of graphite in the copper melt. In the first stage, a vortex method was employed to facilitate the addition of graphite particles into the copper melt. In the second stage, a specially designed stirrer was used for uniform particle distribution while avoiding the formation of vortex in the melt. The two-stage stirring was found to considerably improve the recovery of graphite, over those obtained with the prior practice of single-stage stirring and resulting in a more uniform particle distribution. In addition, graphite recoveries increased with increasing Ti content in the range investigated. Floatation, fluidity, and directional solidification {{experiments were}} also conducted on copper-graphite alloys synthesized in this study. Fluidity tests showed that the <b>spiral</b> <b>fluidity</b> length of the yellow brass alloy increased with temperature and decreased with graphite. The fluidity of copper-graphite alloys investigated to-date remained adequate to make a variety of castings. The observations of casting microstructure under directional solidification and floatation showed that in certain castings the graphite particles remained agglomerated, and they readily floated to {{the upper part of the}} castings where they reduced the size of gains. However, even in the agglomerated form, the graphite particles improved the machinability of copper alloys in a manner similar to lead. The results of the first year work provide an improved method of synthesis of lead free copper graphite alloys with improved machinability and adequate fluidity...|$|R
