5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It {{was not so}} long ago that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E

25|$|Granger Morgan et al. (2009) {{suggested}} {{two related}} decision-making management strategies {{that might be}} particularly appealing when faced with high uncertainty. The first were resilient strategies. This seeks to identify a range of possible future circumstances, and then choose approaches that work reasonably well across all the range. The second were adaptive strategies. The idea here <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> strategies that can be improved as more is learned as the future progresses. Granger Morgan et al. (2009) contrasted these two approaches with the cost–benefit approach, which seeks to find an optimal strategy.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{a common}} problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a {{portfolio}} when there are two conflicting objectives — the desire to have the expected value of portfolio returns {{be as high as}} possible, and the desire to have risk, often measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns, be as low as possible. This problem is often represented by a graph in which the efficient frontier shows the best combinations of risk and expected return that are available, and in which indifference curves show the investor's preferences for various risk-expected return combinations. The problem of optimizing a function of the expected value (first moment) and the standard deviation (square root of the second central moment) of portfolio return is called a two-moment decision model.|$|E

25|$|Princes {{and ambitious}} suitors have {{gathered}} in Babylon from {{far and wide}} for on this day the Princess Tamiri <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a husband. Among those present is Semiramide, who rules Assyria in disguise as her own son. When Semiramide's husband the King died, rather than allow her weak son Nino to assume the throne, she kept him hidden in the palace and assumed his identity. Among the suitors for Tamiri's hand is Semiramide's brother Mirteo and a previous lover of Semiramide's, Scitalce. Years before, Scitalce, deceived by Sibari, had believed Semiramide unfaithful to him and had her thrown into the river. However, unknown to Scitalce, Semiramide survived. Sibari is also present as a suitor for Tamiri and recognises Semiramide, despite her disguise.|$|E
25|$|Separators {{have been}} used as part of data {{compression}} algorithms for representing planar graphs and other separable graphs using a small number of bits. The basic principle of these algorithms <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a number k and repeatedly subdivide the given planar graph using separators into O(n/k) subgraphs of size at most k, with O(n/√k) vertices in the separators. With an appropriate choice of k (at most proportional to the logarithm of n) the number of non-isomorphic k-vertex planar subgraphs is significantly less than the number of subgraphs in the decomposition, so the graph can be compressed by constructing a table of all the possible non-isomorphic subgraphs and representing each subgraph in the separator decomposition by its index into the table. The remainder of the graph, formed by the separator vertices, may be represented explicitly or by using a recursive version of the same data structure. Using this method, planar graphs and many more restricted families of planar graphs may be encoded using a number of bits that is information-theoretically optimal: if there are Pn n-vertex graphs in the family of graphs to be represented, then an individual graph in the family can be represented using only (1nbsp&+nbsp&o(n))log2Pn bits. It is also possible to construct representations of this type in which one may test adjacency between vertices, determine the degree of a vertex, and list neighbors of vertices in constant time per query, by augmenting the table of subgraphs with additional tabular information representing the answers to the queries.|$|E

This can lead to abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies, which is called 'female foeticide'." [...] Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions.

2500|$|Oligopoly is {{a market}} form in which a market or {{industry}} is dominated by {{a small number of}} sellers. The oldest model was the duopoly of Cournot (1838). It was criticized by Harold Hotelling for its instability, by Joseph Bertrand for lacking equilibrium for prices as independent variables. Hotelling built a model of market located over a line with two sellers in each extreme of the line, in this case maximizing profit for both sellers leads to a stable equilibrium. From this model also follows that if a seller <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the location of his store so as to maximize his profit, he will place his store the closest to his competitor: [...] "the sharper competition with his rival is offset by the greater number of buyers he has an advantage". He also argues that clustering of stores is wasteful {{from the point of view}} of transportation costs and that public interest would dictate more spatial dispersion.|$|E
