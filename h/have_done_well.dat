25|$|Increased {{interest}} {{and participation in}} American sports has led to opportunities for Australians {{to play at the}} top level in sports such as baseball, basketball and American football. Grant Balfour is a relief pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays, and played in the 2008 World Series. Australian basketballers <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> at the Olympics, coming fourth four times. The skill set of Australian rules footballers fits the mould of US National Football League (NFL) punters, and they stand out from their American peers with their ability to tackle returners. Two former AFL footballers competed in the 2009 NFC Championship game as punters, Saverio Rocca for the Philadelphia Eagles and Ben Graham for the Arizona Cardinals. Graham's appearance in Super Bowl XLIII made him the first Australian to play in the NFL's championship game. The first College Bowl game to feature two Australians was the 2012 BCS National Championship Game with punter Brad Wing from LSU and defensive end Jesse Williams for Alabama.|$|E

25|$|Solano López would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> to heed his father's {{last words}} to avoid {{aggressive}} acts in foreign affairs, especially with Brazil. Francisco's foreign policy vastly underestimated Paraguay's neighbors and overrated Paraguay's {{potential as a}} military power. Solano López's basic failing {{was that he did}} not recognize the changes that had occurred in the region since Francia's time. Under his father's rule, the protracted, bloody, and distracting birth pangs of Argentina and Uruguay, the bellicose policies of Brazil, and Francia's noninterventionist policies had worked in conjunction with one another to preserve Paraguayan independence. Matters had settled down since then in both Argentina and Brazil, as both countries had become surer of their identities and more united internally. Argentina, for example, began reacting to foreign challenges as a nation rather than an assortment of squabbling regions, as Paraguayans had grown to expect. Solano López's attempt to leverage Paraguay's emergence as a regional power equal to Argentina and Brazil had disastrous consequences.|$|E
25|$|Born 1 October 1900 in Gloucester, Goddard joined Gloucestershire in 1922 as a fast bowler, Goddard {{met with}} so little success in his first six years {{that he was not}} re-engaged by Gloucestershire for 1928. However, {{determined}} to succeed, he joined the ground staff at Lord's and switched to off spin. With his massive hands and steep bounce due to his height (about 190 centimetres or six feet three inches), he was an immediate success and Gloucestershire re-engaged him for 1929. Even on the best of wickets Goddard was able to turn the ball substantially, and when the turf was worn or sticky he could spin to a remarkable degree. He earned a reputation as a voracious appealer, a sworn enemy of batsmen. Owing to his high trajectory, he could be easy to hit (it is estimated he was hit for 70 sixes a season between 1934 and 1938), and it is probable that this is why he was so expensive against the incomparable 1948 Australian side, and in some cases in county cricket. He played only once against Australia (in 1930) and only eight times against all countries – for much of Goddard's time, Hedley Verity was the preferred England spin bowler, and it is often thought that leg spinners rather than off spinners were favoured at this time in Tests. His successes in the matches he played (he did a hat-trick against South Africa in 1938–39) suggests he might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> with more opportunities. He finished with six hat-tricks, the same as Parker and only one less than the all-time record of seven, held by D. V. P. Wright of Kent.|$|E

500|$|Jack Simmons, in his 1945 biography, {{believed}} that the poem was [...] "the longest, the least successful, the most tedious" [...] of Southey's poems. In 1972, Ernest Bernhardt-Kabisch argued [...] "Southey would perhaps <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> to have ended the poem here [...] In its larger framework of Welsh history, the American adventure and its clash of culture is interesting and is comparable in purpose and proportion, if not in power and dramatic nuance, to Odysses' exotic flashback narrative at the court of Phaeacia. The Welsh narrative [...] appeals {{to a variety of}} Romantic interests – patriotic and picturesque, sentimental and libertarian. And though, as always, thought tends to be commonplace and pathos shortwinded, the quality of the writing is almost uniformly high, and there are memorable and moving passages of description and rhetoric, as well as suggestive images". He continued adding that [...] "Southey's epic thereby becomes, in fact, the crowning effort of eighteenth-century English literature to deal poetically with the American Indian".|$|E
500|$|He {{also argued}} that the brigade {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} light antitank weapons, as well as there being no fourth company in a battalion; the absence of the latter was a [...] "serious handicap" [...] to each battalion, especially when surrounded by enemy forces. In terms of the brigade's ground role, Otway considered it to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> in terms of patrolling and night patrols, but was unaccustomed to cooperating with other arms, particularly artillery and armour, {{because of a lack of}} training and was forced to learn these skills during combat. It also suffered from a lack of reinforcements, as high physical and mental standards during airborne training led to a small pool of reinforcements that was easily depleted, as well as the absence of its own transport, forcing the brigade to rely on captured enemy vehicles and pack animals. Finally, Otway argued that [...] "it was most uneconomical and inefficient to employ a parachute brigade in ground operations" [...] unless it was expanded with sufficient transport and extra personnel, as well as possessing a superior officer who understood the specialised role the brigade played and could advise on how to effectively use it.|$|E

The last line from the song, [...] "Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why", is about how [...] "we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as [...] "frank sensuality". [...] "Oceania" [...] also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that [...] "the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [...] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins.
