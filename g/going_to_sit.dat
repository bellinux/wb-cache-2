Producer Alfred Gough said, [...] "Peter Chelsom describes the Stewart family [...] as a bilingual family whose second language is music, and that's very true in this movie." [...] Chelsom says the film's numerous songs are tightly woven {{into the fabric of}} the story and the characters, which is why he believes the film will feel like a musical without being one. [...] "We continuously dance very close to the convention of a musical but are more integrated. Songs are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> within the film, not apart from the film. At times, you won't notice the music is happening; it'll just move the story along." ...|$|E

The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. And now I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the dark, and I could only see out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E

Lopez stated that {{when it comes time to}} make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that she is always working on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't ever stop. I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about.

[...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good.

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me.

Taft told his military aide, Archibald Butt, that [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the lid and it will take a great deal to pry me off". He showed his support for Díaz by meeting with him at El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. The day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham and a Texas Ranger captured and disarmed an assassin holding a palm pistol only {{a few feet from the}} two presidents. Before the election in Mexico, Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero, whose supporters took up arms. This resulted in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years. In the U.S.'s Arizona Territory, two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured, some as a result of gunfire across the border. Taft was against an aggressive response and so instructed the territorial governor.|$|E
