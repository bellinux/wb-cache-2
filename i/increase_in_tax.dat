500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Grant's second term the nation was prosperous, the national debt, government spending, tariffs, and the federal workforce were reduced, {{and there was an}} <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. Congress established a de facto deflationary gold standard that reduced the number of greenbacks in the national economy. However, the Panic of 1873 rocked the nation and destroyed much of the economic advancements made in Grant's first term. The Panic caused a severe nationwide economic depression and turned public opinion against Grant. As a result, Democrats regained control of the House in the 1874 elections. Corruption scandals escalated, though reformers appointed by Grant were able to clean up some federal departments. Most notably, Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow prosecuted the Whiskey Ring, leading to the indictment of Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock. Secretary of War William W. Belknap resigned in disgrace in February 1876 after he was impeached by the House for taking kickbacks. Grant continued to support Reconstruction, and he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which banned discrimination in public accommodations. However, by the end of Grant's presidency, white Southern Democrats–Redeemers–had regained political control of state governments, often through extreme violence and the suppression of black voters.|$|E

The Commercial Appeal reported: [...] "All the diesel money will be earmarked {{to pay off the}} bonds or, if the bond issue fails, to directly finance repairs to the interstates. The gasoline tax money will finance work on non-interstate state roads, notably projects approved in a 1991 road program that without new money remains seven years from completion. Should the bond issue fail, the taxes would remain in place, lessening the chances that the trucking industry will campaign against the bonds."

2500|$|In Estonia, {{which has}} had a flat tax since 1994 (rate has been 20% since 2015, and used to be 21-26%), {{studies have shown that}} the {{significant}} <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> revenue experienced was caused partly by a disproportionately rising VAT revenue. Moreover, Estonia and Slovakia have high social contributions, pegged to wage levels. Both matters raise questions regarding the justice of the flat tax system, and thus its long-term political sustainability. The Estonian economist and former chairman of his country's parliamentary budget committee Olev Raju, stated in September 2005 that [...] "income disparities are rising and calls for a progressive system of taxation are getting louder – this could put an end to the flat tax after the next election". However, this did not happen, because after the 2007 elections a right-wing coalition was formed which stated its will to keep the flat tax in existence. However, critics argue that the tax rates these countries have are actually more progressive than flat.|$|E
2500|$|The Laffer curve as {{presented}} is simplistic {{in that it}} assumes a single tax rate and a single labor supply. Actual systems of public finance are more complex, and there is serious doubt about the relevance of considering a single marginal tax rate. In addition, revenue {{may well be a}} multivalued function of tax rate; for instance, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> rate to a certain percentage may not result in the same revenue as a decrease in tax rate to the same percentage (a kind of hysteresis). Furthermore, the Laffer curve does not take explicitly into account the nature of the tax avoidance taking place. It is possible that if all producers are endowed with two survival factors in the market (ability to produce efficiently and ability to avoid tax), then the revenues raised under tax avoidance can be greater than without avoidance, and thus the Laffer curve maximum is found to be farther right than thought. The reason for this result is that if producers with low productive abilities (high production costs) [...] tend to have strong avoidance abilities as well, a uniform tax on producers actually becomes a tax that discriminates on the ability to pay.|$|E

[...] The case went to the Supreme Court, and with regard to Pfizer, the court cited a prior decision that said: [...] "The record clearly demonstrates that the development plan was not intended to serve the interests of Pfizer, Inc., or any other private entity, but rather, to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs, generating a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> revenue, encouraging spin-off economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront”.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between labor taxation and unemployment in Sweden by estimating a labor market model that includes a wage-setting locus and labor demand and supply relationships. The study simulates {{the effect of a}} 1 percentage point <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the payroll <b>tax</b> and <b>in</b> total <b>tax</b> rates. The <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the payroll <b>tax</b> pushes up labor costs by about ½ percent over a 5 – 10 year time horizon. Hours worked fall by 0. 5 percent and the unemployment rate rises by 0. 3 percentage point. The <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> total <b>tax</b> rates generates a similar result.

50|$|The {{effect of}} a change in {{taxation}} level on total tax revenue depends on the good being investigated, and in particular on its price elasticity of demand. Where goods have a low elasticity of demand (they are price inelastic), an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> or duty will lead to a small decrease in demand—not enough to offset the higher tax raised from each unit. Overall tax revenue will therefore rise. Conversely, for price-elastic goods, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> rate or duty would lead to a fall in tax revenue.|$|E
