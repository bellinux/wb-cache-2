5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to <b>harming</b> animals, then we are more likely to see <b>harming</b> humans as acceptable.|$|E

50|$|Mill's <b>harm</b> {{principle}} {{is distinct from}} the offence principle. The basis of comparison is that, in some cases, psychological or social <b>harm</b> may be comparable to physical <b>harm.</b> The difference {{is based on the}} assumption that offence may cause discomfort, but does not necessarily cause <b>harm.</b> Offence meets the <b>harm</b> principle only if it is a wrong and also causes <b>harm.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{the second}} maxim also opens the {{question}} of broader definitions of <b>harm,</b> {{up to and including}} <b>harm</b> to the society.

50|$|Along similar {{lines as}} Mill, Jasper Doomen {{has argued that}} <b>harm</b> should be defined {{from the point of}} view of the {{individual}} citizen, not limiting <b>harm</b> to physical <b>harm</b> since nonphysical <b>harm</b> may also be involved; Feinbergs distinction between <b>harm</b> and offense is criticized as largely trivial.|$|R

5|$|Prakriti (nature or type of karma) – According to Jain texts, {{there are}} eight main types of karma which {{categorized}} into the 'harming' and the 'non-harming'; each divided into four types. The <b>harming</b> karmas (ghātiyā karmas) directly affect the soul powers by impeding its perception, knowledge and energy, and also brings about delusion. These <b>harming</b> karmas are: darśanāvaraṇa (perception-obscuring karma), jñānavāraṇa (knowledge-obscuring karma), antarāya (obstacle-creating karma) and mohanīya (deluding karma). The non-harming category (aghātiyā karmas) {{is responsible for the}} reborn soul's physical and mental circumstances, longevity, spiritual potential and experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations. These non-harming karmas are: nāma (body-determining karma), āyu (lifespan-determining karma), gotra (status-determining karma) and vedanīya (feeling-producing karma), respectively. Different types of karmas thus affect the soul in different ways as per their nature.|$|E
5|$|Prostitution is {{considered}} sinful {{for both the}} prostitute and the customer; it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and <b>harming</b> society.

50|$|A risk is {{the amount}} of <b>harm</b> that can be {{expected}} to occur during a given time period due to specific <b>harm</b> event (e.g., an accident).

5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and <b>harming</b> native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{examine how}} sociodemographic factors and alcohol {{consumption}} {{are related to}} a four-way typology of causing <b>harm</b> to others and/or being <b>harmed</b> by othersș and one's own drinking.

Results Younger age and heavy drinking were significant correlates of both causing <b>harm</b> and being <b>harmed.</b> Women and better educated respondents {{were more likely to}} report negative effects on relationship and family from another's drinking. Better educated respondents had higher risks for work, financial, or injury <b>harms</b> from another's drinking.

40|$|The total social <b>harm</b> {{caused by}} {{everyone}} is often verifiable, and the <b>harm</b> that each actor causes is often unverifiable.

By excessive <b>harm</b> we mean the difference between the total <b>harm</b> caused by all injurers and the optimal total <b>harm.</b> We show that the rule of total liability for excessive <b>harm</b> creates incentives for efficient precaution and activity level. Consequently, actual <b>harm</b> is not excessive and actual liability is nil. The authorities gain control over social <b>harm</b> without having to monitor individuals, and individuals do not have to pay damages or conform to bureaucratic regulations.

Since then, the biennial report has become a key publication for researchers, policymakers, civil society organisations and advocates, mapping <b>harm</b> reduction policy adoption and programme implementation globally. In the second and third editions, the Global State of <b>Harm</b> Reduction 2010 : Key Issues for Broadening the Response(2) and The Global State of <b>Harm</b> Reduction 2012 : Towards an Integrated Response,(3) important <b>harm</b> reduction issues were explored in a series of chapters on key topics, such as the response to amphetamine-related <b>harms,</b> <b>harm</b> reduction in prisons, effective <b>harm</b> reduction services for women who inject drugs, and access to <b>harm</b> reduction services by young people. The Global State of <b>Harm</b> Reduction 2014 continues to map the response to drug-related HIV, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis.
