He was a better singer than me, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> – that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship". Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, [...] "I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because I used to like telling him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement".|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{secret of}} state, no doubt," [...] the officer rejoined. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> nothing <b>this</b> time; {{but do not}} let it occur again, or I shall think that some Iberian maiden has {{captured}} that susceptible heart of yours." ...|$|R
60|$|I must {{refer you}} on this subject again to Andrew Combe's 'Physiology,' {{especially}} chapters iv. and vii.; and also to chapter x. of Madame de Wahl's excellent book. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> only <b>say</b> <b>this</b> shortly, that the three most common causes of ill-filled lungs, in children and in young ladies, are stillness, silence, and stays.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since I may {{not help}} myself otherwise," [...] said Everard, [...] "I swear, as I {{have a sense}} of {{religion}} and honour, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> nothing of <b>this</b> violence, nor make any search after those who are concerned in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS. Aye! It's {{not much}} profit to us! <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for you, Mr. Anthony--ye know your own mind! [Staying at ANTHONY.] I can reckon on ye! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{is not in}} your proces; yet <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> much: {{they told}} me that the King would become master of his kingdom in spite of his enemies." ...|$|E
6000|$|Clym said huskily, [...] "You are my mother. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> no more--beyond <b>this,</b> that I {{beg your}} pardon for having thought this my home. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> no longer inflict myself upon you; I'll go." [...] And he went out with tears in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Now {{many will}} {{debate on the}} {{psychological}} possibility of such a friendship founded on reciprocal ridicule, or rather on a comedy of comparisons. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> of <b>this</b> harmony of humours what Mr. H. G. Wells says of his harmony of states in the unity of his World State. If it be truly impossible {{to have such a}} peace, then there is nothing possible except war. If we cannot have friends in this fashion, then we shall sooner or later have enemies in some other fashion. There is no hope in the pompous impersonalities of internationalism.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou hast a goodly countenance, Signore, and {{the less}} need to hide it. I have noted thee among the revellers, when thou hast thought thyself unseen; and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> of thee <b>this</b> much, without wish to gain aught in our bargain, one of {{appearance}} fair as thine, Signor Roderigo, had better be seen openly than go thus for ever behind a cloud." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that is true. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for Gar'ner, {{that he is}} as {{reasonable}} a young man, when he does an odd job, as any one I know. I like {{to employ}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mrs. Kemp, tike {{it all in}} all, I ain't got no {{grounds for}} complaint. I'm in the 'abit of askin' five shillings, an' <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> I don't think it's too much for wot I do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you are, I do declare. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> Mr. Graham, for {{wholesomeness}} {{of flesh}} you beat anything I ever come nigh. There's a many {{would have been}} weeks and weeks before {{they could have been}} moved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall ask Mr. Courage," [...] he said, rising, [...] "to {{distribute}} these {{through the}} agency of chance. For myself, <b>I</b> <b>will,</b> with your permission, retire. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> only <b>say</b> <b>this</b> to you, ladies, and to my friends. I hope and believe that it will not be long before I shall have the pleasure of meeting you under very different circumstances. You will be very welcome to the Court of France. I trust that together {{we may be able to}} revive some of her former glories, and I do believe that your presence amongst our ancient aristocracy will be for her lasting good." ...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR JOE,--I'm {{not expecting}} {{anything}} but kicks for scoffing, and am expecting a diminution of my {{bread and butter}} by it, but if Livy <b>will</b> let me <b>I</b> <b>will</b> have my <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> nation is {{like all the others}} that have been spewed upon the earth--ready to shout for any cause that will tickle its vanity or fill its pocket. What a hell of a heaven it will be, when they get all these hypocrites assembled there! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nor railways. It is {{like those}} mysterious offers we see advertised, by which any gentleman with no brains at all may make {{so much a}} week without risk, trouble, or soiling his fingers. However, I am {{intending}} to say nothing till it is settled, though <b>I</b> <b>will</b> just <b>say</b> <b>this</b> much, that you soon may have other fish to fry than to think of Stephen Smith. Remember, I wish, not to be angry, but friendly, to the young man; for your sake I'll regard him as a friend in a certain sense. But this is enough; {{in a few days}} you will be quite my way of thinking. There, now, go to your bedroom. Unity shall bring you up some supper. I wish you not to be here when he comes back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you {{not know}} Marina, Teule?' she said again, {{but before the}} words had left her lips I knew her. 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> that I should {{scarcely}} have known YOU, Teule. Trouble and time have done their work with both of us.' ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Candy" [...] {{is written}} by Aggro Santos, Josef Larossi, Andreas Romdhane, Viktoria Hansen. It has {{elements}} of David Guetta-esque beats with synth noises. The songs chorus refer to online branding. When Santos {{was asked what}} [...] "Candy" [...] means he said, [...] "It means (sings) come and get you some, come and get you some! 'Candy is metaphoric for something that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>say</b> in <b>this</b> interview!" [...] Amy Dawson from Metro noted that Santos and Wyatt exchange a [...] "romantic repartee".|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] Graillot replied, [...] "I say nothing. If what I have {{suggested}} does not exist, {{then for the}} first time in my life I have made a mistake; but I do not think I have. You may not realize it, but there is before you one of those struggles that make or mar the life of women of every age. As for the men, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> only <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> and it is because of it that I have spoken at all--I am a lover of fair play, and the struggle is not even. The younger man may hold every card in the pack, but Eugène of Seyre has learned how to win tricks without aces. I stayed behind to <b>say</b> <b>this</b> to you, Louise. You know the young man and I do not. It is you who must warn him." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} both digital and analog {{information}} {{are important in}} the foundations of quantum physics. If {{it is possible for}} information present in one system to become present in others without being erased in the original system <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> information can be copied. I argue that copying is important for understanding issues like causality and that all information that can be copied is digital. I then explain that analog information that cannot be copied can be understood in terms of decision theoretic probability. Finally, I argue that these ideas can help explain the second law of thermodynamics. The arrow of time we experience is the knowledge arrow of time [...] the present contains more knowledge, that is, useful or explanatory information, than the past. That knowledge is created by evolutionary processes that involve copying, variation and selection and such processes increase entropy. Comment: Submitted for FQXI essay contest, 10 page...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> much: The sea, {{which had}} risen at first, was beaten down by that wind. More: {{it seemed as}} if the whole ocean had been sucked up in the maw of the hurricane, and hurled on through that portion of space which {{previously}} had been occupied by the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must try}} and {{do the best you}} can now. I am not saying what that should be. I am not dictating to you. You are a man, and, of course, you must judge for yourself. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this.</b> You shouldn't do {{anything}} just because it is the easiest. I don't suppose I should live after it. I don't indeed. But that should not signify to you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for the kid, though: {{he was a}} trier. Failure didn't {{discourage}} him. Whenever {{there was}} any kind of sweet near he had a dash at his line, and kept on saying something till he got what he was after. His only fault was his uncertainty. Personally, I would have been prepared to risk it, and start the performance at the first opportunity, but Jimmy said no.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] he said, {{walking up}} on the piazza and setting down his valise, [...] "that you only take soldiers, sailors, farmers, and {{mechanics}} at this house. I have been told all about it, and if I had not thoroughly understood the matter I should not have thought {{of such a thing}} as stopping here. If you will sit down for a few moments <b>I</b> <b>will</b> explain." [...] <b>Saying</b> <b>this,</b> he took a seat on a bench by the door, but Euphemia and I continued to stand.|$|R
6000|$|Life was {{primitive}} in all {{the homes}} of the coulee. Money was hard to get. We always had plenty to eat, but {{little in the way of}} luxuries. We had few toys except those we fashioned for ourselves, and our garments were mostly home-made. I have heard my father say, [...] "Belle could go to town with me, buy the calico for a dress and be wearing it for supper"--but I fear that even this did not happen very often. Her [...] "dress up" [...] gowns, according to certain precious old tintypes, indicate that clothing was for her only a sort of uniform,--and yet <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>say</b> <b>this</b> made her unhappy. Her face was always smiling. She knit all our socks, made all our shirts and suits. She even carded and spun wool, in addition to her housekeeping, and found time to help on our kites and bows and arrows.|$|R
60|$|Theseus set {{the lamp}} {{down on a}} rock behind a corner, and he waited, thinking, {{at a place where}} a narrow dark path turned at right angles to the left. Looking {{carefully}} round he saw a heap of bones, not human bones, but skulls of oxen and sheep, hoofs of oxen, and shank bones. 'This,' he thought, 'must be the place where the food of the Minotaur is let down to him from above. They have not Athenian youths and maidens to give him every day! Beside his feeding place <b>I</b> <b>will</b> wait.' <b>Saying</b> <b>this</b> to himself, he rose and went round the corner of the dark narrow path cut in the rock to the left. He made his own breakfast, from the food that Ariadne had given him, and it occurred to his mind that probably the Minotaur might also be thinking of breakfast time.|$|R
6000|$|Nat's {{adventure}} {{was like}} this; I don't know how true it is; maybe {{he got it}} out of a paper, or somewhere, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for him, that he DID know how to tell it. He could make anybody's flesh crawl, and he'd turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and girls got so faint they couldn't stick it out. Well, it was this way, as near as I can remember: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{now that}} {{the game is played}} and won, why should we bear malice? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> that if ever I were in such a plight as that which I pretended in the inn of Lobenstein, I should never wish to meet a more gallant {{protector}} or a truer-hearted gentleman than Colonel Etienne Gerard. I had never thought that I could feel for a Frenchman as I felt for you when I slipped the papers from your breast.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> {{in further}} apology for my work: {{that if it}} has taken an unwarrantable liberty with our early provincial history, it has at least turned {{attention}} to that history, and provoked research. It is only since this work appeared that the forgotten archives of the province have been rummaged, and the facts and personages of the olden time rescued from the dust of oblivion, and elevated into whatever importance they may actually possess.|$|E
5000|$|Answer of Miss Earth 2012: [...] "Good evening {{ladies and}} gentlemen, I'm so afraid that's my problem because I didn't {{understand}} the question so <b>I</b> <b>will</b> try to <b>say</b> <b>this</b> message : I {{want to say}} that we have to protect Mother Earth because you know, how big mother earth and the people is not a privilege it's a duty for us living on this planet…she gave us everything what we need to the life, so let's respect her and she will be respect us, so thank you, thank you so much."

6000|$|Since I desire, in <b>this</b> chapter, to <b>say</b> an {{instructive}} word or {{two about}} the silver mines, the reader may take this fair warning and skip, if he chooses. The year 1863 was perhaps the very top blossom and culmination of the [...] "flush times." [...] Virginia swarmed with men and vehicles to that degree that the place looked like a very hive--that is when one's vision could pierce through the thick fog of alkali dust that was generally blowing in summer. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> concerning <b>this</b> dust, that if you drove ten miles through it, you and your horses would be coated with it a sixteenth of an inch thick and present an outside appearance that was a uniform pale yellow color, and your buggy would have three inches of dust in it, thrown there by the wheels. The delicate scales used by the assayers were inclosed in glass cases intended to be air-tight, and yet some of this dust was so impalpable and so invisibly fine that it would get in, somehow, and impair the accuracy of those scales.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> Great State, this World Republic {{of civilized}} men, is our dream, {{because it is}} not a dream, it is a manifestly {{reasonable}} possibility. It is our intention. It is what we are deliberately making and what in a little while very many men and women will be making. We are secessionists from all contemporary nationalities and loyalties. We have set ourselves with all the capacity and energy at our disposal to create a world-wide common fund of ideas and knowledge, and to evoke a world-wide sense of human solidarity in which the existing limitations of political structure must inevitably melt away.|$|R
