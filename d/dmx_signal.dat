50|$|When {{controlled}} by a Series 200 data signal, the VLSR stored the cue information (in {{much the same way}} that Series 200 luminaires did) and transmitted the raw positional and colour information to the luminaires, as Series 300 data. In this case, the Series 200 input connector was used to supply both power and data.When {{controlled by}} a DMX512 data signal, all cue information is stored in and transmitted from the lighting console; with the VLSR simply acting as a translating device, which converts the <b>DMX</b> <b>signal</b> to Series 300 data in real time. In this case, the Series 200 input connector is used only to supply mains power to the VLSR, with DMX data being input via a separate, standard, 5-pin XLR connector.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis {{deals with}} design and {{implementation}} of a system for wireless transmission of <b>DMX</b> <b>signal</b> 512, which is primarily designed {{for the management of}} lighting effects. Its electrical specification is based on the EIA 485 standard. Text of the work describes the design stage. First is the issue of implied actual protocol DMX 512 or EIA 485. Next sign on selecting a suitable architecture for wireless transmission, management and compilation of the block diagrams. Describes the operation of the component selection and circuit implementation of the scheme, which is using the DPS Eagle compiled. In conclusion, this work is to evaluate the results of the proposed system and showing the way to its further development {{so that it can be}} realistically implemented in practice...|$|E
50|$|As the {{electrical}} specification currently only defines a purpose {{for a single}} wire pair, some equipment manufacturers continue to use it. Such equipment is not compliant with the DMX standard, but may be sufficiently compatible for operation using simple adapters.Note: There is a risk of equipment damage if 3-pin XLR audio and <b>DMX</b> <b>signals</b> are plugged into each other.|$|R
40|$|Computerized {{lighting}} control {{systems for the}} theater are often very large, expensive, and limited in their everyday uses. A personal computer (PC) is good alternative to the classic lighting consoles. The objective of this project is to implement a {{lighting control}} console on a PC, using the serial port communications. A microprocessor and some IC's were also integrated into the design {{in order to obtain}} the correct <b>DMX</b> 512 <b>signal</b> which can communicate with recent theatrical lighting dimmers. A text based interface was implemented...|$|R
50|$|Most color scrollers use DMX512 {{addressing}} protocol. Each scroller unit {{is given}} an address or identifying number. Earlier scroller models used binary DIP switches {{to set the}} address, however most scrollers currently include digital addressing systems. Once addressed, the unit is then connected with other color scrollers and run back to a power supply (typically with 4-pin XLR cable. 4-pin is used to differentiate power lines from data.) The power supply receives the <b>DMX</b> control <b>signal</b> from the Lighting control console and distributes control <b>signal</b> (either <b>DMX</b> or a proprietary manufacturers signal) to each color scroller unit along with 24 volts DC. Depending on the manufacturer, power supplies can power anywhere from 1 to 64 units.|$|R
