6000|$|Raymond {{looked so}} grave upon this intelligence, that Dennis Morolt, unwilling the Fleming should mark it, thought it {{necessary}} to withdraw his attention. [...] "I can tell thee," [...] he said to Flammock, [...] "that when the Constable of Chester <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> his lances, you shall see your handiwork, the dragon, fly faster homeward than ever flew the shuttle which wove it." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} moment, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> <b>with</b> smoking muskets, {{from among the}} nutmeg-trees.|$|R
60|$|Peter <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a very queer {{expression}} on his face. He seemed bursting with some news which {{he wanted to tell}} and yet hardly liked to.|$|R

60|$|The Story Girl <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a {{quizzical smile}} on her face. Dan whistled. Cecily's pale cheeks flushed with {{understanding}} and gratitude. The Story Girl wore her school print dress and hat also, and was gloveless and heavy shod.|$|R
6000|$|The King {{was greatly}} shocked.--"Good God!" [...] he said, [...] "the gallant Major Coleby, who <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> his four {{sons and a}} hundred and fifty men at Warrington!--And is this all we could do for an old Worcester friend?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Green <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> Thereafter {{we came to}} the {{residence}} of a Mr Priest, who also <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> his son, and thus we sped on over the flat sandy plains, inhaling the sweet scent of mimosa blossom, glowing in the fervid sunshine, and picking up comrades here and there, until about noon we reached the scene of our intended operations.|$|R
50|$|The Cabaret Voltaire. Under {{this name}} {{a group of}} young artists and writers has formed with the object of {{becoming}} a center for artistic entertainment.

60|$|It {{was natural}} that I, suspecting Seth Jepson, should set {{down to his}} door the crime of having betrayed us to our enemies; but when I put that thought into words Archie {{would have none of}} it. He {{declared}} that however much Seth might be inclined toward Toryism, he was not such a knave as to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> traitorous intentions in his heart.|$|R

60|$|As they approached, {{the dogs}} all sprang forward and gambolled around them. They played {{with them for}} a time, and then <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> countenances full of health and glee. Sophia, the eldest, was the most lively and joyous, having much of her father's varied spirit in conversation, and seeming to catch {{excitement}} from his words and looks. Ann was of quieter mood, rather silent, owing, in some measure, no doubt, to her being some years younger.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is a pity, but I cannot blame you," [...] {{the duke}} said, when Fergus had finished. [...] "The man {{has given me}} a great deal of trouble, ever since he <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> his force. He is always slow in obeying orders. Sometimes he seems {{wilfully}} to misunderstand them, and altogether he is a thorn in my side. I am glad, indeed, that the British infantry division are entirely under my control. With them I have no difficulty whatever. He was entirely in the wrong in this matter; and I certainly should address a remonstrance to him, on the subject of his manner and language to one of my staff, but our relations are already unpleasantly strained, and any open breach between us might bring about a serious disaster." ...|$|R
60|$|Unable to make {{an honest}} living so long as General Kelly kept his two {{horsemen}} ahead of us, {{we returned to the}} Army and raised a revolution. It was a small affair, but it devastated Company L of the Second Division. The captain of Company L refused to recognize us; said we were deserters, and traitors, and scalawags; and when he drew rations for Company L from the commissary, he wouldn't give us any. That captain didn't appreciate us, or he wouldn't have refused us grub. Promptly we intrigued with the first lieutenant. He <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> the ten men in his boat, and in return we elected him captain of Company M. The captain of Company L raised a roar. Down upon us came General Kelly, Colonel Speed, and Colonel Baker. The twenty of us stood firm, and our revolution was ratified.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sir, {{if you did}} {{anything}} so foolish you would probably enlarge the two limited titles of our village inns by giving us 'The Dangling Prussian' as a signpost. The Englishman is a patient creature, but at present his temper is a little inflamed, {{and it would be}} as well not to try him too far. No, Mr. Von Bork, you will go <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in a quiet, sensible fashion to Scotland Yard, whence you can send for your friend, Baron Von Herling, and see if even now you may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite. As to you, Watson, you are <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> your old service, as I understand, so London won't be out of your way. Stand with me here upon the terrace, for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have." ...|$|R

50|$|Also in 1986, US 74 was {{extended}} west, from Asheville to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The routing extension starts at its former western terminus <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 70, going northerly, in concurrency <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 70, to I-240, where it overlaps briefly before <b>joining</b> <b>US</b> 19/US 23. From Asheville, in concurrency <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 19/US 23, {{it goes through}} Canton, Lake Junaluska and Waynesville. Near Dillsboro it switches US 23 for US 441 and continues till it splits north within the Qualla Boundary. West of Bryson City, it overlaps with NC 28. In Topton, it <b>joins</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 129 and continues southwesterly till at Murphy, where it <b>joins</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 64 and separates from US 19/US 129. Heading west, in concurrency <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 64, it enters Tennessee; traversing through Ducktown, it reaches Cleveland, where it then follows the US 64 Bypass to I-75. Continuing southeasterly, as a hidden concurrency with I-75, it connects with Chattanooga, ending at its new terminus at I-24.|$|R
50|$|US-159 {{begins at}} US-59 in Nortonville. It <b>joins</b> <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 73 in Horton. The two {{highways}} overlap to the Nebraska border, passing through Hiawatha {{before leaving the}} state north of Reserve.|$|R
50|$|In Quitman it <b>joins</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 84 (cosigned Georgia State Route 38) to Valdosta. From Valdosta to Douglas it joins with Georgia State Route 31. It also joins with Georgia State Route 135 and State Route 56. From Pearson to Douglas it <b>joins</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> Route 441 as a four-lane highway, {{which was}} {{completed}} in 2000.|$|R

25|$|US 20 {{continues}} through Stone Park and Melrose Park before turning south and <b>joining</b> <b>U.S.</b> Routes 12/45. At this point, US 20 becomes Mannheim Road, and later, La Grange Road, until it turns onto 95th Street eastbound <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> 12. This combination later <b>joins</b> <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 41, where the three routes follow Ewing Avenue and Indianapolis Boulevard, {{which are the}} last portions of US 20 prior to its crossing the state line into Indiana.|$|R
50|$|The two {{highways}} {{run through}} Sweetwater before reaching Abilene. US 84 leaves the interstate {{on the western}} side of the city, running with I-20's business loop. <b>US</b> 84 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 83/US 277, <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 277 leaving the concurrency after a short distance. US 84 leaves US 83, northeast of Tuscola. US 84 runs southeast to Coleman, overlapping <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 283 in the process and <b>joining</b> <b>US</b> 67. After leaving Brownwood, US 84 leaves <b>US</b> 67 and <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 183. US 84 becomes a solo route again in Goldthwaite, traveling through Gatesville. In Gatesville, the hwy meets SH 36, which coincidentally also runs to Abilene, albeit in a more direct way than US 84.|$|R
40|$|If the explicitness of some {{languages}} in naming numbers contributes to better mathematical understanding, then how can {{teachers in the}} other languages compensate {{for the lack of}} explicitness? We have designed a pilot project of Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten classes in San Antonio, Texas, where we use a tens-and-ones scheme to name numbers. Measures of results include teacher interviews and assessment of the children’s place value representation with manipulatives. The classes of children are followed through the years of elementary school with particular attention to progress in processes that rely on an understanding of place value. This project began in the fall of 2004. To achieve generalizability will require a much larger project. We need similar projects in many classes using a variety of teaching styles and curricula so as to negate the effects of any one environment. To test whether this approach is applicable to other cultures and languages, we invite others to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> similar projects...|$|R
