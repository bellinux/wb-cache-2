30|$|We use rich {{administrative}} data covering all immigrants in Denmark, and we employ the timing-of-events duration model of Abbring and van den Berg (2003). 2 We find large positive post-programme effects, and, surprisingly, most in-programme effects are positive too. We find the largest effects for subsidized <b>employment</b> <b>programmes,</b> but effects are also large and significant for direct <b>employment</b> <b>programmes</b> {{as well as}} for other programmes. Effects are larger for programmes beginning after six months of unemployment. Implications of our estimates are illustrated by calculating marginal effects on the expected duration to regular employment over a five-year period for typical starting times and <b>programme</b> durations. Subsidized <b>employment</b> <b>programmes</b> shorten the social assistance spell by about 10 months for women and 15 months for men. The effect of direct <b>employment</b> <b>programmes</b> is 3.7 months for women and 4.6 months for men, and the effect of other programmes is 1.5 month for women and 2.6 months for men.|$|R

30|$|The {{finding that}} subsidized {{employment}} {{is the most}} effective type of ALMP is consistent with an earlier study focussing on newly arrived immigrants and with other studies of ALMP effects for unemployed in general. However, this type of ALMP is by far the least frequently applied in Denmark; only 7.4 % of ALMPs offered to immigrants on social assistance are subsidized <b>employment</b> <b>programmes</b> (4.9 % for females and 9.6 % for males). Our results thus indicate that labour market integration of immigrants may be improved considerably by targeting subsidized <b>employment</b> <b>programmes</b> to unemployed immigrants.|$|R

30|$|Using {{the timing}} of events {{duration}} model and a large administrative data set, this study finds large and substantial positive effects of having participated in ALMPs on the hazard rate to regular employment for immigrants receiving social assistance in Denmark. We estimate separate effects for three categories of programmes, and we allow both in-programme and post-programme effects to differ according to whether the program began before or after 6 months. The post-programme effects are largest for subsidized <b>employment</b> <b>programmes.</b> We also find positive in-programme effects except for subsidized <b>employment</b> <b>programmes</b> starting early. Both in-programme and post-programme effects are much larger when the program begins {{at least six months}} after the start of the social assistance spell.|$|R

Wages and employment {{are determined by the}} intersection of demand curves and wage-setting schedules. The wage curve is derived from the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency-wage model. <b>Employment</b> subsidy <b>programmes</b> decrease the risk of being unemployed and tend to keep the welfare of workers. Training programmes upgrade labour skill and tend to transfer labour from a low-productivity to a high-productivity sector. Both programmes tend to increase the welfare of workers. However, the macroeconomic impacts of these two programmes on wages and labour productivity are different. The paper investigates and compares the macroeconomic influences of subsidised <b>employment</b> <b>programmes</b> and training/education programmes in a dual labour-market framework...|$|R
