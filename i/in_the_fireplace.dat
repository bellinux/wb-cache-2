5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, {{but there was no}} evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E

Cassie and Sean burn the book and set aside all their thoughts about The Evil Thing. Sean leaves shortly afterward. Cassie and Max's parents then come home and find the book <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> The father mockingly reads it out loud, reviving The Evil Thing.

25|$|The October 26, 1929, {{edition of}} the Rhinebeck Gazette {{describes}} bins found in the top story or garret of the house. These were traditionally used to store grain {{out of the reach}} of pilfering Indians. However, there are more practical reasons that local grain was stored in the garret of the house. It was more secure from rodents in the barn and would have been a dryer atmosphere, because even when heat was not required, a fire for cooking was always burning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b>|$|E

25|$|Poitou {{testified that}} he and Henriet burned the bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> in Gilles' room.

In the days that follow, while looking at the {{underside}} of the snow globe, Connie discovers a hidden compartment containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message instructing her not to read the message until their 25th wedding anniversary. As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying they {{will find a way to}} move on.

Connie whispers to Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her. It is revealed that Edward has stopped his car near a police station, implying he is about to leave their car and turn himself in.|$|E

A Renaissance-style panelled and arcaded openwork wooden screen was constructed in 1851 by William Horne. Oak panelling was installed framing two internal windows between which is a Jacobean panel and above it was a gallery for family portraits.|$|R

25|$|Papak was {{the grand}} priest {{of the temple}} of Anahita in Istakhr {{and the father of}} Ardashir, the founder of the Sasanian house, with the {{beginning}} of whose reign religion sat on the Persian throne. Papak's religious credit might have helped him in taking the power from Gochihr, then Persian governor who had no interest in following the religion of fire. In a scratched picture, Papak and his son Shapur are shown on a wall in Takht-e Jamshid; in the picture, Papak and Shapur both wear the same helmet similar to that of Shapur I's in his coins; in the picture, Shapur is visualized in the dual place of shah-priest in a way that he squeezes the hilt of his sword by one hand and manipulates the fire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and adds woods by the other hand; and Shapur, son of Papak, squeezes his sword by one hand and takes a ring having a ribbon which is the royal symbol by the other hand on horseback. In his coins, Ardashir, who replaces his brother Shapur as the ruler of Pars in 220, wears the same crown as Shapur's, from the front however, and the picture of his father Papak is drawn behind. Zoroastrianism was the believed and supported religion of the Sasanians until Ardashir's takeover. The current belief is that the priests of the fire temples became noticed and respected by Ardashir's uprising and the opponents were disturbed; but this narrative is the subject of controversy today. Although no remarkable authority of Zoroastrianism had a high rank in Ardashir's court, it seems that the first attempts to establish Zoroastrianism as a government religion was done during Ardashir's period; also the remaining Achaemenid, Hellenic and Parthian traditions were combined and used in that era.|$|E

500|$|The {{central part}} of the castle {{comprised}} a two-storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the latter to hold part of the bibliophile Marquess's vast library. Both included elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy. The decoration here is less impressive than elsewhere in the castle, as much of it was completed after Burges's death by Lonsdale, a less talented painter. The Arab Room in the Herbert Tower remains however one of Burges's masterpieces. [...] Its jelly mould ceiling in a Moorish style is particularly notable. [...] It was this room on which Burges was working when he died and Bute placed Burges's initials, and his own, and the date 1881 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> as a memorial. [...] The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase, recorded in a watercolour perspective prepared by Axel Haig.|$|E
500|$|Mary was not {{beheaded}} with {{a single}} strike. The first blow missed her neck and struck {{the back of her}} head. The second blow severed the neck, except for a small bit of sinew, which the executioner cut through using the axe. Afterward, he held her head aloft and declared, [...] "God save the Queen." [...] At that moment, the auburn tresses in his hand {{turned out to be a}} wig and the head fell to the ground, revealing that Mary had very short, grey hair. A small dog owned by the queen, a Skye Terrier, is said to have been hiding among her skirts, unseen by the spectators. Following the beheading, it refused to be parted from its owner's body and was covered in her blood, until it was forcibly taken away and washed. Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance; contemporary accounts state that all her clothing, the block, and everything touched by her blood was burnt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> of the Great Hall to obstruct relic-hunters.|$|E

500|$|Lamb {{returned}} {{to the police station}} and charged William with Ellen's murder. Ellen's jewellery, found in William's pockets, was confiscated.

500|$|The Herald was {{the largest}} {{circulation}} newspaper in New York City until 1884. Joseph Pulitzer, who came from St. Louis and purchased the World in 1882, aggressively marketed a mix of crime stories and social reform editorials to a predominantly immigrant audience, and saw his circulation quickly surpass those of more established publishers. Bennett, who had moved permanently to Paris in 1877 after publicly urinating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> or piano of his fiancee's parents (the exact location differed in witnesses' memories) spent the Heralds still sizable profits on his own lifestyle, and the Herald's circulation stagnated. Bennett respected Pulitzer, and even ran an editorial praising the publisher of The World after health problems forced him to relinquish the editorship of the paper in 1890. However, he despised William Randolph Hearst, who purchased the New York Journal in 1895 and attempted to ape Pulitzer's methods in a more sensationalistic manner. The challenge of The World and the Journal spurred Bennett to revitalize the paper; the Herald competed keenly with both papers during coverage of the Spanish–American War, providing [...] "the soundest, fairest coverage…(of) any American newspaper", sending circulation over 500,000.|$|E
