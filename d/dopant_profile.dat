Some applications of the SCM technique involve mapping the <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> in a semiconductor device on a 10 nm scale, quantification of the local dielectric properties in hafnium-based high-k dielectric films grown by an atomic layer deposition method {{and the study of}} the room temperature resonant electronic structure of individual germanium quantum dot with different shapes.The high sensitivity of dynamical scanning capacitance microscopy,in which the capacitance signal is modulated periodically by the tip motion of the atomic force microscope (AFM), was used to image compressible and incompressible strips in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) buried 50 nm below an insulating layer in a large magnetic field and at cryogenic temperatures.|$|E

In p-type doping of silicon, a covalently anchored monolayer of allylboronic acid pinacol ester is formed on the surface as the boron precursor while a monolayer of diethyl 1-propylphosphonate is used as the phosphorus precursor in n-type doping. For example, {{in the case of}} USJ formation, combining the phosphorus-MLD and conventional spike annealing, the record 5 nm junction (down to 2 nm - the SIMS resolution limit) with the noncontact Rs measurements (~5000 Ω/□) is reported and being consistent with the predicted values from the <b>dopant</b> <b>profile.</b> Notably, ~70 % of the dopants are electrically active as the MLD process utilizes an equilibrium based diffusion mechanism.|$|E

For the past years, controlling the post-growth dopant profiles in compound semiconductors such as III-V materials deterministically has not been well achieved due to the challenges in controlling the recovered stoichiometry after the implantation and sequential annealing. These residual damages can lead to higher junction leakage and lower dopant activation in compound semiconductors. Utilizing the MLD technique with sulfur dopants, a <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> abruptness of ~ 3.5 nm/decade with high electrically active sulfur concentrations of ~ 8-1018 cm−3 is observed in InAs without significant defect density. [...] Remarkably. the MLD capping layer serves as i) preventing group V elements to desorb and ii) avoiding the dopant atoms to be lost to the ambient in order to result in the good quality junctions.

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} the Etch/TEM and Etch/AFM methods to obtain quantitative 2 -D <b>dopant</b> <b>profiles</b> for the ultra shallow p-n junctions of the next generation of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). For these methods, thin foil (TEM) or bulk (AFM) cross-sectional specimens were etched using a dopant selective chemical so that local areas of the dopant implanted source/drain (S/D) regions were etched to different depths. The surface topography of the S/D regions was determined from the thickness fringes for the TEM method and by the direct measurement for the AFM method. The local etched depths were converted to etch rates, and these were then converted to corresponding 1 -D and 2 -D <b>dopant</b> <b>profiles</b> by the experimentally independent etch rate calibration curves. Shallow junction MOSFET samples were designed and fabricated with junction depths 60 nm (n"+/p), 80 nm (n"+/p) and 120 nm (p"+/n) using 0. 25 #mu#m process technology. A new method using SOG (Spin-on-Glass) contributed to the high quality XTEM thin foil specimens. Controlled stirring of the etchant increased the dopant concentration selectivity and etching consistency. Computer modelling simulated the isotropic etching behaviours, which can introduce the significant error in <b>dopant</b> <b>profiling</b> for shallow and abrupt junction samples. Comprehensive quantitative results enabled the optimum etching time to be determined for the first time. Etch/TEM method gave 1 -D <b>dopant</b> <b>profiles</b> that showed good agreement with 1 -D Spreading Resistance Probe (SRP) <b>dopant</b> <b>profiles</b> for determining junction depths. 2 -D <b>dopant</b> <b>profiles</b> gave L_e_f_f, i. e. the shortest lateral distance between the S/D junctions, of major importance for MOSFET performance. Values for L_e_f_f of 161, 159 and 123 nm were determined from 60, 80 and 120 nm junction depth samples respectively, compared with the 215 nm MOSFET gate length. The resolution and accuracy of the Etch/TEM method are estimated as 2 and 10 nm respectively. For the Etch/AFM method, to overcome the artefact induced by tip size, {{for the first time a}} detailed investigation was made of the convolution occurring for the etched MOSFET structures and a double deconvolution method was developed. The resulting 2 -D <b>dopant</b> <b>profiles</b> for n"+/p 80 nm deep junction sample showed reasonable agreement with Etch/TEM method demonstrating the advantage of the developed deconvolution method.

50|$|This MLD {{technique}} utilizes the crystalline {{nature of}} semiconductors and its self-limiting surface reaction properties to form highly uniform, self-assembled, covalently bonded dopant-containing monolayers {{followed by a}} subsequent annealing step for the incorporation and diffusion of dopants. The monolayer formation reaction is self-limiting, thereby, resulting in the deterministic coverage of dopant atoms on the surface. MLD differs from other conventional doping techniques such as spin-on-dopants (SODs) and gas phase doping techniques {{in the way of}} dopant dose control. Such control in MLD is much more precise due to the self-limiting formation of covalently attached dopants on the surface while the SODs just rely on the thickness control of the spin-on oxide and the gas phase technique depends on the control of dopant gas flow rate; therefore, the excellent dose control in MLD can yield the exact tuning of the resulting <b>dopant</b> <b>profile.</b> Compared to ion-implantation, MLD does not involve the energetic introduction of dopant species into the semiconductor lattice where crystal damages are induced. In the case of implantation, defects such as interstitials and vacancies are inevitably generated, which interact with the dopants to further broaden the junction profile. This is known as the transient-enhanced diffusion (TED), which limits the formation of good quality of USJs. Also, stochastic variation in the dopant positioning and sever stoichiometric imbalance are thus induced for binary and tertiary compound semiconductors by the implantation techniques. In contrast, all MLD dopant atoms are thermally diffused from the crystal surface to the bulk and the <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> can be easily controlled by the thermal budget. Since the MLD system can be classified as a limited source model, this is desirable for controlled USJ fabrication with high uniformity and low stochastic variation. Combined with the excellent dopant dose uniformity and coverage in MLD, it is especially attractive for doping nonplanar devices such as fin-FETs and nanowires. As a result, high quality sub-5 nm ultra-shallow junction has been demonstrated in silicon via the use of this MLD technique. Compared to low-energy ion-implantation into a screening film followed by in-diffusion, the MLD technique requires a lower thermal budget and allows conformal doping on topographic features.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the use of the substrate surface chemistry is the ability to readily control the areal dose of the dopants by forming a mixed monolayer of ‘blank’ and dopant-containing molecules. For instance, a mixture of boron precursor molecules and dodecene (all-carbon ‘blank’ precursor) in different ratios is utilized to manipulate the areal dose of boron. Besides the mixed monolayer formation, the areal dose can be readily tuned by using the molecular structure details of the dopant precursor. In specific, the molecular footprint of the precursor directly governs the surface concentration of the dopants, with larger molecules resulting in a lower dose. In this regard, using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOP) as the phosphorus precursor with an approximately six-fold larger molecular footprint than DPP, the dopant dose can be modulated in the reduction of six times accordingly. Moreover, the doping profiles can be readily tuned through optimization of the annealing conditions. In this case, the high surface doping density with sharp spatial decay can be obtained by using this MLD method with low anneal temperatures and short times for the formation of USJs. The ability to controllably tune the dopant dose through the structural design of the precursor and to control the <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> by the annealing conditions present a unique aspect of the MLD process for attaining the desired dopant dose and profile.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} results of process simulation is the <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> after processing. The accuracy of the profile strongly depends on maintaining a proper density of mesh points {{at any time during the}} simulation. The density of points should be just enough to resolve all dopant and defect profiles but not more because the computation expense of solving the diffusion equations increases with the number of mesh points. A typical full flow CMOS process simulation can have more than 50 mesh changes and the number of mesh changes can increase dramatically if adaptive meshing is performed. For each mesh change, interpolation is used to obtain data values on the new mesh. It is important to manage the mesh changes in such a way to avoid accuracy degradation due to interpolation error. The easiest way to do this is to always keep points once they are introduced into the mesh, but this has the drawback of producing very many mesh points which can be computationally expensive. Maintaining a balance between interpolation error, computational expense, and minimization of required user input is important for obtaining accurate results with a minimum of computational expense. This is especially true when simulating devices in 3D. Without careful placement of mesh either the accuracy will suffer unacceptably, or the computational expense will be too great to be useful. Process simulation tools so far have had limited success in completely automating mesh adaptation such that no user intervention is required. This places a requirement of the user to understand meshing and how it affects simulation accuracy and run time and the burdens the user to track mesh changes during the simulation to ensure proper mesh is maintained.|$|E

This motivates the study of performance enhancement for TFETs. In this paper, we discuss technologies aimed at performance enhancement for TFETs, including strain engineering (Fig. 1), source/drain junction profile engineering (Fig. 2), and use of heterojunction materials. Device and circuit simulation results will be discussed as well. Design optimization of multiple-gate TFET devices [7]-[8] will be briefly discussed, including source and drain junction design.

40|$|Scanning {{capacitance}} microscopy (SCM) {{based on}} the MOS capacitor C-V characteristics is a comparative new technique for <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> extraction. It utilises the high spatial resolution of scanning probe microscopy. However extraction of <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> near a p-n junction has not been successful due to the complex physics involved: typically unrealistically high dopant concentration near the junction is deduced (corresponding to low SCM dC/dV data). Better understanding of SCM measurement and modelling is required to enhance {{the accuracy of the}} extracted dopant concentration. This paper addresses the influence of mobility degradation on the SCM measurement via modelling and comparison with experimental SCM data. The rational for looking into mobility effect is that SCM capacitance measurement is carried out at 915 MHz. At this frequency, resistance of semiconductor surface can be comparable to the reactance of the SCM capacitance. In our simulation carrier mobilities at the semiconductor surface are set low compared to their bulk values to reflect surface mobility degradation. Our results show that the simulated SCM dC/dV is significantly reduced in the vicinity of p-n junction reflecting what is observed experimentally. We attribute this {{to the fact that the}} capacitance between the inverted surface and the SCM probe is not detected due to the high resistance (compared to the reactance of the SCM capacitance) of the inversion layer below the semiconductor and oxide interface. Only the capacitance on the accumulation side is extracted thus leading to the lowering of the detected SCM capacitance and dC/dV. The major conclusion is that the effect of high resistance due to mobility degradation has to be treated carefully for accurate extraction of <b>dopant</b> <b>profile</b> from experimental SCM data...|$|E
