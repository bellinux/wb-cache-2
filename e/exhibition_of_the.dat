5|$|Despite wide popular interest, Escher was {{for long}} {{somewhat}} neglected {{in the art}} world; even in his native Netherlands, he was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. In the twenty-first century, major exhibitions have been held in cities across the world. An exhibition of his work in Rio de Janeiro however attracted more than 573,000 visitors in 2011; its daily visitor count of 9,677 made it the most visited museum <b>exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, anywhere in the world. No major exhibition of Escher's work was held in Britain until 2015, when the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art ran one in Edinburgh from June to September 2015, moving in October 2015 to the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. The exhibition moved to Italy in 2015–2016, attracting over 500,000 visitors in Rome and Bologna, and then Milan.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Krøyer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Krøyer probably met during his time in Paris. Larsson had started painting in watercolours while {{a member of the}} Grez-sur-Loing artists' colony in France. On returning to Sweden, he had begun {{a series of}} pictures of family life with his wife and children in Sundborn in the mid-1890s, publishing it as Ett hem (A home) in 1899. Krøyer's paintings display no signs of disturbance or frustration but leave an impression of a happy family environment, no doubt in accordance with Krøyer's own desires. He exhibited the three from Skagen in 1889 at Den Frie – the <b>exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artists' association that had been formed in 1891 with Krøyer's support – under the collective title Fra mit Skagenshjem (From my Skagen Home).|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} {{work on a}} boat might be photogenic, but, having no experience, {{could not get a}} job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th <b>exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E
5|$|Many of Parsons' {{writings}} were posthumously {{published as}} Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword in 1989, a compilation co-edited by Cameron and O.T.O. leader Hymenaeus Beta (ceremonial name of musician William Breeze), which incited {{a resurgence of}} interest in Parsons within occult and countercultural circles. For example, comic book artist and occultist Alan Moore noted Parsons as a creative influence in a 1998 interview with Clifford Meth. The Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company in 2006, {{with the intention of}} conserving and promoting Parsons' writings and Cameron's artwork, and in 2014 Fulger Esoterica published Songs for the Witch Woman—a limited edition book of poems by Parsons with illustrations by Cameron, released to coincide with his centenary.

5|$|Remembered {{above all}} for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen {{was born in}} Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house {{on the corner of}} Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It {{documents}} his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered house from the age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an <b>exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Stokes {{returned}} from a European honeymoon in 1934, but she produced few works {{in the years immediately}} following. Although the Collins Street apartment had become a full-time studio for Stokes, only two paintings and two sketches from the period are known. The most notable is The Village (c.1933–1935), influenced, according to Stokes' own account, by the post-impressionist and portraitist Augustus John. This work was hung in the inaugural <b>exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Contemporary Art Society, held at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was included in a travelling exhibition that appeared in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1941 and later in Canada. In 1946, Stokes presented the work to the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{rescue of}} the Lipizzans by the United States Army, {{made famous by}} the Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions, {{occurred}} in two parts: The United States Third Army {{under the command of}} General George S. Patton, was near St. Martins in the spring of 1945 and learned that the Lipizzan stallions were in the area. Patton himself was a horseman, and like Podhajsky, had competed in the Olympic Games. On May 7, 1945, Podhajsky put on an <b>exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Riding School stallions for Patton and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson, and at its conclusion requested that Patton take the horses under his protection.|$|E
50|$|He {{became famous}} on the {{international}} art scene from the 1850s onwards, following his participation in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major <b>exhibitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time including the national Ghent Triennial Salon of 1853 and 1865, the 1865 Porto International Exhibition and <b>the</b> 1st International <b>Exhibition</b> <b>of</b> Fine Arts in Munich in 1869.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> {{subscribers}} increased, so did <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prizes, totalling about £9,000 annually at <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union's success.

50|$|In 1914 Marcks {{participated in}} <b>exhibitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Secession and the Deutscher Werkbund, after World War II at the Venice Biennale and the Documentas I (1955), II (1959) and III (1964) in Kassel.|$|R
5|$|At last, in May 1877, {{the day of}} {{recognition}} came, {{with the opening of}} the first <b>exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grosvenor Gallery, when the Days of Creation, The Beguiling of Merlin, and the Mirror of Venus were all shown. Burne-Jones followed up the signal success of these pictures with Laus Veneris, the Chant d'Amour, Pan and Psyche, and other works, exhibited in 1878. Most of these pictures are painted in brilliant colours. A change is noticeable the next year, 1879, in the Annunciation and in the four pictures making up the second series of Pygmalion and the Image; the former of these, one of the simplest and most perfect of the artist's works, is subdued and sober; in the latter a scheme of soft and delicate tints was attempted, not with entire success. A similar temperance of colours marks The Golden Stairs, first exhibited in 1880. The almost sombre Wheel of Fortune was shown in 1883, followed in 1884 by King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid, in which Burne-Jones once more indulged his love of gorgeous colour, refined by the period of self-restraint. He next turned to two important sets of pictures, The Briar Rose and The Story of Perseus, though these were not completed for some years.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second <b>Exhibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E
