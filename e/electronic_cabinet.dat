40|$|Thermal {{characterization}} of electronic cabinets {{is becoming increasingly}} important, due to growing power dissipation and compact packaging. Usually, multiple length scales of interest and modes of heat transfer are simultaneously present. A steady reduced order thermal modeling framework for electronic cabinets was developed to provide an efficient method to model thermal transport across multiple length scales. This methodology takes advantage of compact modeling at the chip or component level and reduced order modeling at subsystem and cabinet levels. Compact models, which were incorporated into system level simulation, were created for components, and reduced order models (ROMs) were developed using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for subsystems and system. An efficient interfacial coupling scheme was developed using the concept of flow network modeling to couple the heat and mass flow rates and pressure at each interface, when interconnecting ROMs together to simulate the entire system. Thermal information was then subsequently extracted from the global modeling and applied to the component model for detailed simulation. A boundary profile-matching scheme for ROM of each subsystem was developed to broaden {{the applicability of the}} multi-scale thermal modeling methodology. The output profiles of the subsystem upstream can be transferred to the input profiles of the subsystems downstream by adding necessary flow straightening ducts during the snapshots generation process. A general method to create dynamic multi-layer compact models for components and modules was developed. These dynamic compact models were incorporated into enclosure level simulation. The dynamic reduced order model for the enclosure was developed using POD. The transient multi-scale thermal modeling approach was illustrated through an electronic enclosure with insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module. The multiscale thermal modeling methodology presented here was validated through experiments conducted on a simulated <b>electronic</b> <b>cabinet</b> and the test vehicle with hybrid cooling technique. The latter incorporated double-sided cooling with hybrid forced air convection, thermoelectric cooling, and micro-channel liquid cooling. The overall multi-scale modeling framework was able to reduced numerical models containing 107 DOF down to around 102, while still retaining an approximation accuracy of around 90 % in prediction of chip junction temperature rises, compared to measurements.

40|$|Abstract: In {{a variety}} of situations, an {{undesired}} shock excitation is applied to a master structure that supports shock-sensitive equipment. Often, one wishes to design and test a master structure that transmits {{the least amount of}} shock energy to the attached equipment. In scaled testing of new designs, a major task is to design and construct “equipment emulators ” – inexpensive mechanical systems which approximately mimic the dynamic behavior of the actual full-scale equipment as seen by the master structure. A new method is presented for assessing the fidelity of equipment emulators and for interpreting test data taken in the presence of imperfect emulators. The proposed approach uses easily obtainable frequency-domain impedance descriptions of the master structure and actual equipment at the attachment points. These ideas may provide a path by which experimentalists can efficiently arrive at conceptual designs of emulators that promise a specified degree of fidelity in terms of attachment point velocities and their associated shock spectra.

50|$|Chinese {{designers}} {{abandoned the}} development of passive phased array radar and decided to adopt the planar array of MR-710 with the same back-to-back configuration of MR-710, because Chinese industry at the time could not provide a new generation passive phased array with the reliability and performance level required by Chinese navy. The more matured planar array of MR-710 not only provided better reliability, but also {{proved to be more}} capable than the domestic Chinese passive phased array designed in the mid-1990s. However, Chinese passive phased array Type 381 does have its advantage over its Russian counterpart in that the equipment below deck is far more compact and reliable. Type 382 design was hence altered to combine the best of two systems by integrating the planar array of MR-710 above the deck and the <b>electronic</b> <b>cabinets</b> and operator consoles of Type 381 below deck together. As a result, the original more than 20 cabinets of MR-710 is drastically reduced on the Type 382. However, the most significant difference between MR-710 and Type 382 is that the former is only a single band radar operates at E-band, while the latter is a dual band radar operates at two frequency bands: S (E/F) and C (G/H) bands. Hence Type 382 also has a name: Sea Eagle (Hai-Ying, 海鹰) S/C, named after the frequency bands it operates at. Maximum power of Type 382 is increased to 100 kW from the 90 kW of the original MR-710., while the maximum range against a fighter sized target is increased to 250 km from the original 230 km of MR-710. In addition to stronger power and higher precision, the rotation rate of Type 382 is increased from the original 12/min to nearly 30/min and scan rate is also nearly doubled.|$|R

Hospitals, on the frontline of this challenge, face nursing shortages and financial constraints. Survey data indicate that missing medication and supplies interrupt nurses more than twice per shift, increasing costs and putting patients at risk. These challenges persist even though over 72 % of U. S. hospitals have deployed Automated Dispensing Machines (ADMs), <b>electronic</b> <b>cabinets</b> that automate inventory management processes and improve product availability. This research investigates the role of inventory inaccuracies, i. e., mismatches between book inventory and physical inventory on hand, as drivers of product availability in hospitals. The research objectives are three-fold: (1) characterize the sources of inventory inaccuracies prevalent in a hospital context; (2) quantify the impact of inventory inaccuracies on product availability and performance metrics; and (3) identify and evaluate practical strategies that hospitals can use to improve product availability by reducing and mitigating inventory inaccuracies. This thesis views the hospital supply chain as a socio-technical system and addresses the research questions using a multilevel, multi-method approach. The research is empirically grounded by the case study of Lambda, a New England area hospital that provided qualitative and high-frequency transactional data from its network of 108 ADMs that stock over 21, 000 product-location combinations. First, by classifying sources of inventory inaccuracies this thesis identifies Imperfect Demand Recording as a hospital-specific source of such inaccuracies. Recording Accuracy is proposed as a metric of user behavior at product and location levels, and reveals that between five and thirty percent of product usage is not recorded. Then, a single-product Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model shows that Imperfect Demand Recording causes large reductions in availability unless mitigated by frequent and consistent (i. e., equally-spaced) inventory counts, and that service level estimates provided by ADMs can have a large, optimistic bias. Assuming that count timing is independent of inventory state, an analytical model provides a closed-form generalization of the simulation results and shows that variability in cycle count has a nonlinear and substantial effect, causing 35 % of counts performed at Lambda to be ineffective. Finally, a sequential and iterative framework integrating the managerial implications of these contributions is proposed. by David C. Opolon. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 1990, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided more than $ 27 billion in disaster assistance, {{more than half of}} which was spent for public assistance projects, such as repairs of damaged roads, government buildings, utilities, and hospitals. FEMA uses established criteria to determine whether to (1) recommend that the President declare a disaster and (2) once a disaster has been declared, approve and fund Public Assistance projects. In 1999, FEMA published formal criteria for recommending the presidential approval of disaster declarations. These criteria include both minimum financial thresholds and other qualitative measures that FEMA applies in deciding whether to recommend presidential approval. These criteria do not necessarily indicate a state's ability to pay for the damage because they do not consider the substantial differences in states' financial capacities to respond when disasters occur. As a result, federal funds may be provided for some disasters when they are not needed. Problems with applying FEMA's criteria remain. In part, these problems may persist because many of the staff assigned to disaster field offices who make eligibility decisions are temporary and may not have the skills and training needed to make appropriate decisions. FEMA has developed a credentialing program to establish qualifications and training requirements for these staff but has not implemented this program. FEMA officials said that budgetary and programmatic factors have delayed implementation. In addition, FEMA's review process does not ensure that all projects are reviewed by the most knowledgeable officials. FEMA also lacks centralized, quantified information that would be helpful for managing the Public Assistance program. Its information system [...] essentially an <b>electronic</b> filing <b>cabinet</b> [...] stores information project by project and does not provide effectively for programwide analysis.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master thesis at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Division of Industrial and Economical Development, at Linköping University of Technology. The project was carried out on behalf of Fanerami AB, Mjölby and {{includes}} 20 weeks of full time schedule work. Cabinets with vertical mounted roller shutters all share the same problem, namely weight balancing. A roller shutter has an equilibrium area where the sum of the different forces acting on the shutter equals zero. As the shutter leaves that area it will pick up speed as it falls towards the bottom. When the shutter hits the bottom of the cabinet there is a potential risk of getting fingers caught and in this project a solution to prevent this from happening was to be presented. In this project, three concepts have been generated with the following different purposes: •In concept 1 the risk of getting any fingers caught when the shutter closes was to be eliminated in an efficient and inexpensive way. •In concept 2 the roller shutter had to be balanced at all time providing the possibility to keep the cabinet open in any position. •The last and most challenging task was to create a remote controlled TV cabinet. The shutters were mounted horizontally and were to be opened simply by pushing the bottom either on the remote transmitter unit or the cabinet. The first concept uses a small oil damper, often seen in kitchen cabinets and drawers. The roller shutter applies pressure on the damper via a lever that transforms the shutter motion along a certain path to a smaller motion in the direction of the damper. By doing so, a smaller damper with higher pressure can be used. Dampers are available with several different pressures and can be mounted in five different positions; therefore the concept can be adjusted to fit almost any cabinet. Concept 2 consists of a thin cord winded around a wheel. The wheel is equipped with a spring that tightens when the cord is pulled in. The spring produces an equal and opposite force that holds the shutter in balance. As the wheel is mounted in the upper front of the cabinet, underneath the shutter, it will almost be invisible. The concept is easy to adjust to most cabinets by simply attach the shutter at different levels. In that way the spring will be tightened to equal the weight of the shutter. The design of the TV cabinet has been a working progress throughout the whole project. A couple of prototypes were produced before the final concept. The mechanical solution is based on two pinion rackets placed one on each side of a rotating pinion powered by a motor through a planetary gearbox. To control the <b>cabinet</b> <b>Electronic</b> Solutions AB developed an electronic system that made it possible to open and close the shutters with a remote control or a switch on the cabinet...|$|R
