40|$|Crop {{rotation}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} technological steps which contribute to yield increases. The concept of agricultural land management within an intensive system of agriculture was the basis for developing at Fundulea, on a leached chernozem, experiments meant to study the effects of modern crop management, with the aim of maintaining a high yield level. The studies carried out referred to: the relationship between annual rainfalls and yields achieved, infection of wheat grains at harvesting with Fusarium spp. and the evolution of floristic composition of weeds in win-ter wheat in different crop rotations for a period of 25 years. Determinations regarding weed infestation were made in wheat monoculture and rotations of 2 - 3 - 4 years (wheat- maize, wheat- maize- peas respectively wheat-sugar beet — maize- sunflower) at the beginning of April and in July (at harvesting). After 25 years of experiments, weed infestation decreased very much within the rotations studied (monoculture = 100 %; two-years rotation = 36 %; three years rotation = 17 %; <b>four-years</b> <b>rotation</b> = 5 %). Bal-anced fertilization with chemical fertilizers in wheat in rota-tions of 3 - 4 years determined a reduction of the infection rate of grains at harvesting. The level of annual rainfalls during the vegetation period of wheat had a determining role in yield formation under non-irrigation conditions. Treatments with different fertilizing elements influenced the level of weed infestation within all crop rotations studied with wheat...|$|R

Nutrient budgets consisted of quantifying various nutrient inputs (e. g., atmospheric deposition and soil mineral weathering), outputs (e. g., fine and coarse root biomass, leaf biomass, harvested biomass, leaching, and denitrification), and transfers (e. g., soil organic matter mineralization, canopy exchange, leaf litter decomposition, and fine root turnover) associated with the plant available soil nutrient pool. Total above- and below-ground production during the rotation was approximately 40 Mg ha- 1, with calculated soil nutrient budget deficits (i. e., nutrient outputs > inputs + transfers) of 17, 39, 112, 271, and 74 kg ha- 1 for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, respectively, averaged across the varieties and sites, but a soil S surplus of 60 kg ha- 1. While soil nutrient budget deficits varied among sites, there were no significant differences (P > 0. 05) among willow varieties.

However, very little information {{is available on the}} relatively long-term effect of different crop rotations and soil tillage practices on crop yields and soil quality parameters. This study was conducted at the Normandin Research Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Five rotation types [1 : Canola–Barley–Barley–Pea (C–B–B–P); 2 : Canola–Pea–Barley–Barley (C–P–B–B); 3 : Canola–Barley–Pea–Barley (C–B–P–B); 4 : Pea monoculture; and 5 : Barley monoculture] and two soil tillage practices [1 : Chisel plough (CP) and 2 : Moldboard plough (MP) ] were evaluated. Canola monoculture of was not included. The study began in 1999 on a former alfalfa field and ended in 2010 after three <b>four-year</b> <b>rotation</b> cycles. Barley monoculture decreased yields by 600 kg ha− 1 in the last five years, whereas field pea monoculture decreased yields by about 1000 kg ha− 1 in most years. Barley monoculture did not significantly reduce grain yields compared to C–B–B–P and C–P–B–B, highlighting the importance of alternate crops every year. Soil tillage (CP versus MP) did not significantly affect yields for all crops in most years; and when it did have an effect, it showed inconsistencies by either increasing or decreasing grain yields. Soil tillage also had insignificant impact regardless of the rotation type involved. Rotation type and soil tillage had insignificant effect on soil organic matter content, whereas CP increased nitrate and phosphorus content in the 0 – 20 cm soil layer. Rotation type had insignificant impact on soil physical properties, whereas CP improved soil water conductivity by 0. 03 cm h− 1 for C–B–B–P and barley monoculture.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) availability related to fertilizer type, catch crop management, and rotation composition on cereal yield and grain N were investigated in four organic and one conventional cropping systems in Denmark using the FASSET model. The <b>four-year</b> <b>rotation</b> studied was: spring barley–(faba bean or grass-clover) – potato–winter wheat. Experiments were done at three locations {{representative of the}} different soil types and climatic conditions in Denmark. The three organic systems that included faba bean as the N fixing crop comprised a system with manure (stored pig slurry) and undersowing catch crops (OF+C+M), a system with manure but without undersowing catch crops (OF−C + M), and a system without manure and with catch crops (OF + C−M). A grass-clover green manure was used asNfixing crop in the other organic system with catch crops (OG+C+M). Cuttings of grass-clover {{were removed from the}} plots and an equivalent amount of total-N in pig slurry was applied to the cropping system. The conventional rotation included mineral fertilizer and catch crops (CF+C+F), although only non-legume catch crops were used. Measurements of cereal dry matter (DM) at harvest and of grain N contents were done in all plots. On average the FASSET model was able to predict the yield and grain N of cereals with a reasonable accuracy for the range of cropping systems and soil types studied, having a particularly good performance on winter wheat. Cereal yields were better on the more loamy soil. DM yield and grain N content were mainly influenced by the type and amount of fertilizer-N at all three locations. Although a catch crop benefit in terms of yield and grain N was observed in most of the cases, a limited N availability affected the cereal production in the four organic systems. Scenario analyses conducted with the FASSET model indicated the possibility of increasing N fertilization without significantly affecting N leaching if there is an adequate catch crop management. This would also improve yields of cereal production of organic farming in Denmark...|$|E

Consequently, the production of purpose-grown woody bioenergy crops, such as short rotation coppice (SRC) willow, is expected to proliferate. Although the economic and environmental benefits associated with SRC willow production are well documented, systematic assessments of nutrient cycling within these plantations are rare. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine biomass production and biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) during an initial <b>four-year</b> <b>rotation</b> of six willow varieties grown at four plantations along a 500 km north-south pedoclimatic gradient within Saskatchewan, Canada. Nutrient budgets were also calculated after quantifying various nutrient inputs (e. g., atmospheric deposition, soil mineral weathering, and organic matter mineralization), outputs (e. g., above- and below-ground biomass, leaching, and denitrification), and transfers (e. g., canopy exchange, leaf litter decomposition, and fine root turnover) affecting the plant available soil nutrient pool. Total stem, leaf litter, and below-ground (primarily fine roots) biomass production after four years averaged 19. 0, 7. 1, and 12. 5 Mg ha- 1, respectively, with corresponding soil nutrient budget deficits of 17, 39, 112, 271, and 74 kg ha- 1 of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, respectively, but a soil S surplus of 60 kg ha- 1. Despite willow’s relatively low nutrient-demanding nature, negligible leaching and denitrification losses, and substantial nutrient cycling from leaf litter, the nutrient export in harvested biomass over multiple rotations will require soil nutrient amendments, particularly N and P, to maintain plantation productivity. Given the apparent eventual need for supplemental fertility to support adequate willow growth over the 22 -yr plantation life span, the fate of broadcast 15 N-labelled fertilizer was also examined. Though the willow accumulated less than ⅓ of the applied fertilizer N after one year, the majority of the residual fertilizer N (51 %) remained available for willow uptake in subsequent years.

Our objective was to compare runoff, soil erosion, and crop yields from a conventional tillage, wheat-fallow two-year rotation and a no-till <b>four-year</b> <b>rotation.</b> The experiment was undertaken within a small watershed to provide results that would be repre¬sentative of conservation effectiveness at the field scale. Two neighboring drainages, 5. 8 and 10. 7 ha (14 and 26 ac), in the 340 mm y- 1 (13. 4 in yr- 1) precipitation zone of northeastern Oregon, were instrumented to record rainfall, runoff, and erosion over a four-year period (2001 through 2004). One drainage was cropped to a winter wheat–fallow rotation and received inversion tillage (tillage fallow). The second drainage was cropped in a four-year no-till rotation: winter wheat–chemical fallow–winter wheat–chickpea (no-till fallow). We recorded 13 runoff events from the inversion tillage system and 3 from the no-till system. Total runoff and erosion values from inversion tillage drainage were 5. 1 mm (0. 20 in) and 0. 42 Mg ha- 1 (0. 19 tn ac- 1) versus 0. 7 mm (0. 03 in) and 0. 01 Mg ha- 1 (- 1) from no-till drainage. The no-till rotation was substantially more effective in conserving soil and water in this field-scale comparison. Soil erosion observed in this research is {{a fraction of that}} reported for similar tillage practices outside of the Pacific Northwestern. Mean wheat yields did not significantly differ between inversion tillage and no-till treatments despite intensify¬ing the rotation by replacing one year of fallow with a chickpea crop in the four-year rota¬tion. Because of high year-to-year variability in yield and limited sample size, more study is needed to compare winter wheat yields in no-till production systems with inversion tillage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the changes and drivers of crop {{rotation}} patterns in the United States and their implications to nitrogen loading using principally the Cropland Data Layers (CDL) produced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). We determined the temporal changes for different crops in the United States using different time periods from 2003 to 2011. Annual, biannual, and <b>four-year</b> <b>rotation</b> patterns were quantified and the trends of monocultural cropping practices were analyzed. ^ The price of crops, changes in policies and expansion of ethanol production were found to contribute to the observed shift in crop rotation strategies. The impact of ethanol plants on corn monoculture was analyzed using different sized buffers and a continuous distance raster. We found that the closer to an ethanol plant, the higher likelihood that corn is planted continuously. The results also showed the direct effect of policy changes as well as changes in crop prices. ^ With the increase in corn monoculture there is an increase in the required amount of applied nitrogen fertilizer to attain desired yields. We developed a model based on the corn yield potential of different soils combined with the recommended amount of applied nitrogen for different corn rotation practices at a national scale from 2009 to 2011. ^ Our results were within 1 percent of National Agricultural Statistic Services (NASS) estimated nitrogen use for corn in 2009 and 2010. The model allowed us to spatially determine the distribution of nitrogen used for corn growth as well as to create scenarios to simulate the potential changes to nitrogen loading if all corn was grown in rotation or if all corn was grown in monoculture. We found that changes in crop rotations can have as much if not greater impact on the total amount of recommended nitrogen applied for corn production as the increased nitrogen from the yearly growth in corn production. ^ Using the nitrogen model, we developed a user interface that allows a land manager or farmer to select their area of interest. The interface calculates the contribution to the total applied nitrogen within each intersected 12 digit hydrologic unit from a selected area of interest and the desired rotation practice. The interface then determines how much nitrogen would be used if the manager changes their rotation practices. ...|$|E
50|$|There were 229 mostly European-owned estates of 79,000 {{hectares}} in 1970, but 14,355 of 759,000 hectares in 1989 {{and their}} final area exceeded a million hectares. Only about 25% {{of the land}} was used in a <b>four-year</b> tobacco cultivation <b>rotation.</b> Many estates became insolvent, despite easy credit and were foreclosed by the parastatal banks. When estates were formed, former residents lost their Customary Land rights and left or became estate labourers or tenants. There were 51,000 agricultural workers (mostly on tea estates) in 1968, 181,000 in 1980 and 200,000 in 1990. Tenants replaced employees later and 675,000 estate tenants were registered in 1990 and 580,000 “squatters” lived on surplus land as a low-paid casual labour pool. Few grew all their food but relied on rations or purchases. This occupation of land by inefficient tobacco estates undermined food security.|$|R
40|$|Two main {{challenges}} facing organic arable farming are {{the supply of}} nitrogen (N) to the crop and the control of perennial weeds. Nitrate leaching from different organic arable crop rotations was investigated over three consecutive <b>four-year</b> crop <b>rotations</b> in a field experiment at three locations in Denmark (12 years in total). The experimental treatments were: i) crop rotation, ii) catch crop and iii) animal manure. Nitrate leaching was estimated from measured soil nitrate concentation in ceramic suction cells and modelled drainage. There were significant effects on annual N leaching of location (coarse sand > loamy sand > sandy loam) and catch crops (without > with). Including a grass-clover green manure on 25 % of the area did not increase N leaching compared with crop rotations without green manure. Also the application of animal manure did not influence N leaching, probably because even in the manured treatments the application rate was lower than crop demand. The results identify management of crop and soil during autumn as the main determinant of N leaching. Nitrate leaching was lowest for a catch crop soil cover during autumn and winter (avg. 20 kg N ha- 1), a soil cover of weeds/volunteers had on avg. 30 kg N ha- 1, and the largest N leaching losses were found after stubble cultivation (avg. 55 kg N ha- 1). The N leaching losses increased with increasing number of autumn soil cultivations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{variation}} in seasonal temperature and precipitation on soil water nitrate (NO 3 -N) concentration and leaching from winter and spring cereals cropping systems was investigated over three consecutive <b>four-year</b> crop <b>rotation</b> cycles from 1997 to 2008 in an organic farming crop rotation experiment in Denmark. Three experimental sites, varying in climate and soil type from coarse sand to sandy loam, were investigated. The experiment included experimental treatments with different rotations, manure rate and cover crop, and soil nitrate concentrations was monitored using suction cups. The effects of climate, soil and management were examined in a linear mixed model, and only parameters with significant effect (P < 0. 05) {{were included in the}} final model. The model explained 61 % and 47 % of the variation in the square root transform of flow-weighted annual NO 3 -N concentration for winter and spring cereals, respectively, and 68 % and 77 % of the variation in the square root transform of annual NO 3 -N leaching for winter and spring cereals, respectively. Nitrate concentration and leaching were shown to be site specific and driven by climatic factors and crop management. There were significant effects on annual N concentration and NO 3 -N leaching of location, rotation, previous crop and crop cover during autumn and winter. The relative effects of temperature and precipitation differed between seasons and cropping systems. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted N concentration and leaching increased with increases in temperature and precipitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
