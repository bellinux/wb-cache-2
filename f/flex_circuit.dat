50|$|Each {{element of}} the <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> {{construction}} {{must be able to}} consistently meet the demands placed upon it {{for the life of the}} product. In addition, the material must work reliably in concert with the other elements of the flexible circuit construction to assure ease of manufacture and reliability. Following are brief descriptions of the basic elements of <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> construction and their functions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flex</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are often}} used as {{connectors}} in various applications where flexibility, space savings, or production constraints limit the serviceability of rigid circuit boards or hand wiring. A common application of <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> is in computer keyboards; most keyboards use <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> for the switch matrix.|$|R
50|$|Minco's <b>Flex</b> <b>Circuits</b> Business Unit {{designs and}} {{manufactures}} custom flexible circuits for high-end applications {{for use in}} critical medical and defense products.|$|R
5000|$|Double-sided <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> are <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> {{having two}} {{conductor}} layers. These <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> can be fabricated {{with or without}} plated through holes, though the plated through hole variation is much more common. When constructed without plated through holes and connection features are accessed from one side only, the circuit {{is defined as a}} [...] "Type V (5)" [...] according to military specifications. It is not a common practice but it is an option. Because of the plated through hole, terminations for electronic components are provided for {{on both sides of the}} circuit, thus allowing components to be placed on either side. Depending on design requirements, double-sided <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage of this type of substrate is that it allows crossover connections to be made very easy. Many single sided circuits are built on a double sided substrate just because they have one of two crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit connecting a mousepad to the motherboard of a laptop. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a very small crossover connection which uses the second side of the substrate.|$|R
50|$|Rigid-flex {{circuits}} are {{a hybrid}} construction <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> consisting of rigid and flexible substrates which are laminated {{together into a}} single structure. Rigid-flex circuits {{should not be confused}} with rigidized flex constructions, which are simply flex circuits to which a stiffener is attached to support the weight of the electronic components locally. A rigidized or stiffened <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> can have one or more conductor layers. Thus while the two terms may sound similar, they represent products that are quite different.|$|E
50|$|UV laser {{depaneling}} {{makes use}} of a 355 nm wavelength (ultraviolet), diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser source. At this wavelength the laser is capable of cutting, drilling and structuring on rigid and <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> substrates. The laser beam, capable of cut widths under 25μm, is controlled by high-precision, galvo-scanning mirrors with repeat accuracy of +/- 4 μm.|$|E
50|$|Sculptured flex {{circuits}} are a novel {{subset of}} normal flexible circuit structures. The manufacturing process involves a special <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> multi-step etching method which yields a flexible circuit having finished copper conductors wherein {{the thickness of}} the conductor differs at various places along their length. (i.e., the conductors are thin in flexible areas and thick at interconnection points.).|$|E
50|$|Flexible electronics, {{also known}} as <b>flex</b> <b>circuits,</b> is a {{technology}} for assembling electronic circuits by mounting electronic devices on flexible plastic substrates, such as polyimide, PEEK or transparent conductive polyester film. Additionally, <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> can be screen printed silver circuits on polyester. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid printed circuit boards, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use. An alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility, referred to as flexible silicon (~ 5 mm bending radius).|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} {{there are}} many different kinds of flexible circuits, including one metal layer, double sided, multilayer and rigid <b>flex</b> <b>circuits.</b> The circuits can be formed by etching metal foil cladding (normally of copper) from polymer bases, plating metal or printing of conductive inks among other processes. Flexible circuits {{may or may not have}} components attached. When components are attached, they are considered by some in the industry to be flexible electronic assemblies.|$|R
40|$|A {{replacement}} conveyorized photoresist stripping {{system was}} characterized {{to replace the}} ASI photoresist stripping system. This system uses the qualified ADF- 25 c chemistry for the fabrication of <b>flex</b> <b>circuits,</b> while the ASI uses the qualified potassium hydroxide chemistry. The stripping process removes photoresist, {{which is used to}} protect the copper traces being formed during the etch process...|$|R
50|$|A {{metal foil}} is most {{commonly}} used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available {{from which to choose}} and create a <b>flex</b> <b>circuit,</b> however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, {{there are a number of}} different types of copper foil available for <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the issues}} with the CSP type of package (which was {{intended}} to be soldered directly to an FR4 or <b>flex</b> <b>circuit)</b> was that for high-density interconnects, the soft solder bump provided less of a stand-off as the solder bump diameter and pitch were decreased. Different solutions were employed including one developed by Focus Interconnect Technology (former APTOS engineers), which used a high aspect ratio plated copper post to provide a larger fixed standoff than was possible for a soft solder collapse joint.|$|E
50|$|A {{membrane}} switch typically has 4 or more layers. The {{top layer of}} a {{membrane switch}} is the graphic interface between the user and the machine. The another critical layer is a printed circuit. This {{can also be a}} <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> made of copper and polyimide material. The layers are normally assembled using pressure-sensitive adhesives although inexpensive designs can be held together by other mechanical means such as a keyboard housing. Contact between two traces can be made through a printed shorting pad or through a metal dome that stands on legs.|$|E
40|$|Rigid <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> have {{historically}} been used in military or commercial aerospace applications where performance was primarily dictated by specification rather than function. Rigid flex {{has proved to be}} useful in other marketplaces, such as consumer electronic goods, in consideration of the inherent higher reliability and smaller available form factor. Unfortunately rigid flex manufacturers have had limited material choices. This has led to higher cost materials and processes being used for less stringent applications, such as personal computing devices or automotive products, where cost drivers are significantly more important. Additionally, there is a constant drive in these commercial markets to reduce overall system size while increasing, or maintaining, high reliability. This paper will focus on work done to define circuit board performance around application rather than specification controlled criteria. Several circuit board materials have been evaluated which will allow for lower cost rigid <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> to be produced and address specific functional performance requirements. Criteria such as flex bend life cycling and minimum bend radii will be presented for a number of material options...|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} inflatable hinge includes curable resin for rigidly positioning {{panels of}} solar cells about the hinge in which wrap around contacts and <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> are disposed for routing {{power from the}} solar cells to the power bus further used for grounding the hinge. An indium tin oxide and magnesium fluoride coating is used to prevent static discharge while being transparent to ultraviolet light that cures the embedded resin after deployment for rigidizing the inflatable hinge...|$|R
50|$|Flexible {{circuits}} (also variously {{referred to}} {{around the globe}} as <b>flex</b> <b>circuits,</b> flexible printed <b>circuit</b> boards, <b>flex</b> print, flexi-circuits) are members of electronic and interconnection family. They consist of a thin insulating polymer film having conductive circuit patterns affixed thereto and typically supplied with a thin polymer coating to protect the conductor circuits. The technology {{has been used for}} interconnecting electronic devices since the 1950s in one form or another. It {{is now one of the}} most important interconnection technologies in use for the manufacture of many of today's most advanced electronic products.|$|R
50|$|Polymer {{thick film}} (PTF) flex {{circuits}} are true printed circuits {{in that the}} conductors are actually printed onto a polymer base film. They are typically single conductor layer structures, however two or more metal layers can be printed sequentially with insulating layers printed between printed conductor layers, or on both sides. While lower in conductor conductivity and thus not suitable for all applications, PTF circuits have successfully served {{in a wide range}} of low-power applications at slightly higher voltages. Keyboards are a common application, however, there are a wide range of potential applications for this cost-effective approach to <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Flex {{circuits}} {{having three}} or more layers of conductors are known as multilayer flex circuits. Commonly the layers are interconnected by means of plated through holes, though {{this is not a}} requirement of the definition for it is possible to provide openings to access lower circuit level features. The layers of the multilayer <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> {{may or may not be}} continuously laminated together throughout the construction with the obvious exception of the areas occupied by plated through-holes. The practice of discontinuous lamination is common in cases where maximum flexibility is required. This is accomplished by leaving unbonded the areas where flexing or bending is to occur.|$|E
50|$|Patents issued at {{the turn}} of the 20th century show that early {{researchers}} were envisioning ways of making flat conductors sandwiched between layers of insulating material to layout electrical circuits to serve in early telephony switching applications. One of the earliest descriptions of what could be called a <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> was unearthed by Dr Ken Gilleo and disclosed in an English patent by Albert Hansen in 1903 where Hansen described a construction consisting of flat metal conductors on paraffin coated paper. Thomas Edison’s lab books from the same period also indicate that he was thinking to coat patterns cellulose gum applied to linen paper with graphite powder to create what would have clearly been flexible circuits, though there is no evidence that it was reduced to practice.|$|E
50|$|Adhesives {{are used}} as the bonding medium for {{creating}} a laminate. When it comes to temperature resistance, the adhesive is typically the performance limiting element of a laminate especially when polyimide is the base material. Because of the earlier difficulties associated with polyimide adhesives, many polyimide <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> presently employ adhesive systems of different polymer families. However some newer thermoplastic polyimide adhesives are making important in-roads.As with the base films, adhesives come in different thickness. Thickness selection is typically {{a function of the}} application. For example, different adhesive thickness is commonly used in the creation of cover layers {{in order to meet the}} fill demands of different copper foil thickness which may be encountered.|$|R
50|$|Single-sided {{flexible}} circuits have {{a single}} conductor layer made of either a metal or conductive (metal filled) polymer on a flexible dielectric film. Component termination features are accessible only from one side. Holes may be formed in the base film to allow component leads to pass through for interconnection, normally by soldering. Single sided <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> can be fabricated with or without such protective coatings as cover layers or cover coats, however {{the use of a}} protective coating over circuits is the most common practice. The development of surface mounted devices on sputtered conductive films has enabled the production of transparent LED Films, which is used in LED Glass but also in flexible automotive lighting composites.|$|R
40|$|A silicon vertex {{detector}} (SVD) for the Belle-II experiment comprises four {{layers of}} double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSDs), assembled in a ladder-like structure. Each ladder module of the outermost SVD layer has four rectangular and one trapezoidal DSSDs supported by two carbon-fiber ribs. In {{order to achieve}} a good signal-to-noise ratio and minimize material budget, a novel chip-on-sensor "Origami" method has been employed for the three rectangular sensors that are sandwiched between the backward rectangular and forward (slanted) trapezoidal sensors. This paper describes the bonding procedures developed for making electrical connections between sensors and signal fan-out <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> (i. e., pitch adapters), and between pitch adapters and readout chips {{as well as the}} results in terms of the achieved bonding quality and pull force...|$|R
50|$|The {{controller}} prototypes used in {{the electrical}} development lab employed a yoke and gimbal mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit. This simple design gave smooth linear control and was highly reliable. The design of the analog joystick, which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They quickly became the Achilles' heel of the system because of their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low-cost internal <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> system. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel. The controllers did, however, include a pause button, a unique feature at the time. Various third-party replacement joysticks were also released, including those made by Wico.|$|E
50|$|The base {{material}} is the flexible polymer film which provides {{the foundation for}} the laminate. Under normal circumstances, the <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> {{base material}} provides most primary physical and electrical properties of the flexible circuit. In the case of adhesiveless circuit constructions, the base material provides all of the characteristic properties.While a wide range of thickness is possible, most flexible films are provided in a narrow range of relatively thin dimension from 12 µm to 125 µm (1/2 mil to 5 mils) but thinner and thicker material are possible. Thinner materials are of course more flexible and for most material, stiffness increase is proportional to the cube of thickness. Thus for example, means that if the thickness is doubled, the material becomes eight times stiffer and will only deflect 1/8 as much under the same load.There are a number of different materials used as base films including: polyester (PET), polyimide (PI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyetherimide (PEI), along with various fluropolymers (FEP) and copolymers. Polyimide films are most prevalent owing to their blend of advantageous electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties.|$|E
40|$|Dual {{junction}} {{amorphous silicon}} (a-Si) solar cells produced on polyimide substrate {{have been selected}} as the best candidate to produce a lightweight solar array for the PowerSphere program. The PowerSphere concept features a space-inflatable, geodetic solar array approximately 0. 6 meters in diameter and capable of generating about 20 W of electrical power. Trade studies of various wiring concepts and connection methods led to an interconnect design with a copper contact that wraps around the edge, {{to the back of}} the solar cell. Applying Plasma Vapor Deposited (PVD) copper film to both sides and the edge of the solar cell produces the wrap around contact. This procedure results in a contact pad on the back of the solar cell, which is then laser welded to a <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> material. The <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> is constructed of copper in a custom designed routing pattern, and then sandwiched in a Kapton insulation layer. The <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> then serves as the primary power distribution system between the solar cells and the spacecraft. <b>Flex</b> <b>circuit</b> material is the best candidate for the wiring harness because it allows for low force deployment of the solar cells by the inflatable hinges on the PowerSphere. An additional frame structure, fabricated and assembled by ILC Dover, will reinforce the wrap around contact-flex blanket connection, thus providing a mechanically robust solar cell interconnect for the PowerSphere multifunctional program. The PowerSphere team will use the wraparound contact design approach as the primary solution for solar cell integration and the flex blanket for power distribution...|$|E

40|$|A high-performance, ultralight, {{photovoltaic}} concentrator array {{is being}} developed for space power. The stretched lens array (SLA) uses stretched-membrane, silicone Fresnel lenses to concentrate sunlight onto triple-junction photovoltaic cells. The cells are mounted to a composite radiator structure. The entire solar array wing, including lenses, photovoltaic cell <b>flex</b> <b>circuits,</b> composite panels, hinges, yoke, wiring harness, and deployment mechanisms, has a mass density of 1. 6 kg/sq. m. NASA Glenn has measured 27. 4 % net SLA panel efficiency, or 375 W/sq. m. power density, at room temperature. At GEO operating cell temperature (80 C), this power density will be 300 W/sq. m., resulting in more than 180 W/kg specific power at the full wing level. SLA is a direct ultralight descendent of the successful SCARLET array on NASA's Deep Space 1 spacecraft. This paper describes the evolution from SCARLET to SLA, summarizes the SLA's key features, and provides performance and mass data for this new concentrator array...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{electronic}} circuit board industry flexible circuit still cover a small the market share, however, with the fastest growth rate. The technology is increasingly used in automotives and aerospace, in handheld mobile appliances and many medical devices like pace makers or hearing aids [1, 2]. Over past years a European consortium of research institutes and industry has explored the future technological potential of flexible printed circuits {{in the framework of}} the project SHIFT. One aspect was to investigate the frontiers of flexible circuit fabrication with respect to minimum feasible line width and pitch using different manufacturing methods. Still further beyond today mainstream flex fabrication technologies were the developments to integrate active and passive components into the buildup layers of <b>flex</b> <b>circuits.</b> In this way extremely high integration of electronic systems and highest functional densities can potentially be realized.

40|$|The Boeing Company has {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) and Surface Mount Technology (SMT) for a highly reliable, low cost interconnect for concentrator solar cell arrays. TAB and SMT are currently used in the electronics industry for chip interconnects and printed circuit board assembly. TAB tape consists of sixty-four 3 -mil/ 1 -oz tin-plated copper leads on 8 -mil centers. The leads are thermocompression gang bonded to GaAs concentrator solar cell with silver contacts. This bond, known as an Inner Lead Bond (ILB), allows for pretesting and sorting capability via nondestruct wire bond pull and flash testing. Destructive wire pull tests resulted in preferred mid-span failures. Improvements in fill factor were attributed to decreased contact resistance on TAB bonded cells. Preliminary thermal cycling and aging tests were shown excellent bond strength and metallurgical results. Auger scans of bond sites reveals an Ag-Cu-Tin composition. Improper bonds are identified through flash testing as a performance degradation. On going testing of cells are underway at Lewis Research Center. SMT techniques are utilized to excise and form TAB leads post ILB. The formed leads' shape isolates thermal mismatches between the cells and the <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> they are mounted on. TABed cells are picked and placed with a gantry x-y-z positioning system with pattern recognition. Adhesives are selected to avoid thermal expansion mismatch and promote thermal transfer to the <b>flex</b> <b>circuit.</b> TAB outer lead bonds are parallel gap welded (PGW) to the <b>flex</b> <b>circuit</b> to finish the concentrator solar cell subassembly...|$|E
40|$|During the {{shutdown}} of 2013 - 2014, for {{the enhancement of}} the current ATLAS Pixel Detector, a fourth layer (Insertable B Layer, IBL) is being built and will be installed between the innermost layer and a new beam pipe. A new generation of readout chip has been developed, and two different sensor designs, a rather conventional planar and a 3 D design, have been bump bonded to the Front Ends. Additionally, new staves and module <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> have been developed. A production QA test bench was therefore established to test all production staves before integration with the new beam pipe. Quality assurance measurements under cleanroom conditions, including temperature and humidity control, are being performed on the individual components during the various production steps of the IBL; namely, connectivity tests, electrical tests and signal probing on individual parts and assembled subsystems.

40|$|Due to {{copyright}} restrictions, {{the access}} to {{the full text of}} this article is only available via subscription. In recent years, light emitting diodes (LEDs) have become an attractive technology for general and automotive illumination systems. LEDs have been preferable for automobile lighting due to its numerous advantages such as long life, low power consumption, optical control and light quality as well as robustness for high vibration. Thermal management {{is one of the main}} issues due to severe ambient conditions and compact volume. Conventionally, tightly packaged double sided FR 4 based printed circuit boards are utilized for both driver electronics components and LEDs. In fact, this approach will be a leading trend for advanced Internet of Things (IOT) applications in near future. A series of numerical models are developed to determine the local temperature distribution on both sides of a light engine. Results showed that FR 4 PCB has a temperature gradient of over 63 °C while the maximum temperature is 105 °C. This causes a significant degradation of lifetime and lumen extraction as many LEDs are recommended to be operated below 100 °C. In addition to FR 4, Aluminum metal core and vapor chamber based advanced heat spreader substrates are developed to obtain thermal impact on the substrate due to a wide range of thermal conductivity of three boards. To mimic real application, two special <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> are developed for LEDs and driver circuit. 10 red and 6 amber LEDs at one flex-PCB, and driver components are populated on the other flex-PCB are mounted. Both <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> are attached each side of the substrate. Experimental results showed that the local hotspots occurred at FR 4 PCB due to low thermal conductivity. Later, a metal core printed circuit board is investigated to minimalize local hot spots. High conductivity metal core PCB showed a 19. 9 % improvement over FR 4 based board. A further study has been performed with an advanced heat spreader based on vapor chamber technology. Results showed that a thermal enhancement of 7. 4 % and 25. 8 % over Al metal core and FR 4 based boards with an advanced vapor chamber substrate.

40|$|Abstract- As a {{treatment}} for aortic stenosis, several companies have recently introduced prosthetic heart valves designed to be deployed through a catheter using an intravenous or trans-apical approach. This procedure can either {{take the place of}} open heart surgery with some of the devices, or delay it with others. Real-time 3 D ultrasound could enable continuous monitoring of these structures before, during and after deployment. We have developed a 2 D ring array integrated with a 30 French catheter that is used for trans-apical prosthetic heart valve implantation. The transducer array was built using three 46 cm long <b>flex</b> <b>circuits</b> from MicroConnex (Snoqualmie, WA) which terminate in an interconnect that plugs directly into our system cable, thus no cable soldering is required.
