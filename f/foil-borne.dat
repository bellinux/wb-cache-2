5000|$|Her {{use this}} time, however, was more {{problematic}} {{than the first}} testing period in 1974. She continually suffered mechanical breakdowns, including problems with her turbine, {{and the lack of}} spare parts forced the Coast Guard to extend her period of evaluation from 12 months to 16 months. Her crew spent more of their time attempting to repair her rather than patrolling and one officer likened her operation to that of an aircraft, requiring frequent maintenance; The difference being that an aircraft has a flight crew to operate the aircraft and a maintenance crew for its upkeep. The crew of Flagstaff, however, had to do both, and were [...] "overwhelmed with the maintenance workload," [...] and their morale consequently suffered. From 26 May 1977-27 October 1977, Flagstaff only managed 305.2 hours of operating time, including only 71.6 hours of <b>foil-borne</b> time. In March 1978, she suffered a transmission failure and the nail in her coffin was the deterioration of her turbine. The only solution to the latter problem was to replace the turbine, and the cost of that was prohibitive. The Coast Guard decided to decommission her due to [...] "the high cost of repairs {{and the fact that the}} CG feels sufficient information has been gained from the E.P. Period." [...] During this period of inoperability, she was located at the Coast Guard's aids to navigation station in Bristol, Rhode Island.|$|E
40|$|Hydrofoils {{have been}} applied to many {{different}} types of marine craft, including yachts. However, most of these have been for attempts at speed records or by inventors and, notably, the international Moth class, but so far not to modern racing yachts. They provide a number of advantages, and this project has investigated the feasibility of application to a modern canting-keel maxi yacht. The investigation began with drawing up a set of lines for a modern canting-keel maxi yacht. A resistance was then predicted, both with and without foils, using the Delft Systematic Yacht Series and a three-dimensional analysis of the <b>foil-borne</b> resistance. A towing rig was designed and constructed, and several models built and tested on open water and in a swimming pool to compare the resistance and performance, both with and without foils. Finally, a radio-controlled sailing model was constructed and tested, both with and without foils. The results showed a clear speed advantage for the foil-assisted maxi yacht. Just as with canting keels, fitting foils to an ocean-racing maxi will not be without its problems. However, the evidence is compelling, and it is considered {{only a matter of time}} before someone sets a precedent with a full-scale yacht, which others will follow...|$|E
