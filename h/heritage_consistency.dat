The book’s internal structure; functional structure; conceptual relationships; scope; knowledge antecedents; applications to theory, research, and practice; and areas for further development are discussed. In 1974, I created a course entitled “Culture and Health Care. ” It was predicated onmy ignorance and everything I did not learn in nursing school and life. It was founded on a promesa (promise) Imade to a class of studentswherein I was exposed to many differences in health beliefs and practices. I saw “me, the nurse ” through the eyes of the patient. It was not a positive image. In 1977, I was encouraged to write the first edition of my text, and in 1983, 1990, 1995, and 1999 I revised the bookCulturalDiversity inHealth and Illness. The purpose of the text is to increase the reader’s awareness of the dimensions and complexities involved in delivering nursing and health care to people fromdiverse cultural backgrounds. I developed the book to share my personal experiences and thoughts concerning the introduction of cultural concepts into the education of nurses, physicians, and other health-care professionals. The essential argument of the book is that the provider of health care (nurse, physician, social worker, etc.) has been socialized into a distinct “provider culture. ” This culture instills in its members its own norms regarding health and ill-ness beliefs and practices. When a member of the provider culture interacts with a person from a culture with differing health/illness norms, there may often be a conflict. PRESENTATION OF THEORIES AND MODELS The book is based on the weaving of three facets: <b>heritage</b> <b>consistency,</b> HEALTH 1 traditions, and cultural phenomena affecting health. <b>Heritage</b> <b>Consistency</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>consistency</b> is a theory developed by Estes and Zitzow (1980) to describe “the degree towhich one’s lifestyle reflects his or her respective tribal culture ” (p. 1). The theory has been expanded in an attempt to study the degree to which a person’s lifestyle reflects his or her traditional culture...|$|E

In some discrimination methods, M-distance limits of 10 – 15 for maximum variance have been reported for classifying samples but threshold values vary according to the type of sample and application [44]. Raising the M-distance limit should therefore be done with some caution. This research therefore demonstrates the complexity of translating a model developed in the laboratory to a real <b>heritage</b> setting. <b>Consistency</b> between the analysis procedure used for both model development and on-site work is paramount, including sample preparation, environmental conditions and instrument performance.|$|R
