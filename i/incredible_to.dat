I thought if it could be a single that it would be <b>incredible</b> <b>to</b> perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E

I am {{well aware that}} this may seem <b>incredible</b> <b>to</b> the reader, but nevertheless I insert it in my veracious work because it is true: This banner was woven of the cleanest and whitest silk and no picture of any figures was found on it. In case of war, however, a raven was always to be seen, {{as if it were}} woven into it. If the Danes were going to win the battle, the raven appeared, beak wide open, flapping its wings and restless on its feet. If {{they were going to be}} defeated, the raven did not stir at all, and its limbs hung motionless.|$|E
500|$|Schwab {{announced}} that pre-production {{for a new}} album began on June 6 followed by a month-long recording session in Steelman Studios in Van Nuys, CA. Matt McClellan and the band collaborated on production and Steve Evetts mixed the album. Dan Mumford is scheduled to do the artwork. The band has spent {{the middle of the}} year in Los Angeles recording 18 new tracks including an acoustic EP. With a career spanning nearly 20 years and selling over half a million records Andrew Schwab feels this album is a special landmark for P86. He says, [...] "We have loved pushing the envelope of evolution on every Project 86 release and this record is no exception. The inspiration behind this record is completely different and it's been <b>incredible</b> <b>to</b> write and record with such a talented group of guys.". Joining Schwab in the studio is Darren King (The Overseer) on guitar, Cody Driggers (The Wedding) on bass, and Ryan Wood (7 Horns 7 Eyes) on drums.|$|E
500|$|The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, {{other musicians}} and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the {{following}} evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal {{abuse of the}} work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote [...] "The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than {{the picture of the}} stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still <b>incredible</b> <b>to</b> me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end." [...] The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux [...] "at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor". The company presented the Rite during its London season a few weeks later. The Times reported that although there was [...] "something like a hostile reception" [...] at the first London performance, the final performance in the season [...] "was received with scarcely a sign of opposition". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.|$|E

500|$|... "A Different Kind of Love Song" [...] is a dance-pop song {{written and}} {{produced}} by Johan Aberg, while additional writing {{was done by}} Michelle Lewis, and Sigurd Rosnes. Anders Hansson co-produced the song. According to Michael Paoletta of Billboard, the track [...] "finds [...] not rocking the [...] "Believe" [...] boat too much: the chorus is soaring, the beats are foot-stomping, and the singer's vocals are gloriously affected." [...] Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly perceived that Cher's vocals are heavily processed due {{to the use of}} auto-tune. Lyrically, [...] "A Different Kind of Love Song" [...] alludes to themes of tragedy, heroism and , as noted by Rolling Stone journalist Barry Walters. The song was also treated with different remixes done by producers such as Rodney Jerkins. In an interview with MTV News, Jerkins expressed that he was flattered to be working with Cher. He further added, [...] "It's <b>incredible</b> <b>to</b> be able to work with a true diva. Cher said she just wanted me to do my thing, which was the most incredible thing in the world.

500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was <b>incredible</b> <b>to</b> see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1988, police closed an {{investigation}} into alleged jamming of the Cox campaign's phone lines by supporters of Rosenberg. [...] "For several weeks, about every third call we got {{was one of these}} bogus calls. You would hear a kind of whirring noise like a machine of some kind. ... It got so bad just before the election that we had to move our get-out-the vote operation to another office and use cellular phones in the field," [...] said Cox's campaign manager Bob Schuman. A representative of the police said that charges were not made because though the location of the jamming was traced, it could not be determined specifically which individuals were responsible. [...] "It's <b>incredible</b> <b>to</b> me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but I feel pretty strongly that we don't want to let them get away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't know anything about it. I don't want to speculate about who might have done this to Cox's phones, but I certainly don't condone it," [...] said Rosenberg. Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters. The residence belonged to a developer and his wife who had each made donations of $1,000 to Rosenberg's campaign for Congress.|$|E
