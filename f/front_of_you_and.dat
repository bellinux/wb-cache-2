500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E

In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're just looking at what's in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really looking forward to it — reuniting. The only note I gave them during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect."

I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{interesting}} moves in recent theorising on education is the distinction between knowledge and knowers, chased rigorously by Karl Maton in his latest book that is about to come out – Knowledge and knowers: towards a realist sociology of education (2012). Lying {{at the heart of the}} distinction is a recognition that specialisation works with both knowledge forms and identity. For most of us this seems obvious – you are always working with a real live student in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> – <b>and</b> your task is not only to induct her into specialised knowledge forms but to ensure that she develops professionally as a person. The two are tied together, specialised knowledge does not only have an effect on your cognitive capabilities and technical skills, it transforms your being. So why is the knower-knowledge distinction causing such a stir then? It’s done something perennial in the world of theorising; it has sutured a theoretical distinction that split the world in two unequal halves. Just before Bernstein died he brutally cleaved the world of knowledge specialisation in two with the distinction between hierarchical an...|$|R

The condition usually begins in childhood or adolescence and can impact greatly on education, career choices and social development. Objective This article describes the presentation, investigation and management options for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis. Discussion Clinical history and examination is often sufficient to make a diagnosis of palmoplantar hyperhidrosis.

2500|$|Also {{once again}} turning {{out for this}} tour was John Robb who again ecstatically {{reviewed}} the Manchester date of the tour (14 December 2011 at the HMV Ritz) for his Louder Than War website. [...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam...

These people are called 'Berbalangs', and the Cagayans live in great fear of them. These Berbalangs are a kind of ghouls, and feed on human flesh occasionally to survive. You can always identify them, because the pupils of their eyes are not round, but just narrow slits like those of a cat. They dig open the graves and eat the entrails of the corpses; but in Cagayan the supply is limited. So when they feel the craving for a feed of human flesh they go away into the grasslands, and, having carefully hidden themselves, hold their breaths and fall into a trance. Their astral bodies are then liberated.... They fly away, and entering a house make their way into the body of one of the occupants and feed on their entrails..... The arrival of the Berbalangs may be heard from afar, as they make a moaning noise which is loud from a distance but dies away into a feeble moan as they approach. When they are near <b>you</b> the sound <b>of</b> their wings may be heard and the flashing lights of their eyes can be seen like dancing fire-flies in the dark. Should you be the happy possessor of a cocoa-nut pearl you are safe, but otherwise the only way to beat them off is to jab at them with a kris, the blade of which has been rubbed with the juice of a lime. If you see the lights and hear the moaning in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> wheel fast <b>and</b> make a cut in the opposite direction.
