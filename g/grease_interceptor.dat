5000|$|Septage or {{septic tank}} sludge refers to the {{partially}} treated sludge stored in a septic tank. It is one type of fecal sludge. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater in a septic tank where it accumulates over time. Septage is pumped out of a septic tank or onsite sewage facility with a vacuum truck. The septic tanks can be residential or non-residential. Non-residential sources can include wastewater from commercial/industrial development, <b>grease</b> <b>interceptor</b> {{as well as other}} sources such as portable toilet, RV, and boat waste.|$|E
50|$|A {{grease trap}} (also known as <b>grease</b> <b>interceptor,</b> grease {{recovery}} device and grease converter) is a plumbing device (a type of trap) designed to intercept most greases and solids before they enter a wastewater disposal system. Common wastewater contains {{small amounts of}} oils which enter into septic tanks and treatment facilities to form a floating scum layer. This scum layer is very slowly digested and broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digestion process. Large amounts of oil from food preparation in restaurants can overwhelm a septic tank or treatment facility, causing release of untreated sewage into the environment. High-viscosity fats and cooking grease such as lard solidify when cooled, and can combine with other disposed solids to block drain pipes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second most}} common type of {{interceptor}} is the large in-ground tank, which is usually [...] These units are constructed of concrete, fiberglass, or steel. By nature of their larger size, they have larger grease and solid storage capacities for high-flow applications such as a restaurant or hospital store. They are commonly called gravity interceptors. Interceptors require a retention time of 30 minutes to allow the fats, oils, grease and food solids to settle in the tank. As more waste water enters the tank, the grease-free water is pushed out of the tank. The rotting brown grease inside a grease trap or <b>grease</b> <b>interceptor</b> must be pumped out on a scheduled basis. The brown grease is not recycled and goes to landfill. On average [...] of brown grease goes to landfill annually from each restaurant.|$|E

40|$|Fats, oil {{and grease}} (FOG) can be {{recovered}} efficiently from <b>grease</b> <b>interceptors</b> for biodiesel production. FOG is susceptible to hydrolysis because of its inherent high moisture content {{and the presence of}} lipases associated with food residuals in the <b>grease</b> <b>interceptors.</b> This study reveals that the FFA content of FOG derived from <b>grease</b> <b>interceptors</b> did not exceed 8 % (w/w) due to constant influx of fresh FOG from wastewater. However, if the FOG is allowed to hydrolyze without dilution, the FFA content can reach 15 % (w/w) in more than 20 Â days. Experiments were conducted to optimize reaction parameters for the esterification of FOG prior to the conventional alkali-catalyzed biodiesel production process. Sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) was a more efficient catalyst than Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 in reducing the acid value to [less-than-or-equals, slant] 1 Â mg KOH/g under identical reaction conditions. At reaction temperatures of [less-than-or-equals, slant] 50 Â Â°C, only H 2 SO 4 was capable of reaching the recommended acid value within 24 Â h. The optimum methanol to FFA ratio for an H 2 SO 4 -catalyzed reaction was 20 : 1, whereas for Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 it was above 26 : 1. Esterification occurred under static, non-mixed conditions, although conversion rates were low. The rate of conversion increased with mixing speed, with a 200 Â rpm orbital shaking speed as optimum.

40|$|South East Water Limited is a {{state-owned}} company providing {{water and sewerage services}} to 1. 3 million {{customers in the}} south east region of Melbourne. One of the key management issues for South East Water was the control of blockages and spills due to build-up of fats and grease in the sewer system. In 1995 it was estimated that approximately 30 % of sewer blockages were caused by fats and grease, and that 80 % of these fats came from commercial businesses (that is, restaurants, fast food outlets, etc.). In order to reduce sewer blockages, South East Water implemented a three phase Greasy Waste Program in late 1995. The first phase involved putting all commercial premises on Trade Waste Consents. Over 4, 100 such consents were issued. The second phase was to ensure all commercial customers had an appropriately sized <b>grease</b> <b>interceptor.</b> Over 1, 650 new grease interceptors were installed. The third and final phase was to ensure that all grease interceptors were pumped out regularly. South East Water developed and implemented its Wastelog system in consultation with the Victorian Waste Management Association to monitor and enforce pump-outs. By 2001, the Greasy Waste Program had contributed to a 50 % reduction in sewer blockages caused by fats...|$|E
40|$|Fat oil {{and grease}} (FOG) from food {{preparation}} can cause severeproblems if it is discharged to the municipal sewer network. A surveyamong Swedish and Norwegian municipalities has shown that nearlyall respondents experience FOG-related problems. The most commonproblem is FOG accumulation connected to the sewer pipes whichdecreases the pipe pipe capacity and may lead to sewer overflows. FOGaccumulation occurs especially at lift stations and depressions. FOGdeposits are often made up of saponised FOG. The fatty acids promotefurthermore corrosion of concrete pipes. FOG can even impact wastewater treatment and might cause severer working conditions. The aim for the water suppliers has thus {{to be an effective}} FOGsource control before FOG is discharged to the sewer network. Sourcesare both commercial establishments and residential sewer customers. In this report different source control measures are discussed. Greaseinterceptors are commonly used for commercial FOG sources. However,a number of them lack a <b>grease</b> <b>interceptor</b> and quite often operationand maintenance is deficient. An insufficient frequency ofemptying and a lack of supervision have been identified as a commonproblem. FOG collection systems for commercial FOG producers existin both Sweden and Norway. Collection systems for private householdsare currently in a test phase and experiences from among others Austriaare promising. Even the collected amount of FOG could presumablybe increased. Collected FOG and FOG slurry from interceptors is avaluable resource which can be used as raw material in the chemicalindustry or as an energy source (combustion, biodiesel, fermentation). Threshold values for FOG discharges are set up commonly by municipalities. However, even here supervision is often insufficient. Often, thethreshold values are inadequately low and a value of at least 150 mg/lis recommended. All those measures have to be supported by informationcampaigns which aim on both commercial and private customers.

50|$|In US {{metropolitan}} areas, {{the brown}} grease is taken by pumpers or grease-hauling trucks to wastewater treatment plants, {{where they are}} charged to dump it. In other areas, it may be taken to a landfill {{or it may be}} illegally dumped somewhere unknown, to avoid charges. This unmonitored disposal process is not only harmful for our environment and our health, but it also hurts businesses which have no idea where their business waste ends up, or indeed how much liquid waste is in their <b>grease</b> <b>interceptors</b> at any point in time, leaving them vulnerable to illegal dumping into their own <b>grease</b> traps or <b>interceptors.</b> Some companies now market computerized monitoring services along with in situ bioremediation, which produces byproducts of CO2 and gray water that can safely flow into sewer systems. Other new technologies offer ex situ treatment to process brown grease into some form of transportation fuel. This may not be as environmentally friendly as in situ treatment, since it still requires vehicles to pump and transport the brown grease waste to the plants.|$|R

Nationwide Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) control programs exist to address this problem, but the guidelines with respect to wastewater from dairy-based food service establishments (FSEs) are unclear, with no existing scientific investigation on potential separation of dairy products. The separation tendencies of wastewater originating from dairy-based FSEs were investigated, and significant separation of dairy constituents (Kjeldahl Nitrogen and fats) was observed under acidic conditions (pH 4 - 5. 4), with maximum separation at the isoelectric point of casein proteins (pH = 4. 6). Physical treatment at field-scale <b>grease</b> <b>interceptors</b> for dairy-based FSEs showed accumulation of dairy constituents, particularly fats, at pH 4. 4 - 5 caused by dairy products souring.
