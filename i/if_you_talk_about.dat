Trees that have been used and enjoyed by our people for generations are at risk. Some are dying out. Ferdinand Mushinge is the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. He encourages us to identify our favorites and to domesticate these wild trees by raising on our farms. A collection of fruit tree varieties ? and all their characteristics ? is a gene bank where the diversity is preserved. As he explained to Chris Kakunta, the trees on your land need to be nurtured just as tenderly as any other crop, or foreign, exotic trees. If not, then they will not thrive and the genetic treasure they hold could be lost forever. IN:	?We have been involved? OUT:	? they will have a regular harvest. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: The things you will need to get the best from your domesticated fruit trees were explained to Chris Kakunta by Ferdinand Mushinge, the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mushinge	We have been involved in indigenous fruit trees because some were being heavily harvested for firewood. So genetic erosion was slowly creeping in. Future generation might not have such fruits in the future. So far I can say so good, these trees can be domesticated. That is what is initially required is, farmers can set up what we call community seed banks. The seed can be collected, processed and then planted out in what we call small nurseries and then re-grown in strategic areas. But one thing you should know when you talk about domestication. The trees should be grown in their natural ecological sites. Kakunta	When you talk of ecological sites what exactly do you mean? Mushinge	What I am trying to say when I say ecological sites, tree species, can only establish properly, they only flower and fruit properly in particular geographical areas which are adapted to certain climatic conditions which are conducive for them to flower and fruit. Kakunta	If the farmers have to choose an indigenous tree which they can domesticate, what factors do they have to follow? Mushinge	The factors which farmers have to follow if they have to domesticate a particular indigenous fruit tree is one the climatic factor, two the rainfall pattern, three the species of that wild fruit tree. Soil conditions are also important. For example I will give you a very common fruit tree which is very vital in agriculture, you will find it commonly in the markets but unfortunately it is slowly phasing out, you find {{that a lot of the}} trees have been cut. The example I am talking about is Uapaca Kirkiana which is commonly known as masuku. Very nice, very tasty but can be successfully grown. Kakunta	Wonderful, so what about in terms of the period under which the farmer can grow the tree and be able to get the fruits, don?t you think it matters as well? Mushinge	That is a very important point. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> such trees like mango which is exotic, mango normally will flower and fruit after 3 to 4 years. And from there one aspect you have to consider is biennial bearing. Sometimes the fruit might not be too well because of maybe climatic factors, if the rainfall has not dropped very well the fruit might not flower and fruit very well. But a point in fact is if it is properly cultivated, that is such factors like proper fertilisation in fact even irrigate in terms of scarce rainfall periods you can even put in some water. As a matter of fact when you plant out these trees like the masuku you only need to establish it in the first year. In the next years or so you let nature run its course. Kakunta	Could you just tell us some steps towards cultivation of this particular tree? Mushinge	One, what is most important is tillage. For example the trees, when you plant them out in the field they have to be 4 by 4 metres apart. Two, they have to irrigated at least once per week. When I say irrigate them, irrigate them once per week with 15 to 20 litres of water, make sure that you apply some fertiliser, that is X or D compound and then you really should be applying it once per year as and when the need arises. Kakunta	Now in the absence of these chemical fertilisers would you recommend farmers to use manure for instance? Mushinge	That is a very good question. Manure behaves like fertiliser. The most important aspect one should consider is that it should properly decompose. Make sure that it decomposes properly but it is an excellent alternative to inorganic fertilisers. Kakunta	So once the farmer follows this procedure are they assured that these indigenous fruit trees can grow just like the exotic ones? Mushinge	When these plants follow out the proper agronomic procedures which I have stipulated after 3, 4 and 5 years depending on the species in question they will definitely have a continuous yield but a point in fact is management is very important. Exotic fruit trees need to be managed same as indigenous fruit trees, they can be domesticated, managed and they will have a regular harvest.

5000|$|Capon {{described}} {{himself in the}} introduction to one of his books as an “old-fashioned high churchman and a Thomist to boot.” One of Capon’s primary themes is the radical grace of God. Capon summarizes his broad view of salvation as follows: I am and I am not a universalist. I am one <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> what God in Christ has done to save the world. The Lamb of God has not taken away the sins of some — of only the good, or the cooperative, or the select few who can manage to get their act together and die as perfect peaches. He has taken away the sins of the world — of every last being in it — and he has dropped them down the black hole of Jesus’ death. On the cross, he has shut up forever on the subject of guilt: [...] "There is therefore now no condemnation[...] [...] [...]" [...] All human beings, at all times and places, are home free whether they know it or not, feel it or not, believe it or not.But I am not a universalist <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> what people may do about accepting that happy-go-lucky gift of God’s grace. I take with utter seriousness everything that Jesus had to say about hell, including the eternal torment that such a foolish non-acceptance of his already-given acceptance must entail. All theologians who hold Scripture to be the Word of God must inevitably include in their work a tractate on hell. But I will not — because Jesus did not — locate hell outside the realm of grace. Grace is forever sovereign, even in Jesus' parables of judgment. No one is ever kicked {{out at the end of}} those parables who wasn’t included in at the beginning.|$|R
