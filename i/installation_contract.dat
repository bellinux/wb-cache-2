40|$|Model {{computations}} {{that give}} the lay-out of a lighting installation have to be implemented in the real world. There, deviations from the ideal performance of just about every element of the installation will be felt.

It is clear that with all possible deviations from the ideal the homogeneity of a real lighting installation can never {{be as good as}} the one computed. The only way to make sure it is nearly as good is by measurement of the actual light distribution. Then, an occasional adjustment or replacement may often yield a satisfactory result.

40|$|Landscape {{and related}} {{environmental}} works are discussed {{as an integral}} and essential aspect of most land development projects, whether they are building or civil works, environmental protection, rehabilitation or landscape beautification. Problematic contractual issues that regularly arise in landscape contracting {{from the use of}} standard forms of construction contracts for pre-main contract, in-main contract and post-main contract landscape work are identified and discussed. These forms of contracts have essentially been written for traditional building and engineering works and are shown to be inadequately addressing the unique contractual aspects relating to landscaping works. The study focuses on the issues to be addressed in a contract between an employer and a landscape contractor for work to be undertaken before the main construction contractor has been appointed and on landscape subcontract work undertaken during the construction under the main contract. It addresses the problems surrounding the contractual practical termination of the landscape subcontract, the defects liability period and interim landscape maintenance as well as landscape maintenance work after the landscape installation has reached final completion. The study points towards an appropriate form of contract for use in conjunction with the JBCC contract system to provide for the particular requirements of landscape contracting. It indicates the necessary compatibility between landscape subcontractual requirements and the JBCC Nominated/Selected Subcontract Agreement. This required compatibility warrants a revision of or an addendum to the JBCC document. The requirements for a landscape maintenance contract, for use after termination of the landscape installation (sub) contract, are shown to be sufficiently different from the <b>installation</b> <b>contract</b> to warrant changes or addenda to the standard construction contract form. From a review of literature on the landscape contractual environment in South Africa and a study of contracts commonly used in South Africa, pertinent landscape contractual issues are identified for the three phases in which landscape and related environmental works are performed, i. e. before the main construction contract, during the main construction contract and during the landscape maintenance period after completion of the main contract. These issues are formalised and tested for validity and relevance by means of a survey conducted amongst developers and owners of building and engineering works, contractors and professional consultants. The research is summarised, findings and conclusions {{for each of the three}} landscape works phases are presented and recommendations made to address the confirmed contractual problematic issues. The survey confirms the JBCC suite of contracts as the most widely used for landscaping contracts in South Africa and the recommendations therefore focus thereon. The study concludes with a proposal for an addendum to the JBCC’s Nominated/Selected Subcontract Agreement entitled “General and specific conditions of subcontract for landscape and related works” and recommendations for further study of related issues identified in the survey but which fall outside the focus of this study.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedContracting {{continues to play}} an important role in the Department of Defense (DoD) as a means to acquire a wide array of systems, supplies, and services. More than half of DoDs budget is spent through contracts. With these large dollars spent comes the possibility of fraud in contracting that can subvert the process causing waste and possibly impeding mission accomplishment. The purpose of this research was to analyze DoDs contracting workforces level of fraud knowledge, according to the six phases of contract management, five internal control components, and six procurement fraud scheme categories. This was done through the deployment of a survey consisting of fraud knowledge and organizational perception questions. The survey was completed by contracting personnel at the U. S.

The results displayed differences in fraud awareness and perception among the different contracting phases, internal control components, and procurement fraud scheme categories.

Unanticipated hiring freezes impose considerable constraints on organizations and their employees by hindering {{the ability to}} find or cultivate talent to fulfill shifting demands. This study focuses on hiring freezes and how they affect organizations in the Department of Defense (DoD), specifically the Army Missions and <b>Installation</b> <b>Contracting</b> Command (MICC). This paper discusses potential consequences {{and the effects of}} hiring freezes on the MICC. In order to observe these effects, data were gathered from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) to perform a statistical analysis on employees and their changes in labor market outcomes. The elements studied included attrition, promotion, and productivity during periods when a DoD hiring freeze was in effect and periods when organizations were permitted to fill vacant staff positions. Additionally, an online survey was conducted to gauge the MICC employees' current perceptions of their working environment. Overall, the findings suggest that hiring freeze periods had an effect on the MICC, and the factors that contributed to voluntary turnover at the MICC were poor command climate, job burnout, and low levels of job satisfaction.

40|$|When a {{contractor}} expends {{a great deal}} of time and expense to prepare a proposal in response to a high-dollar Government Request for Proposals and award of the resultant contract is made to another contractor, the unsuccessful offeror will often protest since the post-award debriefing does not satisfy his concerns as to why his was not the best offer. This thesis reviews the current written guidance pertaining to post-award debriefings, looks at the current installation level debriefing process and recommends ways to improve debriefings. Results of a questionnaire sent to <b>installation</b> <b>contracting</b> officers and offerors who contract with them indicate: the current debriefing process is not working as well as it should; the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) should help improve the debrief; and further improvements are possible. Some of the thesis' recommendations are: make the post-award debrief an integral part of the process for key technical personnel; give weaknesses, in writing, to the unsuccessful offerors with notification of award; if requested, release all information that the contractor would receive under protest discovery procedures; provide analytical training for contracting officers; use videos and other types of training on "how not to" and "how to" conduct a post-award debriefing.

The Army faces issues and challenges throughout the acquisition process, particularly in the contracting career field. Assessing any contracting knowledge gap {{can be a challenge}} because of the sheer magnitude of the required knowledge involved in Department of Defense contract management. To capture the data needed to measure and analyze tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge, a knowledge assessment tool was used. Following the distribution of the assessment tool, an analysis of the knowledge gap was performed on multiple demographic categories. This information enables organizations to develop an on the job training task management guide that will not only train contracting personnel in all of the contracting phases but also focus in on the knowledge gaps identified within the research. Furthermore, there will be an increased visibility for supervisors and contracting officers to provide the feedback necessary through supplemental training to ensure the readiness of the contracting specialists within the 1102 career field.
