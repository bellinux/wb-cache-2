2500|$|The {{manner in}} which the trial was {{conducted}} was widely criticised inside and outside Romania. However, Ion Iliescu, Romania's provisional president, said in 2009 that the trial was [...] "quite shameful, but necessary" [...] in order to end the state of near-anarchy that had gripped the country in the three days since the Ceaușescus fled Bucharest. [...] Similarly, Victor Stănculescu, who had been defense minister before going over to the revolution, said in 2009 that the alternative would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> the Ceaușescus lynched on the streets of Bucharest.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, core black {{characters}} were introduced with the Barber and Winters families. Victoria Rowell (Drucilla Barber) and Tonya Lee Williams (Dr. Olivia Barber) were {{cast as the}} nieces of the Abbott's maid, Mamie Johnson, in 1990. The brothers Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla. The Young and the Restless became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters. [...] "I play a CEO at a major corporation, that's something we don't see that often," [...] St. John said. [...] "And the show doesn't use the old African-American stereotypes that we <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> on TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer. We {{have come a long}} way." [...] Though the characters held prominent positions in the fictional work place of Genoa City, they had little interaction with other characters outside of their jobs.|$|E

In the end, Superboy-Prime is pulled into the core of a red sun by both Superman of Earth-Two and Superman (Kal-El) of the main DC Universe.
