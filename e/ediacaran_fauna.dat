The formation is of particular interest because a part of it appears to cover the boundary between the enigmatic organisms of the Ediacaran geological period and the more familiar fauna of the Cambrian explosion where lifeforms recognizable as ancestors of later and recent lifeforms first emerged.Taken as a whole, the Doushantuo Formation ranges from about 635 Ma (million years ago) at its base to about 551 Ma at its top, predating by perhaps five Ma the earliest of the 'classical' <b>Ediacaran</b> <b>faunas</b> from Mistaken Point on the Avalon peninsula of Newfoundland, and recording conditions up to a good forty to fifty million years before the Cambrian explosion.|$|R
40|$|Geological {{evidence}} suggests that Gaia is endothermic: her body temperature has varied, but within limits; {{there has been no}} runaway greenhouse like Venus, nor deep freeze like Mars. This paper presents a hypothesis that the Earth's climate has been ameliorated by living organisms: they have served either as heaters or air-conditioners, and their ecological tolerance is the sensor of Gaia's thermostat. At the beginning, 3. 8 or 3. 5 Ga ago, only anaerobic autotrophs capable of tolerating high temperatures thinned out the atmospheric CO 2 through carbon fixation. Fossil organic carbon was utilized by anaerobic heterotrophs to reinforce the effectiveness of the late Archean greenhouse, when solar luminosity was weaker than it is now. With the increasing solar luminosity during early Proterozoic time, new life forms such as cyanobacteria evolved, removing CO 2 from the atmosphere and storing it in stromatolitic carbonates. Over-eager cyanobacteria may have consumed too much greenhouse CO 2 to cause glaciation. Their decline coincided in timing with the rise of the <b>Ediacaran</b> <b>faunas</b> which had no carbonate skeletons. The change in the mode of carbon-cycling may have started the warming trend after the Proterozoic glaciation. The Cambrian explosion was an event when skeletal eukaryotes usurped the function of prokaryotes in removing greenhouse CO 2 through CaCO 3 precipitation. With the evolution of land plants, coal-makers took over the ‘air-conditioning' duty. They over-did it, and Permo-Carboniferous glaciation ensued. After a wholesale turnover of the faunas and floras {{at the end of the}} Palaeozoic, more CO 2 was released than fixed in early Mesozoic time. The warming trend reached its zenith in the early Cretaceous, when flowering trees and calcareous plankton began to flourish. The decline since then, with a temporary restoration during early Palaeogene time, could be a manifestation of the varying efficiency of extracting and burying carbon dioxide, in the form of inorganic and organic carbon. The relation of atmospheric CO 2 and climatic variation is documented by study of air bubbles in ice cores. Yet there is also correlation to astronomical cycles. The latter seem to have triggered changes which are amplified by feedback mechanisms of carbon cyclin...|$|R
40|$|The Earth is a {{self-organizing}} system liking a living organism. Lovelock proposed Gaia {{as a metaphor}} to designate the check and balance ofterrestrial temperatures: the Earth is never too hot so that the ocean could boil, and the Earth is never too cold that the ocean could freeze from top to bottom. Hsü proposed that Gaia is endothermic because the life on Earth has been alternate successions of air-conditioners and heaters which evolved and deactivate or reinforce the terrestial greenhouse of carbon dioxide in atmosphere. When Earth was heating up too much, the air-conditioneers, such as anaerobic bacteria, cyanobacteria, skeletal organisms and trees, and finally calcareous plankton, went to work to bring the terrestrial temperature down. When the Earth was freezing at times of continental glaciation, heaters went to work, such as methanogenic bacteria, <b>Ediacaran</b> <b>faunas,</b> tundra and desert plants, and now Homo sapiens. Gaia has to have other organs to keep the {{self-organizing system}} vital. This paper presents a postulate that the Miocene Mediterranean Sea acted as Gaia´s kidney. The steady influx of dissolved ions and debris into the ocean causes inevitable increase of ocean´s salinity. The fossil and geochemicl records indicate that the ocean has never been too saline nor too brackish {{for the survival of}} normal marine organisms: the salinity ranged from about 32 to 36 pro mil during the last billion years. Ocean-drilling cruises to the Mediterranean discovered a very large salt formation, deposited during some 5 million years ago when the Mediterranean dried up. A study of the geochemical balance of the oceans indicates that the deposition of very large salt bodies in isolated basins such as the Miocene Mediterranean every 100 million years or so. The saline giants have the function of Gaia´s kidney. With periodical removals of the salt ions and the heavy metals from seawater, the world´s ocean have been rendered forever habitable. Gaia has to have a kidney. The desiccation of the Mediterranean is the evidence of a functioning kidney.

The main difficulty arises because of the low resolution of Vendian chronostratigraphy when {{compared with that of}} the Phanerozoic. For the Vendian, interregional and especially global stratigraphic correlations can be made only to an accuracy not exceeding tens of millions of years. In two to three of the best studied sequences, the Vendian has been divided into five widely correlative units on the basis of ichno- and microfossil complexes, <b>Ediacaran</b> metazoan <b>faunas,</b> radiometric dates and stable isotope signatures, and glacial horizons (Knoll, 2000; Walter, et al., 2000). Six stratigraphic levels have been identified in White Sea sequences of the Middle Vendian based on metazoan faunal assemblages (Fedonkin, 2003). In the great majority of other Vendian sequences, the set of stratigraphic data is insufficient to subdivide and especially to globally correlate regional units.

40|$|Part I: Stratigraphic {{constraints}} {{on the number of}} discrete neoproterozoic glaciations and the relationship between glaciation and ediacaran evolution. Stratigraphic and structural observations in the Death Valley region provide new insights into two topical problems. First, stratigraphic observations provide {{a better understanding of the}} number of discrete Neoproterozoic glaciations and the relationship between glaciation and the diversification of the first animals. Detailed stratigraphic investigations reveal incised valleys within the Neoproterozoic Johnnie Formation. The size (> 150 m) and regional extent of the valleys, and the carbon isotope signature of underlying carbonates show that the valleys are probably glacioeustatic in origin. The incised valleys help to complete the Neoproterozoic glacial record in the western United States. The incised valleys and a pair of glacial diamictites in the underlying Kingston Peak Formation represent two to three discrete Neoproterozoic glaciations. This record of two to three glaciations matches the global Neoproterozoic glacial record. The incised valleys provide the youngest evidence for large-scale Neoproterozoic glaciation in the western United States. Correlation of the Johnnie valleys with incised valleys in the uppermost Caddy Canyon Formation of Idaho and Utah shows that this glaciation occurred before 580 Ma. These findings suggest that diverse <b>Ediacaran</b> <b>faunas</b> post-date the youngest major Neoproterozoic glaciation by tens of millions of years. Second, structural and stratigraphic observations provide new {{constraints on}} the magnitude of extension in the Death Valley extended domain. These observations reveal a thrust fault in the northwestern Spring Mountains, NV. Correlation of this thrust fault with thrusts in other ranges constrains the translation of those ranges relative to the Spring Mountains. While these correlations are not unique, the most plausible correlations require large-magnitude extension in the Death Valley area and north of Las Vegas Valley. Correlation of contractile structures in the northwestern Spring Mountains and Specter Range with Permo-Triassic structures in the Cottonwood Mountains may provide a link between the Permo-Triassic thrust belt in the Cottonwood Mountains and the Central Nevada thrust belt. The Central Nevada thrust belt may be at least in part Permo-Triassic in age, and may represent a foreland fold and thrust belt which developed inboard of the Golconda allochthon during its emplacement. Part II: The Kwichup Spring thrust in the northwestern Spring Mountains, Nevada : implications for large-magitude extension and the structure of the Cordilleran thrust belt. Approximately 170 km(2) of new mapping in the northwestern Spring Mountains reveals contractile structures related to a regional thrust fault called the Kwichup Spring thrust. The Kwichup Spring thrust involves at least 1. 4 km of stragraphic throw. Along much of its length, the Kwichup Spring thrust has been reactivated or excised by a normal fault. Stratigraphic and structural evidence suggest that the Kwichup Spring thrust correlates with the Montgomery thrust in the Montgomery Mountains. Correlation of these two thrusts requres a reappraisal of the geometry of the Cordilleran thrust belt in Nevada and southeastern California. The Kwichup Spring - Montgomery thrust probably correlates with either the Clery thrust in the Funeral Mountains or the Panamint thrust in the Panamint Mountains. Both possible correlations require large (> 115 km) west-northwest translation of the Panamint and Cottonwood Mountains with respect to the Spring Mountains during Neogene extension. Before this large-scale translation, the Panamint and Cottonwood Mountains were positioned along the southern projection of the Central Nevada thrust belt of Taylor and others (1993). Since contractile structures in the Cottonwood Mountains are Permo-Triassic, the Central Nevada thrust belt may be at least in part Permo-Triassic. ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of ultrastructural, {{biochemical}} and genetic studies, bacteria and blue green algae (Kingdom Monera, all prokaryotes) differ unambiguously from the eukaryotic organisms (Fungi, plants sensu stricto) and protists or protoctists, (Copeland, 1956). The gap between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is recognized as the most profound evolutionary discontinuity in the living world. This gap {{is reflected in the}} fossil record. Fossil remains of Archaean and Proterozoic Aeons primarily consist of prokaryotes and the Phanerozoic is overwhelmingly characterized by fossils of the megascopic eukaryotic groups, both metazoa and metaphyta. Based on the morphological interpretation of microscopic objects structurally preserved in Precambrian cherts, the time of appearance of remains of eukaryotic organisms in the fossil record has been claimed to be as early as 2. 7 · 109 years ago, (Kaźmierczak, 1976). Others suggest chronologies varying between 1. 7 to 1. 3 · 109 (Schopf et al., 1973) or a time approaching 1. 3 · 109 years (Cloud, 1974). There is general agreement that many of the <b>Ediacaran</b> <b>faunas,</b> which have been dated at about 680 m. y. are fossils of megascopic soft-bodied invertebrate animals. Since all invertebrates are eukaryotic, the ca. 680 m. y. date for deposition of these animal assemblages may represent the earliest appearance of eukaryotic organisms. But the question remains as to whether there is definitive evidence for eukaryotic cells before this “benchmark” of the late Precambrian. An excellent discussion of this particular problem as especially relating to acritarchs extending from rocks of Upper Riphean through Vendian and into the basal Cambrian is presented in recent studies by Vidal (1974, 1976) in Late Precambrian microfossils from the Visingsö rocks of southern Sweden. Previous work on the laboratory silicification of wood and algal mat communities (Leo and Barghoorn, 1976) suggested that further analysis of “artificial fossils” might be of aid in the interpretation of fossil morphology toward the ultimate solution of this problem. Thus the procedure developed by one of us (ESB) for laboratory wood silicification was adapted to various smaller objects. By successive immersions of wet cellular aggregates, colonies of various organisms and abiotic organic microspheres in tetraethyl orthosilicate, silicified cells and structures are produced which bear an interesting resemblance to ancient chert-embedded microfossils. Our observation of these microorganisms and proteinoid microspheres silicified in the laboratory as well as of degrading microorganisms, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, have led us to conclude that many, if not all, of the criteria for assessing fossil eukaryotic microorganisms are subject to serious criticism in interpretation. We studied a large variety of prokaryotic algae, some eukaryotic algae, fungi, protozoa, and abiotic organic microspheres stable at essentially neutral pH. In some cases, degradation and/or silicification systematically altered both size and appearances of microorganisms. By the use of monoalgal cultures of blue-green algae, features resembling nuclei, chloroplasts, tetrads, pyrenoids, and large cell size may be simulated. In many cases individual members of these cultures show so much variation that they may be mistaken as belonging to more than one species. The size ranges for silicified prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae overlap. Several prokaryotes routinely yielded spherical or filamentous structures that resembled large cells. Because of genuine large sizes (e. g., Prochloron), shrinkage, systematic alteration or congregation of unicells to form other structures we find sizes to be of very limited use in determining whether an organism of simple morphology was prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Although some “prebiotic proteinoid microspheres” (of Fox and Harada, 1960) are impossible to silicify with our laboratory methods, those stable at neutral pH (Hsu and Fox, 1976) formed spherical objects that morphologically resemble silicified algae or fungal spores. Many had internal structure. We conclude that even careful morphometric studies of fossil microorganisms are subject to many sources of misinterpretation. Even though it is a logical deduction that eukaryotic microorganisms evolved before Ediacaran time there is no compelling evidence for fossil eukaryotes prior to the late Precambrian metazoans...|$|R

It is accepted that sponges, ctenophorans, cnidarians, placozoans, and bilaterians were members of the <b>Ediacaran</b> <b>fauna,</b> many of which have uncertain affinities. The fossil Sabellidites cambriensis Yanishevsky, 1926, derived from the terminal Ediacaran strata, is the earliest known organically preserved animal that belonged to a newly evolving fauna, which replaced the Ediacara-type metazoans. Morphologically simple soft-bodied tubular fossils, such as S. cambriensis, and biomineralized, as contemporaneous Sinotubulites sp., are not easy to recognize phylogenetically because many unrelated organisms developed encasing tubes independently. Therefore, in addition to morphologic information, evidence derived from the microstructure of the organic wall and its biochemistry may be vital to resolving fossil origins and phylogenetic relationships. Here we present morphological, microstructural and biogeochemical studies on S. cambriensis using various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, which provide new evidence that supports its siboglinid, annelidan affinity. The late Ediacaran age of Sabellidites fossil constrains the minimum age of siboglinids and the timing of the divergence of including them annelids by fossil record and this could be tested using molecular clock estimates.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in science lies in disentangling causality in complex, coupled systems. This is illustrated no better than in the dynamic interplay between the Earth and life. The early evolution and diversification of animals occurred within a backdrop of global change, yet reconstructing the potential role of the environment in this evolutionary transition is challenging. In the 200 million years from the end-Cryogenian to the Ordovician, enigmatic <b>Ediacaran</b> <b>fauna</b> explored body plans, animals diversified and began to biomineralize, forever changing the ocean's chemical cycles, and the biological community in shallow marine ecosystems transitioned from a microbial one to an animal one. In the following dissertation, a multi-faceted approach combining macro- and micro-scale analyses is presented that draws on the sedimentology, geochemistry and paleontology of the rocks that span this transition to better constrain the potential environmental changes during this interval. In Chapter 1, the potential of clumped isotope thermometry in deep time is explored by assessing the importance of burial and diagenesis on the thermometer. Eocene- to Precambrian-aged carbonates from the Sultanate of Oman were analyzed from current burial depths of 350 - 5850 meters. Two end-member styles of diagenesis independent of burial depth were observed. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 explore the fallibility of the Ediacaran carbon isotope record and aspects of the sedimentology and geochemistry of the rocks preserving the largest negative carbon isotope excursion on record [...] -the Shuram Excursion. Chapter 2 documents the importance of temperature, fluid composition and mineralogy on the delta 18 -O min record and interrogates the bulk trace metal signal. Chapter 3 explores the spatial variability in delta 13 -C recorded in the transgressive Johnnie Oolite and finds a north-to-south trend recording the onset of the excursion. Chapter 4 investigates the nature of seafloor precipitation during this excursion and more broadly. We document the potential importance of microbial respiratory reactions on the carbonate chemistry of the sediment-water interface through time. Chapter 5 investigates the latest Precambrian sedimentary record in carbonates from the Sultanate of Oman, including how delta 13 -C and delta 34 -S CAS vary across depositional and depth gradients. A new model for the correlation of the Buah and Ara formations across Oman is presented. Isotopic results indicate delta 13 -C varies with relative eustatic change and delta 34 -S CAS may vary in absolute magnitude across Oman. Chapter 6 investigates the secular rise in delta 18 -Omin in the early Paleozoic by using clumped isotope geochemistry on calcitic and phosphatic fossils from the Cambrian and Ordovician. Results do not indicate extreme delta 18 -O seawater depletion and instead suggest warmer equatorial temperatures across the early Paleozoic. ...|$|E
