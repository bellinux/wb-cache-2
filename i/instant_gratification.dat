5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of <b>instant</b> <b>gratification</b> over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E

40|$|Since the term, ‘Digital Native’ {{has been}} coined; {{a plethora of}} {{research}} has followed. But, researchers have yet to reach a consensus on what the real digital native is like. There are several traits of digital native; such as their age who has born in or after 1980 and technology skills. The notion of age as a defining criterion for digital nativity has come under criticisms in recent years. Some studies found that, despite being born at the time period proposed for digital natives, students were ill- prepared to work with technology. This paper focuses four attributes of digital nativity which alluded to digital natives. These are: grow up with technology, comfortable with multitasking, reliant on graphics for communication, and thrive on <b>instant</b> <b>gratifications</b> and rewards. From the growing volume of research on digital nativity, several implications for teaching and learning could be drawn. Future teachers should be equipped to teach and learn with technologies at their training stage.

25|$|Instead, {{scholars}} like Fish {{suggest that the}} humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge).

In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and the public realm in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists, is the foundation for modern democracy.|$|E
25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for You, {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide <b>instant</b> <b>gratification,</b> games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E

500|$|Sigmund Freud {{viewed the}} {{struggle}} to delay gratification as a person's efforts to overcome the instinctive, libidinal drive of the id. According to classic psychoanalytic theory, a person's psyche is composed of the id, ego and superego. The id {{is driven by the}} pleasure principle: it wants physical pleasure, and it wants it now. The ego, operating under the reality principle, serves to moderate the id's desire for <b>instant</b> <b>gratification</b> against the superego, which is guided by a person's internalized sense of morality. According to psychoanalytic theory, a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by intrapsychic conflict – the ego cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego – and experiences psychological distress, often in the form of anxiety or [...] "neurosis".|$|E

40|$|We {{live in an}} age of <b>instant</b> {{information}} <b>gratification,</b> where {{increasingly the}} public in Africa views access to information as a key to their ability to understand and make the right decision. But as has been pointed out repeatedly, {{there is no guarantee that}} the quality of information is sufficient in theory or practice to guide decision making, and that the data as presented can be understood without establishing any context to it. Quite often, planning without facts is common; poor decision is familiar because the people who have to make it are ill informed or unaware of who holds the information or how to get hold of it. Even if they have identified what they want, the information cannot be cross- referenced and combined because the data does not use common references for geographical or administrative areas. The need to provide the Geographic Information System (GIS) community with fast, reliable, and up-to-date information has become a challenge for all geoinformation producers and users in Africa. These emphasize the need for geospatial data infrastructure (GDI) in Africa. Developing a proper metadata is the cornerstone of any GDI.

Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|R

The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued.
