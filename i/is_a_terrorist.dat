Other measures include reinforced cockpit doors and an air marshal on every flight.|$|E

500|$|The comrades {{eventually}} {{decide to}} act on their own, calling themselves [...] "Freeborn British Communists". They start experimenting with explosives and build a car bomb. Alice does not fully support this action, but accepts the majority decision. They target an upmarket hotel in Knightsbridge, but their inexperience results in the premature detonation of the bomb, which kills Faye and several passers-by. The remaining comrades, shaken by what they have done, decide to leave the squat and split up. Alice, disillusioned by Jasper, chooses not to follow him and remains behind because she cannot bear to abandon the house into which she has poured so much effort. Despite her initial reservations about the bombing, Alice feels a need to justify their actions to others, but realises it would be fruitless because [...] "rdinary people simply didn't understand". She acknowledges that she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrorist</b> now, though she cannot remember when the change happened.|$|E
500|$|John D. F. Black's {{original}} pitch {{featured a}} story about capital punishment. His idea {{was based on a}} film treatment detailing the colony planet of Llarof where capital punishment is handed down as a sentence for any offense except against those who are immune from the law. In the treatment, a security officer is killed by a local law enforcement officer, who is then killed himself by his partner for unjustly killing the Enterprise crewman. The planet would have had a rebel faction who wanted to overthrow the laws, which Picard refused to back initially whilst citing the Prime Directive. A second draft featured a rebel leader executed for treason. Black explained the premise of a society that developed laws to prevent terrorism and chaos: [...] "Let's say that what we do is kill everybody who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrorist</b> or suspected of being a terrorist. Now the people who have killed everybody, what do they do?" ...|$|E

500|$|Several global {{events of}} the early 2010s {{included}} the rise of hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec; large scale protest movements, including the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, and Quebec student protests; the crypto-anarchist activity {{on the part of}} Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson; and the various information leaks to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning, the Stratfor email leak by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond, and the global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden. The rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that Anarky's relevance as a character had dramatically increased, and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media. This sentiment led the creative team that developed Batman: Arkham Origins to include Anarky in the game. Describing Anarky's anti-government and anti-corporate agenda, Holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement. Holmes stressed in one interview, [...] "In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today." [...] Even as early as 2005, James Peaty recommended that Anarky should be included in more publications {{in the midst of the}} ongoing War on Terror, stating [...] "Anarky <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrorist!</b> How can that not be interesting in the modern climate?" ...|$|E
