5|$|Network {{forensics}} {{is concerned}} with the monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic, both local and WAN/internet, for the purposes of information <b>gathering,</b> <b>evidence</b> collection, or intrusion detection. Traffic is usually intercepted at the packet level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile and rarely logged, making the discipline often reactionary.|$|E

40|$|This book portrays <b>evidence</b> and <b>gathering</b> of <b>evidence</b> {{under the}} current Croatian {{regulation}} relating to evidence and in practice. In this context, the author first analyses the fundamental principles of Croatian civil procedure and law of evidence. Then, the general principles of <b>evidence</b> and <b>gathering</b> of <b>evidence</b> are discussed, {{as well as the}} general rule on the burden of proof. The question of <b>gathering</b> of <b>evidence</b> through modern technology (videoconferencing, etc.) in the Croatian law and practice is also discussed. Separate parts of this book contain the analysis of means of proof regulated by the Croatian Civil Procedure Act: inspection of object ('view'), documents, witness testimony, expert testimony, and party testimony. The rules on costs caused by <b>gathering</b> of <b>evidence,</b> including the costs for translation are analysed, as well as the rules on language. The concepts of illegally obtained evidence and illegal evidence in the Croatian law and practice are discussed. This volume contains the report about the Council Regulation (EC) No 1206 / 2001 and the multilateral and bilateral legal assistance treaties to which Croatia is a party. There are several appendices to this book: a table of authorities according to the Regulation No 1206 / 2001, and relevant sources of Croatian civil procedure, table of case law on evidence, table portraying a ordinary/common civil procedure timeline, table referring to legal interpretation in the Croatian legal system, and comparative tables focusing on functional differences between national regulation, bilateral legal assistance treaties, multilateral treaties, and Council Regulation (EC) No 1206 / 2001 on taking of evidence by hearing of witnesses.

25|$|Meanwhile, Dutch embassy diplomat Herman Knippenberg was {{investigating}} {{the murders of}} Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly even met Sobhraj, although the latter's true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued <b>gathering</b> <b>evidence.</b> With {{the help of a}} neighbour of Sobhraj, Knippenberg built a case against him. Knippenberg was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj's apartment, a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims' documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes. The trio's next stop was Malaysia, where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the last time he was ever seen, and neither Chowdhury nor his remains were ever found. It is believed that Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving Malaysia to continue his and Leclerc's roles as gem salesmen in Geneva. A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in Germany, the claim appeared unsubstantiated. The search for Chowdhury continues.|$|E

25|$|Wild Cat Exchanged for Crown Prince (狸貓換太子): Bao Zheng {{met a woman}} {{claiming}} to be {{the mother of the}} reigning Emperor Renzong. Dozens of years prior, she had been Consort Li, an imperial concubine of Emperor Zhenzong's, before falling out of favour for supposedly giving birth to a bloody dead wild cat. In reality, the jealous Consort Liu had plotted with eunuch Guo Huai (郭槐) to secretly swap Li's infant with a skinned wildcat minutes after the birth and ordered palace maid Kou Zhu to kill the baby. However, Kou gave the baby to chief eunuch Chen Lin (陳琳), who secretly brought the child to the Eighth Prince, a younger brother of Emperor Zhenzong. Kou was later tortured to death by Guo when Consort Liu began to suspect that the infant had survived. The child was raised by the Eighth Prince as his own son and was subsequently selected to succeed Emperor Zhenzong, who had died heirless. Due to the passage of time, <b>gathering</b> <b>evidence</b> was a challenge. With the help of a woman dressed as Kou's ghost, Bao dressed himself as Yama, lord of Hell, to play on both Guo's fear of the supernatural and guilt, thereby extracting his confession. When the verdict was out, the emperor was reluctant to accept Consort Li. Bao then admonished the emperor and ordered that he be beaten for lack of filial piety. The emperor's Dragon Robe was beaten instead. Emperor Renzong eventually accepted his mother and elevated her as the new empress dowager.|$|E
500|$|This hostility {{suggests}} that the series' problems are [...] "not epistemological; they are political"—the agents, Scully in particular, have to balance a search for [...] "the truth" [...] {{with the need to}} secure criminal convictions in their cases. This balancing act [...] "between investigating to discover the truth and <b>gathering</b> <b>evidence</b> to support a court case" [...] has been compared to the perceived stance of the FBI during the series' tenure. The bureau had at this time seen itself as a law enforcement agency responsible for amassing evidence to prosecute criminal cases. There is a disparity between this approach and public perception of the FBI's role as an organization investigating an objective and apolitical truth; this led to public frustration [...] "because [...] incorrectly believe that a courtroom is designed to discover the truth".|$|E
