25|$|Henry's {{record of}} urging unity {{made him a}} {{potential}} supporter of a closer bond between the states, and {{as late as the}} end of 1786, Madison hoped for Henry as an ally in the fight. A number of factors had eroded Henry's trust in the Northern states, including what he deemed Congress's failure to send adequate troops to protect Virginia settlers in the Ohio River Valley. Henry was outraged by the Jay–Gardoqui Treaty, which would have ceded exclusive navigation on the Mississippi River to Spain for 25 years. This was in exchange for commercial concessions that would benefit New England, where there was a growing separatist movement. Northern votes were sufficient to relax Jay's negotiating instructions, which had originally forbidden restricting American navigation on the Mississippi, to allow him to reach a deal; Southern votes were sufficient to block the treaty's ratification. These events caused Henry and some other Virginia leaders to <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed,</b> and to have little trust in the good faith of the North.|$|E

25|$|In September 2008, the Swedish media {{reported}} that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed. The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate {{on the condition that}} the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed</b> by SVT. This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.|$|E
25|$|With the Vril {{generator}} and the meteorite piece, Richtofen {{now believes}} he can control the zombies, and returns to Griffin Station. Here, they attempt to activate the MPD, a machine that controls the Aether energy, which opens to reveal Samantha inside; instead of dying by Richtofen's trap, Samantha was teleported to the moon while Maxis was sent somewhere else. Samantha accidentally triggered the MPD and was trapped within the device, but this also allowed her to enter the Aether realm. Maxis, who was retrieved by Group 935 scientists, apologized to his daughter and committed suicide in front of her, prompting her to assume control of the zombies and seek vengeance on Richtofen. Richtofen fuses the golden rod and the meteorite piece, and using it to switch souls with Samantha, takes over as the new zombie controller. This causes his former allies to <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed,</b> and they ally themselves with Samantha (who now resides in Richtofen's body). Maxis is revealed to have become a sentient artificial intelligence living within the systems of Griffin Station, and he guides his daughter and the three soldiers to launch three missiles at the Earth. This severs Richtofen's link with the Aether, but the launch results in the , while still leaving Richtofen {{in control of the}} undead.|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} these two-hour presentations, now titled Dalton: Code of Vengeance II, aired as the NBC Sunday Night Movie on Sunday, May 11, 1986. Combining episodes written by Luther Murdock and Aiken Woodruff, Dalton: Code of Vengeance II found Dalton {{travelling}} first to Houston, Texas, to help friend Jeanne Bennett (played by Karen Landry) locate her husband—his former commanding officer, Major Monty Bennett (Donnelly Rhodes). [...] When he discovers that Major Bennett is now aiding the New Patriots, a conservative paramilitary group of Vietnam veterans bent on overthrowing the United States government, he sets off for the Florida Everglades to stop them. [...] The New Patriots' plan is to commit acts of domestic terrorism while framing an Arab group for the atrocities {{in the belief that}} this will allow them to seize control of the government they <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed</b> them in Vietnam. [...] Ultimately, Dalton confronts his former commander in the swamp and, after a long and unexplained flashback sequence of combat in Vietnam, Dalton stops both his commander and the group's plans.|$|E
500|$|The band rescheduled European tour {{dates in}} the {{aftermath}} of the September 11 attacks. [...] "After the attacks the world kind of went into freeze mode and we didn't know whether to carry on with things or not... so we decided we'd rather everyone was safe and play the shows a little later instead," [...] said Hoppus shortly thereafter. The European dates were canceled a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was", and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed.</b> The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, mercenaries in the Kolwezi {{had taken}} Tshombe's threats about a {{scorched}} earth policy seriously and had planted explosives on all nearby bridges, the Nzilo Dam (which provided most of Katanga's electricity), {{and most of}} the UMHK mining facilities. When Tshombe arrived on 12 January, he was informed by UMHK officials that they had negotiated a tax deal with the central government and were withdrawing their support for secession. They asked him to not spread the news, fearing the mercenaries would <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed</b> and destroy their facilities as revenge. Realising in a final meeting in Kolwezi that the situation was grim, Colonel Bob Denard suggested that, before fleeing, the mercenaries should destroy the Nzilo Dam to make a political statement. Tshombe, knowing that the UMHK would disapprove, told him that such an action would be [...] "criminally irresponsible." [...] Company representatives met with Brigadier General Noronha to discuss the best way for UN troops to enter Kolwezi without causing collateral damage. General Moke vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of the city. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and a lack of discipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline among the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of Baudouinville to surrender to besieging UN and Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC) forces. Instead, they {{and most of the}} population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near Kongolo laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.|$|E

2500|$|A {{thriving}} parish {{for much}} of the 20th century, St. Andrew's suffered a change {{at the end of the}} century. [...] The surrounding area became increasingly heterogeneous, ethnically and culturally. [...] Some locals resisted these changes and left the area in the process sometimes called [...] "urban flight", further reducing the number of active parishioners. Another strong factor in the decline of attendance and revenue at St. Andrew's was dissatisfaction with the Archdiocese in the wake of the Church sex scandal which came to light at this time. [...] Forest Hills parishioners had particular cause to <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed.</b> [...] John J. Geoghan, one of the most notorious molesters among Catholic clergy, served at St. Andrew's from 1974 to 1980 and ran the altar boy program. [...] Patrick McSorley, one of Geoghan's most visible accusers, was from this parish.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the series}} has progressed, more notable cameo {{appearances}} of real individuals have {{to a greater}} or lesser extent furthered/augmented/commented on the plot. [...] Powers issue #7 [...] "Ride Along" [...] introduced author Warren Ellis into the Powers universe, as a writer of [...] "graphic novels" [...] who accompanies Walker on a [...] "ride along" [...] for research purposes.

2500|$|Merrily We Roll Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed?</b> I'm not sure I would put it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – if you can call it that, though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E

Stewart was reluctant at first, but Clark convinced her to take the case, arguing that otherwise [...] "the Arab world would <b>feel</b> <b>betrayed</b> by their friends on the American left." [...] Interviewed by the Washington Post about her embrace of Rahman's case, she said, [...] "my own political sense tells me that the only hope for change in Egypt is the fundamentalist movement." [...] Kuby, who had represented Rahman earlier, disagreed with Stewart's characterization, stating, [...] "I love Lynne, but no one in the world could fairly posit the sheikh as a progressive or liberal on any issue."
