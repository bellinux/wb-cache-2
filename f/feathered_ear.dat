Major Barrow scouted the ground, and reported that everywhere assegais, shields, <b>feathers,</b> <b>ear</b> and head ornaments, skins, furs, blankets, and ever; guns were lying about in confusion, evidently cast away in their headlong flight by the Zulus, but that none of these had been seen.|$|R
50|$|Gryphons {{give birth}} to living young (often twins), can grow rather old and come in various shapes, {{depending}} to a large part on the avian influence. Examples of the early generations are the hawklike Broadwings and the unique Gryfalcon-female Zhaneel. Obviously, later generations are larger than their progenitors, they reach at least {{the size of a}} heavy warhorse (Treyvan, Hydona).Usually, all four legs of a gryphon end in taloned feet of great strength. In some cases the forefeet are more handlike and useful for fine manipulations. Their heads appear very similar to those of raptors, just broader and topped by a set of <b>feathered</b> <b>ears.</b> Gryphon tails are feathered and sometimes end in tufts, not unlike those of lions.|$|R
60|$|Tyrrel {{paused a}} moment in deep thought, then took his hat, {{paid a visit to}} the stable, where his horse saluted him with <b>feathering</b> <b>ears,</b> and that low amicable neigh, with which that animal {{acknowledges}} the approach of a loving and beloved friend. Having seen that the faithful creature was in every respect attended to, Tyrrel availed himself of the continued and lingering twilight, to visit the old Castle, which, upon former occasions, had been his favourite evening walk. He remained while the light permitted, admiring the prospect we attempted to describe in the first chapter, and comparing, as in his former reverie, the faded hues of the glimmering landscape to those of human life, when early youth and hope have ceased to gild them.|$|R
500|$|The breed was a {{freckled}} white {{dog with}} either liver or black markings, the breed standard in 1859 set their measurements at [...] in height at the withers. It had long legs, <b>feathered</b> <b>ears,</b> a white area on forehead, which {{was said to}} [...] " [...] {{a great deal to}} his beauty", [...] but there were differences from the English Springer, including a broader skull and shorter neck. It was also compared to the English Setter in its build, shape, and proportions, although it was a much smaller size. While other field spaniels of this era displayed colours other than liver and white or liver and black, the Norfolk did not. The breed-specific qualities varied greatly as in some places the breeding lines were not kept particularly pure, those lines having had stock from Sussex and Clumber Spaniels bred into them.|$|R

5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with <b>feathering</b> on the <b>ears</b> and legs.

50|$|The Tweed Water Spaniel {{had a long}} {{tail and}} a curly, liver-colored coat, and looked similar to the Irish Water Spaniel except it had a heavier muzzle and a pointed skull. The dog also had thick, {{slightly}} <b>feathered,</b> hound-like <b>ears,</b> droopy lips, and fore legs that were feathered, but hind legs that were not. Their size {{was that of a}} small retriever, with a liver-coloured curly coat. Instances of offspring which were liver-coloured but tan below the knees were noted in Hugh Dalziel's 1897 work British Dogs: Their Varieties, History, Characteristics, Breeding, Management, And Exhibition, although the author speculated this may have been due to Bloodhound ancestry in one of the parents of the litters.|$|R

5000|$|Breed {{standards}} for the Araucana vary from country to country. It may have unusual tufts of <b>feathers</b> on the <b>ears,</b> and may be rumpless, without a tail and tail-bone; in the United States it may for this reason {{be known as the}} South American Rumpless. Both ear-tufts and rumplessness are caused by lethal genes, so not all birds display these traits. The Ameraucana breed and [...] "Easter Egger" [...] hybrids of the United States, which also lay blue or green eggs, both derive from the Araucana.|$|R
25|$|A {{group of}} black-footed species {{occurring}} in tropical coastal or inland habitat between the Persian Gulf and Australia. Most species are tentatively assigned here, {{based on the}} combination of range, crestlessness, size, general lack of naked skin ornaments {{and the presence of}} some amount of white <b>feathering</b> in the <b>ear</b> region at least in breeding plumage. This clade is not too well supported, but this may be because the two presumed members included in recent research are quite dissimilar; the three unstudied ones are very similar to one or the other.|$|R
50|$|Japanese Chin stand about 20 to 27 cm (8 to 11 inches) {{in height}} at the withers.

The American Kennel Club and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale give no weight {{requirement}} for the Chin, regardless of the aforementioned desire for lighter dogs. Its distinctive expression is characterized by a large broad head, large wide-set eyes, short broad muzzle, <b>ear</b> <b>feathering,</b> and evenly patterned facial markings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{short-eared owl}} (Asio flammeus) is {{a species of}} typical owl (family Strigidae). Owls {{belonging}} to genus Asio are known as the eared owls, as they have tufts of <b>feathers</b> resembling mammalian <b>ears.</b> These [...] "ear" [...] tufts {{may or may not}} be visible. Asio flammeus will display its tufts when in a defensive pose, although its very short tufts are usually not visible. The short-eared owl is found in open country and grasslands. The scientific name is from Latin. The genus name Asio is a type of eared owl, and flammeus means [...] "flame-coloured".|$|R
5000|$|Like the Papua New Guineans, New Zealand Māori wore {{feathered}} headdresses too {{to symbolize}} power. The now extinct huia feather was highly prized, with chiefs wearing white-tipped huia feathers to symbolise power over chiefs wearing monotone feathers. Huia feathers were revered as [...] "taonga" [...] or treasures by Māori and in later times, the European settlers. The huia feathers were often grouped in twos and were usually {{accompanied by a}} kiwi <b>feather</b> cloak, an <b>ear</b> piercing and commonly a small jade club. After Western colonisation, European woman began wearing the feathers to express their strong social standing.|$|R
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip.

[...] The outer coat will be dense, straight, and harsh. The plush coat is longer, with a soft undercoat and a distinctive [...] "mane" [...] which extends to the chest.

2500|$|The {{appearance}} of the Paisley terrier {{was similar to the}} Skye Terrier, but was shorter backed and weighed around 7kg (16lbs), about half the weight of today's Skye Terrier. The breed had a flowing [...] "silvery, soft jacket" [...] (coat) of blue and tan, and was shown along with the hard-coated Skye Terriers. They were further described as having a great profusion of silky fur with very profuse <b>ear</b> <b>feathering</b> (long hair on the ears.) To differentiate it from the Skye, it was nicknamed the Silky. From the earliest time of the breed, the beauty of the coat won prizes at dog shows. Traditionally, the dogs were shown standing on a box, so that the length of the silky coat could be shown to its best advantage.|$|R
50|$|They measure about 17 cm in length, and {{the sexes}} are similar though easily distinguishable. Adult males have the upperparts deep blue-black {{with a slight}} luster. The black cap subtends the red eye, the upperpart plumage is black-and-white, and the underparts pure white. Females have a black loral stripe and white supraloral <b>feathering,</b> with the <b>ear</b> coverts pale and the crown not solidly black. They also have greyer backs than males, and grey to buffy tones to the white plumage tracts. Immature birds {{resemble}} females, but have brownish bills and brown irides, while the upperparts and flanks are still greyer, and the underparts and edges of the wing feathers are yet more buffy. Intraspecific variation is clinal. Range, iris colour, wing markings and the female plumage assist in separating it from other puffback species.|$|R
