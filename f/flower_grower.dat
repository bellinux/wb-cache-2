60|$|If you are {{a farmer}} or any sort of horticulturist, a fruit or <b>flower</b> <b>grower,</b> let us say, or a seedsman, you will {{probably}} find yourself still farming under Socialism--that is to say, renting land and getting what you can out of it. Your rent will be fixed {{just as it is}} to-day by what people will give. But your landlord will be the Municipality or the County, and the rent you pay will largely come back to you in repairs, in the guiding reports and advice of the Agricultural Department, in improved roads, in subventions to a good electric car service to take your produce to market; in aids and education for your children. You will probably have a greater fixity of tenure and a clearer ownership in improvements than you have to-day. I am inclined to think that your dairying and milking and so forth will be done for you wholesale in big public dairies and mills because of the economy of that; you will send up the crude produce and sell it, perhaps, to the county association to brand and distribute. It is probable you will sell your crops standing, and the public authority will organize the harvesting and bring out an army of workers from the towns to gather your fruit, hops and corn. You will need, therefore, only a small permanent staff of labourers, and these {{are much more likely to}} be partners with you in the enterprise than wage workers needing to be watched and driven.|$|E

40|$|Washington {{state is}} home to many small-scale, {{specialty}} cut <b>flower</b> <b>growers,</b> and diversified farms with both food and floral crops. Many cut <b>flower</b> <b>growers</b> utilize direct marketing channels, such as farmers markets, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), roadside stands, and on-farm sales (you-pick operations). Direct marketing allows growers to receive the full retail price rather than wholesaling to another business, such as a retail florist or grocery store. Farmers markets are a popular direct-marketing channel for many cut <b>flower</b> <b>growers</b> because they offer a ready supply of customers, coordinated marketing, and relatively low retail costs compared to brick-and-mortar stores. It can be difficult for cut <b>flower</b> <b>growers</b> to determine what price to charge for their products. Price is usually based on cost of production and market conditions. Several sources, including the USDA, report cut flower prices that are largely based {{on the price of}} cut flower imports (USDA AMS). The Association of Specialty Cut <b>Flower</b> <b>Growers</b> provides its members with a pricing guide based on values reported by members across the county. While these are helpful reference points, prices can vary widely by product, local conditions, and marketing channel. The goal of this research was to document and analyze the prices of cut flowers sold at farmers markets. The pricing study results are intended to help cut <b>flower</b> <b>growers</b> evaluate farmers markets as a direct marketing channel and to assess their bouquet composition and pricing strategies...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the emergence of}} African-European business relationships. Its {{focus is on the}} role of bargaining power and information technology {{and its impact on the}} different stakeholders in (electronic) markets (sellers, market maker, buyers). Information technology is seen as an enabling technology that facilitates reaching a wider customer base (called reach) and providing a channel for increased customer services (called richness). The central question is how African suppliers can create bargaining power by means of information technology and therefore enter and improve their position in European markets. Research is carried out in the flower industry. In this industry African <b>flower</b> <b>growers</b> create competitive advantage and develop business relationships with European buyers (wholesalers, retailers). In this article we investigate three flower markets (Tele Flower Auction, FloraHolland Auction, and Aalsmeer Auction), the role of African <b>flower</b> <b>growers,</b> and the use and impact of information technology in these markets. The results of our research show that there are potentials for African <b>flower</b> <b>growers</b> to enter the European flower markets and to increase their position of bargaining power. A first potential is using and implementing information technology for the access to new and large European markets. African <b>flower</b> <b>growers</b> use information technology to streamline transaction processes and lower transaction costs. A second potential is related to the quality and specificity of the produced flower products. Information technology can remove the quality uncertainty of products and can provide rich information services to buyers. The results in the flower industry suggest that information technology provides opportunities for the African producers to expand the reach and richness of their product and service offerings, thus creating economic value.

50|$|In 1907 {{she took}} courses at Columbia University and later at Harvard College in {{landscape}} design. She began a {{private practice in}} Augusta working on residential landscapes and expanded to the public sector, completing projects for both parks and schools. She continued writing in the 1910s and 1920s publishing articles about southern gardening in The Florists’ Exchange, The <b>Flower</b> <b>Grower</b> and House and Garden, as well as publishing an ongoing column on gardening for The Augusta Chronicle. Between 1914 and 1917, she was commissioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to landscape several post offices and custom houses in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina. In addition to her commissioned work, Dillon also created a project to teach gardening to children. The Merchant and Manufacturers Association provided funds for school children to plant on empty lots and offered prizes for beautification. The project was so successful that it was launched into a citywide campaign which included involvement from businesses and various civic organizations. During World War I, Dillon joined the Red Cross and along with other women participated in the Woman’s Messenger Motor Service, (officially called the Red Cross Motor Corps) and made both garments and surgical supplies. In 1919, she {{served on the board}} of the State Federation of Professional and Businesswomen’s Club, which in addition to improving the professional prospects of women, urged the legislature to grant suffrage.|$|E

In 1921, she attended the Forestry Congress in her capacity as chair and was considered one of the experts in her field. Her 1922 book, The Blossom Circle of the Year in Southern Gardens, became widely known and then in 1927, she pushed for the founding of Sumter's first garden club. When she moved to Sumter, Dillon continued with her writing, publishing columns on gardening which regularly appeared in both The Sumter Daily Item and The State published in Columbia, South Carolina, as well as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Upon completion of the city park, Dillon was offered a full-time position as the city landscape architect, in 1928 as the Sumter Superintendent of Parks and Trees. Among many projects she planned during this period was the 1938 design for Swan Lake Iris Gardens, though the land was not donated until 1949, after Dillon's retirement in 1948. When she retired, Dillon returned to Georgia and continued writing about gardening even though she had also began to lose her sight.

40|$|The flower {{industry}} {{has a reputation}} for heavy usage of toxic chemicals and polluting the environment, enormous consumption of water, and poor working condition and low wage level {{in various parts of the}} world. It is unfortunate that this industry is adamant to change and repeating the same mistakes in Ethiopia. Because of this, - there is a growing concern among the general public and the international community about sustainability of the Ethiopian flower industry. Consequently, working conditions in the flower industry, impacts of wage income on the livelihoods of employees, coping strategies of low wage flower farm workers, impacts of flower farms on the livelihoods of local people and environmental pollution and conflict, were analysed. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed. Four quantitative data sets: labour practice, employees’ income and expenditure, displaced household, and <b>flower</b> <b>grower</b> views survey were collected between 2010 and 2012. Robust regression to identify the determinants of wage levels, and Multinomial logit to identify the determinants of coping strategies of flower farm workers and displaced households were employed. The findings show the working conditions in flower farms are characterized by low wages, job insecurity and frequent violation of employees’ rights, and poor safety measures. To ensure survival of their family, land dispossessed households adopt a wide range of strategies including reduction in food consumption, sharing oxen, renting land, share cropping, and shifting staple food crops. Most experienced scarcity of water resources, lack of grazing areas, death of herds and reduced numbers of livestock due to water source pollution. Despite the Ethiopian government investment in attracting and creating conducive environment for investors, not much was accomplished when it comes to enforcing labour laws and environmental policies. Flower farm expansion in Ethiopia, as it is now, can be viewed as part of the global land and water grab and is not all inclusive and sustainable. Several recommendations are made to improve working conditions, maximize the benefits of flower industry to the society, and to the country at large...|$|E
