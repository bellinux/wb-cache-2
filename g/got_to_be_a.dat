Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics [...] "Couldn't we accept each other / Can't we make ourselves aware." ...|$|E

500|$|... "There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Way" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey from her self-titled debut studio album (1990). Columbia released it as the fifth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom. It {{was one of four}} songs Carey wrote with Ric Wake during their first recording session together in February 1990, but [...] "There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Way" [...] was the only composition to make the final track listing. It is a socio-political conscious R-pop song which addresses the existence of poverty, racism and war in the world which gradually becomes more aspirational and positive as it progresses. The track garnered a mixed reception upon the album's release in 1990. While Carey's vocals were praised, it was seen as too political. An accompanying music video highlights social injustices. The song reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau {{felt that}} Carey was being too {{political}} in her [...] "brave, young, idealistic attack" [...] on war and destitution. Ralph Novak, David Hiltbrand and David Grogan of People wrote {{that it is}} a [...] "testimony to her talent that she does so much with so little." [...] They continued to write that Carey's [...] "tone and clarity" [...] makes [...] "There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Way" [...] a [...] "mesmerizing" [...] track. To mark twenty-five years since the release of Mariah Carey in June 1990, Billboard writer Trevor Anderson wrote a track-by-track review of the album in June 2015. He noted that [...] "There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Way" [...] follows the same melodic tone as the album's opener [...] "Vision of Love" [...] but highlighted their stark lyrical differences, as the former is about social activism and the latter is about love. Although he praised Carey's vocals, writing that she [...] "deploys" [...] one of her best whistle notes of her career, he felt that [...] "the aim for broad appeal comes at the expense of memorable lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Way" [...] was {{composed}} by Mariah Carey and [...] Ric Wake for Carey's self-titled debut studio album (1990); the lyrics {{were written by}} Carey, while she and Wake composed the music. It was written during Carey and Wake's first recording session together. They composed four songs, but only [...] "There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Way" [...] was chosen for the final track listing. Co-produced by Wake and Narada Michael Walden, it appears as the second of ten songs on the track listing. The track was recorded in February 1990 and engineered by Bob Cadway at Cove City Sound Studios and The Power Station, both located in New York City; he was assisted by Dana Jon Chappelle. It was mixed by David Frazer at Tarpan Studios in San Rafael. The keyboards, bass and rhythm engineering {{was carried out by}} Louis Biancaniello, while Joe Franco performed the percussion, Vernon [...] "Ice" [...] Black played the guitar, and Rich Tancredo also performing on the keyboards. Walter Afanasieff played the synth horns. Carey provided her own background vocals along with Billy T. Scott, Jamiliah Muhammed and The Billy T. Scott Ensemble. The song was released as the fifth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that, on the surface, the episode [...] "has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> instant {{contender}} for the most low-key Adventure Time ever", noting {{that there are no}} guest stars and that the action is centered entirely in Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. However, he applauded the episode, arguing that it [...] "absolutely nails the insanity of trying to jump into an overcomplicated, impenetrable game with a much more seasoned competitor". Wilkins compared the titular Card Wars game to , Dungeons & Dragons, and Risk, pointing out that Card Wars [...] "byzantine rules and gleefully baffling terminology" [...] emulates and lampoons the aforementioned games. Ultimately, Wilkins concluded that the episode was successful because of [...] "how real this all feels".|$|R

500|$|... "There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Morning After Pill" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great." [...] He {{thought that it was}} indicative of an overall upward trend in the quality of Veronica Mars and praised the episode's balance between the case-of-the-week and the Dean O'Dell story arc. [...] "Like last week's episode, 'There's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Morning After Pill' benefited from integrating already established characters into a mystery of the week." [...] He was positive towards the mystery of the week in general, stating that it made him realize {{that it was possible to}} make good episodes with only a stand-alone mystery. However, he was critical of the development of Veronica and Logan's relationship, particularly Logan's new character traits. [...] "Let's just hope they don't get back together again next week, or anytime soon, because this horse has been beaten to death as it is." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend was positive towards the episode, calling it [...] "jam-packed with drama". However, she stated that she would have enjoyed the episode more if Mac, Piz, Wallace, or Parker had made an appearance. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall enjoyed the pairing of Bonnie and her father, played by Chris Ellis.|$|E

Matlock takes the position that the military build-up by Ronald Reagan in the early-1980s has contributed to the inaccurate characterization of Reagan as a war hawk. [...] The quote atop the first page of Reagan and Gorbachev is by Ronald Reagan, speaking in 1981 during the beginnings of a one trillion dollar defense spending surge, that states [...] "I've always recognized that ultimately there's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> settlement, a solution." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCarthy {{often used}} accusations of {{homosexuality}} as a smear tactic in his anti-communist crusade, often combining the Second Red Scare with the lavender scare. On one occasion, he {{went so far}} as to announce to reporters, [...] "If you want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> against McCarthy, boys, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either <b>a</b> Communist or a cocksucker."

2500|$|The comedian {{has also}} {{expressed}} discomfort {{with the notion}} that success in standup comedy—or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry—should oblige him to serve as a role model. In this position, he finds himself directly at odds with one of his comic idols, Bill Cosby. Cosby has reprimanded Rock both explicitly—for his Niggas vs. Black People track—and implicitly, for heavy use of the word [...] "nigger." [...] Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 Roll With The New show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: [...] "Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling Jerry Seinfeld he's a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> entertainer and a leader. It's too much." [...] Often the subject of tabloids, when asked about paparazzi and the other negative aspects of fame, Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: [...] "You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips." ...|$|R

In addition, the subplot involving Logan and Veronica's breakup triggered a discussion in the writers' room about Veronica's character traits. The episode received 2.40 million viewers in its original broadcast and mixed reviews from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN thought it was indicative of a general upward trend in the show's quality, while Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club thought it was uneven.|$|E

I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel." [...] Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which the singer read voraciously.
