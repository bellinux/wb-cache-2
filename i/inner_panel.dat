5|$|The panels contain {{quotations}} in Latin {{from several}} biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into {{the edges of}} the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly {{on the surface of the}} central <b>inner</b> <b>panel.</b> The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in white paint are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE MUNDI ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS ("Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece {{consists}} of five paintings– a central <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> and two double-sided wings. Those {{on the reverse}} of wings are visible when the shutters are closed, and show the hospital donors flanked by their patron saints. The interior has a central panel with the enthroned Virgin and Child flanked by saints; the left wing features episodes {{from the life of}} John the Baptist with emphasis on his beheading; the right wing shows the apocalypse as recorded by John the Evangelist, pictured writing on the island of Patmos.|$|E

50|$|The Carat was {{designed}} by Technoflug around the wings and horizontal tail of the Schempp-Hirth Discus sailplane, marrying these to a new fuselage, fin, undercarriage and engine.. Structurally the aircraft {{is a mixture of}} fibreglass and carbon fibre composites. The wings have PVC foam cores. In plan the wings have parallel chord <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> and two outer sections of increasing straight taper. Winglets are an option. Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are mounted on the upper surfaces of the <b>inner</b> <b>panels,</b> with turbulators on the underside to ensure a controlled boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent flow without separation. The wings have 3° of dihedral.|$|R
500|$|The {{paintings}} on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the Virgin Mary and Archangel Gabriel in an Annunciation scene painted in grisaille, which because of their near-monochrome colouring {{give the impression that}} the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> Mary is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap. On the left hand wing Archangel Michael presents a kneeling donor, while on the right St. Catherine of Alexandria stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering. [...] The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the assumption, while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine.|$|E
500|$|The Dresden Triptych (or Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor, or Triptych of the Virgin and Child) is a {{very small}} hinged-triptych altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It {{consists}} of five individual panel paintings: a central <b>inner</b> <b>panel,</b> and two double-sided wings. It is signed and dated 1437, and in the permanent collection of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden, with the panels still in their original frames. The only extant triptych attributed to van Eyck, and the only non-portrait signed with his personal motto, ALC IXH XAN ("I Do as I Can"). the triptych can be placed at the midpoint of his known works. It echoes a number of the motifs of his earlier works while marking an advancement in his ability in handling depth of space, and establishes iconographic elements of Marian portraiture that were to become widespread by {{the latter half of the}} 15thcentury. Elisabeth Dhanens describes it as [...] "the most charming, delicate and appealing work by Jan van Eyck that has survived".|$|E
2500|$|The Ford GT {{features}} {{many new}} and unique technologies, including superplastic-formed frame, aluminum body panels, roll-bonded floor panels, a friction stir welded center tunnel, {{covered by a}} magnesium center console, a [...] "ship-in-a-bottle" [...] gas tank, a capless fuel filler system, one-piece door panels, and an aluminum engine cover with a one-piece carbon fiber <b>inner</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|On one of {{his regular}} visits to German glider builders, Teichfuss watched the {{construction}} of high performance aircraft like Hans Jacobs' DFS Reiher. The Turbine design, begun in 1938, was a high performance machine which showed Jakob's influence but was rather simpler to construct. It was a mid wing cantilever monoplane with gull wings of strongly straight tapered, elliptically tipped plan. The <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> extended over rather more than one third span and were mounted with about 10° of dihedral; there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons. There were spoilers on the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> at about mid-chord.|$|R
50|$|On {{the west}} (main) elevation, end pavilions project from the towers. These flank a 13-bay central section with 13 three-story windows groups, {{recessed}} behind marble pilasters with fluted <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b> A banded beltcourse running between {{the fourth floor}} and the parapet features a pattern of stars and eagles carved in low relief.|$|R
30|$|The {{relative}} {{density of the}} cytoskeleton panel in the probing volume may be expressed as the ratio of At% to Ad%, represented as D. As shown in Table  1, the cancerous CaSki cells showed at least a threefold increase in elastic density (D%) of the inner panels; however, the elastic density of the cortical panel decreased by 82  % compared with its normal counterparts. These finding may be attributable to the depolymerization of F-actin at the cell cortex [33] and upregulation of the expression of microtubulin in the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> [37]. Changes in cell stiffness are important for initial adhesive interactions during cell migration in vivo. Disruption of F-actin increases cell adhesion, whereas disruption of tubulin reduces adhesive interactions in vivo [34]. Therefore, lower cortical tension and higher elastic density of the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> may increase the adhesive properties of CaSki, thereby facilitating migration and transformation.|$|R

5000|$|The Circe {{is built}} from {{composite}} materials, with flying surfaces and fuselage shells made from glass-balsa-glass sandwiches. The wings {{have a single}} spar with flanges of aligned glass fibre (uni-directional rovings) and a glass-balsa sandwich web. The fuselage has GRP-balsa stiffening cross-members. The wing is tapered in two sections, with more taper on the outer 40% of the span. Such double taper plans can provide lift/drag ratios close {{to that of the}} ideal elliptical wing, and have benign stall characteristics. [...] Ailerons occupy all the trailing edge of the outer panels, with flaps across the <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b> Four sets of Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, two per wing, are located just behind the spar, roughly centred on the <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b> Each set extends its surfaces, mounted like parallel rulers, above and below the wing. They were difficult to design because of the considerable flexure of the wing, the latter leading to the Circe's nickname of Gummiflügel (Rubberwing) at a time of stiffer structures.|$|R
5000|$|In double gatefolds {{there are}} three {{parallel}} folds. The left and right edges of the paper fold and meet in the middle, without overlapping, along a center fold. The outer panels (the ones that fold in to the middle) are usually 1/32" [...] to 1/8" [...] smaller than the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> (the ones covered by the panels that fold in) to allow for proper folding and nesting.|$|R

50|$|The outer {{wings of}} 15th-century diptychs and triptychs {{typically}} contained Annunciation scenes painted in grisaille. Molly Teasdale Smith believes the practice echoes {{the tradition of}} covering religious imagery with grey cloth during the then-46-day lenten period leading up to Easter. There is a symmetry with this in how polyptychs were typically kept closed except for Sundays or church holidays, when they were opened to reveal the more colourful and expansive <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work is {{intended}} to apprehend which door vibrations contribute to the visible motion occuring during closure,where they emanate from and how they may be abolished. The human ability to distinguish mechanical vibrations is not well-known and should be experimentally investigated. On account on its inertia, the eye perception weakens over frequency and, in particular, no dynamic motion can be discerned over 50 Hz. This determines the upper frequency limit of visibility and rejects the currently assumed value 10 Hz higher. Below 50 Hz, mechanical vibrations may be visible {{as long as their}} amplitude is larger than an experimentally-defined threshold. The frequency domain of interests is deep. During the closure process, the main excitation arises from the water strips that brake the door and transmit energy into <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b> The resulting vibrations travel towards outer panels because of the strong coupling between the both. Provided that the door natural properties that are likely to be excited from the closure process do not appear below 50 Hz, no external vibrations will be distinguished. <b>Inner</b> <b>panels</b> act as transfer systems between excitation and outer panels, thus their construction must be specifically emphasised. As a rule the current structures are not stiff enough,in particular <b>inner</b> door <b>panels</b> that {{turn out to be a}} source of weakness. Practical ways to improve the construction are discussed and must be further investigated, for instance using FEM calculations, of which consistence is assessed in this work...|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of mixed}} construction, including bolted-together aluminum tubing, 4130 steel tubing, wood and dope and aircraft fabric. Its 30 ft span wing {{is supported by}} a single lift strut per side, with jury struts, and incorporates a unique folding mechanism. The wing folds by first hinging the outer <b>panels</b> onto the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> and then the whole wing pivots on a central steel post to allow positioning fore-and-aft for towing on its landing gear or for storage.|$|R
5000|$|The Sparviero design, {{begun in}} 1937, was {{intended}} as an aerobatic competition glider comparable with the 1936 DFS Habicht.

The <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> extended over less than one third span and were mounted with about 10° of dihedral; there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons. [...] There were no flaps or spoilers.|$|R
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces. The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated {{by members of the}} Holy Family; early works, especially from the Sienese or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel's figures. Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 Miraflores Altarpiece and c.1452 Braque Triptych. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b> From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs, the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|R
