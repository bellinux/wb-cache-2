Historical Chinese culture has not recognized {{a concept of}} sexual orientation, or a <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> divide people based on their same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although {{there was a significant}} culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons to their husbands, women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.|$|E

If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has a {{software}} repository of over 26,000 applications that are developed by third parties. Examples include: windowing systems, web browsers, email clients, office suites and so forth. In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> allow these programs to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled binaries ("packages"). The Ports collection supports the current and stable branches of FreeBSD. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date Ports collection.|$|E

The Regional Corridor Development Authority is the government agency responsible for managing SCORE. The entire central region of Sarawak is covered under SCORE, including areas such as Samalaju (near Bintulu), Tanjung Manis, and Mukah. Samalaju will be developed as an industrial park, with Tanjung Manis as a halal food hub, and Mukah as the administrative centre for SCORE {{with a focus on}} resource-based research and development.|$|E

There is now a need to {{encourage the use of}} these <b>frameworks</b> <b>to</b> inform practice in the teaching and learning of statistics. This paper focuses on frameworks that describe the levels of cognitive development of the concept of variation. Recent research proposing theoretical frameworks on, or referring to, reasoning about variation are synthesised. Discussion follows on the use of theoretical <b>frameworks</b> <b>to</b> inform the teaching and learning cycle for statistics courses, especially the design of curriculum, learning activities and assessment tasks...|$|R

5|$|Khrushchev told Mikoyan of {{his idea}} of {{shipping}} Soviet missiles to Cuba. Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles. In early November 1962, after the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed {{about the death of}} his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E
5|$|Python {{can serve}} as a {{scripting}} language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.|$|E

5|$|The estuary stingray's diminished {{population}} and susceptibility to multiple threats {{have led the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Vulnerable. Demographic modelling has shown that {{it is likely to}} become Endangered without intervention. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are located within its range, but at present they lack adequate protection from fishing. As this ray remains locally abundant in Hervey Bay and parts of Moreton Bay, these areas may become important centers for preserving the species. The Queensland government has listed the estuary stingray on the Back on Track species prioritisation <b>framework,</b> <b>to</b> facilitate the development of conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E
5|$|Vector spaces {{have many}} {{applications}} as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some field are involved. They provide a <b>framework</b> <b>to</b> deal with analytical and geometrical problems, or {{are used in}} the Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in optimization. The minimax theorem of game theory stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods. Representation theory fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as group theory.|$|E
