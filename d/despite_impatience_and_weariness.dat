60|$|Austin stood, half naked, on the {{platform}} between launch and surfboat, with the water sluicing from him, and though he had toiled since early dawn, he was sensible only of a feverish <b>impatience,</b> <b>and</b> no <b>weariness</b> at all. He {{had had enough of}} the dark land, and what they were about to do was to ensure a start on the journey that would take them out of it. It grew rapidly darker, the long hull faded, and the flare of the lamp alone cut, a sheet of orange and saffron, against the blackness above them. Jefferson's voice fell through it sharply.|$|R
50|$|There Anil meets Sarath's brother, Gamini, an {{emergency}} doctor. She discovers {{that he is}} intricately involved in the country's affairs and daily struggles to {{save the lives of}} numerous victims. Gamini helps them with a fellow Sri Lankan whose hands have been nailed to a road, and tells them about the various atrocities citizens face {{as a result of the}} civil war. Later Anil and Sarath meet with Ananda, on the advice of Palipana, hoping that he will be able to reconstruct the face of Sailor for them. Ananda does so after some days, <b>despite</b> Anil's <b>impatience</b> <b>and</b> skepticism, and then almost immediately attempts suicide, only to be rescued by an intuitive and quick-thinking Anil. Anil and Sarath eventually are able to identify Sailor in a small village.|$|R
6000|$|To {{lie on the}} wool-packs, with a cranny left {{between the}} {{curtains}} of the awning to let in the air, was luxury to Hetty now, and she half-slept away the hours till the driver came to {{ask her if she}} wanted to get down and have [...] "some victual"; he himself was going to eat his dinner at this [...] "public." [...] Late at night they reached Leicester, and so this second day of Hetty's journey was past. She had spent no money except what she had paid for her food, but she felt that this slow journeying would be intolerable for her another day, and in the morning she found her way to a coach-office to ask about the road to Windsor, and see if it would cost her too much to go part of the distance by coach again. Yes! The distance was too great--the coaches were too dear--she must give them up; but the elderly clerk at the office, touched by her pretty anxious face, wrote down for her the names of the chief places she must pass through. This was the only comfort she got in Leicester, for the men stared at her as she went along the street, {{and for the first time}} in her life Hetty wished no one would look at her. She set out walking again; but this day she was fortunate, for she was soon overtaken by a carrier's cart which carried her to Hinckley, and by the help of a return chaise, with a drunken postilion--who frightened her by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi, and shouting hilarious remarks at her, twisting himself backwards on his saddle--she was before night in the heart of woody Warwickshire: but still almost a hundred miles from Windsor, they told her. Oh what a large world it was, and what hard work for her to find her way in it! She went by mistake to Stratford-on-Avon, finding Stratford set down in her list of places, and then she was told she had come a long way out of the right road. It was not till the fifth day that she got to Stony Stratford. That seems but a slight journey as you look at the map, or remember your own pleasant travels to and from the meadowy banks of the Avon. But how wearily long it was to Hetty! It seemed to her as if this country of flat fields, and hedgerows, and dotted houses, and villages, and market-towns--all so much alike to her indifferent eyes--must have no end, and she must go on wandering among them for ever, waiting tired at toll-gates for some cart to come, and then finding the cart went only a little way--a very little way--to the miller's a mile off perhaps; and she hated going into the public houses, where she must go to get food and ask questions, because there were always men lounging there, who stared at her and joked her rudely. Her body was very weary too with these days of new fatigue and anxiety; they had made her look more pale and worn than all the time of hidden dread she had gone through at home. When at last she reached Stony Stratford, her <b>impatience</b> <b>and</b> <b>weariness</b> had become too strong for her economical caution; she determined to take the coach for the rest of the way, though it should cost her all her remaining money. She would need nothing at Windsor but to find Arthur. When she had paid the fare for the last coach, she had only a shilling; and as she got down at the sign of the Green Man in Windsor at twelve o'clock in the middle of the seventh day, hungry and faint, the coachman came up, and begged her to [...] "remember him." [...] She put her hand in her pocket and took out the shilling, but the tears came with the sense of exhaustion and the thought that she was giving away her last means of getting food, which she really required before she could go in search of Arthur. As she held out the shilling, she lifted up her dark tear-filled eyes to the coachman's face and said, [...] "Can you give me back sixpence?" ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to try to clarify the notions of <b>impatience</b> <b>and</b> myopia, often {{considered}} as synonymous in the literature. The occurrence of asset price bubbles (see Araujo et al., 2011) when only myopia is required, explains why we focused on a stronger notion that we define as <b>impatience</b> <b>and</b> which allows to avoid such market anomalies. The first part characterizes the <b>impatience</b> <b>and</b> the myopia in the context of discrete and continuous time flows of income (consumption) valued through a Choquet integral with respect to an (exact) capacity. Our results unlike the additive utility functional allow to disentangle myopia from impatience: impatience requires myopia but the converse is false. Moreover it turns out that in our framework a decision maker exhibits more easily <b>impatience</b> <b>and</b> myopia in continuous time than in discrete time. In the second part, we recall the generalization given by Rébillé (2008) of the Yosida-Hewitt decomposition of an additive set function into a continuous part and a pathological part and use it to give a characterization of those convex capacities whose core contains at least one G-continuous measure. We then proceed to characterize the exact capacities whose core contains only G-continuous measures thus connecting some previous characterizations of <b>impatience</b> <b>and</b> myopia with core properties of exact capacities. As a dividend, a simple characterization of countably additive Borel probabilities on locally compact σ-compact metric spaces is obtained...|$|R

The model yields that distribution is exclusively determined by the pattern of status impatience across households...|$|R
