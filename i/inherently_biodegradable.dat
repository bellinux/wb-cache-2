Enhancement of the polymer by adding in {{additives}} to change the hydrophobic nature of the resin to slightly hydrophilic allows microorganisms to consume the macromolecules of the product, these products often are confused with oxobiodegradable products, but work in a different way. Enhancing of the hydrophilicity of the polymer allows fungus and bacteria to consume the polymer at a faster rate utilizing the carbon inside the polymer chain for energy. These additives attract certain microorganisms found in nature and many tests have been completed on the mixing of synthetic and biobased materials which are <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable</b> for enhancing the biodegradability of synthetic polymers that are not as fast to biodegrade.|$|E
40|$|Phthalate diesters (DPEs) are {{a family}} of {{industrial}} chemicals used in {{a vast array of}} consumer products. Because of their broad commercial applications, many DPEs have become ubiquitously distributed in the environment. An in vitro test was conducted to measure the biodegradation rate of seven DPEs in temperate marine sediments. Low molecular weight congeners degraded rapidly with sediment half-lives ranging from 3. 0 and 8. 0 days, while high molecular weight congeners exhibited slow (2 -ethyl-hexyl phthalate sediment half-life of 340 days) or no significant biodegradation. While previous studies show that the high molecular weight congeners are <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable,</b> in the current study they were recalcitrant in natural sediments. A mechanistic biodegradation model was developed {{based on the premise that}} all phthalates are <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable,</b> but only the freely dissolved fraction of the chemical concentration in sediments is bioavailable for microbial degradation. The model showed good agreement with empirical observations...|$|E

The composites were prepared by using film-stacking method, thus by laying basalt fabrics and PLA film onto each other and co mpression moulding this layered structure. PLA film was produced film (sheet) extrusion from pellets. The effect of processing parameters, namely pressure and temperature was analysed on the mechanical properties of the composites. It was found that both paramet ers are highly effectiv e in significantly increasing the wetting of the basalt fabric, a nd thus the mechanical properties.

40|$|Concern with {{environmental}} {{issues such as}} global climate change has stimulated research into {{the development of more}} environmentally friendly technologies and energy sources. One critical area of our economy is liquid fuels. Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for liquids production is of particular concern, as {{it is one of the}} most interesting ways to produce renewable liquid fuel for transport and heat and power production. The aerobic biodegradability of various pyrolysis oils from different origins and of a EN 590 diesel sample was examined using the Modified Sturm (OECD 301 B). The results demonstrate that all fast pyrolysis oils assessed are biodegradable with similar shaped curves with 41 - 50 % biodegradation after 28 days, whereas the diesel sample reached only 24 % biodegradation. Since pyrolysis oils achieved biodegradability over 20 % these are classified as <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable.</b> Modelling of biodegradation processes was successfully performed with a first-order chemical reaction. The biodegradability results obtained for biomass pyrolysis oils are compared to those of conventional and alternative fuels...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{dramatic}} increase in interest in the use of ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydride monomers as a method to prepare well-defined polypeptides and peptide hybrid materials. The resulting molecules are often capable of assembling into a variety of different structures, including micelles, vesicles, nanoparticles and hydrogels, and therefore have been explored as novel drug delivery systems. Peptides are attractive in this regard due to their rich chemical functionality and ability to assemble through the formation of secondary structures (e. g. α-helices and β-sheets). In addition, they are <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable</b> and biocompatible. This review describes recent advances in the field, covering aspects such as improved methods with which to prepare better-defined polypeptides, crosslinking of assemblies to enhance biostability, the preparation of materials that respond to a variety of stimuli (including light and intra- or extracellular redox conditions), functionalization with targeting ligands to enhance cellular uptake, assemblies for small interfering RNA delivery and approaches to theranostic systems. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} RAFT polymerization stems partly from the ease and utility of installing a functional chain transfer agent onto {{the ends of}} the generated polymer chains. In parallel, the Passerini multicomponent reaction offers great versatility in converting a wide range of easily accessible building blocks to functional materials. In this work, we have combined the two approaches such that a single, commonly available, RAFT agent is used in Passerini reactions to generate a variety of multifunctional RAFT chain transfer agents containing ester linkages. Reactions to generate the multifunctional RAFT agents took place under mild conditions and in good yields. The resulting Passerini-RAFT agents were able to exert control over radical polymerization to generate materials of well-defined molecular weights and dispersity. Furthermore, the presence in these polymer cores of ester and amide functionality through the Passerini chemistries, provided regions in the materials which are <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable,</b> facilitating any subsequent biomedical applications. The work overall thus demonstrates a versatile and facile synthetic route to multi functional RAFT chain transfer agents and biodegradable polymers...|$|E
40|$|Data {{allowing}} for a complete environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their photoderatives in the environment are still scarce. In the present study, in vitro toxicity and both bio- and photopersistence of various pharmaceuticals (aciclovir, allopurinol, cetirizine, cimetidine, fluconazole, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, phenytoin, primidone, ranitidine, sotalol, sulpiride, tramadol and valsartane) {{as well as their}} phototransformation products were evaluated in order to fill data gaps and to help prioritise them for further testing. Twelve out of the fourteen compounds investigated were found to be neither readily nor <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable</b> in the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development-biodegradability tests. The study further demonstrates that the photo-induced transformation of the pharmaceuticals was faster upon irradiation with a Hg lamp (UV light) than with a Xe lamp emitting a spectrum that mimics sunlight. Comparing the non-irradiated with the respective irradiated solutions, a higher acute and chronic toxicity against bacteria was found for the irradiated solutions of seven compounds (cetirizine, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide, ranitidine, sulpiride, tramadol and valsartane). No cyto- and genotoxic effects were found in human cervical (HeLa) and liver (Hep-G 2) cells for any of the investigated compounds or their phototransformation products. This comparative study documents that phototransformation products can arise as a result of UV treatment of wastewater containing these pharmaceuticals. It further demonstrates that some phototransformation products may have a higher environmental risk potential than the respective parent compounds because some phototransformation products exhibited a higher bacterial toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Natural fiber {{reinforced}} polymer composites {{have gained}} their {{popularity in the}} composite research because of versatility and diversified nature of their applications (Gay et al., 2003). This {{is due to a}} range of potential advantages of natural fibers, especially with regard to their environmental performance. Natural fibers are renewable resources and even when their composite wastes are incinerated, they do not cause net emission of carbon dioxide to the environment. They are <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable,</b> which may be beneficial (Aquino et al., 2007; Singleton et al., 2003; Verpoest et al., 2010). Among all the natural reinforcing fibrous materials, silk appears to be a promising fiber due to its high toughness and aspect ratio in comparison with other natural reinforcements. Moreover, the mechanical properties of silk fibers consist of a combination of high strength, extensibility, and compressibility. On the other hand, maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and commercial grade polypropylene (PP) are commonly used matrices for fiber-reinforced composites due to their good interfacial bonding properties (Karmarkar et al., 2007; Wambua et al., 2003). In this chapter, both raw and alkali treated silk fibers are taken into consideration to characterize their properties first. The specific objective is to determine the modulus and strain to failure of the single silk fiber. Other aims of this work are to fabricate the unidirectional silk fiber reinforced polymer (MAPP and commercial grade PP) matrix composites by varying fiber volume fraction and to determine their mechanical properties such as tensile strength, flexure strength, impact strength, and hardness. ...|$|E
40|$|As the United States slowly {{transitions}} from coal and foreign oil to more renewable energy sources, domestic {{natural gas is}} being utilized as an intermediate "bridge fuel". Advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have increased gas extraction and exploration {{over the past ten}} years. The massive quantities of fluids used to fracture gas-producing shale plays contain potentially toxic chemicals and the wastes are highly saline and contain naturally occurring radioactive materials. It is unclear if there are risks to shallow drinking water aquifers and if the chemical constituents of fracking fluid are <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable</b> if released into the environment. Monitoring the fate of these chemicals as they enter the environment is critical to understanding potential health hazards and persistence. Here, groundwater monitoring for organic compounds coupled with spatial data analysis indicates no subsurface contamination from hydraulic fracturing of the Marcellus Shale in northeastern Pennsylvania. However, a chemical fingerprint is presented suggesting increased organic compounds in shallow groundwater are due to subsurface mixing with brine containing geogenic hydrocarbons from the Marcellus Shale. To investigate the fate and extent of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and the associated wastes if released into the environment, bench-scale reactor experiments were performed. These reactors contained a synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluid and activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. Bulk organic carbon decreased upwards of 76 ± 2 % in a freshwater mixture and 69 ± 2 % in a 10, 000 mg L- 1 NaCl saline solution. Furthermore, gasoline range organic compounds degraded over 99 ± 1 % for both solutions while diesel range organic compounds recorded significantly less degradation in the saline solution than the freshwater solution (68 ± 2 % and 92 ± 1 %, respectively). Recalcitrant compounds of interest proved to be in the higher-molecular weight range of diesel range organic constituents. Additionally, salinity decreased the initial concentrations of both gasoline range and diesel range organic compounds in the synthetic frack solution. To explain the concentration differences in the saline reactors, the compound losses due to volatilization were quantified and further loss mechanisms were suspected to be sorption to particle surfaces.

40|$|One of {{the four}} steps within Council Regulation 793 / 93 /EEC on the {{evaluation}} and control of existing chemicals is the priority setting step. The priority setting step is concerned with selecting high-priority substances from {{a large number of}} substances, initially starting with 2, 474 high-production-volume chemicals. In {{order to be able to}} efficiently carry out the priority setting step, an automated priority setting method was developed, the so-called European Union risk ranking method (EURAM). The EURAM produces rankings among the high-production-volume chemicals appearing in the International Uniform Chemical Information Database (IUCLID). As part of a publication series, this paper deals with the data selection criteria used in EURAM and furthermore with data validation of the selected data. To validate the selected data in EURAM, comparisons are made with validated data of priority chemicals for which European Union risk assessment reports have been completed or with data of priority chemicals from the Screening Information Data Set initial assessment reports of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Regression analysis between the selected data in EURAM and the data selected by expert judgment in the assessment procedure resulted in good correlation for physicochemical properties and aquatic toxicity data. In addition, the type of biodegradation (i. e., readily biodegradable, <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable,</b> or nonbiodegradable) selected by EURAM also was in agreement with the type of biodegradation selected by expert judgment in the risk assessment procedure. Hence, the good correlation between the automated data selection procedure of EURAM and the data selection by expert judgment indicates that the data selection criteria of EURAM, which are developed in order to select data for priority purposes among high-production-volume chemicals in IUCLID, seem to perform well.

40|$|Biosurfactants are {{compounds}} that exhibit surface activity (e. g., reduce surface and interfacial tension) and {{are derived from}} natural, biological sources. They are considered green substances due to their natural derivation, biodegradability, and relatively low toxicity. Biosurfactants from multiple classes {{have been shown to}} interact with metals, and a review of these interactions is provided. Rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are attracting attention for metal remediation applications. The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate rhamnolipids' ability to complex rare earth elements, determine the environmental compatibility of novel rhamnolipid diastereomers, and assess the efficacy of rhamnolipid as a collector in ion flotation. Previous research shows rhamnolipids selectively bind elements of environmental concern over common soil and water cations, but there had been no examination of transition metals from the f-block of the periodic table. The f-block elements include the rare earth elements, which are a vital component of nearly every modern technology and subject to supply risk. The interaction between monorhamnolipids and the rare earth elements was investigated by determining conditional stability constants using a resin-based ion exchange method. For the 27 metals examined, the conditional stability constants could be divided into three groups, albeit somewhat subjectively: weakly, moderately, and strongly bound. UO 22 +, Eu 3 +, Nd 3 +, Tb 3 +, Dy 3 +, La 3 +, Cu 2 +, Al 3 +, Pb 2 +, Y 3 +, Pr 3 +, and Lu 3 +are strongly bound with conditional stability constants ranging from 9. 82 to 8. 20; Cd 2 +, In 3 +, Zn 2 +, Fe 3 +, Hg 2 +, and Ca 2 + are moderately bound with stability constants ranging from 7. 17 to 4. 10; and Sr 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, UO 22 +, Cs+, Ba 2 +, Mn 2 +, Mg 2 +, Rb+, and K+ are weakly bound with stability constants ranging from 3. 95 to 0. 96. The uranyl ion is reported twice due to the ion demonstrating two distinct binding regions. The conditional stability constants were demonstrated to be an effective predictor of metal removal order. The metal parameters of enthalpy of hydration and ionic charge to radius ratio were shown to be determinants of complexation strength. Naturally produced rhamnolipids are a mixture of congeners. Synthetic rhamnolipid synthesis has recently enabled production of four monorhamnolipid diastereomers of a single congener. The biodegradability, acute toxicity (Microtox assay), embryo toxicity (Zebrafish assay), and metal binding capacity of the diastereomers was investigated and compared to natural monorhamnolipid. Biodegradability testing showed all the diastereomers were <b>inherently</b> <b>biodegradable.</b> By the Microtox assay, all of the monorhamnolipids were categorized as slightly toxic by Environmental Protection Agency ecotoxicity categories. Out of 22 parameters tested, the zebrafish toxicity assay showed only diastereomer toxicity for the mortality parameter, except for diastereomer R,R which showed no toxic effects. All the monorhamnolipids interacted with both Cd 2 + and Pb 2 +. Ion flotation is one possible technology for metal recovery and remediation of metal contaminated waters. Ion flotation utilizes charged surfactants to collect and concentrate non-surface active ions at the surface of an aerated solution. Rhamnolipid's suitability as a collector in ion flotation was investigated. A flotation column was designed to test monorhamnolipid efficacy as a collector. Monorhamnolipids form foams and effectively remove Cs+, Cd 2 +, and La 3 + from solution. The efficacy of the flotation process relies on the collector:colligend ratio and valency of the colligend. Flotation of metal solutions showed a removal order of Cd 2 +>La 3 +>>Cs+ when the metals were present individually and mixed at equimolar concentrations. When mixed at order of magnitude different concentrations, the flotation order was Cd 2 +>>Cs+>>La 3 +. These studies show rhamnolipid has potential to be used for environmentally-compatible metal recovery and metalliferous water remediation, especially for the rare earth elements...|$|E
