40|$|Background and Objectives: Waste {{produced}} by health and treatment centers (hospitals) including medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> {{is one of}} the sources of municipal waste production. Waste {{produced by}} medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> due to the existence of pathogens and infectious materials by high importance {{is one of the}} environmental issues. This survey has been done on the qualitative-quantitative analytical bases, and the investigation has focused on the management strategies of the waste material of medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Rasht, Iran in 2009. Methods: In this descriptive study, samples were collected from 19 medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Rasht in 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday every week), after filling the questionnaire and interviewing with the managers. Then, the samples were separated manually, and divided into 46 different constituents and weighed. Next, the constituents were classified based on characteristics and potentiality of being hazardous. Results: The total amount of annual waste production by the medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Rasht is 25785. 143 kg. In this study, the share of manufacturing conventional waste (domestic type wastes), especially infectious, chemical, pharmaceutical, and radioactive wastes were 1. 16 %, 95. 34 %, 1. 42 % and 2. 08 %, respectively. The highest and lowest amount of waste production relates to plastic materials and wood which are 48. 37 and 0. 43 %, respectively. In this study sharp cutting things were calculated to be 10. 52 %. Furthermore, 84 percent of the managers of the medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories</b> had not had enough information of the circulars and instructions on the enforceable management strategies of the medical wastes. Conclusion: Concerning the management of the medical waste production in the medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratories,</b> it is suggested that the managers and the personnel be trained on the separation, collection, and disinfection techniques and final disposal, and the wastes have to be treated per regulations and instructions...|$|R

Optimal treatment for cancer involves accurately identifying patients for risk-stratified therapy. Those with a rapid response to initial treatment may benefit from truncated treatment regimens, showing the value of accurate disease response measures. Cell-free miRNA are highly stable in blood, are overexpressed in cancer and are quantifiable within the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>laboratory.</b> In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, plasma miR-21, miR-494, and miR-1973 are promising disease response biomarkers. Circulating miRNAs {{have the potential to}} assist clinical decision making and aid interpretation of positron emission tomography combined with computerized tomography.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} March, {{veterinary}} organizations {{reported more}} than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, and experts expected the death toll to number in the thousands, with one online database already self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 8500 animal deaths, including at least 1950 cats and 2200 dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part {{because there is no}} centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). For this reason, many sources speculate {{the full extent of the}} pet deaths and sicknesses caused by the contamination may never be known. In October, the results of the [...] "AAVLD survey of pet food-induced nephrotoxicity in North America, April to June 2007," [...] were reported, indicating 347 of 486 cases voluntarily reported by 6 June 2007 had met the diagnostic criteria, with most of the cases reported from the United States, but also including cases of 20 dogs and 7 cats reported from Canada.The cases involved 235 cats and 112 dogs, with 61 percent of the cats and 74 percent of the dogs having died. Dr. Barbara Powers, AAVLD president and director of the Colorado State University Veterinary <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Laboratory,</b> said the survey probably found only a percentage of the actual cases. She also said the mortality rate is not likely to be representative of all cases, because survey respondents had more information to submit for animals that had died. A number of dogs were also reported affected in Australia, with four in Melbourne and a few more in Sydney. No legal action or repercussions have as yet occurred regarding these cases. Dr. Powers elaborated further: “But there absolutely could be more deaths from the tainted pet food.... This survey didn’t catch all the deaths that happened. In order to be counted in our survey, you had to meet certain criteria.... If someone had a pet that died and they buried it in their back, they weren’t eligible for our survey. We had to have confirmed exposure to the recalled pet food, proof of toxicity, and clinical signs of renal failure. So this is only a percentage of the deaths that are out there. There’s no way to guess how many pets were affected.” ...|$|E
