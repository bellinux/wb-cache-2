Consequently, our foreign representatives have been accustomed to live in garrets--sometimes on the roof. Being poor men, it has been the best they could do on the salary which the Government has paid them. How could they adequately return the hospitalities shown them? It was impossible. It would have exhausted the salary in three months. Still, it was their official duty to entertain their influentials after some sort of fashion; and they did the best they could with their limited purse. <b>In</b> <b>return</b> for champagne they furnished lemonade; <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for game they furnished ham; <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for whale they furnished sardines; <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for liquors they furnished condensed milk; <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for the battalion of liveried and powdered flunkeys they furnished the hired girl; <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for the fairy wilderness of sumptuous decorations they draped the stove with the American flag; <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for the orchestra they furnished zither and ballads by the family; <b>in</b> <b>return</b> for the ball--but they didn't return the ball, except in cases where the United States lived on the roof and had room.|$|R

He won the canvass, defeating Democrat Matthew Flournoy 38,587 to 30,491. In his first address to the legislature, he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime.

5|$|The Kingdom of Armenia {{between the}} Black Sea and Caspian Sea became {{a focus of}} {{contention}} between Rome and the Parthian Empire, {{and control of the}} region was repeatedly gained and lost. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission from 37 AD but in 47 AD the Romans retook control of the kingdom and offered it client kingdom status. Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign between 55 and 63 AD against the Parthian Empire, which had again invaded Armenia. After gaining Armenia once more in 60 AD and subsequently losing it again in 62 AD, the Romans sent Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo in 63 AD into the territories of Vologases I of Parthia. Corbulo succeeded <b>in</b> <b>returning</b> Armenia to Roman client status, where it remained for the next century.|$|E

Debt-based funding involves a sponsor lending money to the project, {{with the promise of}} their investment being returned plus interest. Donation-based crowd funding involves a donor investing out of altruistic interest, without any interest in financial or material rewards <b>in</b> <b>return.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{team was}} one of 20 to receive an {{invitation}} to the Tour de France. Contador, Leipheimer, and Armstrong were all named to the team. There was much speculation and controversy, which began when Armstrong first signed with the team, over who would be the team's protected rider in the Tour. Though Armstrong's express goal <b>in</b> <b>returning</b> from retirement was to win an eighth Tour de France, Contador had won his last three Grand Tours and insisted that he deserved leadership of the team and hinted that he might leave if forced to support Armstrong. Bruyneel assured Contador that he would be the leader before the season began. Contador was also publicly named team leader shortly before the Tour began.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} saw the {{departure}} of Hartwell {{and the addition of}} Cynthia Bailey and Phaedra Parks. The main lineup remained unchanged during the fourth season, although Marlo Hampton joined as a friend of the housewives. Whitfield exited the series upon the conclusion of the fourth season, and was replaced by Porsha Williams and Kenya Moore in the fifth season. Zolciak departed from the program {{in the middle of the}} fifth season. The departure of Zolciak made Leakes the only remaining original cast member as of season six; however, Zolciak commented that she might be interested <b>in</b> <b>returning</b> to the series. In the seventh season, Williams became a friend of the housewives, alongside new cast member Demetria McKinney, while Claudia Jordan was introduced as a main housewife.|$|E
5|$|After a hotel {{housing the}} {{remaining}} foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which {{was conducted by}} an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role <b>in</b> <b>returning</b> him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the Imperial Economic Conference, Lyons {{appointed}} Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom it was to remain his and Ethel's home {{for the rest of their}} lives. His first task in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia's burgeoning government debts, the repayment of which was crippling Depression-era Australia. Over two years, he negotiated with the Westminster Bank and the British Government for loan conversions worth £84 million, which saved Australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with the Ottawa Agreements were significant in helping alleviate the Australian government's budgetary difficulties. Bruce was asked at several points during the 1930s to return to Australia by UAP backers and other political figures, who hoped that he could replace Lyons as prime minister. He himself had questioned Lyons' health and capacity to execute the role effectively, but he showed little interest <b>in</b> <b>returning.</b> In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing Lyons, but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week of release, the PS3 version of A Realm Reborn placed second in Japan's sales charts, with 184,000 {{physical}} copies sold. In late October 2013, Square Enix announced that the game had one and a half million registrations. It was the 16th best selling personal computer game of 2013 in the United States. In Japan, the PlayStation 3 version was ranked 32 in sales, with 244,574 retail copies sold. Following an extremely poor fiscal year 2013, Square Enix executives commended the game's sales and subscriptions for its role <b>in</b> <b>returning</b> the company to profitability in 2014. As of July 2016, the game had over 6 million cumulative players, a figure which excludes free trial members. Yoshida has repeatedly emphasized that the robust success of A Realm Reborn was due to its traditional monthly subscription model. He sees the free-to-play model as an unreliable source of income predicated on devoting a lot of development resources to monthly consumable or cosmetic items in order to maintain profitability, leaving little time left for higher quality story and battle content. He also disclosed that over 80% of players are satisfied with the subscription model and theorized that this is due to players' confidence in a steady stream of quality content because of their subscription. With the traditional model, the player base grows over time as people see the game expand, unlike a free-to-play game which can boast a huge initial player base which changes dramatically in size and revenue from month to month. Yoshida has no plans to change to a free-to-play model in the near future.|$|E

He was {{assigned}} to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division on March 16, 1967, and conducting a search and destroy mission with his company when his company came under attack from a Viet Cong battalion. Half of a platoon was pinned down under enemy fire, and Mendez volunteered to lead a squad to assist the pinned-down Marines <b>in</b> <b>returning</b> to friendly lines with their two dead and two seriously wounded. Mendez exposed himself and opened fire on the enemy. His platoon commander, Lieutenant Ronald Castille, was seriously wounded and he fell, unable to move. Mendez shielded him with his body as he applied a dressing to the wound, he picked up the lieutenant and started to carry him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. Mendez was hit in the shoulder, yet he chose to act as rear man and he continued to shield his lieutenant with his own body until he was mortally wounded. Mendez was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and promoted to sergeant.|$|E
