The premise here is that capital is developed within the design studio, that is, designers-to-be and educators-to-be are <b>encultured</b> <b>into</b> design while studying/teaching design. This can be paralleled with the notion that parents enculture children into families and families/friends enculture young people into society. This paper begins by defining and introducing the concept of cultural capital, a body of knowledge that acts as an asset in particular situations; our study focuses on knowledge that is useful to being a designer/design educator. We continue by exploring what kinds of capital designers have and what role this capital plays in the educational scenario. Four key themes are identified as relating to the cultural capital of nineteen design educators from different geographical locations in the western world. These themes result from analysing educators’ intimate narratives, which reveal some of the values, beliefs and actions inherent to design. Furthermore, the themes illustrate a sampling of the design educators’ thesaurus, i. e. what design educators draw upon for teaching and designing. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s and early 1990 s, much {{attention}} was paid by British agricultural geographers to {{the restructuring of}} the farm sector under pressures of national, European and global change. The need to adopt a perspective capable of looking beyond the farm gate inspired the introduction of modified political economy approaches into agricultural research. One important cornerstone of the empirical application of this thesis was {{the concept of the}} ‘farm adjustment strategy’. This attempted to map out the responses, especially those of survival, made by farm family businesses to rapidly changing agrarian conditions. Subsequently, the farm adjustment strategy became remarkable for its popularity as a way to organise research into agricultural change in developed market economies. Following a retreat in the 1990 s, there has been something of a recent revival {{in the use of the}} term ‘strategy’ relating to agricultural adjustment. Revisiting this concept is therefore timely. Using empirical evidence from studies of farming change in the Welsh Marches, this paper examines two issues. First, it makes a critical reexamination of the concept to resolve differences with interpretation linked to theoretical perspectives so that future misuse can be minimised. Second, an attempt is made to assess the relevance of defined elements of farm adjustment strategies to analyses of farm business change. In so doing, there is an attempt to recover our knowledge of agrarian restructuring and to help situate newly <b>encultured</b> investigations <b>into</b> the likely survival of family labour-based forms of production...|$|R
