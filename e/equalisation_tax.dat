40|$|The wine <b>equalisation</b> <b>tax</b> (WET), {{introduced}} by the A New Tax System (Wine <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Tax)</b> Act 1999 (Cth), is, in essence, a wholesale sales tax on certain wine containing a specified content of potable alcohol that is sold for consumption in Australia. The apparent fiscal purpose of the Act is to reduce and recoup the public costs of alcohol abuse. The hallmarks of sound tax legislation are traditionally encapsulated in the tax policy principles of simplicity, equity, economic efficiency and fiscal adequacy. This article explores {{the extent to which}} these hallmarks are reflected in the rules of the Act. The authors conclude that the WET is not a "good tax" in light of any of the principles, and its deficiencies raise the threshold issue of whether alcohol taxation is an appropriate way to address the public costs of alcohol abuse.

40|$|In a decentralised tax system, {{the effects}} of tax {{policies}} enacted by one government are not confined to its own jurisdiction. First, if both the regional and the federal levels of government co-occupy the same fields of taxation, tax rate increases by one layer of government will reduce taxes collected by the other. Second, if the tax base is mobile, tax rate increases by one regional government will raise the amount of taxes collected by other regional governments. These sources of fiscal interdependence are called in the literature vertical and horizontal tax externalities, respectively. Third, as Smart (1998) shows, if equalisation transfers are present, {{an increase in the}} standard <b>equalisation</b> <b>tax</b> rate provides incentives to raise taxes to the receiving provinces. A way to check the empirical relevance of these hypotheses is to test for the existence of interactions between the regional tax rate, on the one hand, and the federal tax rate, the tax rate set by competing regions, and the standard <b>equalisation</b> <b>tax</b> rate, on the other hand. Following this approach, this paper estimates provincial tax setting functions with data on Canadian personal income taxation for the period 1982 – 1996. We find a significant positive response of provincial tax rates to changes in the federal income tax rate, the tax rates of competing provinces, and the standard equalisation rate (only for receiving provinces). We also find that the reaction to horizontal competition is stronger in the provinces that do not receive equalisation transfers.

This also explains why welfare differences are negligibly small across the fiscal union scenarios. Even when introducing risk premia on government bonds, this general finding is not changed - although risk premia per se decrease welfare notably. We further perform a counterfactual exercise analysing the effects of what would have happened had a fiscal union regime been installed at the start of EMU already.

40|$|No {{detailed}} analysis of the fiscal and economic inequalities of local units (at the municipality and city level) in Croatia has ever been published. The Government and the Finance Ministry have endeavoured by tax sharing, allocations of current grants and personal income tax refunds to palliate the differences in the fiscal capacities of local units.

The paper, then, tests out the hypothesis that the existing Croatian model of horizontal fiscal equalisation is ineffective, for the Government and the Finance Ministry do not, with their poorly targeted financial instruments (personal income tax sharing, current grants and personal income tax refunds), manage to bring about palliation of the differences among the fiscal capacities of the local units, on the contrary, they tend to increase them. fiscal <b>equalisation,</b> <b>tax</b> sharing, personal income tax, personal income, tax refund, fiscal capacity, Croatia...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{effectiveness}} of local <b>tax</b> <b>equalisation</b> across English local authorities since 1981 is evaluated. Two specific aims of equalisation policies are identified. Proportional rate equalisation implies that variations in needs and resources should be neutralised and that tax levels should depend on local spending decisions. Strict rate equalisation implies that local taxes should not exceed the levels specified by central government. The statistical evidence indicates that neither of these aims has been achieved since 1981. The main obstacles to proportional rate equalisation are differences in grant funding and inadequate compensation for variations in needs and resources. The main obstacle to strict rate equalisation is incrementalism in local budgeting. The implications of the planned reforms of local government finance are analysed. It is concluded that equalisation {{may be more effective}} under the new system of local taxes and central grants. ...|$|R

40|$|In Western economies, the {{concrete}} design of fiscal federalism {{is determined by}} the status the federation grants to regionally comparable economic and social conditions, and to what extent this status is anchored in the constitution. If the political and social acceptance of regional differences is high, the significance of regional equalisation is low and vice versa. In the case of great regional differences fiscal equalisation could be overburdened by the task of reducing fiscal strength. Moreover, if the political and social acceptance is lacking, regional policy interventions of the federal level is appropriate to support the regional economic convergence rather than fiscal equalisation. However, in high-performing economies organized as federations, comparably weak institutions such as those in Russia are largely unknown. In this sense, international experience makes it clear that strong and well-designed institutional arrangements between the different governmental levels are an important precondition for a high-performing fiscal system. In other words, {{to take advantage of the}} potential efficiency gains offered by fiscal federalism, the vertical co-ordination of revenue and expenditure responsibilities between the different governmental levels should be clarified.

40|$|In most {{countries}} special excise and other taxes are imposed on beer, wine and spirits. Both {{the tax base}} and tax rates usually vary across products and across countries. This paper reviews the market failure arguments for special taxation of alcoholic beverages, evaluates {{the pros and cons}} of different externality correction taxes in terms of the tax base and tax rate, and uses the results to suggest reform of the special taxation of alcohol in Australia. Excessive alcohol consumption involves external costs, including road accidents, violence and crime, extra health care costs, and a part of the loss of lower labour remuneration. Alcohol consumption by volume across the different products is the suggested special tax base. The market failure correction tax rate applied to all alcohol beverages would be a weighted average of the marginal external cost for different categories of consumers classified by different levels of external cost. A special tax on all alcohol consumed required for administrative reasons is a relatively blunt instrument, and the tax likely would be complemented by more targeted instruments such as provision of information and education, restrictions on consumption by youth and drivers.

We used annual sales data and taxation rates for 2010 as the base case. Main outcome measures: Alcohol consumption, taxation revenue, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and health care costs averted. Results: In 2010, the Australian Government collected close to $ 8. 6 billion from alcohol taxation. All four of the proposed variations to current rates of alcohol excise were shown to save money and more effectively reduce alcohol-related harm compared with the 2010 base case. Abolishing the WET {{and replacing it with}} a volumetric tax on wine would increase taxation revenue by $ 1. 3 billion per year, reduce alcohol consumption by 1. 3 %, save $ 820 million in health care costs and avert 59 000 DALYs. The alternative scenarios would lead to even higher taxation receipts and greater reductions in alcohol use and harm. Conclusions: Our research findings suggest that any of the proposed variations to current rates of alcohol excise would be a cost-effective health care intervention; they thus reinforce the evidence that taxation is a cost-effective strategy. Of all the scenarios, perhaps the most politically feasible policy option {{at this point in time}} is to abolish the WET and replace it with a volumetric tax on wine.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{question}} the relevance of the theoretical foundations of tax interactions between actors within the framework of administrative decentralisation in Cameroon. Indeed, the theoretical research reflects two explanatory logics to these interactions. The first assumes the potential mobility of tax-bases of Tiébout (1956), Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986), Wildasin (1988) and Hoyt (1991). The second is based on the agency relationship between the actors through the assumption of political competition comparison by Hirschman (1970), Brennan and Buchanan (1980). In Cameroon, a theoretical study of decentralisation shows that the legislature opted for a part in a <b>tax</b> <b>equalisation</b> as a solution to the phenomenon of spatial segregation or 'social apartheid' and to the other hand to a centralised tax management level of the central government to curb the dangers of the mobility of the tax-base and political sanction by the population - voter. Therefore, two major lessons from this: first, 'the local tax policy is specific to each country and takes into account the contextual specificities' and second, 'the choice of tax decentralisation must take into account the mobility of tax-bases'. administrative decentralisation; tax interaction; tax base mobility; political competition; spatial segregation; Cameroon; agency relationship; taxation; tax equalisation; centralised tax management; tax decentralisation...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} the developments in production structures in Finnish regions {{and the differences}} in regional income levels and the causes that affect them in an integrating global economy {{as well as the}} challenges facing regional policies. The increasing openness of the world economy, the increasing competition it causes and its effect on Finland 2 ̆ 019 s regions is the central task of this study. We combine the classical theory of international trade based on comparative advantage about the specialisation of countries with the approach of the new economic geography and agglomeration forces about the specialisation of regions inside countries. The study is a pioneer in Finland because similar analysis of regional production structures and specialisation has not been done before. We find that the so-called agglomeration forces drive the location of production in Finland. These regional agglomeration forces are the economic size of the region and closeness to markets (so-called market potential), distance between companies producing intermediate and final products, scale effects, and the educational level and R&D activities. Centralisation of production also requires that workforce is willing to relocate and that the productivity growth in core areas is faster than on average. Because labour mobility is such a central requirement for production agglomeration the study also examines migration within Finland in the past 50 years. For regional policies the conclusion of the study is that agglomeration forces should not be constrained if they lead to and are caused by faster productivity growth in core regions. In Finland there are significant differences in public sector services per capita in different regions so that regions with low wage and tax revenues have more public sector services in per capita terms than the core regions.
