This political leverage has been used to obtain funding for yeshivas and community institutions, to obtain a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>exemption</b> for Haredi Yeshiva students from military service, and to pass legislation regarding observance of the Shabbat and kosher ("dietary") laws, often to the consternation of secular Israelis.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of the tax system on the {{economic}} factors that triggered the financial crisis. We examine three cases in which the tax regime interacted with these factors, reinforcing them. First, we focus on the taxation of residential building: while the importance of capital gains taxes is disputed, the deductibility of mortgage interest {{may have contributed to the}} financial crisis by creating some of the raw materials for the securitization industry. Second, a narrow perspective on the tax treatment, together with specific provisions, may have fostered performance-based remuneration of managers, resulting in overemphasis of short-term profitability and incentive to excessive risk-taking. Third, the securitization process, which played a key role in the outbreak of the financial crisis, was accompanied by opportunities for tax arbitrage and reduction of the overall tax wedge paid by investors, through offset of incomes that are ordinarily taxed at different rates; a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>exemption</b> of CDS premiums received by non-residents supplemented the tax arbitrage. taxation, financial crisis, housing market, stock options, securitization, credit default swaps...|$|E

They include {{a broad range of}} trade protection measures, subsidies, de jure and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>exemptions</b> from antitrust statutes, labor market adjustments, and industry-specific assistance to enhance the use of new technology. Rather than producing a broad range of goods, the Japanese selected a few areas in which they could develop high-quality goods to produce in vast quantities at competitive prices. A good example is the camera industry, which since the 1960s has been dominated by Japan.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} the main {{changes in the}} Hungarian labor market since 1989. They focus especially on changes in behavior in state and privatized firms, since the shedding and restructuring of labor {{are at the heart}} of the transition. They describe five types of firms: 1) state firms (often in bad shape and/or natural monopolies); 2) firms privatized by insiders; 3) firms privatized by outside (but domestic) investors; 4) new small-scale ("de novo") private firms. The state and de novo firms are increasingly outside the tax system - the state firms by <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> tax <b>exemptions,</b> the <b>de</b> novo firms through tax evasion. As the de novo sector grows, the effective tax yield will tend to fall, shifting the tax burden to the other three types of firms. Subsidizing the growth of the private sector may have been desirable initially, but it is dynamically undesirable. It is important to change the distribution of the tax burden, while setting tax rates that enhance the growth of labor. Thetype of growth seen in the last four years is probably not sustainable. With tax evasion high, average payroll taxes in the taxable sector have until recently risen sharply. Social insurance spending and other labor taxes represented about 34 percent of hourly compensation costs in 1992 - significantly more proportionately than in OECD and most transition economies. And high contribution rates together with apparent real wage rigidity have depressed the rate of job creation in the taxed sectors. Wage levels are lower than in neighboring countries but higher than in other transition economies. Despite adverse shocks to output and employment, consumption wages have risen slightly and unit labor costs have clearly increased. The authors emphasize the continuing loss of employment and its changing distribution in terms of ownership, sector, and taxation - as well as associated changes in unemployment that have resulted from the asymmetric paths of the state and private sectors.

40|$|The {{preceding}} chapter {{summarized the}} main features of low-wage work across our six countries. In this chapter and the next, we attempt to explain the main institutional determinants of the size and nature of low-wage work in each country. In this chapter, we focus on national institutions involved in setting workers' pay. In the next chapter, we complement our analysis of pay-setting with a review of national institutions that affect labor supply, including unemployment benefits and other income support programs, education and training policy, and immigration. The results of the case studies suggest that “pay-setting institutions” {{play a central role}} in explaining international differences in low-wage work. By pay-setting institutions, we refer to the formal and sometimes informal mechanisms used to determine the wages (and benefits) received by workers in different industries and occupations within each country. More specifically, we mean collective-bargaining arrangements, minimum wages, and other labor and product market legislation, regulations, and procedures that have an impact on wage determination. Our review of national pay-setting institutions has two main findings. First, the prevalence of low-wage work appears to be strongly related to the "inclusiveness" of national pay-setting institutions. The more "inclusive" the pay-setting institutions, the lower the prevalence of low-wage work. The most inclusive systems use centralized and coordinated national collective bargaining agreements to extend the wage gains of the most powerful, generally unionized, workers to those workers with less bargaining power, especially less-skilled and fnon-union workers. Some countries, meanwhile, provide a degree of inclusiveness through a national minimum wage that extends a wage floor below workers who would otherwise have little ability to secure higher wages. The least inclusive countries, such as the United States, rely on largely unregulated market forces to set wages. The second key finding of our pay-setting analysis is the important role played by employer "exit options" [...] de jure or <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>exemptions,</b> exceptions, or loopholes in otherwise inclusive pay-setting institutions. Non-standard work contracts, for example, may fall outside of national collective bargaining agreements, allowing employers to set low wages even in countries with extensive collective bargaining. Lax enforcement of existing labor law, particularly in contexts where there is little or no union oversight, can provide another exit option for firms seeking to cut labor costs. Gender, ethnicity, national origin, region of residence, and other factors all play a role in explaining differences in wages paid across industry and occupation, but we concentrate here on institutional structures that are explicitly designed to determine what workers earn. The most important of these institutions in most of our countries is the national system of collective bargaining. The national minimum wage is probably the next most important national pay-setting institution, and is particularly important in countries where collective bargaining is limited in its reach. We also stress that a largely unregulated competitive labor market is a key pay-setting institution, with important implications for the prevalence of low-wage work, particularly in the absence of strong collective bargaining or a binding national minimum wage. Two less obvious pay-setting institutions are non-standard work arrangements (such as part-time and temporary work) and product-market regulations. The many complex and evolving forms of non-standard work arrangements grant different rights and responsibilities to firms and workers, frequently shifting the relative bargaining power of employers and employees with direct effects on low-wage work. Efforts to open product markets to national and international competition often increase competitive pressures on national workers, especially by putting national workers in direct competition with workers from other countries. The rest of this chapter looks, in turn, at the "inclusiveness" of collective bargaining arrangements and national minimum wages; non-standard work arrangements and product-market deregulation as opportunities for "exit options" from the generally more inclusive national pay-setting systems; and, finally, at issues related to pay-setting at the firm level...|$|R

40|$|<b>De</b> <b>facto</b> states, {{defined as}} {{entities}} that possess {{control over a}} defined territory, population, and government, but without recognition from other states, have become increasingly important {{over the past three}} decades. Although the universe of cases is small (there have been 24 <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states since the 1960 s), <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states {{play an important role in}} regional security and stability. Despite this relevance, we still know little about why <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states emerge, how their preferences are formed, and what shapes their behaviour and decision-making. Shedding light on these overlooked issues will allow us to better understand the role of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states in regional and international politics. The existing literature, although insightful, does not fully explain the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. In particular, the literature has fallen short in explaining the behaviour of Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to better understand the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states, this thesis asks the following questions: what are the factors that shape and influence <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state preferences and behaviour? What are the factors that determine if a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state will declare independence or preserve the status quo? More specifically, in terms of the cases under examination, why did Kosovo and South Sudan declare independence, while Iraqi Kurdistan has not? The goal of this dissertation is to identify the conditions under which a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state may declare independence and when it may preserve the status quo. To address these questions, this thesis employs international relations theories and adopts a comparative analysis method to the behaviour of Kosovo, South Sudan, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Following extensive fieldwork in Iraqi Kurdistan, the thesis argues that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states will forgo independence when the parent state furnishes the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state with autonomy and offers sufficient economic incentives. Other mitigating factors include the domestic environment of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state and the parent state, the role of regional and international governments, and the presence or absence of the old regime of the parent state. The main point is that the preference for independence is neither fixed nor inevitable...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the concept of}} <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> (by fact) statelessness, often conceptualised as ineffective citizenship, from being included within the statelessness discourse.

This definition {{for the first time}} in the Territory resulted in LGBT people having a mechanism in the territory courts to resolve property disputes with their ex-partners. Prior to this reform, the non-financial contributions of a same-sex partner to a relationship could not be recognised in the same way as marriage or heterosexual <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> relationships.

The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has given}} rise to the number of non-state political actors such as <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. While scholarly attention has been given to the concept of sovereignty and to empirical analyses of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood, <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states as influential non-state political actors remained theoretically under-studied. This dissertation tackles the research question of how an issue that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states causes affects the likelihood of conflict between a parent and an external state. I examine the “opportunity and willingness” pre-theoretical framework of Most and Starr (1989) in order to comprehend how <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states cause inter-state military conflict. I argue that the process of fighting for <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood and the outcome of becoming a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state both create opportunity for the parent and external states. Moreover, internal dynamics in a state are important to understand whether the states are willing to exploit the interaction opportunity <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states generate. I especially examine regime type and levels of democracy in parent, external and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states and argue that when these are all democracies, v likelihood of militarized disputes decrease. Using the comparative method and most similar systems design, I analyze two cases: Kurdistan Regional Government, Iraq, Turkey and South Ossetia, Georgia, Russia.
