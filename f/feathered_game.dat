5|$|Chef François Massialot wrote Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois in 1691, {{during the}} reign of Louis XIV. The book {{contains}} menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a marinade is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and <b>feathered</b> <b>game,</b> while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.|$|E
60|$|We may remark {{in passing}} {{that the animals}} which those wrecked sailors called rabbits were in reality hares. Moreover, the men took an easy, perhaps unscientific, method of {{classifying}} <b>feathered</b> <b>game.</b> Nearly everything with wings that dwelt chiefly on lake, river, or sea they called ducks, and all the feathered creatures of the forest they styled partridges. From this simple classification, however, were excepted swans, geese, eagles, and hawks.|$|E

And as he talked he lost himself in the tale of it, and the very quality of his voice changed. He told of a land of wooded hill and pleasant vale, of clear water running over limestone down to the great river beyond, the Ohio--a land of glades, the fields of which were pied with flowers of wondrous beauty, where roamed the buffalo in countless thousands, where elk and deer abounded, and turkeys and <b>feathered</b> <b>game,</b> and bear in the tall brakes of cane. And, simply, he told how, when the others had left him, he stayed for three months roaming the hills alone with Nature herself.|$|E

50|$|Most {{religious}} observances {{are held}} with the balian presiding.

The religious ceremonies attending the celebration of the great buklog festival, held to propitiate the diwata or to celebrate an event of communal significance, are exclusively performed by the balian. In general, the functions of a balian are those of a medium who directs the living person’s communication with the spirits, of a priest who conducts sacrifices and rituals, and of a healer of the sick.|$|E

60|$|The {{old lady}} went {{away with her}} medicine, and Mr. Shaynor and I stamped on the tiled floor behind the counter to keep {{ourselves}} warm.

Three superb glass jars-- red, green, and blue--of the sort that led Rosamund to parting with her shoes--blazed in the broad plate-glass windows, and there was a confused smell of orris, Kodak films, vulcanite, tooth-powder, sachets, and almond- cream in the air. Mr. Shaynor fed the dispensary stove, and we sucked cayenne-pepper jujubes and menthol lozenges.

Fred and I hunted <b>feathered</b> small <b>game,</b> the others hunted deer, squirrels, wild turkeys, and such things. My uncle and the big boys were good shots. They killed hawks and wild geese and such like on the wing; and they didn't wound or kill squirrels, they stunned them. When the dogs treed a squirrel, the squirrel would scamper aloft and run out on a limb and flatten himself along it, hoping to make himself invisible in that way--and not quite succeeding. You could see his wee little ears sticking up. You couldn't see his nose, but you knew where it was. Then the hunter, despising a [...] "rest" [...] for his rifle, stood up and took offhand aim at the limb and sent a bullet into it immediately under the squirrel's nose, and down tumbled the animal, unwounded, but unconscious; the dogs gave him a shake and he was dead. Sometimes when the distance was great and the wind not accurately allowed for, the bullet would hit the squirrel's head; the dogs could do as they pleased with that one--the hunter's pride was hurt, and he wouldn't allow it to go into the gamebag.|$|R

50|$|The Cretan Hound uses both {{sight and}} scent {{on the hunt}} {{and they have a}} {{particular}} tendency to taste the aerial or ground scent, {{even to the point of}} sucking it from pebbles and stones. When the prey is sensed, the tail moves in circular fashion and the hound becomes rigid, moments before the chase begins. Meek, affectionate, aristocratic, yet deadly on the chase, it’s a polite hound that comes alive in the presence of prey; clean, gentle, elegant in form and movement, it’s never vulgar or overwhelming in gestures. Slightly reserved with strangers, it’s naturally inquisitive and tolerant. The Cretan Hound lives happily together with other domestic animals but will ruthlessly chase the neighbor’s cat! Excellent, gentle and very affectionate with children. It rarely barks but will give notice of strangers approaching its home; at the farm it will kill mice and rats and it’s not indifferent to <b>feathered</b> <b>game,</b> but the latter use will make the breed lazy and untidy in the hunt; its constitution needs the challenge of the true chase.|$|E
50|$|The vine ripens {{relatively}} quite late, producing good yields {{with high}} resistance to fungal disease and rot. The grape crossed with another Veneto wine grape, Marzemina bianca, to produce Raboso Veronese. It produces quite a large, tight, cylindrical bunch {{with one or}} two wings and a sturdy bunchstem. Its spheroid grape has a blue-black, very tough skin with good bloom. The flesh has a varietal, neutral flavour which is slightly meaty and sweet-acidulous-astringent.Each grape has two or three average-sized, pear-shaped seeds. This vigorous vine can produce an abundant yield. Optimal vinification requires appropriate maceration of juice and skins: this results in a full-bodied wine, acidic and tannic when young, ideal for laying down.Left to age in wooden barrels, it will gradually acquire a deep ruby colour with garnet tinges, a broad and full bouquet of wild violets with a concentrated note of morello cherry; the palate is dry, attractively astringent, and full-flavoured.At full maturity, Raboso Piave {{is one of the great}} Venetian reds, probably the best among the traditional wine of Eastern of Veneto. It is excellent with furred and <b>feathered</b> <b>game,</b> red meat, grilled meats and well-matured cheeses. It is also a superb sipping wine, an ideal accompaniment to long winter evenings in the company of friends.|$|E

6000|$|We {{would have}} you to wit, that on eggs though we sit, and are spiked on the spit, and are baked in the pan, Birds are older by far than your {{ancestors}} are, and made love and made war ere the making of Man! For when all things were dark, not a glimmer nor spark, and {{the world like a}} barque without rudder or sail Floated on through the night, 'twas a Bird struck a light, 'twas a flash from the bright feather'd Tonatiu's {3} tail! Then the Hawk {4} with some dry wood flew up in the sky, and afar, safe and high, the Hawk lit Sun and Moon, And the Birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere, and they recked not of care that should come on them soon. For the Hawk, so they tell, was then known as Pundjel, {5} and a- musing he fell {{at the close of the}} day; Then he went on the quest, as we thought, of a nest, with some bark of the best, and a clawful of clay. {6} And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name, without <b>feathers</b> (his <b>game</b> was a puzzle to all); Next around them he fluttered a-dancing, and muttered; and, lastly, he uttered a magical call: Then the figures of clay, as they featherless lay, they leaped up, who but they, and embracing they fell, And THIS was the baking of Man, and his making; but now he's forsaking his Father, Pundjel! Now these creatures of mire, they kept whining for fire, and to crown their desire who was found but the Wren? To the high heaven he came, from the Sun stole he flame, and for this has a name in the memory of men! {7} And in India who for the Soma juice flew, and to men brought it through without falter or fail? Why the Hawk 'twas again, and great Indra to men would appear, now and then, in the shape of a Quail, While the Thlinkeet's delight is the Bird of the Night, the beak and the bright ebon plumage of Yehl.{8} And who for man's need brought the famed Suttung's mead? why 'tis told in the creed of the Sagamen strong, 'Twas the Eagle god who brought the drink from the blue, and gave mortals the brew that's the fountain of song. {9} Next, who gave men their laws? and what reason or cause the young brave overawes when in need of a squaw, Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name, and his conduct you blame if he thus breaks the law? For you still hold it wrong if a lubra {10} belong to the self- same kobong {11} that is Father of you, To take HER as a bride to your ebony side; nay, you give her a wide berth; quite right of you, too. For her father, you know, is YOUR father, the Crow, and no blessing but woe from the wedding would spring. Well, these rules they were made in the wattle-gum shade, and were strictly obeyed, when the Crow was the King. {12} Thus on Earth's little ball to the Birds you owe all, yet your gratitude's small for the favours they've done, And their feathers you pill, and you eat them at will, yes, you plunder and kill the bright birds one by one; There's a price on their head, and the Dodo is dead, and the Moa has fled from the sight of the sun! ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} caponisation on live weight, weight gain, carcass {{characteristics}} and blood plasma values of pheasants were examined. Eighty pheasants reared in <b>feathered</b> <b>game</b> nurserie {{were included in}} experiment. The birds were castrated at 8 or 12 weeks of age. The age of castration up to 12 weeks showed complete testicular regeneration while when castration was performed at 8 weeks of age testicular regeneration reached 25 %. Pheasant capons, that were fed higher protein diet, showed lower live weights but higher dressing percentages than game pheasants. Weight and weight gain of pheasant capons were increased till December. Blood plasma values showed significantly higher levels (P< 0. 01) of Ca, total protein and albumin for pheasant capons but these differences were related to composition of feed mixtures. We concluded that pheasant capons fed higher protein diet represents better commercial product than pheasant reared as game animals but that more studies under different feeding conditions and alternative breeding systems are necessary to clarify the effects of caponisation of pheasants and to justify production.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of hanging {{position}} of hunted pheasant carcasses (secured by the head as compared to hanging position secured by the legs) on the biogenic amine concentration in the thigh and breast muscles. The carcasses of <b>feathered</b> <b>game</b> (Phasianus colchicus), left entirely untreated after hunting and placed in a storage space at a pre-set temperature of 7 °C for 21 days were used in the study. Samples of breast and thigh muscles were taken at regular weekly intervals. Measurement of biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, tryptamine, histamine, phenylethylamine) was based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Higher biogenic amine concentrations were detected in the muscles (both breast and thigh) of pheasants hanging by their legs compared to pheasants hanging by their heads (no statistically significant difference in biogenic amine concentration between monitored groups was, however, established). Higher concentrations of biogenic amines were found in the thigh muscles compared to breast muscles in both monitored groups. The obtained results show, that hanging the carcasses of pheasants during storage by the head is more suitable method in term of biogenic amine concentration than storing carcasses hanging by the legs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine and compare the levels of amino acids (AAs) in breast and thigh muscles of six species of <b>feathered</b> <b>game</b> of the same age.

The highest content of AAs was found in the chukar partridge (breast: 815. 7 ± 47. 71 g/kg; thigh: 771. 4 ± 107. 0 g/kg, on a dry matter basis), the lowest levels of AAs were found in Japanese quail (breast: 734. 2 ± 45. 07 g/kg) and grey partridge (thigh: 614. 9 ± 49. 66 g/kg). In all examined species, the level of histidine in breast muscles differed (P ≤ 0. 01) from that in thigh muscles. In all investigated species, the levels of essential AAs in breast muscles were higher (P ≤ 0. 01) than those in thigh muscles, whereas the levels of non-essential AAs in breast muscles were lower (P ≤ 0. 01) than those in thigh muscles. Breast muscles are therefore more valuable than thigh muscles because of the content of essential AAs...|$|E
