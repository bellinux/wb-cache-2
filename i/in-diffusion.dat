50|$|This MLD {{technique}} utilizes the crystalline {{nature of}} semiconductors and its self-limiting surface reaction properties to form highly uniform, self-assembled, covalently bonded dopant-containing monolayers {{followed by a}} subsequent annealing step for the incorporation and diffusion of dopants. The monolayer formation reaction is self-limiting, thereby, resulting in the deterministic coverage of dopant atoms on the surface. MLD differs from other conventional doping techniques such as spin-on-dopants (SODs) and gas phase doping techniques {{in the way of}} dopant dose control. Such control in MLD is much more precise due to the self-limiting formation of covalently attached dopants on the surface while the SODs just rely on the thickness control of the spin-on oxide and the gas phase technique depends on the control of dopant gas flow rate; therefore, the excellent dose control in MLD can yield the exact tuning of the resulting dopant profile. Compared to ion-implantation, MLD does not involve the energetic introduction of dopant species into the semiconductor lattice where crystal damages are induced. In the case of implantation, defects such as interstitials and vacancies are inevitably generated, which interact with the dopants to further broaden the junction profile. This is known as the transient-enhanced diffusion (TED), which limits the formation of good quality of USJs. Also, stochastic variation in the dopant positioning and sever stoichiometric imbalance are thus induced for binary and tertiary compound semiconductors by the implantation techniques. In contrast, all MLD dopant atoms are thermally diffused from the crystal surface to the bulk and the dopant profile can be easily controlled by the thermal budget. Since the MLD system can be classified as a limited source model, this is desirable for controlled USJ fabrication with high uniformity and low stochastic variation. Combined with the excellent dopant dose uniformity and coverage in MLD, it is especially attractive for doping nonplanar devices such as fin-FETs and nanowires. As a result, high quality sub-5 nm ultra-shallow junction has been demonstrated in silicon via the use of this MLD technique. Compared to low-energy ion-implantation into a screening film followed by <b>in-diffusion,</b> the MLD technique requires a lower thermal budget and allows conformal doping on topographic features.|$|E

Full-depth distribution of in-diffused Pt was studied by monitoring the acceptor level of Pts-/ 0 by the deep level and current transient spectroscopy.

The resulting Pts distribution can be controlled by the profile of radiation damage produced by helium ions while the amount of in-diffused Pts is set by the dose of platinum implantation. However, concentrations of in-diffused platinum remain more than one order below the magnitudes obtained by diffusion from PtSi layer.

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of metal impurities and {{their interactions with}} structural defects (e. g., dislocations) are deleterious {{to the performance of}} Si-based solar cell devices. To achieve higher minority carrier lifetimes that translate into higher solar cell efficiencies, novel growth methods with low dislocation densities and reduced metal impurity concentrations have recently been developed. These methods simultaneously aim to achieve low capital expense (capex), necessary to ensure rapid industry scaling. Monocrystalline Si grown by the non-contact crucible method (NOC-Si) has the potential to achieve high bulk minority carrier lifetimes and high efficiencies at low cost given its low structural defect density. Growth in large-diameter crucibles ensures high throughput consistent with low capex. However, high temperatures, coupled with conditions during Si growth (e. g., crucible and ambient gas) can lead to the <b>in-diffusion</b> of impurities, compromising the potential to achieve high efficiency solar cell devices. Herein, we report high minority-carrier lifetimes exceeding 3 milliseconds (ms) in n-type NOC-Si material, achieved through a strict impurity-control procedure at the growth stage that prevents <b>in-diffusion</b> of impurities to the melt, coupled with a tailored defect-engineering process via optimized phosphorus gettering...|$|E
