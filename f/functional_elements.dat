5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> of the brain. The {{essential}} {{function of}} the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of {{them are}} subunits of hexosaminidasenbsp&A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency {{in any one of}} these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.|$|E

25|$|The GLO/PI {{lines that}} have been {{duplicated}} in Petunia contain P. hybrida GLOBOSA1 (PhGLO1, also called FBP1) and also PhGLO2 (also called PMADS2 or FBP3). For the <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> equivalent to AP3/DEF in Petunia there is both a gene that possesses a relatively similar sequence, called PhDEF {{and there is also}} an atypical B function gene called PhTM6. Phylogenetic studies have placed the first three within the «euAP3» lineage, while PhTM6 belongs to that of «paleoAP3». It is worth pointing out that, in terms of evolutionary history, the appearance of the euAP3 line seems to be related with the emergence of dicotyledons, as representatives of euAP3-type B function genes are present in dicotyledons while paleoAP3 genes are present in monocotyledons and basal angiosperms, among others.|$|E
500|$|To {{determine}} {{the status of}} Accolade's claim of fair use of Sega's copyrighted game code, the court reviewed four criteria of fair use: {{the nature of the}} copyrighted work, the amount of the copyrighted work used, the purpose of use, and the effects of use on the market for the work. Of note to the judges in reviewing Sega's copyright claim was the difference in size between the TMSS file and the sizes of Accolade's games. As noted by Judge Reinhardt in writing the opinion of the court, the TMSS file [...] "contains approximately twenty to twenty-five bytes of data. Each of Accolade's games contains a total of 500,000 to 1,500,000 bytes. According to Accolade employees, the header file is the only portion of Sega's code that Accolade copied into its own game programs." [...] This made the games overwhelmingly original content, and according to Judge Reinhardt, to the benefit of the public to be able to compete with Sega's licensed games, especially if the games were dissimilar as contended in the appeal. The court did not accept the argument that Accolade's games competed directly with Sega's, noting that there was no proof that any of Accolade's published games had diminished the market for any of Sega's games. Despite claims from Sega's attorneys that the company had invested much time and effort into developing the Genesis, and that Accolade was capitalizing on this time and energy, the court rejected these claims under the notion that the console was largely functional, and its functional principles were not protected under the Copyright Act of 1976. On the matter of reverse engineering as a process, the court concluded that [...] "where disassembly {{is the only way to}} gain access to the ideas and <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} related {{theory is}} hierarchy theory, {{which refers to}} how systems of discrete <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> operate when linked at two or more scales. [...] For example, a forested landscape might be hierarchically composed of drainage basins, which in turn are composed of local ecosystems, which are in turn composed of individual trees and gaps. [...] Recent theoretical developments in landscape ecology have emphasized the relationship between pattern and process, {{as well as the}} effect that changes in spatial scale has on the potential to extrapolate information across scales. [...] Several studies suggest that the landscape has critical thresholds at which ecological processes will show dramatic changes, such as the complete transformation of a landscape by an invasive species due to small changes in temperature characteristics which favor the invasive's habitat requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Land {{managers}} and conservationists {{have become increasingly}} interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned. [...] As a result, {{it is important to}} understand how to identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change. [...] Because a large proportion of a species' population could exist in sink habitat, conservation efforts may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements. [...] Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat. [...] Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there. [...] Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances. [...] Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the <b>functional</b> <b>elements</b> necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction. [...] For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.|$|E
