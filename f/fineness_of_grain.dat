He looked at the heaped-up luggage, at the tinkling bells, at the young women from the lingere, at the repudiated visitors, at everything but the other American parents. Something in his breast told him that he knew all about these. It's not upon each other that the animals in the same cage, in a zoological collection, most turn their eyes. There was a silent sociability in him and a superficial <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> that helped to account for his daughter Francie's various delicacies. He was fair and spare and had no figure; you would have seen in a moment that the question of how he should hold himself had never in his life occurred to him. He never held himself at all; providence held him rather--and very loosely--by an invisible string {{at the end of which}} he seemed gently to dangle and waver. His face was so smooth that his thin light whiskers, which grew only far back, scarcely seemed native to his cheeks: they might have been attached there for some harmless purpose of comedy or disguise. He looked for the most part as if he were thinking over, without exactly understanding it, something rather droll that had just occurred; if his eyes wandered his attention rested, just as it hurried, quite as little. His feet were remarkably small, and his clothes, in which light colours predominated, were visibly the work of a French tailor: he was an American who still held the tradition that it is in Paris a man dresses himself best. His hat would have looked odd in Bond Street or the Fifth Avenue, and his necktie was loose and flowing.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{commonly}} available stones, only marble has a slight translucency i.e. subsurface scattering that {{is comparable to}} that of human skin. It is this translucency that gives a marble sculpture a visual depth beyond its surface and this evokes a certain realism when used for figurative works. Marble also has the advantage that, when first quarried, it is relatively soft and easy to work, refine, and polish. As the finished marble ages, it becomes harder and more durable. Preference to the cheaper and less translucent limestone is based largely on the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> marble's <b>grain,</b> which enables the sculptor to render minute detail in a manner not always possible with limestone; it is also more weather-resistant.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{series of}} oxygen free high {{conductivity}} copper samples with different initial grain sizes, cold rolling conditions and storage times {{as well as}} slightly different impurity contents was used to investigate {{the effects of these}} initial parameters on the development of cube texture during recrystallization. For rolling reductions of 90 % and 95 %, cube textures with volume fractions between 3 % and 50 % were observed. Higher rolling reduction led to a stronger cube texture. Cube texture development is very sensitive to the initial grain size before rolling. In general, fine grained material gives a strong cube texture after recrystallization, and the requirement on <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> size may vary for materials with different purity. Large sample widening during rolling can largely inhibit the development of cube texture after recrystallization. Neither storage time, nor the slight change in impurity content had large effects in the present investigation...|$|R

It {{seems to me that}} the more finely a colour is ground, the more it is saturated by oil. Now we’re not over-fond of oil, that goes without saying. If we painted like Monsieur Gérôme and the other trompe-l’oeil photographic ones, we’d no doubt ask for colours ground very fine. We, on the contrary, don’t strongly object to the canvas having a rough look. So if instead of having the colour ground on the stone for God knows how many hours, we grind it just long enough to make it workable, without bothering too much about the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain,</b> we’d have colours that were fresher, perhaps darkening less.

40|$|The so‐called ‘re‐identification condition’ (K elly 2011) {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the most prominent argument for nonconceptualism, the argument from <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain.</b> A number of authors have recently argued that the condition should be modified or discarded altogether, with devastating implications for the nonconceptualist (see, e. g., B rewer 2005, C huard 2006). The aim of this paper is to show that the situation is even more dire for nonconceptualists, for even if the re‐identification condition remains in its original form, the argument from <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> still fails to make the case for nonconceptualism. The paper's central case rests on two claims: according to the first, if the re‐identification condition holds, then some beliefs will represent some properties nonconceptually; and according to the second, if some beliefs represent some properties nonconceptually, the argument from <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> fails to make the case for nonconceptualism in any relevant sense.

40|$|Conceptualist {{accounts}} of the representational content of perceptual experiences have it that a subject S can experience no object, property, relation, etc., unless S &quot;i # possesses and &quot;ii # exercises concepts for such object, property, or relation. Perceptual experiences, on such a view, represent {{the world in a}} way that is conceptual “through and through ” &quot;McDowell, 1994 : 46; see also McDowell, 1998; Brewer, 1999 :ch. 5 #. A familiar objection against such a conception of experience exploits the fact that perceptual experiences, it seems, have a certain <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain.</b> What this means exactly isn’t too clear, but at least the following seems to be true. One can, for example, visually perceive very subtle differences between highly similar properties'such as some specific shades of red, say. As a result of the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> with which experiences represent these properties, normal perceivers like you and me are able to make quite fine-grained discriminations. Why is the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> of experience supposed to be problematic for advocates of Conceptualism? Because, the suggestion goes, we can perceive distinct shades of color and their specific differences without possessing distinct concepts for each such shade. As Evans puts it in an often quoted passage &quot; 1982 : 229 #: “Do we really understand the proposal that we have as many colour concepts as there are shades of colour that we can sensibly discriminate? ” Whether or not we understand such a proposal, it seems quite plausible that normal perceivers might lack specific concepts for certain shades of color they perceive nonetheles...|$|E

5000|$|Despite, {{the claims}} of Jean Bodin, Malestroit did put forth several valid claims about the price {{revolution}} that continues to hold value today, particularly his argument explaining the different price indexes {{of the day and}} the explanation to why the Spanish prices rose the least and the Brabantine the most. Spain, unlike almost all other European countries of this era, underwent no debasements of the gold and silver coinages during most of the period, but in 1599 when the new Spanish king Philip III (1598-1621) introduced the purely copper “vellon” coinage that all changed. Following Henry VIII of England and his infamous “Great Debasement” program that began 1526, the Spanish King Philip III tried to cement his Spanish legacy through changes in “coinage” strategy. Previously, Spanish Kings (at least from 1471) issued a largely copper fractional coinage called blancas, with a nominal money-of-account value of 0.5 maraved, but with a very small amount of silver to convince the public that it was indeed precious-metal [...] "money". The blanca issued in 1471 had a silver <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 10 <b>grains</b> or 3.47% (weighing 1.107g). In 1497, that fineness was reduced to 7 grains (2.43% fine); in 1552, to 5.5 grains (1.909% fine); in 1566, to 4 grains (1.39% fine). By the start of the seventeenth century, inflation took hold of Spain as the gap between nominal and silver-based prices dramatically shifted. The purely copper coinage had done its damage to Spain. The differences between the silver-based and vellon-based price indexes in Spain showed that the purely copper coinage other European countries used made up a much smaller proportion of the total coined money supply (something the Spanish Kings had overlooked and Malestoit was able to pinpoint).|$|R

First, we individuate some difficulties in characterizing the notion of “concept” itself both in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

Finally we look in greater detail at the proposal developed by Jacob and Jeannerod (Ways of seeing. The scopes and limits of visual cognition.

40|$|One of {{the current}} debates in {{philosophy}} of mind is whether the content of perceptual experiences is conceptual or nonconceptual. The proponents of nonconceptual content, or nonconceptualists, typically support their position by appealing to the so-called <b>Fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grain</b> Argument, which, in rough terms, has as its conclusion {{that we do not}} possess concepts for everything we perceive. In his Mind and World, John McDowell tried to give a response to the argument, and show that we do possess concepts for everything we perceive.

40|$|Tamar Szabo Gendler Sydney Shoemaker Richard BoydMany people {{share the}} intuition {{that in order}} to know what {{pineapple}} tastes like, one must have tasted pineapple. This is a special instance of the more general intuition that there are truths which cannot be understood unless one has had certain experiences. The influence of this intuition is widespread; it underlies debates about concept acquisition, the individuation of sense modalities, and our knowledge of the external world and of other minds. In this dissertation, I examine a famous argument in which this intuition plays a prominent role, Frank Jackson's knowledge argument. I articulate and defend this general intuition, and offer a diagnosis of its source: the reason these truths cannot be understood by someone who has not had the relevant experiences is that the content of visual experience is partly ineffable, i. e., the content of visual experience cannot be fully expressed linguistically. I distinguish between two types of ineffability, argue that only one of them would explain the central intuition, and isolate a feature of our visual experience that could explain why our experiences are necessarily ineffable. I argue that if the ineffability of perceptual experience is part of an explanation of the central intuition, then it must be interpreted as a claim about the phenomenal nature of experiences, rather than as a claim about the abilities of the subjects of experience. After close examination of three of the most prominent phenomenological features of perceptual experience - richness, <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain,</b> and determinacy - I argue that only determinacy is an essential property of phenomenological content, and thus the right type of property to explain why experiences are necessarily ineffable...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} settle an unresolved problem within {{the philosophy of}} mind and perception by substantiating a particular theory {{about the nature of}} perceptual states. The problem is the so-called debate about nonconceptual content, and the theory I defend is Conceptualism, i. e., the view that perceptual states are conceptual mental states. ^ The overall defense consists of two general tasks. One, I introduce and scrutinize (Ch. 2), and then ultimately offer my own formulation and defense of (Ch. 3), what has historically been Conceptualism’s main rationale: the Epistemic Argument. The argument is epistemological in nature, and the main thrust of it is this: perceptual states are points of departure for immediate rational transitions, but this could be so only if they were conceptual states. Additionally, considerations about the nature of perceptual recognition (§ 4. 9) are leveraged into an independent argument for Conceptualism (§ 6. 6). ^ Two, I attempt to rebut the most prominent objections against Conceptualism: that it’s logically incompatible with the evident richness and <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> of perceptual experience (Ch. 4); that its commitment to a demonstrative account of perceptual contents is logically incompatible with the possibility of non-veridical perceptions (Ch. 4); that it’s logically incompatible with, and hence would make it impossible for us to explain, the datum that so-called observational concepts are learned on the basis of perceptual experiences (Chaps. 5 - 6); and that a proper explanation of observational concepts falsifies it (Ch. 5). The main theoretical component by which those objections are rebutted is the demonstrative account of perceptual contents; hence Chapters 4 - 6 also do considerable work to define and work out certain kinks in that account. ^ If my arguments are sound, they should be of some interest to our understanding of how perceptual states fit into the overall theory of rationality. If conceptualism is true, then the transition from perception to belief is a special case of, and hence can be subsumed under the more general investigation into the nature of, rational inference. ...|$|E

40|$|The use of fly ash (FA) as an {{admixture}} to concrete is broadly extended for {{two main}} reasons: {{the reduction of}} costs that supposes the substitution of cement and the micro structural changes motivated by the mineral admixture. Regarding this second point, there is a consensus that considers that the ash generates a more compact concrete {{and a reduction in}} the size of the pore. However, the measure in which this contributes to the pozzolanic activity or as filler is not well defined. There is also no justification to the influence of the physical parameters, fineness of the grain and free water, in its behavior. This work studies the use of FA as a partial substitute of the cement in concretes of different workability (dry and wet) and the influence in the reactivity of the ash. The concrete of dry consistency which serves as reference uses a cement dose of 250 Kg/m 3 and the concrete of fluid consistency utilized a dose of cement of 350 Kg/m 3. Two trademark of Portland Cement Type 1 were used. The first reached the resistant class for its <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> and the second one for its composition. Moreover, three doses of FA have been used, and the water/binder ratio was constant in all the mixtures. We have studied the mechanical properties and the micro-structure of the concretes by means of compressive strength tests, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and thermal analysis (TA). The results of compressive strength tests allow us to observe that concrete mixtures with cements of the same classification and similar dosage of binder do not present the same mechanical behavior. These results show that the effective water/binder ratio has a major role in the development of the mechanical properties of concrete. The study of different dosages using TA, thermo-gravimetry and differential thermal analysis, revealed that the portlandite content is not restrictive in any of the dosages studied. Again, this proves that the rheology of the material influences the reaction rate and content of hydrated cement products. We conclude that the available free water is determinant in the efficiency of pozzolanic reaction. It is so that in accordance to the availability of free water, the ashes can react as an active admixture or simply change the porous distribution. The MIP shows concretes that do not exhibit significant changes in their mechanical behavior, but have suffered significant variation in their porous structur...|$|E
