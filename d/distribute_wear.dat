50|$|An {{advanced}} ratchet type has {{a mechanism}} that rotates the pencil lead 9° counter-clockwise {{every time the}} lead is pressed on to the paper (which counts as one stroke), to <b>distribute</b> <b>wear</b> evenly. This auto-rotation mechanism keeps the lead 50% narrower than in the common propelling mechanical pencils, resulting in uniform thickness of the lines written onto the paper. The design was first developed by Mitsubishi Pencil Company, and named Kuru Toga under the Uni brand. This type of pencil is most suited for Asian languages that have multiple strokes per letter or word, where the pencil is frequently lifted off the paper. The mechanism is not suitable for cursive writing used in western scripts. Another recent auto-rotation movement by Uni rotates the lead 18 degrees per stroke (or 20 strokes per complete revolution), which is better suited for western scripts.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{structural}} reliability under processes of deterioration presents very important problem in design. The structure’s wear shows {{a reduction of}} bearing capacity in time that for one’s turn leads to increasing the probability of failure. The reasons for long duration and irreversible change {{of structural}} features can be corrosion in steel structures, decomposition in wood structures, ageing in polymer structures, and processes of abrasion or erosion also. The problem of defects accumulation should be mentioned too, when reduction of the bearing capacity connects with load’s value and its duration. The models and peculiarities of corrosion wear and its influence on bearing capacity are discussed in this paper. 1. MODELS OF CORROSION WEAR Corrosion {{is an important factor}} in reducing of reliability and durability due to different kinds of structures or equipments. From 10 % to 12 % of fabricated and used steel is lost annually due to destructive effects of corrosion. In spite of widely used protection methods, the quantity of steel destroyed is growing almost proportionally to the accumulated stores of steel. Losses from corrosion average are between 2 % to 4 % of GDP in almost every country. About 30 % of structural steel is subjected to atmospheric corrosion, and 75 % is subjected to atmospheric and aggressive corrosion simultaneously [1]. Under corrosion’s influence the initial cross-section of a structural element is decreased, and consequently so its bearing capacity. Fig. 1 presents the types of corrosion for structural steel.

40|$|Osteolysis is {{the main}} cause of aseptic {{loosening}} and stem failure. The mechanism that leads to osteolysis is poorly understood; pressure generation caused by reversible stem micromotion may play an important role. We aimed to determine whether dynamically inducible micromotion occurs in vivo at the prosthesis-cement interface and to use these data to develop and confirm a finite element representation of this interface. Dynamically inducible micromotion was measured using radiostereometric analysis in 21 hips implanted with an Exeter stem, at 3 months and 12 months postoperatively, by changing loading from double-leg stance to single-leg stance. Dynamically inducible micromotion occurred at 3 and 12 months; similar micromotion was observed at both time points. At 3 months the head of the stem was displaced posteriorly (0. 10 +/- 0. 16 mm) and inferiorly (0. 08 +/- 0. 12 mm) on loading. A Coulomb friction nonbonded representation of the stem-cement interface was used to fit the clinically measured dynamically inducible micromotion. The final finite element model predicted gap opening and closing between the implant and the mantle. This may be a mechanism for generating pressure and <b>distributing</b> <b>wear</b> debris, which are believed to important contributors to failure...|$|R

50|$|The {{roller chain}} design reduces {{friction}} compared to simpler designs, resulting in higher efficiency and less wear. The original power transmission chain varieties lacked rollers and bushings, {{with both the}} inner and outer plates held by pins which directly contacted the sprocket teeth; however this configuration exhibited extremely rapid wear of both the sprocket teeth, and the plates where they pivoted on the pins. This problem was partially solved by the development of bushed chains, with the pins holding the outer plates passing through bushings or sleeves connecting the inner plates. This <b>distributed</b> the <b>wear</b> over a greater area; however the teeth of the sprockets still wore more rapidly than is desirable, from the sliding friction against the bushings. The addition of rollers surrounding the bushing sleeves of the chain and provided rolling contact with the teeth of the sprockets resulting in excellent resistance to wear of both sprockets and chain as well. There is even very low friction, as long as the chain is sufficiently lubricated. Continuous, clean, lubrication of roller chains is of primary importance for efficient operation as well as correct tensioning.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCementless metal-back {{acetabular}} cups {{have good}} long-term results, but some problems have appeared {{due to the}} shell's stiffness, modularity and required bearing surfaces. The RM Pressfit® Cup is a single-piece polyethylene cementless acetabular cup that is covered by {{a thin layer of}} titanium. This allows for bone integration without limitations related to the stiffness of a metal-back shell. There is very little published information about this new, innovative implant design. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical and radiological results from a continuous series of 91 cups (85 patients) with a follow-up of at least 4 years. No patients were lost to follow-up. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to assess the clinical outcome. To assess the radiological outcomes, digital X-rays were used to evaluate the cup position and integration; wear was measured using Livermore's technique. The clinical results were excellent: the mean HHS was 94 and 82 % of cases had good or excellent scores. Three of the cups had to be revised because of dislocation brought on by incorrect positioning. X-rays revealed that three implants had shifted during the first 6 weeks, but had stabilized afterwards. Bone integration on X-rays was satisfactory in all cases with no signs of osteolysis. The configuration of the bone trabeculae showed that loads between the implant and peri-acetabular cancellous bone were evenly <b>distributed.</b> The <b>wear</b> of the polyethylene cup-ceramic head bearing was 0. 07 mm/year. The results of this series are consistent with recent published studies with the RM Pressfit® Cup. Level of evidenceIV...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePDC {{drill bit}} {{performances}} in hard rock {{has been greatly}} improved during the last decades by innovations in PDC wear, impact resistance and better vibrations understanding. The bit design is generally done by balancing the bit, <b>distributing</b> uniform <b>wear</b> along the profile and achieving high drillability and steerability. To obtain required drilling performances, drill bit designer adjust features such as profile shape, gage and mainly cutter characteristics (shape, type and orientation). Cutter rock interaction model became a critical feature in the design process. But previously used models considered only three forces on a cutter based on the cutter-rock contact area : drag force, normal force and side force. Such models are no longer valid {{with the introduction of}} PDC cutters with chamfer and special shape. This paper presents a new cutter rock interaction model including some several improvements. It is based on the presence of a build-up edge of crushed materials on the cutting face often described in the literature. In addition, the chamfer, which significantly affects bit Rate Of Penetration (ROP), is taken into account (shape and size). Forces applied {{on the back of the}} cutter and due to the rock deformation and back flow of crushed materials are considered in the model. Finally, results of numerous single cutter tests (under atmospheric and confining pressure) are presented and compared to the new cutter rock interaction model predictions. An analysis of the influence of the PDC characteristics (shape, size, chamfer, back and side rake angles, [...] ) is presented. The model has been applied to optimize the cutting efficiency and bit steerability and some design rules are given to minimize the specific energy and maximize the rate of penetration. Finally, full scale laboratory drilling tests and field results indicate that the use of accurate cutter rock interaction model can help the drill bit designer to find the best drill bit for a specific application. Standard laboratory full scale drilling procedures have been developed. The tests have shown that drillability, stability, steerability and wear can be improved and controlled by acting on the cutter characteristics, cutter setup, trimmer characteristics and gage type...|$|R
40|$|In ridge plant systems, {{crops are}} planted into ridges formed during {{cultivation}} {{of the previous}} crop. Row cleaning devices on the planter push weed seed and residue lying on the soil surface from the ridge to the area between the rows, or row middles. The crop seed is planted into the old row in a cleanly tilled strip at a higher elevation than the row middles. A band application of herbicide behind the planter typically {{is used in the}} row for weed control. Crop cultivation controls weeds between the row and rebuilds ridges for the following year. Ridge plant systems are often lower in cost than other tillage and planting systems, but may not be suitable for all farming situations. Level or gently sloping fields, especially those having poorly drained soils, are well suited to ridge plant systems. The elevated ridge tends to shed the residue to the row middles, allowing earlier soil warming in the spring. This warming, combined with drainage from the ridge, allows soil in the ridge to be drier at planting time than unridged soils. Ridge planting is an excellent choice for soils that are often too wet for early spring tillage. Ridge plant systems help control erosion by leaving the soil covered with residue until planting. After planting, 30 to 50 percent of the initial residue may be left on the soil surface. Residue covered areas between the rows alternate with cleanly tilled strips in the rows. If planting is done correctly, the cleanly tilled strip will be higher than the residue covered areas, so that water drains from the row to the residue covered row middles. Ridge Cleaning Equipment Ridge planting equipment uses row cleaning devices to push residue and weed seed to the row middles where a crop cultivator can provide weed control. Removing the residue also enhances warming of the soil. Disk furrowers can be used to move some of the surface residue and weed seed to the row middle. In general, larger diameter disks will be more effective in moving residue and weed seed, and have less plugging problems than smaller diameter disks. Overlapping, notched-edge heavy duty versions are available to clean the ridge tops. The notched edges aid in keeping the disks rotating when operating at a shallow depth. The overlapping disks cut the residue without plugging and clear the row area behind the disks. To minimize side draft, the leading disk should be on the right for half the flowers and on the left for the other half. Some ridge planters use a wide sweep to clear the ridge top. The flat sweep operates at a shallow depth, sliding under the residue and moving residue, soil and weed seed to the row middle. Often some type of deflector shields or 2 ̆ 2 trash guards 2 ̆ 2 are used to move the residue, soil and weed seeds off the ridge top as they slide over the sweep. The horizontal disk is free to rotate and is designed to operate like a sweep, sliding under the residue and soil. Deflector shields keep the row area clean. The rotating action makes the disks self-cleaning and <b>distributes</b> <b>wear</b> {{around the perimeter of the}} disk rather than only on the leading edge. The row cleaning devices should be operated at a very shallow depth, removing less than l or 2 inches of the ridge top to keep the row higher than the residue covered row middles. This reduces the erosion potential in the cleanly tilled strips. After planting, the top of the ridge should be 3 to 5 inches higher than the row middle and shaped to shed water to the row middle. For erosion control, never allow the row area to be lower than the row middle after planting. Doing so can concentrate runoff in the cleanly tilled strips, which increases erosion in the row area on sloping soils when planting is up and down hill. Even if the field is relatively flat and has little erosion potential, creating furrows by operating the row cleaning device too deeply can cause sediment from runoff to be deposited in the row. When dry, these deposits can form a crust that a rotary hoe may not break because the row is lower than the row middles. Additionally, operating row cleaning devices too deeply places the crop seed in a cooler, wetter environment, which can slow germination and emergence. Operating row cleaning device too deeply is a common problem with ridge plant systems. The operating depth need to be only deep enough to keep residue and weed seed flowing away from the row area. Very little soil needs to be moved and it is not necessary to remove the previous crop root masses. In fact, removing the root masses can cause these problems: • The removed root masses may be run over by planter gauge wheels, causing non-uniform planting depth. • A void can be created in the soil where the root mass was removed and the planter may not be capable of placing and covering the seed properly when seeds are dropped into these voids. • At cultivation, root masses can plug the cultivator or be pushed back into the row, interfering with crop growth or harvest...|$|R
