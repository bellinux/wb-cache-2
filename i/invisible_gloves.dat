The level of skin protection afforded by five creams was tested using a panel of 5 volunteers. A fluorescent tracer was used as the test substance. The difference in skin protection between the five products was evaluated. Our findings suggest that Hands First Barrier Cream was the most protective of the four barrier cream products tested in this study, covering between 9 - 11 % more of the participant’s hands than the three other BCs tested. However, the control emollient cream seemed to perform better than the barrier creams tested. Given the small difference in protective ratings between the Hands First Cream and the other BCs and the small sample size of this study there is some degree of uncertainty and the results should be interpreted with care. A much larger laboratory study will b...|$|E
