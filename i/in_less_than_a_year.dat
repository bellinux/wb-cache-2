5|$|In 1858, Louis Faidherbe, the {{governor}} of Senegal, inaugurated the Bouteville boat that was capable of transporting 150 passengers, animals {{and all kinds of}} goods. The boat made ten crosses every day and the fares differed: five centimes for a person, 50 centimes for a horse, cow or camel, and two francs for a carriage. <b>In</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> it was obvious that this system was overrun and a second boat was introduced but with no success.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig {{model were}} proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of}} a fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Stadium Station {{began with}} the laying of the first rails for Central Link, between Holgate and Lander streets, in August 2005. The station itself was built by Kiewit Pacific <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> with opening ceremonies for Stadium and SODO {{stations}} held on May 30, 2006, celebrating {{the completion of the}} first two Central Link stations. Light rail testing on the , at-grade SoDo segment began in March 2007, and ended in February 2008. Regular Link service from Seattle to Tukwila began on July 18, 2009, including the use of its pocket track to store extra trains serving a sellout friendly match between the Seattle Sounders and Chelsea at CenturyLink Field.|$|E
5|$|Hansa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Royal Dockyard in Danzig in 1868. She was the first ironclad warship {{to be built in}} a German shipyard; her {{predecessors}} had all been built in French and British shipyards. The ship was launched on 26 October 1872 and moved to the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin for fitting out work. The work proceeded very slowly, and Hansa was not commissioned into the German fleet until 19 May 1875, {{two and a half years}} after her launch. By comparison, all of the earlier foreign-built ironclads were completed <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1786, Hope's career {{suffered}} a blow {{when he was}} stationed aboard the frigate HMS Pegasus, commanded by Prince William Henry. Hope and Prince William fell out badly and <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> Hope had been transferred to the frigate HMS Boreas, at that time commanded by Captain Horatio Nelson, with whom Hope had good relations. Two years later, Hope was transferred to HMS Adamant {{at the request of}} Sir Richard Hughes. When Hughes reached flag rank in 1790 whilst stationed in Newfoundland, he promoted Hope to commander and gave him command of Adamant.|$|E

In Australia, Let Go had been certified seven-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association in 2003, based on the sales of over 490,000 units from wholesalers to retailers. The album is the tenth best-selling album of 2002 there, and the third in the following year.. 'Let Go' reached its peak worldwide during Christmas holiday with almost 860,000 copies sold worldwide during Christmas week and then another 600,000 copies worldwide {{in the first week}} of 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{shooting}} {{took place}} at the Kauhajoki School of Hospitality, owned by the Seinäjoki Municipal Federation of Education. The facilities and campus were shared between the Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences and the Seinäjoki Vocational Education Centre – Sedu. Saari was a second-year student in a Bachelor of Hospitality Management degree programme. The incident was the second school shooting <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in Finland, the other being the Jokela school shooting in November 2007, in which nine people including the gunman died. Before that, only one other school shooting had taken place in the country's history, in Rauma in 1989, leaving two people dead.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston {{was once}} more forced into exile, but Edward {{recalled}} him <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> The king {{had spent the}} intervening time gathering support, and at the time, {{the only one to}} resist the return of Gaveston was Warwick. With time, however, opposition to the king grew. Another source of contention was Edward abandoning his father's Scottish campaigns, a policy that opened the Border region up to devastating raids from the Scots. This affected Warwick greatly, with his extensive landed interest in the north. Tensions grew {{to the point where the}} king in 1310 had to ban Warwick and others from arriving at parliament in arms. They still did, and at the parliament of March 1310, the king was forced to accept the appointment of a commission to draft a set of ordinances towards reform the royal government.|$|E
50|$|With the {{objective}} of connecting all the towns on the Northwest coast to Lille <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour, the Nord-Pas de Calais région has put in place TERGV.

5|$|General Hubert Gough {{commanded}} a mounted infantry regiment with distinction during {{the relief of}} Ladysmith, but his command was destroyed while attacking a larger Boer force in 1901. When he joined the BEF, he was {{in command of the}} 3rd Cavalry Brigade, and was promoted from a brigade to a corps command <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> He was given command of the 2nd Cavalry Division in September 1914, the 7th Division in April 1915, and the British I Corps in July 1915. He commanded I Corps during the battle of Loos. In May 1916, he was appointed commander of the Fifth Army, which suffered heavy losses at the battle of Passchendaele. The collapse of the Fifth Army was widely viewed as the reason for the German breakthrough in the Spring Offensive, and Gough was dismissed as its commander in March 1918, being succeeded by General William Birdwood for the last months of the war. Birdwood had previously commanded the Australian Corps, an appointment requiring a combination of tact and tactical flair.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{committee}} {{then began}} {{an investigation into}} the United States Army. This began at the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but ultimately nothing came of this investigation. McCarthy next {{turned his attention to the}} case of a U.S. Army dentist who had been promoted to the rank of major despite having refused to answer questions on an Army loyalty review form. McCarthy's handling of this investigation, including a series of insults directed at a brigadier general, led to the Army-McCarthy hearings, with the Army and McCarthy trading charges and counter-charges for 36 days before a nationwide television audience. While the official outcome of the hearings was inconclusive, this exposure of McCarthy to the American public resulted in a sharp decline in his popularity. <b>In</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> McCarthy was censured by the Senate and his position as a prominent force in anti-communism was essentially ended.|$|E
5|$|The war also posed {{problems}} for the army commanders, given that, prior to 1914, the largest formation any serving General in the BEF had commanded on operations was a division. The expansion of the British Army saw some officers promoted from brigade to corps commander <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Army commanders also {{had to cope with}} the new tactics and weapons that were developed. With the move from manoeuvre to trench warfare, both the infantry and the artillery {{had to learn how to}} work together. During an offensive, and when in defence, they learned how to combine forces to defend the front line. Later in the war, when the Machine Gun Corps and the Tank Corps were added to the order of battle, they were also included in the new tactical doctrine.|$|E
