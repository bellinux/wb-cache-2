40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} the <b>full</b> <b>colored</b> HOMFLYPT invariants in the full skein of the annulus C. We show that the <b>full</b> <b>colored</b> HOMFLYPT invariant has a nice structure when q→ 1. The composite invariant is a combination of the <b>full</b> <b>colored</b> HOMFLYPT invariants. In order to study the framed LMOV type conjecture for composite invariants, we introduce the framed reformulated composite invariant Ř_p(L). By using the HOMFLY skein theory, we prove that Ř_p(L) lies in the ring 2 Z[(q-q^- 1) ^ 2,t^± 1]. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture of congruent skein relation for Ř_p(L) and prove it for certain special cases. Comment: 27 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|In 1907, Bauer {{was asked}} by the Åhlén & Åkerlund {{publishing}} house (now Bonnier Group) to illustrate their new series of books, Among Gnomes and Trolls. The books would be published annually, and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors. The majority of Bauer's pictures for the book were full-page watercolor illustrations in a muted color scheme; he also contributed with covers, vignettes and other smaller illustrations. Bauer's most significant creatures, the trolls, were rendered in shades of gray, green, and brown, the colors of the forests, as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself. Due to the limitiations of the technology available to his printers, the 1907–10 editions were produced in just two colors: black and yellow. Some of Bauer's original paintings for these prints were in <b>full</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
