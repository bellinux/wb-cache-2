40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a discrete-time two-sector CES economy with sector specific external effects and partial <b>depreciation</b> <b>of</b> capital. We {{show that the}} occurrence of local indeterminacy of equilibria depends on an interplay between factor substitutability and capital depreciation. When the elasticity of substitution is less than one, local indetermi-nacy may occur with low <b>depreciation</b> <b>of</b> capital. When the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, local indeterminacy is more likely if the rate <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> is high...|$|R

Second, we show that the responses of the East Asian currencies to a sudden and sharp <b>depreciation</b> <b>of</b> the US dollar will differ with countries because of the different degree of linkages of the East Asian currencies to the US dollar. Based on the above analyses, a regional coordination of the exchange rate policy is necessary to the East Asian countries to response appropriately to a possible <b>depreciation</b> <b>of</b> the US dollar in the near future...|$|R
