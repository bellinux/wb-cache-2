25|$|<b>Epipelagic</b> <b>fish</b> {{generally}} move {{long distances}} between feeding and spawning areas, or {{as a response}} to changes in the ocean. Large ocean predators, such as salmon and tuna, can migrate thousands of kilometres, crossing oceans.|$|E
25|$|Coastal fish (also called neritic or inshore fish) {{inhabit the}} waters near {{the coast and}} above the {{continental}} shelf. Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that coastal fish that are not demersal fish are usually <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the number}} of species is limited, <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes</b> are abundant. What they lack in {{diversity}} they make up in numbers.

25|$|Coastal <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fish</b> {{are among}} the most {{abundant}} in the world. They include forage fish as well as the predator fish that feed on them. Forage fish thrive in those inshore waters where high productivity results from the upwelling and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.|$|E
25|$|Coastal fish, {{also called}} inshore fish or neritic fish, inhabit the sea between the {{shoreline}} and {{the edge of}} the continental shelf. Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that pelagic coastal fish are generally <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fish,</b> inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone. Coastal fish can be contrasted with oceanic fish or offshore fish, which inhabit the deep seas beyond the continental shelves.|$|E
25|$|Oceanic <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fish</b> can be true residents, partial residents, or {{accidental}} residents. True residents {{live their}} entire {{life in the}} open ocean. Only a few species are true residents, such as tuna, billfish, flying fish, sauries, pilotfish and remoras, dolphin, ocean sharks and ocean sunfish. Most of these species migrate {{back and forth across}} open oceans, rarely venturing over continental shelves. Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{forage fish}} are facultative predators that can pick {{individual}} copepods or fish larvae {{out of the}} water column, and then change to filter feeding on phytoplankton when energetically that gives better results. [...] Filter feeding fish usually use long fine gill rakers to strain small organisms from the water column. Some of the largest <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes,</b> such as the basking shark and whale shark are filter feeders, and so are some of the smallest, such as adult sprats and anchovies.|$|R

25|$|Oceanic fish (also called {{open ocean}} or {{offshore}} fish) {{live in the}} waters that are not above the continental shelf. Oceanic fish can be contrasted with coastal fish, who do live above the continental shelf. However, the two types are not mutually exclusive, {{since there are no}} firm boundaries between coastal and ocean regions, and many <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fish</b> move between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages in their life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Some feed on carrion. Cameras {{show that}} when a dead fish {{is placed on the}} bottom, {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it from the inside out. Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fish.</b> But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epipelagic</b> <b>fish</b> {{inhabit the}} epipelagic zone. The epipelagic zone is {{the water from}} the surface of the sea down to 200 metres. It is also {{referred}} to as the surface waters or the sunlit zone, and includes the photic zone. The photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1% of the surface value. This depth depends on how turbid the water is, but in clear water can extend to 200 metres, coinciding with the epipelagic zone. The photic zone has sufficient light for phytoplankton to photosynthese.|$|E

40|$|Deep-sea fishes inhabit ∼ 75 % of the {{biosphere}} and are {{a critical part of}} deep-sea food webs. Diet analysis and more recent trophic biomarker approaches, such as stable isotopes and fatty-acid profiles, have enabled the description of feeding guilds and an increased recognition of the vertical connectivity in food webs in a whole-water-column sense, including benthic-pelagic coupling. Ecosystem modeling requires data on feeding rates; the available estimates indicate that deep-sea fishes have lower per-individual feeding rates than coastal and <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes,</b> but the overall predation impact may be high. A limited number of studies have measured the vertical flux of carbon by mesopelagic fishes, which appears to be substantial.

25|$|The {{epipelagic zone}} is vast, {{and is the}} home for most pelagic fish. The zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight, is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action, and {{can be a good}} habitat for algae to grow. However, it is an almost featureless habitat. This lack of habitat {{diversity}} results in a lack of species diversity, so the zone supports less than 2% of the world's known fish species. Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish, so <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fish</b> tend to be found in coastal water above the continental shelves, where land runoff can provide nutrients, or in those parts of the ocean where upwelling moves nutrients into the area.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>epipelagic</b> {{predator}} <b>fish</b> {{and their}} smaller prey fish are countershaded with silvery colours which reduce visibility by scattering incoming light.

50|$|Fishes {{that live}} in surface waters down to about 200 metres, <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes,</b> live in a sunlit zone where visual predators use visual systems which are {{designed}} pretty much as might be expected. But even so, there can be unusual adaptations. Four-eyed fish have eyes raised above {{the top of the}} head and divided in two different parts, so that they can see below and above the water surface at the same time. Four-eyed fish actually have only two eyes, but their eyes are specially adapted for their surface-dwelling lifestyle. The eyes are positioned on {{the top of the head}}, and the fish floats at the water surface with only the lower half of each eye underwater. The two halves are divided by a band of tissue and the eye has two pupils, connected by part of the iris. The upper half of the eye is adapted for vision in air, the lower half for vision in water. The lens of the eye changes in thickness top to bottom to account for the difference in the refractive indices of air versus water. These fish spend most of their time at the surface of the water. Their diet mostly consists of the terrestrial insects which are available at the surface.|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{processes}} regulating {{the production of}} <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes</b> in the northern North Pacific, especially (but not limited to) salmonids, and whether this regulation {{is likely to be}} exerted predominately by plankton production processes or self-regulated by the influence of fish on their prey. This question {{is at the core of}} the PICES CCCC program, i. e. Carrying Capacity and Climate Change. How is the carrying capacity regulated- by physical and resulting food-web processes (“bottom-up”), or by the effects of variable fish abundance and predation on their prey? If it is from the bottom-up, then one would expect direct linkages with climate variability. If it is regulated by fish abundance (in effect “top-down ” control, or perhaps better described as “self-regulating ” control), linkages with climate variability may be less direct and anthropogenic effects, e. g. fishing, changes to habitat and rearing conditions, etc., may be more important. “Bottom-up ” Control Studies of plankton in the North Pacific suggest that production processes may differ between the western and eastern regions, but that the temporal trends have generally been similar from the 1950 ’s at least to the late 1980 ’s.

40|$|Flying fishes (family Exocoetidae) are {{important}} components of epipelagic ecosystems and are targeted by fishing fleets in the Caribbean Sea and elsewhere. However, owing to their anti-predator behavior and habitats, their ecology, abundance, and distributions are only partially known. From September 20 to October 6, 2011, {{we conducted a}} series of surveys over a large area (approximately 75, 000 km 2) of the northern Gulf of Mexico (87 °W– 90. 5 °W, 28 °N– 30 °N). The surveys used an airborne lidar and vessel-based sampling, supported by near real time satellite observations of oceanic conditions. The aerial survey was conducted from a fixed wing aircraft that flew repeated surveys day and night, enabling data collection that was both broad-scale and synoptic. Vessel-based sampling included quantitative visual observations, trawl sampling, and qualitative dip-netting for species identifications. The combined surveys identified large aggregations of epipelagic organisms dominated by flying fishes. Large numbers of jellyfish (Aurelia sp.) and low numbers of numerous other species were also observed. The putative flying fish aggregations had an average length scale of 6. 1 km and an average population estimated at 10, 000 individuals. While always near the surface, flying fish aggregations were slightly deeper at night than during the day and found most often off the continental shelf in warm water with low chlorophyll concentrations. At least three species were present: Hirundichthys rondeletii (Valenciennes, 1847), Cheilopogon melanurus (Valenciennes, 1847), and Prognichthys occidentalisParin, 1999.

40|$|International audienceWe studied {{seasonal}} and inter-annual {{variations in}} the diet, amount of food delivered to chicks, and body condition of chicks and adult red-tailed tropicbird at Europa Island (Mozambique Channel, Indian Ocean), during 3 consecutive seasons. The diet consisted of <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes</b> (13 families) and squid (3 families) totalling 32 taxa. Three families, the squid Ommastrephidae (mainly Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) and the fishes Exocoetidae (flying-fish) and Coryphaenidae (dolphinfish), accounted for 68 % {{of the number of}} prey and 83 % of the ingested biomass. There were considerable differences in size and mass of the prey items, dolphin fish being the largest and squid the smallest. There were important seasonal variations in diet. During chick-rearing, 41 % of the mass of food delivered to chicks consisted of dolphin fish, whereas these fish represented only 2 % of the mass of food during incubation. The squid were caught in similar proportion throughout the breeding season but were larger during chick rearing. We did not find any inter-annual variation in the diet of chicks, nor in the body condition of either fledglings or adults, suggesting that no major inter-annual changes in food availability occurred during the course of our study. However, there was some interannual variation in feeding frequency and body condition of chicks of less than 60 d. There were also significant day-to-day {{variations in the}} feeding frequency in one of the 3 seasons studied. This suggests that day-to-day variation in the marine environment or in foraging conditions may have shortterm consequences in the food provisioning and body condition of growing chicks, but that these variations do not necessarily result in long-term (inter-annual) variations in diet and body condition of fledgling or adult red-tailed tropicbirds at Europa island.

40|$|Large, mesopelagic teleost fishes have a {{potentially}} keystone {{position in the}} ecology of the pelagic water column, yet remain relatively unstudied when compared with large, commercially important, <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes.</b> Here, the ecological roles of four, large, vertically migrating teleosts were examined. Stomach content analyses were performed on 48 oilfish (Ruvettus pretiosis), 35 escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum), 32 snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens) and seven lancetfish (Alepisaurus spp.) collected from pelagic longline gear in the Western North Atlantic Ocean from 2007 to 2010. Of these specimens, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were also performed on white dorsal muscle tissue from 33 oilfish, 16 escolar, 27 snake mackerel and seven lancetfish. Based on literature length-at-maturity values, all escolar, snake mackerel and lancetfish specimens were mature, while 13 of the 33 oilfish were juveniles. Crustaceans, annelids, salps, cephalopods and teleosts were present in the stomachs and were presumed to be prey items. A Kruskal–Wallis test showed the four species to be isotopically segregated in both δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Escolar were the most depleted in δ 13 C, followed by adult oilfish, juvenile oilfish and lancetfish, with snake mackerel the most enriched. The depletion in δ 13 C of adult oilfish and escolar may have been attributable to high C/N values, which were strongly correlated with length in oilfish, weakly correlated with length in escolar and moderately correlated with length in snake mackerel and lancetfish. The high C/N was likely due to the high lipid concentration of these fishes. Other factors that {{may have contributed to the}} depletion in δ 13 C may include spawning or a change in carbon source within the ecosystem. Large escolar occupied the highest trophic level (δ 15 N = 10. 20), followed by snake mackerel (δ 15 N = 9. 66), adult oilfish (δ 15 N = 9. 32), lancetfish (δ 15 N = 9. 05) and juvenile oilfish (δ 15 N = 7. 83).

40|$|The feeding {{behavior}} of marine predators {{varies with the}} level of competition to which they are exposed. Populations living in the same or overlapping geographic regions (sympatric) are generally subject to inter-specific competition, which can lead to the development of differing trophic strategies that maximize both nutritional and reproductive efficiency. The otariids of the islands in the western Galapagos Archipelago represent appropriate subjects for studying the response mechanisms of sympatric species exposed to strong competition, both trophic and spatial. The present study has focused on evaluating the possible differences in the trophic niches of the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) and the Galapagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) over time, based upon the analysis of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (? 13 C and ? 15 N), and observation of both species at sea. A comparative analysis of the isotopic signal of skin samples from pups of both species was performed for rookeries on Fernandina Island between 2003 and 2009. Analyses of the isotopic signal present in prey covering the entire trophic range of these predators were also performed, in order to relate this information to otariid sighting records collected during offshore cruises in 1993 – 1994 and 2000. The ? 13 C and ? 15 N values defined differences in the feeding zones and in the trophic level of each species; which were related with the interannual variability of the ecosystem, i. e. El Niño and La Niña events. Whereas Z. wollebaeki showed a coastal (inshore) foraging strategy, relying on the consumption of small <b>epipelagic</b> <b>fishes,</b> A. galapagoensis {{turned out to be a}} more oceanic (offshore) predator, with a preference for small squid.
