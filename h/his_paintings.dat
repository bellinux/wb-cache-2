The figures often seen in <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> are abstract and inspired by the masks and sculptures of Nigeria. These Nigerian arts have also inspired Jarrell's totem sculptures. Living and working in Cleveland, Jarrell continues to explore the contemporary African American experience through <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> sculptures, and prints. His work {{is found in the}} collections of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, High Museum of Art, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the University of Delaware.|$|E

5|$|Modelling is {{far from}} the only {{possible}} way to illustrate mathematical concepts.

Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 Great Metaphysical Interior explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b>|$|E
