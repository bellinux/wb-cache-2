5|$|The {{advantage}} of this re-statement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> can exploit theorems from linear algebra on {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent, simultaneously perpendicular vectors.

5|$|To wear tefillin without {{reciting the}} blessings: This is the opinion of, among others, Jacob ben Asher, Moses of Coucy and David HaLevi Segal. The {{advantage}} of this compromise <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> avoids the transgressions of either not donning tefillin or making a blessing in vain.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, {{the family}} learns that Peter's {{condition}} {{has a big}} chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They learn that the only other option besides the daily procedures <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> must give up one of their kidneys to Peter. Lois volunteers to give up one of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover {{that he has the}} same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are smaller than human's, the donation requires both kidneys. If the procedure was successful, Brian would lose his life. Brian decides {{to go along with the}} procedure to save Peter's life. Reluctant to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman reveals that he is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys. He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog kidneys would work, meaning that Brian would have died for nothing. Thus, Brian's life is spared.|$|E

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E

25|$|Constitutionally (in Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia), one of {{the four}} tests for {{entitlement}} to the privileges accorded to a Malaysian Malay <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> must be a Muslim. The rationale for this is that Islam is considered intrinsic to Malay ethnic identity, which culturally and historically is ruled by a Sultan who is a Muslim. Another test <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> must follow the Malay culture. Controversially, court rulings have assumed that all ethnic Malays must automatically satisfy this constitutional definition of a Malaysian Malay, and have therefore concluded that they must satisfy all of its requirements, so they have to be Muslim.|$|E
