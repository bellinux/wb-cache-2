Shorinji Kempo Unity opposed the application, but the IPO found that SKU had not demonstrated <b>genuine</b> <b>use</b> of its registered trademark. SKU appealed the decision. In the High Court, the appeal judge found that SKU had shown <b>genuine</b> <b>use</b> of its mark, but that the BSKF mark can be registered. In particular, Judge Warren found that Shorinji Kempo is a generic term, which simply describes a martial art, and even if this were not the case, there is no possibility of confusion of the BSKF's mark {{with that of the}} SKU.|$|E
50|$|The stamps appear only in {{specialist}} catalogues. Many {{are thought}} to have been forged and some may have been produced purely for philatelic purposes and to have never seen <b>genuine</b> <b>use.</b> For these reasons, collectors prefer to collect the stamps on cover, however, such covers are rare.

50|$|In the United Kingdom {{many local}} {{carriage}} labels {{have been issued}} by offshore islands, which in some cases had a <b>genuine</b> <b>use</b> to pay for transport of the mail to the mainland by ferry.

50|$|Stamps {{used for}} {{training}} postal {{workers in the}} United Kingdom are usually normal postage or other stamps, including television license and national insurance stamps (when they were in use), obliterated with two vertical or horizontal bars to prevent <b>genuine</b> <b>use,</b> though other forms of cancellation have been used such as overprinting or rubber stamps. They have frequently {{found their way into}} the hands of collectors. Early examples were properly printed with bars but more recent examples tend to simply be crossed through with a black marker pen. A range of cancelled or voided paper money, cheques, postal orders, credit cards and horizon labels are also used to train workers which takes place at counter training schools (CTOs). Before decimalisation in 1971, post offices were issued with very simple training stamps in the same colours as the upcoming decimal stamps.|$|E

5000|$|Problems of money, property, and {{authority}} may easily divert {{us from our}} primary spiritual aim. We think, therefore, that any considerable property of <b>genuine</b> <b>use</b> to A.A. should be separately incorporated and managed, thus dividing the material from the spiritual. An A.A. group, as such, should never go into business. Secondary aids to A.A., such as clubs or hospitals which require much property or administration, ought to be incorporated and so set apart that, if necessary, they can be freely discarded by the groups. Hence such facilities ought {{not to use the}} A.A. name. Their management should be the sole responsibility of those people who financially support them. For clubs, A.A. managers are usually preferred. But hospitals, as well as other places of recuperation, ought to be well outside A.A. [...] - [...] and medically supervised. While an A.A. group may cooperate with anyone, such cooperation ought never go so far as affiliation or endorsement, actual or implied. An A.A. group can bind itself to no one.|$|E

40|$|Article 15 (1) of the Community Trade Mark Regulation {{states that}} the Community Trade Mark holder has to put the mark into <b>genuine</b> <b>use</b> in the Community within five years from registration. Even though the {{regulation}} does not deal with the extent of use necessary, the Joint Statements uphold that <b>genuine</b> <b>use</b> within one country is enough. However, recent case law from national offices have ruled in the opposite direction, resulting in legal uncertainty concerning how much use that is needed. The courts claimed that use within merely one Member State is not use in {{a substantial part of}} the Community and therefore not genuine. This paper shows that it is not satisfactory to define <b>genuine</b> <b>use</b> in the Community by way of analogy to the term substantial part of the territory. The latter derives from the test of reputation concerning a different case entirely. Instead, most indicators point towards a market-oriented approach where national frontiers do not matter. Focus should be on the extent of use being made compared to the market concerned in the entire EU. A case-by-case assessment is required, where all relevant circumstances are taken into consideration...|$|E

The increasing complexity of image processing tasks at IPL is illustrated with examples of various applications from the planetary program and earth resources activities.

We propose a consistent estimator for the density of the increments of T in a stationary regime, derive its convergence rates and prove the optimality of the rates. It turns out that the convergence rates heavily depend on the decay of the Mellin transform of T. Finally, the performance of the estimator is analysed via a Monte Carlo simulation study...|$|E

In 1919 Arshak Fetvadjian was {{commissioned}} to design and supervise production of stamps for the new republic. Ten stamps were designed in different denominations and printed in Paris. Due to the occupation of Armenia they were never delivered and few were printed, so no <b>genuine</b> <b>uses</b> are known and many forged stamps are recorded. The stamps were sold to stamp collectors and dealers in Paris during 1924 and Hovanesian suggests that the Armenian government in exile (Dashnak Party) did this because they needed money to finance their activities,.|$|R

Now, more than six months after the CJEU has handed down its decision, commentators remain remarkably silent.
