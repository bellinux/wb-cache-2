Coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk.|$|E
5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> Dunfermline and tap <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E

There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video.

Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion.
