40|$|Abstract We report 17 {{children}} who were admitted to our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and required <b>haemofiltration</b> for renal replacement therapy between 1996 and 1999. Ten patients were male and 7 were female. The median age was 26 months (range 8 months to 19. 7 years). The main indication for acute renal replacement was acute renal failure (n= 13). Other indications included tumour lysis syndrome (n= 2), removal of toxin (n= 1) and end-stage renal failure with peritonitis (n= 1). Continuous venovenous <b>haemofiltration</b> (CVVH) was performed in 12 patients, continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHD) in 6 patients, continuous arteriovenous <b>haemofiltration</b> (CAVH) in 2 patients, continuous arteriovenous haemodiafiltration (CAVHD) in one patient and one patient underwent intermittent <b>haemofiltration</b> (IHF). The most common vascular access used was femoral vessels (n= 15), followed by the subclavian veins (n= 2). The median duration of <b>haemofiltration</b> was 22 hours (range 3 hours to 20 days). Analysis of {{the results showed that}} the drop in central venous pressure (p= 0. 002) and the reduction in serum urea level (p= 0. 0425) after <b>haemofiltration</b> were statistically significant.

40|$|Introduction: Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation is {{a supportive}} cardiopulmonary bypass technique {{for patients with}} acute reversible cardiovascular or respiratory failure. Favourable effects of <b>haemofiltration</b> during cardiopulmonary bypass instigated {{the use of this}} technique in infants on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The current study aimed at comparing clinical outcomes of newborns on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with and without continuous <b>haemofiltration.</b> Methods: Demographic data of newborns treated with <b>haemofiltration</b> during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were compared with those of patients treated without <b>haemofiltration</b> in a retrospective 1 : 3 case-comparison study. Primary outcome parameters were time on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, time until extubation after decannulation, mortality and potential cost reduction. Secondary outcome parameters were total and mean fluid balance, urine output in mL/kg/day, dose of vasopressors, blood products and fluid bolus infusions, serum creatinin, urea and albumin levels. Results: Fifteen patients with <b>haemofiltration</b> (HF group) were compared with 46 patients without <b>haemofiltration</b> (control group). Time on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was significantly shorter in the HF group: 98 hours (interquartile range (IQR) = 48 to 187 hours) versus 126 hours (IQR = 24 to 403 hours) in the control group (P = 0. 02). Time from decannulation until extubation was shorter as well: 2. 5 days (IQR = 0 to 6. 4 days) versus 4. 8 days (IQR = 0 to 121. 5 days; P = 0. 04). The calculated cost reduction was € 5000 per extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run. There {{were no significant differences in}} mortality. Patients in the HF group needed fewer blood transfusions: 0. 9 mL/kg/day (IQR = 0. 2 to 2. 7 mL/kg/day) versus 1. 8 mL/kg/day (IQR = 0. 8 to 2. 9 mL/kg/day) in the control group (P< 0. 001). Consequently the number of blood units used was significantly lower in the HF group (P< 0. 001). There was no significant difference in inotropic support or other fluid resuscitation. Conclusions: Adding continuous <b>haemofiltration</b> to the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit in newborns improves outcome by significantly reducing time on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and on mechanical ventilation, because of better fluid management and a possible reduction of capillary leakage syndrome. Fewer blood transfusions are needed. All in all, overall costs per extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run will be lower...|$|E
40|$|Intra-arterial {{chemotherapy}} {{combined with}} <b>haemofiltration</b> enables {{the administration of}} drugs to confined neoplastic tissue while limiting the systemic drug exposure. During the procedure, the cytotoxic drugs are injected into the arterial supply of the tumour and the venous blood coming from the tumour bed is pumped out and filtered trough <b>haemofiltration</b> unit in order to extract the cytotoxic drug not fixed on the tumour. The patients selected for such treatment failed previous intravenous chemotherapy. Thirteen patients underwent intra-arterial chemotherapy injections combined with <b>haemofiltration</b> procedures: 8 unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer and 5 pelvic recurrences from rectal cancer. Fluorouracil, mitomycin C and doxorubicin were infused. One out of thirteen patients presented a complete regression of his liver metastases, 5 / 13 presented a partial regression, 2 / 13 patients did not show any significant modification {{of the size of}} their lesions and were classified as stable disease, 5 / 13 patients showed a progression of their neoplastic disease.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective case-cohort study. A general hospital in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: The results of chronic intermittent treatment with <b>haemofiltration</b> (n = 10) or haemodialysis (n = 2) were analysed in patients with severe chronic heart failure, predominantly due to coronary heart disease, and oedema refractory to a pharmacological regimen including high dose frusemide.

Low P 2 -microglobuIin sieving coefficients and a highly negative filter mass balance error were observed during the initial phase of treatment with AN 69 but not with Duo-Flux or F 60, indicating {{a high degree of}} p 2 -microglobulin adsorption by AN 69. Total removal of P 2 -microglobulin was calculated by addition of the total amount adsorbed by the membrane and the total amount recovered in the collected ultrafiltrate. With AN 69 and F 60, total removal of P 2 -microglobulin amounted to 393 ± 135 (SD) and 316 ± 35 mg per treat-ment, while total removal with Duo-Flux was 242 + 79 mg per treatment.
