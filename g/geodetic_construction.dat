50|$|The {{latter was}} one of the most robust {{airframes}} ever developed, and pictures of its skeleton largely shot away, but still sound enough to bring its crew home safely, are still impressive. The <b>geodetic</b> <b>construction</b> offered a light and strong airframe (compared to conventional designs), with clearly defined space within for fuel tanks, payload and so on. However the technique was not easily transferred to other aircraft manufacturers, nor was Vickers able to build other designs in factories tooled for geodetic work.|$|E

Wallis used the term [...] "geodetic" [...] to apply to the airframe and distinguish it from [...] "geodesic" [...] which is the proper term for a line on a curved surface, arising from geodesy.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{reliability}} and trust of geodetic structure monitoring are related with new principles of leveling network construction, their testing and mathematical processing. Two indices, point density and errors in their altitude location, {{have been considered}} recently as the main characteristics of <b>geodetic</b> <b>construction</b> quality used for geodetic monitoring of  engineering object settlements. As it is an evitable distortion of the measuring data {{in the process of}} its accumulation and processing due to influence of additional factors (rough and systematic measurement errors, original data errors and so on), nowadays while evaluating the quality of geodetic constructions one more important characteristic is {{to be taken into account}} that is reliability of the <b>geodetic</b> <b>construction.</b> The majority of standard <b>geodetic</b> <b>construction</b> schemes do not have a sufficient reliability rate for definitive determination of construction settlements in any measuring cycle. Due to this very reason a problem concerning higher reliability of geodetic constructions and efficiency of their mathematical processing and, in consequence, provision of more accurate determination of engineering object settlements is considered as an actual one and it finds its solution in the paper. </p...|$|E
40|$|Slovenia {{is among}} the water-richest {{countries}} in Europe. Through our territory runns quite a few rivers on which we have successfully built a hydroelectric power plants to generate electricity. Already in the 80 - s, our experts were increasingly concerned by the increase in renewable electricity in that way. River Sava was preferred in the lower reaches, flowing through Brežice to Croatia. It was suggested to build hydro chain, which includes construction of hydroelectric power plants: Boštanj, Blanca, Brežice and Mokrice. The first two are already built and in operation, the last in the chain is expected {{at the end of}} 2015. This graduation thesis focuses on laws that are essentials for the construction of hydroelectric power plant and are strongly associated with the surveying profession (the <b>geodetic</b> <b>construction</b> plan for the design, surveying network, control measurements and registration in official records). The content of regulations and laws, is logically related to the building hydroelectric power plant Blanca. Surveyors have been through the entire process of building an indispensable part, without which the construction was not possible. Surveyor is the first presence on the ground and draw a surveying plan, which helps the designer on the project. Later, his duties have increased and include: regular transfers from the project into the nature, control measurements of compliance of construction with the project, calculations of transported volumes of material, monitoring and recording changes that occured during construction, and construction of surveying and mapping plan for the registration in official records. ...|$|E
5000|$|Wallis' {{design for}} the huge six-engined Victory Bomber drew upon his prior {{experience}} and expertise. Wallis was an expert on <b>geodetic</b> airframe <b>construction,</b> having previously used it in designs such as the Wellesley (1935) and Wellington (1936), and naturally used it again for the Victory Bomber; also, all existing Vickers tooling was for this construction method. His specification was for a 50-ton (45 tonne) bomber that could fly at high altitude, 45000 ft being calculated to give the bomb maximum impact speed, at a speed of 320 mph over a distance of 4000 mi. It would carry a single 22400 lb [...] "earthquake bomb". Defensive armament was minimal; speed and height would be its chief defence with one quad-gun turret in the tail position for any fighter aircraft that did attempt to reach it. The bomber would benefit by climbing to altitude while over Britain, where fighter defences could protect it. Due to the high altitudes that bombing missions would take place at, the crew compartment was pressurised.|$|R

40|$|Construction work {{starts and}} {{finishes}} with geodetic measurements, therefore geodetic measurements and labeling {{are the most}} important components of mounting and installation work in constructions and deformation observations. Modern constructions are distinguished by the size of construction objects, complexity of engineering structures and high precision of connectors and nodes of structural elements. These peculiarities and highly increased mechanization level caused changes in construction technology and character of engineering equipment of construction objects. Demand for precision has greatly increased. To reach a high precision of measurements, digital geodetic instruments are used. Large part of <b>geodetic</b> work in <b>constructions</b> is composed of leveling. This work contains investigations of leveling errors of digital levels. Changes in leveling methodology and sources of specific errors occur using digital levels for precise leveling. These changes can affect construction-engineering measurements. Precision investigations of a particular model of levels and coded staffs and digital leveling are necessary. Digital investigations of technical, geometrical and methodological parameters of instruments are also needed. The scope of this presentation includes resorting to digital automatic levels and impact of their accuracy on deformation and construction measurements...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the problem of}} the usage of post‐processing services of the ASG‐EUPOS system on the example of GNSS network established for geodetic service of building of the inclined drift, to make coal deposit accessible, and also building associated objects. For the purpose of <b>geodetic</b> service of <b>construction</b> realization network was established outside the planned objects. The network consists of six new ground points and four control points belonging to ASG‐EUPOS network. Simultaneous, static measurements of the network were performed in three‐hour observation session, using multi‐frequency and multi‐system satellite receivers – Trimble R 8. The paper presents three variants of post‐processing of the observation results. Calculations were performed using POZGEO‐D service and geodetic software package GEONET. The results of the calculation process revealed, that homogeneous vector networks should be adjusted on the ellipsoid or in the geocentric system. Model of adjustment of the vector network on the plane adopted in the GEONET software package should not be applied for elaboration of this type of network (long reference vectors more than 50 km) ...|$|R

The content of the thesis is divided into three sections. The first section describes the legal basis which specify the <b>geodetic</b> works in <b>construction</b> of buildings. The concepts of <b>construction,</b> which a <b>geodetic</b> surveyor should be very familiar with, are listed and explained. Instruments and software used for mapping out a facility and its surroundings are described in continuation. The main section presents a method for stabilizing a geodetic network, which served surveyors on the field as a base for carrying out the necessary works. A method of polar mapping is described as well as the accuracy of mapping by using this method. The practical section of the thesis relates to the work of a surveyor in the field as well as to an explanation of the use of software in mapping out a facility. Surveying of the terrain was carried out for the purpose of calculating the volume of the spoil. The final section presents a method for calculating the volumes of the spoil and the results of calculations...|$|R
