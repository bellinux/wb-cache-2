500|$|In {{spite of}} all this and the {{introduction}} of more recent Pacifics, {{in the middle of the}} 1950s Gresley types continued to have a quasi-monopoly of East Coast Main Line express passenger services, and as the Sixties approached they went through yet another series of improvements comparable to those of the 1920s. The most significant of these was the fitting of the French double Kylchap exhaust system, which was entirely due to the persistence from 1956 of P. N. Townend, Assistant District Motive Power Superintendent at King's Cross locomotive shed. [...] These modifications greatly reduced <b>exhaust</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> making the locomotives more economical and free-running, and also kept the firetubes clean, reducing turn-around time, so much so that they were able to fit into the more intensive diesel locomotive workings. The Kylchap arrangement was already being universally applied to the A4 streamlined Pacifics, though with the non-streamlined A3 locomotives, the soft exhaust would cause the smoke and steam to drift into the driver's forward vision. The solution came in the form of narrow German-style smoke deflectors, which somewhat changed the appearance of the A3 locomotives in their latter days.|$|E
2500|$|By comparison, a {{turbocharger}} {{does not}} place a direct mechanical {{load on the}} engine, although turbochargers place <b>exhaust</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> on engines, increasing pumping losses. This is more efficient because while the increased back pressure taxes the piston exhaust stroke, much of the energy driving the turbine {{is provided by the}} still-expanding exhaust gas that would otherwise be wasted as heat through the tailpipe. In contrast to supercharging, the primary disadvantage of turbocharging is what is referred to as [...] "lag" [...] or [...] "spool time". This is the time between the demand for an increase in power (the throttle being opened) and the turbocharger(s) providing increased intake pressure, and hence increased power.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{exhaust system}} {{provides}} a significant mechanical advantage by creating low <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> at the engine’s <b>exhaust</b> valves.

This variability maintains a comparable <b>exhaust</b> velocity and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> throughout the engine’s rev range. The result is that the turbocharger improves fuel efficiency without a noticeable level of turbocharger lag.|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial distribution of fuel in cylinders is a key factor affecting the combustion characteristics and emission generation of a DI diesel engine. The airfuel mixing quality is critical for controlling ignition timing and combustion duration. Avoiding fuel-rich areas within the cylinder can significantly reduce soot formation as well as high local temperatures resulting in low NOx formation. The present investigation {{is focused on the}} effects of advanced fuel injections and air path strategies as well as the effects of piston geometry and fuel spray angle on air-fuel homogeneity, combustion process and their impacts on the performance and emission of the engine. A Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder engine in combination with AVL Fire CFD software was used in this investigation. An experimental analysis was conducted to assess the combustion characteristics and emissions formation of the engine under various injection strategies such as different injection timing, quantity, ratio, dwell angles between injections with various exhaust valve opening times and <b>exhaust</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressures.</b> A quan- titative factor named Homogeneity Factor (HF) was employed in the CFD code in order to quantify the air-fuel mixing and understand how the air-fuel homogeneity within the cylinder can influence the combustion and emissions of the engine. The investigation concludes that multiple injection strategies have the potential to reduce diesel emissions while maintaining meaningful fuel economy. Split injection can be used to improve the air-fuel mixture locally and control temperature generation during the start of combustion. Increased air-fuel homogeneity results in fewer fuel-rich areas within the cylinder and contributes to the reduction of soot emission. Extending the pre-mixed combustion phase has a direct effect on the reduction of soot formation while NOx generation is highly dependent on the scale of the primary fuel injection event...|$|R

Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W.

Conversely, simply generating steam at process pressure instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has an opportunity cost. (See: Steam turbine#Steam supply and exhaust conditions) The capital and operating cost of high pressure boilers, turbines and generators are substantial, and this equipment is normally operated continuously, which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations.|$|R

40|$|On-site and near-site {{distributed}} {{power generation}} (DG), {{as part of}} a Buildings Cooling, Heating and Power (BCHP) system, brings both electricity and waste heat from the DG sources closer to the end user's electric and thermal loads. Consequently, the waste heat can be used as input power for heat-activated air conditioners, chillers, and desiccant dehumidification systems; to generate steam for space heating; or to provide hot water for laundry, kitchen, cleaning services and/or rest rooms. By making use of what is normally waste heat, BCHP systems meet a building's electrical and thermal loads with a lower input of fossil fuel, yielding resource efficiencies of 40 to 70 % or more. To ensure the success of BCHP systems, interactions of a DG system-such as a microturbine and thermal heat recovery units under steady-state modes of operation with various <b>exhaust</b> <b>back</b> pressures-must be considered. This article studies the performance and emissions of a 30 -kW microturbine over a range of design and off-design conditions in steady-state operating mode with various <b>back</b> <b>pressures.</b> In parallel with the experimental part of the project, a BCHP mathematical model was developed describing basic thermodynamic and hydraulic processes in the system, heat and material balances, and the relationship of the balances. to the system configuration. The model can determine the efficiency of energy conversion both for an individual microturbine unit and for the entire BCHP system for various system configurations and external loads. Based on actual data Tom a 30 -kW microturbine, linear analysis was used to obtain an analytical relationship between the changes in the thermodynamic and hydraulic parameters of the system. The actual data show that, when the backpressure at the microturbine exhaust outlet is increased to the maximum of 7 in. WC (0. 017 atm), the microturbine's useful power output decreases by from 3. 5 % at a full power setting of 30 kW to 5. 5 % at a one-third power setting (10 k w), while the efficiency of the unit decreases from 2. 5 to 4. 0 %, accordingly. Tests on the microturbine were conducted at the Cooling, Heating, and Power Laboratory set up at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Buildings Technology Center. Data were collected from the microturbine at power demand settings of 30 kW (full load) to 10 kW in 5 -kW increments. For each power demand setting, data measurements were taken over an entire range of microturbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressures.</b> The parameters measured were engine speed, ambient air temperature, air temperature at the microturbine inlet, gas temperature at the turbine outlet, exhaust gas temperature, throttle pressure loss, flow rate of natural gas, and composition of combustion products.

40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} and reduced emissions demands from users and legislative organisations have {{lead to the}} development of advanced combustion technologies for diesel engines. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a widely used technology to control diesel combustion and emissions, primarily to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Implementation of high levels of EGR (> 50 %) is able to simultaneously reduce both emissions of NOx and particulate matter (PM) to ultra low levels. However, high EGR combustion is subject to reduced combustion {{efficiency and}} stability with increased total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. This thesis presents research into low temperature diesel combustion (LTC) operation and the effects on combustion and emissions when the engine is operated under air, fuel and EGR rates encountered during transitions between LTC and conventional diesel operation modes. This has resulted in an improved understanding of the diesel combustion process and pollutant emissions with high rates of EGR, different fuel injection pressures and timings, post fuel injection and <b>exhaust</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressures.</b> The sensitivity of LTC to variations in engine speed, fuel injection quantity, and EGR rate and intake manifold temperature were investigated. Pseudo-transient operation of the engine was studied to interpret the transient performance of a diesel engine during transients within LTC and from LTC to conventional diesel combustion in a new European driving-cycle (NEDC) test. Experimental investigations were conducted on a single cylinder research diesel engine. Cylinder pressure, fuel consumption and gaseous and particulate emissions (filter smoke number, size distribution, and total number) were measured. The results showed that an increase in EGR rate can realise LTC on the research engine. Fuel injection parameters influenced the combustion phasing, and control of this was able to improve the combustion stability and to reduce the THC and CO emissions. The low smoke number for the LTC diesel combustion was a result of reduced mean particle size with possible changes in particulate composition. EGR is the most critical parameter influencing the LTC combustion and emissions. Transient simulation of an engine exhibits significant discrepancies in EGR rate and boost pressure. Pseudo-transient points at intermediate load condition showed significantly increased emissions, particularly smoke number. Retarded fuel injection timing and increased boost pressure were demonstrated to be an effective strategy to reduce smoke emissions for these pseudo-transient operating points.

50|$|Diesel exhaust {{contains}} {{relatively high}} levels of particulate matter (soot), consisting largely of elemental carbon. Catalytic converters cannot clean up elemental carbon, though they do remove up to 90 percent of the soluble organic fraction, so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or diesel particulate filter (DPF). Historically, a DPF consists of a cordierite or silicon carbide substrate with a geometry that forces the exhaust flow through the substrate walls, leaving behind trapped soot particles. Contemporary DPFs can be manufactured {{from a variety of}} rare metals that provide superior performance (at a greater expense). As the amount of soot trapped on the DPF increases, so does the back pressure in the exhaust system. Periodic regenerations (high temperature excursions) are required to initiate combustion of the trapped soot and thereby reducing the <b>exhaust</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> The amount of soot loaded on the DPF prior to regeneration may also be limited to prevent extreme exotherms from damaging the trap during regeneration. In the U.S., all on-road light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after January 1, 2007, must meet diesel particulate emission limits, meaning that they effectively have to be equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. Note that this applies only to the diesel engine used in the vehicle. As long as the engine was manufactured before January 1, 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007. During the re-generation cycle, most systems require the engine to consume more fuel in a relatively short amount of time in order to generate the high temperatures necessary for the cycle to complete. This adversely affects the overall fuel economy of vehicles equipped with DPF systems, especially in vehicles that are driven mostly in city conditions where frequent acceleration requires a larger amount of fuel to be burned and therefore more soot to collect in the exhaust system.|$|E

High <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply of steam turbine is to increase the quantity of air inlet and outlet as well as exhaust temperature through improving turbine <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> For condensing steam turbine unit of 50 MW studied in this article, <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> of which rise to 0. 032 MPa from 0. 0046 MPa, and the exhaust temperature will increase to 70 ℃ respectively. Through the calculation of rated condition and variable condition, we can obtain the impact to the unit due to the change of <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> and for unit of 50 MW can reduce 30876. 9 tons of standard coal consumption in a heating period. It can also decrease the emission of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, smoke and ashes, which effect of energy saving and emission reducing is very obvious...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} friction and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> on the formability of superplastically formed aluminium alloy AA 7475 sheet at the temperature of 517 °C. Several experiments with lubrication and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> are performed using a simple box shape tool cavity. The coefficient of Coulomb friction between the formed sheet and tool has been determined indirectly using a finite element model to simulate superplastic forming of the box shape. Typical values determined for all lubricant conditions tested {{are in the range}} 0. 1 < μ < 0. 2. The void growth with strain was determined directly from measurements as a function of <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> The results show the application of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> at 1 MPa reduces the growth of voids from 7 % to 0. 3 % void volume fraction at a logarithmic thickness strain of 0. 65. This paper reports <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> has a significantly greater role than friction in enhancing the formability of the allo...|$|R
