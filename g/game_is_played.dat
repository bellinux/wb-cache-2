5|$|World title {{competition}} {{first started}} in 1986 and required {{the use of}} ivory balls. However, this requirement was dropped in 1990. The highest score ever achieved in world competition was 374, by the Frenchman Jean Reverchon in 1992, while {{the highest score in}} competition overall is 427 set by Belgian Walter Bax on March 12, 2006 at a competition held in Deurne, Belgium, beating his own previous record of 425. The <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>played</b> predominantly in western Europe, especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>played,</b> each PC {{changes over}} time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when the <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>played</b> in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
25|$|Only five Super Bowls since 1984 have <b>been</b> <b>played</b> in stadiums used {{by three}} of these {{expansion}} teams; four of these <b>games</b> <b>were</b> <b>played</b> in Florida, and one <b>game</b> <b>was</b> <b>played</b> in Texas.|$|R

5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>played</b> {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E
5|$|Development of Jedi Knight {{was led by}} Justin Chin, who {{had also}} worked on the {{previous}} game. The most significant developments for Jedi Knight are the use of The Force and the lightsaber. The Force plays an integral role in how the player plays the game and shapes the way the <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>played.</b> The method of allocating credits to Force powers was designed with a role-playing video game style in mind, allowing the player the choice of which powers to improve. Chin said in an early interview that progress in the game {{is based upon the}} abilities the player develops.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>played</b> by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
