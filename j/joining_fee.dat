25|$|The Qantas {{frequent}} flyer programme {{is aimed}} at rewarding customer loyalty. Points are accrued based on distance flown, with bonuses that vary by travel class. Points can also be earned on other Oneworld airlines {{as well as through}} other non-airline partners. Points can be redeemed for flights or upgrades on flights operated by Qantas, Oneworld airlines, and other partners. Other partners include credit cards, car rental companies, hotels and many others. To join the programme, passengers living in Australia or New Zealand pay a one-off <b>joining</b> <b>fee,</b> and then become a Bronze Frequent Flyer (residents of other countries may join without a fee). All accounts remain active {{as long as there is}} points activity once every eighteen months. Flights with Qantas and selected partner airlines earn Status Credits— and accumulation of these allows progression to Silver status (Oneworld Ruby), Gold status (Oneworld Sapphire), Platinum and Platinum One status (Oneworld Emerald).|$|E
