40|$|The {{conventional}} <b>dyeing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> in {{the textile}} industry is usually performed at high temperatures {{although it is}} possible to dye at low temperatures. The <b>dyeing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> at low temperature presents some advantages from the industrial point of view, namely energy saving, environmental control and fibre protection (maintenance of the properties during the dyeing, finishing and final use). The conventional process of exhaustion dyeing of the microfibres of PA 6. 6 takes place at temperatures that can go from 98 to 115 ºC, in spite of it being possible to dye at lower temperatures, using for this effect dyes with low molecular weight, as it is the case of some acid dyes. However, in the dyeing with dyes of large molecule, as the metal complex dyes, it can result in defective dyeing due to their lower diffusion and migration properties. Dyeing at low temperatures without affecting the properties of dyeing, such as diffusion and levelness, {{has been shown to be}} possible with the aid of solvents. Polyester has been dyed with methylene chloride at temperatures of 40 ºC [1] and wool has been dyed at lower temperatures with n-butanol and benzyl alcohol [2]. In this work we studied the use of benzyl alcohol as an auxiliary for lowering the dyeing temperature of PA fibres. This product is referred in the literature as a solvent of PA at it’s boiling temperature, and also a product that causes the disaggregation of acid dyes in the dyeing of PA fibres [3]. To this effect we carried out exhaustion dyeings with metal complex dyes for evaluating the minimum temperature of dyeing with benzyl alcohol and its effect on the exhaustion and diffusion of the dyes. Thermal analysis techniques were used to understand the effect of dyeing, with and without benzyl alcohol, on properties and thermal behaviour of PA 6. 6 microfibres.

Wool fibres were treated with oxygen plasma and three types <b>of</b> <b>dyeing</b> systems that are commonly used for wool dyeing, namely: (i) acid dye, (ii) chrome dye and (iii) reactive dye; {{were used in the}} dyeing process. For acid dyeing, the <b>dyeing</b> rate <b>of</b> LTP-treated wool <b>fibre</b> was greatly increased, but the final dyeinq exhaustion equilibrium did not show any significant change. For chrome dyeing, the <b>dyeing</b> rate <b>of</b> LTP-treated wool <b>fibre</b> was increased, but the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased only to a small extent.

Two azo bifunctional dyes with different reactive groups were selected: C. I. Reactive Black 5 (vinyl sulphone) and C. I. Reactive Red 231 (chlorotriazine). The influence of pH (5 and 9) and dye hydrolysis on the decolourisation yield was studied. The electrochemical treatment was the most efficient, with 95 – 100 % colour removal yield. The coagulation with M. oleifera waste also achieved high colour removal efficiency (91 – 94 %). Both methods showed an independent behaviour with respect to pH or dye hydrolysis. The enzymatic treatment should be performed at pH 5. This method was suitable to remove the chlorotriazine dye (92 – 93 % efficiency), whereas the vinyl sulphone one showed a marked dependence on dye hydrolysis: moderately efficient for the hydrolysed dye and highly efficient without hydrolysis.

40|$|Cotton {{is a vital}} {{material}} for the textile industry, providing the fundamental raw component for the manufacture of numerous and varied garments. It has been thoroughly characterised {{both in terms of}} its constitution; behaviour under a variety of environmental and manufacturing conditions; and several mechanisms by which it takes up dyestuffs. Recently the availability of a range of high-performance surface analysis tools has allowed researchers to begin to assess the contribution of the surface interface to the overall properties of cellulose in cotton. In particular, these approaches offer considerable potential to address the current lack of fundamental experimental data in support of the proposed dye-uptake mechanisms in cotton <b>fibres.</b> The absence <b>of</b> a detailed molecular model for the process makes it difficult to predict dye performance and to identify the key characteristics of the cotton which influence dyeing. For example, the existence and location <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> binding sites is still unclear. It has been postulated that the occurrence of crystalline or amorphous regions in cotton {{may play a role in}} such binding and in dye uptake. A deeper understanding <b>of</b> the <b>dyeing</b> mechanisms therefore requires knowledge of the interplay between the physical chemistry <b>of</b> the <b>dye,</b> its adsorption/diffusion onto the surface of and within cotton fibres, and the related physical and chemical characteristics of the cotton itself. Here we begin to address these broad questions through the application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other complimentary surface analytical techniques, to analyse a range <b>of</b> <b>dyed</b> and undyed cellulose based textiles. We provide high-resolution surface morphological image data, which show nanometre scale detail of the surface <b>of</b> <b>dyed</b> and undyed cotton fibres. It is believed that the dyeing process induces an increase in crystallinity, due to breakages in hydrogen bonds between cellulose chain molecules during swelling <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> within the dyebath, thus allowing dye molecules to enter and become entrapped within the fibre matrix. We provide evidence in the form of image data that suggest a difference in the crystal structure between undyed and dyed cellulose fibres to support this theory. We also reveal possible crystalline and amorphous regions within the substrate through AFM phase imaging using modified tips and successfully fingerprint regions <b>of</b> <b>dyed</b> and undyed cellulose fibres. Complimentary surface chemical analysis <b>of</b> <b>dyed</b> and undyed <b>fibres,</b> provide qualitative and quantitative data to show the presence <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> molecules on the surface <b>of</b> <b>dyed</b> cellulose textiles. Novel investigations <b>of</b> <b>dyed</b> <b>fibres</b> through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), determine the amount <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> present at the surface <b>of</b> cotton <b>fibres.</b> Using the N 1 s atomic orbital region as a diagnostic peak, the level <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> loading could be directly attributed to the concentration levels <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> within the dyebath. The XPS data also provided strong evidence for possible dye-uptake mechanisms. We observed that certain stages <b>of</b> the <b>dyeing</b> process directly influenced the amount <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> entering cotton <b>fibres.</b> XPS showed that an increase in salt (NaCl) content within the dyebath produced dyed fibres with increased presence <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> compound at the surface. The knowledge obtained from these studies will help to improve the dyes and dyeing mechanisms for cotton and other textiles, thus improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>dyed</b> garments offered to the consumer.

In contrast to natural dyes which must be mordanted {{in order to be}} applied on the same kind <b>of</b> substrates, direct <b>dyes</b> can be used directly. These dyes contain solubilizing sulfonic acid groups that are ionized in aqueous solution, and therefore the dye molecule is present in the dyebath as the anion. As result, an electrolyte must be added to the dye liquor because cellulose fibers have a negative surface charge in water, which would repel the dye anion. The cations of the electrolyte neutralize the negative charge and favor the adsorbtion <b>of</b> the <b>dye</b> ions on the fiber. The dye sorption can be described with the help of Nernst, Freundlich or Langmuir adsorption isotherms. The aim of the present work was to establish the influence of two important parameters (temperature and electrolyte concentration) on the <b>dyeing</b> <b>of</b> a cellulosic substrate- mercerized cotton- with one disazo direct dyes, through the study of the equilibrium isotherms. The dyeings were carried out at three different temperatures: 60 o, 86 o and 96 oC and at two sodium chloride concentrations: 4 g/L and 10 g/L. The study <b>of</b> the <b>dyeing</b> process was performed by comparing the experimental isotherms <b>of</b> the studied <b>dyes</b> with the classical sorption isotherms: Nernst, Freundlich and Langmuir. The most appropriate sorption model was established by linear regression analysis. Better statistical results were obtained in the case of Langmuir adsorption model...|$|R
