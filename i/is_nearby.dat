5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street <b>is</b> <b>nearby,</b> named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx {{developed}} a catarrh that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a stateless person. Family and friends in London buried his body in Highgate Cemetery (East), Highgate, London on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists (George Eliot's grave <b>is</b> <b>nearby).</b> There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Fordun's account of the Battle of Mortlach {{is due to a}} distortion of local tradition. Mortlach <b>is</b> <b>nearby</b> the site of the battle in which Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III) wrested power from Lulach. Máel Coluim's first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, was the niece of Harald III of Norway, and it has been argued by Alex Woolf that the tradition of a battle between the Scots and Norwegians is due to a Scandinavian involvement on the side of Máel Coluim.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus Bridge, {{a target}} of the British 6th Airborne, {{was the site of}} some of the {{earliest}} action of the Normandy landings. The bridge was replaced in 1994 by one similar in appearance, and the original is now housed on the grounds of a nearby museum complex. Sections of Mulberry Harbour B still sit in the sea at Arromanches, and the well-preserved Longues-sur-Mer battery <b>is</b> <b>nearby.</b> The Juno Beach Centre, opened in 2003, was funded by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, France, and Canadian veterans.|$|E

5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain <b>is</b> <b>nearby,</b> its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured {{on opposite sides of}} the mountain. If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|At Omaha Beach, {{parts of}} the Mulberry harbour are still visible, {{and a few of}} the beach {{obstacles}} remain. A memorial to the American National Guard sits at the location of a former German strongpoint.

5|$|Entrance to the {{platforms}} {{is controlled}} by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar {{is on the left}} and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel <b>is</b> <b>nearby.</b> The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction maintenance depot {{can be seen in the}} distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.|$|E
5|$|Escaping the Phantom Zone, Zod and {{his crew}} {{intercept}} a transmission from the scout vessel and travel to Earth. Deducing that Kal-El <b>is</b> <b>nearby,</b> they broadcast a global address demanding that he surrender or risk war. Clark meets with the United States Army and agrees to comply, with Lois joining him as a hostage. Zod reveals that he possesses advanced terraforming equipment salvaged from Kryptonian outposts, which he intends to use to transform Earth into a new Krypton. His science officer, Jax-Ur, extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will annihilate humanity and build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity. With help from Jor-El, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military, just as Zod orders an invasion.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that only 7,000 daily riders entered the station between September 13–22, 2015, drastically below the MTA's projected ridership of 32,000 passengers upon the station's opening. This was attributed to incompleteness of developments in the area, {{as well as an}} unopened entrance to the High Line park, which <b>is</b> <b>nearby.</b> In late October 2015, AM New York found that the average daily ridership was even lower, at only 5,900 passengers per day, except for during the 2015 New York Comic Con on October 8–11, when average daily ridership reached 18,300 daily riders. The station's official ridership between September 13 and December 31, 2015, was 692,165, making it the 392nd busiest station in the city out of 422 total stations. Ridership at the station increased in 2016 with 2,691,851 riders, making it the 189th busiest station in the city out of 422 total stations.|$|E

5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female <b>is</b> <b>nearby.</b> In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|Most {{historical}} {{buildings are}} concentrated in the Old Town. Bratislava's Town Hall is a complex of three buildings erected in the 14th–15th centuries and now hosts the Bratislava City Museum. Michael's Gate is the only gate that has been preserved from the medieval fortifications, and it ranks among {{the oldest of the}} town's buildings; the narrowest house in Europe <b>is</b> <b>nearby.</b> The University Library building, erected in 1756, was used by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1802 to 1848. Much of the significant legislation of the Hungarian Reform Era (such as the abolition of serfdom and the foundation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences) was enacted there.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator <b>is</b> <b>nearby.</b> The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E

5|$|Outside the city, Crocker Range Park, {{occupying a}} stretch of c. 20 x 80km of the Crocker Range {{mountain}} chain to the city's southeast (roughly between Tenom and Tambunan, is a popular spot for jungle trekking and camping. Kota Kinabalu is also the gateway {{to one of the}} most popular conservation areas in Malaysia, Kinabalu Park. The park is a two-hour drive away from the city and Mount Kinabalu, which is the 10th highest peak in South-East Asia and the highest in Malaysia, is located there. The Rafflesia Forest Reserve near Tambunan, which is 30kilometres away from Kota Kinabalu, is also within the Crocker Range National Park boundary. One of the smaller species of Rafflesia, R. pricei, can be found there. The Gunung Emas Highland Resort, which <b>is</b> <b>nearby,</b> is another spot famous for its scenery and cool climate.
