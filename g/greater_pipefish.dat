50|$|The <b>Greater</b> <b>{{pipefish}},</b> (Syngnathus acus, Linnaeus, 1758), is a pipefish of {{the family}} Syngnathidae. It is a seawater fish and the type specimen of the genus Syngnathus.|$|E
50|$|The Lesser {{pipefish}} or Nilsson's pipefish, Syngnathus rostellatus, is a pipefish {{similar to}} the <b>greater</b> <b>pipefish,</b> but with no crest above the head. Usually it reaches up to 17 cm in length, maximally 18 cm, although in South Wales they are usually not more than 10 to 13 cm long. They have a light to dark green-brown colour with bar-like markings on the sides (compare the <b>greater</b> <b>pipefish).</b> Lesser pipefish are found all around the British Isles {{and as far as}} the French coast , although it has now been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study the habit at selection of juvenile cod Gadus morhua, juvenile whiting merlangus merlangius, black goby Gobius niger, <b>great</b> <b>pipefish</b> Syngnathus acus, sand eel Ammodytes tobianus, butterfish Pholis gunnellus, three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus acculeatus, sea stickleback Spinachia spinachia, goldsinny Ctenolabrus rupestris, and flounder Plathichthys flesus. Aquaria with compartments with algae, with sand and with no substratum were used. Cod, whiting and <b>great</b> <b>pipefish</b> preferred the empty compartments followed by the compartments with sand. For the other species {{no significant differences were}} observed althouqh butterfish, three-spined stickleback, and sea stickleback were most frequently found in compartments with algae, and black goby and sand eel were most frequently found in the compartments with sand. The experiments also showed that cod and whiting had a significant attraction to each other...|$|R
40|$|Supplementary data {{related to}} this article can be found at: [URL] dx. doi. org/ 10. 1016 /j. ecss. 2014. 03. 017 One of the most {{widespread}} invasive alien species (IAS) in aquatic ecosystems is the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. Several {{studies have shown that}} C. fluminea can cause large-scale changes in macrozoobenthic assemblages; however, very few attempted to investigate the effects of this IAS on mobile epibenthic species, such as fishes and crustaceans. In this context, the influence of C. fluminea on epibenthic species was investigated during one year by comparing the associated epibenthic fauna in three nearby sites of the Minho estuary (NW of the Iberian Peninsula), wherein the abiotic conditions are similar but the density of the Asian clam is highly different. From a total of 13 species, six were significantly influenced by C. fluminea; five responded positively, namely the brown shrimp Crangon crangon, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, the common goby Pomatoschistus microps, the brown trout Salmo trutta fario and the <b>great</b> <b>pipefish</b> Syngnathus acus, whereas the shore crab Carcinus maenas was negatively influenced. However, stomach contents analysis revealed that fish and crustacean species do not feed on C. fluminea, suggesting that this IAS is still not a large component of the diet of higher trophic levels in this estuarine ecosystem. Our results suggest that the structure provided by C. fluminea shells is likely {{to be one of the}} main factors responsible for the differences observed. C. fluminea physical structure seems to influence the epibenthic associated fauna, when found in densities higher than 1000 ind. /m 2, with sedentary small-bodied crustaceans and fishes being mainly attracted by the increasing in habitat complexity and consequent enhancement of heterogeneity and shelter availability.

50|$|The River Gweebarra is a {{brown trout}} and salmon fishery. Other species include Sand goby, European flounder, European eel, plaice, Fifteen-spined stickleback, Five-bearded rockling, Lesser sandeel, Two-spotted goby, <b>Greater</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Long-spined sea scorpion, Three-spined stickleback, turbot and pollack.|$|E
50|$|Syngnathus temminckii {{was until}} {{recently}} synonymised with the European species S. acus Linnaeus, 1758 (<b>greater</b> <b>pipefish),</b> but morphological {{data show that}} it is distinct. Genetic data further indicate {{that it is not}} even the sister taxon of S. acus, but of another southern African species, the critically endangered river pipefish S. watermeyeri.|$|E
50|$|The fish is {{generally}} 33 cm to 35 cm in length with a reported maximum length of 47 cm. They are almost square in each {{segment of the}} body, and known to feel rigid when handled. The <b>Greater</b> <b>pipefish</b> has distinctive body rings which are a sandy brown with darker bars covering his body in between.|$|E
5000|$|The {{head has}} a long, thin, round snout {{with a small}} up-turned mouth; the eyes are small and {{situated}} well back towards the gill covers; The body is long and thin, covered with bony plates; the dorsal fin situates halfway along the body, and pelvic fins are found below this. The caudal fin is shaped like a fan, and small pectoral fins are situated behind the gills. The lesser and <b>greater</b> <b>pipefish</b> species differ because one has a crest on the head while one doesn't [...] However, they are still quite similar: a fully grown lesser pipefish and a young <b>greater</b> <b>pipefish</b> share similar coloration and markings and they both have a caudal fin and swim in a similar style. One distinguishing feature of the lesser pipefish is a continuous black line from the gills down the belly to the tail, although this not very apparent on very young specimens.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Greater</b> <b>pipefish</b> {{has a long}} {{segmented}} armoured body, angular {{in cross}} section and stretching up 45 cm long with its stiff appearance. It ranges a color brown to green in with broad alternating light and dark hue along it. Its customized by a long snout with mouth on end and a slight hump {{on the top of}} the body just behind the eyes.|$|E
40|$|Like most ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), {{pipefishes}} (Syngnathoidei) feed by suction. Most pipefishes {{reach their}} prey by a rapid dorso-rotation of the head. In the present study, we analysed the feeding kinematics of the razor fish, Centriscus scutatus, {{and of the}} <b>greater</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Syngnathus acus in detail. We found capture times of as little as 4 – 6  ms for C. scutatus and 6 – 8  ms for S. acus. We then hypothesized that the long snout of pipefishes is optimal for such fast feeding. To test this, we implemented in a mathematical model the following considerations. To reach the prey as fast as possible, a low moment of inertia increases the head's angular speed, whereas a long snout decreases the angle over which the head must be turned. The model accurately predicted the snout lengths {{of a number of}} pipefishes. We found that the optimal snout length, with which a prey will be reached fastest, is inversely related to its cross-section. In spite of the small cross-section, the development of a long snout can be an evolutionary advantage because this reduces the time to approach the prey...|$|E
40|$|Gyrodactylus eyipayipi sp. n. is {{described}} from the skin, gills, flute and male brood pouch of captive specimens of the <b>greater</b> <b>pipefish</b> Syngnathus acus L., collected for and maintained at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town, South Africa. It {{is the first}} marine Gyrodactylus species reported from the African continent. The new species is compared to the three known Gyrodactylus species affecting syngnathiform hosts (G. pisculentus Williams, Kritsky, Dunnigan, Lash et Klein, 2008, G. shorti Holliman, 1963, and G. syngnathi Appleby, 1996). Although all four species have similar-sized and shaped attachment hooks with some overlap, separation of the species is possible using marginal hook morphology. The marginal hooks of G. eyipayipi measure (mean) 30 µm in total length and are larger {{than those of the}} three other species (mean, 24 - 28 µm). Gyrodactylus eyipayipi can also be discriminated based on differences {{in the shape of the}} marginal hook sickle notably by its long sickle point which extends far beyond the toe, its blunt rounded toe and, by the approximate rectangular shape to the base of the sickle. By comparison, the sloping toe regions of G. pisculentus and G. syngnathi give the sickle bases an approximately triangular shape, whilst the short sickle point and open aperture to the sickles of G. shorti allow for their discrimination from G. eyipayipi...|$|E
