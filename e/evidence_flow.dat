This method involves translating a rule-base into an <b>evidence</b> <b>flow</b> graph, a representation originally developed for real-time intelligent systems in distributed environments, and then running simulations of the <b>evidence</b> <b>flow</b> graph. Certain errors can be found during the translation process. The simulations can detect output sensitivity to rule firing order, to order of presentation of inputs, and to small changes in input values...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this ongoing {{research}} and development program is to develop software tools which enable the rapid development, upgrading, and maintenance of embedded real-time artificial intelligence systems. The goals of {{this phase of the}} research were to investigate the feasibility of developing software tools which automatically translate expert system rules into Ada code and develop methods for performing validation and verification testing of the resultant expert system. A prototype system was demonstrated which automatically translated rules from an Air Force expert system was demonstrated which detected errors in the execution of the resultant system. The method and prototype tools for converting AI representations into Ada code by converting the rules into Ada code modules and then linking them with an Activation Framework based run-time environment to form an executable load module are discussed. This method is based upon the use of <b>Evidence</b> <b>Flow</b> Graphs which are a data flow representation for intelligent systems. The development of prototype test generation and evaluation software which was used to test the resultant code is discussed. This testing was performed automatically using Monte-Carlo techniques based upon a constraint based description of the required performance for the system...|$|E

Using the analogy of the supply chain borrowed from the petrochemical industry, the study outlines key aspects of the evidence ecosystem in which the centres operate, including <b>evidence</b> <b>flow,</b> demand pulls, transmission lines, usability, waste and incentives. Drawing on a literature review, the report identifies interventions most likely to improve the implementation of evidence in policy making and delivery and outlines the characteristics of evidence ecosystems that contribute most to their effectiveness and efficiency. The study then presents the findings from fifty-five semi-structured interviews with a structured sample of personnel in each What Works sector, reflecting on evidence sources, transmission lines, problems and incentives across sectors. It concludes with the presentation of a generic form of the evidence ecosystem followed by a list of generic recommendations, addressing issues across all What Works sectors and focusing on evidence creation, translation and implementation. The ecosystem adapted for each What Works sector is then presented followed by lists of recommendations for each sector...|$|E

Key Points • • Eyewitnesses sometimes make identification errors that can have profound consequences. False identifi-cations of the innocent can lead to false convictions, and false non-identifications of the guilty can allow criminals to commit additional crimes. • • Research has led to several proposals for reforms, {{but many of the}} proposed reforms result in a trade-off of errors as correct and false identification rates covary. • • A theoretical framework that separates accuracy from response bias is critical to understanding the error trade-off and producing true overall reductions in error. • • Eyewitness confidence can be helpful in reducing errors as eyewitness <b>evidence</b> <b>flows</b> downstream in the criminal justice process...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{calls for}} {{evidence-based}} policies, {{the process of}} using evidence in forest conservation policy implementation has remained unclear. In this paper, we focus on voluntary conservation and investigate complex ways to use evidence in implementation of the Forest Biodiversity Programme METSO in Finland. Data were collected via nine focus group discussions involving a total of 59 forest conservation stakeholders. Through interpretative qualitative analysis, we found that forest owners' and forest advisers' awareness of the voluntary instrument and the smooth interplay of knowledge types are important factors in implementing voluntary conservation. Knowledge use should be locally bound for policy implementation to be effective. Social relationships enable integrating local knowledge. Forest owners, advisers, authorities and other actors interpret scientific and other knowledges (and simultaneously co-produce new knowledge) in practical action. We conclude that educating forest advisers, informing forest owners, and increasing collaboration can enhance <b>evidence</b> <b>flows</b> from research to practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{occurrence}} of pulmonary artery obstruction {{in the course}} of acute aortic dissection is an unusual complication. The mechanism implicated is the rupture of the outer layer of the aorta and the subsequent hemorrhage into the adventitia of the pulmonary artery that causes its wall thickening and, at times, produces extrinsic obstruction of the vessel. There are no reports of this complication in acute intramural hematoma. Case presentation An 87 -year-old woman was admitted to the hospital in shock after having had severe chest pain followed by syncope. An urgent transesophageal echocardiogram revealed the presence of acute intramural hematoma, no evidence of aortic dissection, severe pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, and periaortic hematoma that involved the pulmonary artery generating circumferential wall thickening of its trunk and right branch with no <b>evidence</b> of <b>flow</b> obstruction. Urgent surgery was performed but the patient died in the operating room. The post mortem examination, in the operating room, confirmed that there was an extensive hematoma around the aorta and beneath the adventitial layer of the pulmonary artery, with no <b>evidence</b> of <b>flow</b> obstruction. Conclusion This {{is the first time that}} this rare complication is reported in the scenario of acute intramural hematoma and with the transesophageal echocardiogram as the diagnostic tool. </p...|$|R
