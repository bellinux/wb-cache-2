25|$|Shortly after midnight, a 25-year-old woman {{suffered}} a fractured bone after being {{shot in the}} leg by a live round fired from New Barnsley RUC base. The base {{was the target of}} a gun and grenade attack. At the Larnak Way interface in West Belfast, loyalists tried to enter the nationalist area at 3am. A shot fired from the nationalist side struck a 14-year-old Protestant boy who was climbing over the security fence. <b>It</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> in the shoulder and punctured a lung. One source reported that warning shots had been fired, while another said the teenager was wounded when an IRA unit launched a gun and grenade attack on a military base near the interface. Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) gunmen also opened fire on British soldiers in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast.|$|E
500|$|Five {{months after}} moving onto Coronation Street, Toyah {{developed}} {{a crush on}} her neighbour, Spider Nugent (Martin Hancock), and even turned vegetarian to try and impress him. Hancock told All About Soap's Hilary Kingsley that Spider initially saw Toyah as [...] "a chubby schoolgirl, a pesky brat who {{had a crush on}} him." [...] However, when she listened to his issues and helped him with his battles against the local supermarket and the council, Spider began to admire her instead. Hancock explained [...] "She was so efficient and hard-working that she became a friend. And then, over the summer, <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Blimey! She's turned out nice!" [...] While Spider and Toyah watched the 1999 solar eclipse together, they ended up having sex for the first time. Hancock observed that both Spider and Toyah were overcome by the excitement to the point that there was [...] "an explosion of lust." [...] However, in the morning, Spider was torn about what had happened. He admired Toyah, but knew that if they became a couple, it would cause a lot of problems, particularly as there was a ten-year age gap between them. Taylor explained that she was happy that her character was getting together with Spider, although their scenes together often took place in the [...] "grottiest" [...] of locations.|$|E
2500|$|... 5 October saw no matches, but the {{following}} day the Leewards went top {{of the table and}} became the first team to qualify for the Final Four after a victory described as [...] "miraculous" [...] by the Guyana Chronicle. Their opponents Trinidad and Tobago were chasing 245 to win, and needed three off the last over with a wicket in hand and West Indies wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin at the crease on 48, facing the first ball from Gavin Tonge (who had bowled nine overs for 60 previously). A fast, full-length ball saw Ramdin play across the line, missing the ball as <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> on the pad, and the umpire gave him lbw. With no more wickets remaining, the Trinbagonians had lost by two runs. Guyana went second in the table after their seven-run win over Jamaica, with Sarwan missing out on a third successive century but still making 63 off 59 balls in a total of 219, and Jamaica then lost four wickets for 20 runs at the death to need 22 off the last eight balls; they could only get 14. Windward Islands also went down for the first time of the season, losing to Barbados after needing seven runs off the final over. They had needed 92 with four wickets in hand in the 34th over, but Rawl Lewis and Liam Sebastien put on 81 in 14.1 overs, and Sebastien was batting with the number 10 Mervyn Matthew. He was bowled on the first ball from substitute Corey Collymore, and Alvin LaFeuille could only make four off the final five balls as the Windwards closed one run short of a tie.|$|E
50|$|A {{drunkard}} begs {{an image}} of the Sacred Heart for a peso every morning. A sexton wraps a half-peso piece in paper with a rock to give it some weight, and throws <b>it</b> to <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> in the head. The drunkard finds the coin and says {{if it had been a}} full peso, it would have killed him.|$|R

When he does not get any response, he goes to his locker and gets a gun that shoots wooden stakes. He returns to the classroom and finds Stefan there. He shots him but Stefan catches the stake before <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him.</b> Alaric tries to reload but Stefan stops him and gets the gun.|$|R

60|$|Umslopogaas smiled grimly, {{for he had}} a {{sense of}} humour and could {{appreciate}} a repartee even when <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> hard. Then we stopped talking for the climb took all our breath.|$|E
50|$|Charlie in his drunken state {{sees the}} dummy as the rival and prepares to fight. Mabel watches from the bedroom, {{frustrated}} by his actions. Charlie demands the dummy leaves. He pushes it. It swings back then rolls forward again striking Charlie. Charlie tries to placate it but ends up striking it again. Each time he <b>hits</b> <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> back harder. Mabel joins {{in the fight}} then reveals to Charlie {{that it is just}} a dummy. Meanwhile, neighbour get concerned at the noise.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Mr. and Mrs. Robin Redbreast, one of {{our most}} aristocratic families," [...] said he, {{swinging}} his club around in a circle until Chubbins ducked his head for fear <b>it</b> might <b>hit</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the office, Angelus confronts Rebecca {{and his two}} employees. He mocks Wesley {{for being}} inadequate, then tells Cordelia how bad {{she was in the}} play. She threatens him with water, trying to {{convince}} him that it's holy water. The water temporarily stuns <b>him</b> when <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him,</b> allowing Wesley to knock him down into the elevator shaft. Angel wakes up, chained to his bed, feeling horrible about the things he said. Cordelia reluctantly forgives him, but leaves Angel chained to the bed.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} the inwardness of the {{information}} {{did not seem to}} come home to Mr. Gooch. Then <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him.</b> He spun round. John was standing squarely between him and the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am. Aimed at her. But <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him.</b> Yes, ma'am, hard. Gev him a black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn't {{the heart}} to try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the inwardness of the {{information}} {{did not seem to}} come home to Mr. Gooch. Then <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him.</b> He spun round. Billy Windsor was standing with his back against the door and a more than nasty look on his face.|$|E
5000|$|After a {{wild ride}} inside the kangaroo's pouch, Bugs gets out and is then struck by a boomerang thrown by an aborigine, whom Bugs later calls [...] "Nature Boy". Bugs throws the boomerang away but <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> again. Nature Boy confronts Bugs, who teases him into a yelling fit. Nature Boy throws his spear at Bugs, who runs and dives into a rabbit hole. Bugs tricks Nature Boy into {{thinking}} he's stabbing the rabbit down the hole, then kicks the man down into the hole.|$|R

500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Astronomic Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes an {{expedition}} to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers—Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus—agree to the plan. They build a space capsule {{in the shape of a}} bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of [...] "marines", most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits. The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> in the eye.|$|R
60|$|With a quaintly mischievous gesture {{she flung}} the rose at him; <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> in the face, then fell; he had perforce to stoop {{in order to}} pick it up. When he once more {{straightened}} his tall figure she was standing quite close to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "`I am the {{careless}} fellow!' I shouted. At {{the same}} time I flung the nest straight into his upturned face. The result was better than I had expected; for <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> fair, and the four eggs, bursting on his forehead, poured over his eyes and nose.|$|E
60|$|Gillinger {{wandered around}} under {{the ball for}} what seemed an age. It dropped as swiftly as a rocket shoots upward. Gillinger went forward in a circle, then sidestepped, and threw up his broad hands. He misjudged the ball, and <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> fairly {{on the head and}} bounced almost to where Doran stood at second.|$|E
60|$|A rough-and-tumble {{scrimmage}} ensued, {{and it must}} be {{said that}} the bully got by far the worst of <b>it.</b> Tom <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> again and again, and Sam also, and when at last he staggered to his feet, one eye was almost closed and his nose was bleeding profusely.|$|R
60|$|But {{it is in}} the music-hall, as I have said, that I am most {{impressed}} with the youthfulness of man. How delighted we are when the long man in the little boy's hat, having asked his short brother a riddle, and before he can find time to answer <b>it,</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> over the stomach with an umbrella! How we clap our hands and shout with glee! It isn't really his stomach: it is a bolster tied round his waist--we know that; but seeing the long man whack at that bolster with an umbrella gives us almost as much joy as if the bolster were not there.|$|R
60|$|Answer. I am sorry. De Vaux is not dead. True, {{the ball}} had <b>hit</b> <b>him,</b> oh yes, <b>it</b> had <b>hit</b> <b>him,</b> but <b>it</b> had glanced off against a family Bible, which he carried in his {{waistcoat}} {{in case of}} illness, struck some hymns that {{he had in his}} hip-pocket, and, glancing off again, had flattened itself against De Vaux's diary of his life in the desert, which was in his knapsack.|$|R
60|$|Pickens sent up a {{tremendous}} fly, the highest ever batted on Madden's Hill. It went over Tom Lindsay in center field, and Tom ran and ran. The ball {{went so far}} up that Tom had time to cover the ground, {{but he could not}} judge it. He ran round in a little circle, with hands up in bewilderment. And when the ball dropped <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> on the head and bounded away.|$|E
60|$|She {{bent down}} and picked up a sharp stone and flung it quickly at him. He had no time to duck. <b>It</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> on the temple. With a cry he put his hand to his head and when he took it away it was wet with blood. Ethel stood still, panting with rage. He turned very pale, and without a word, taking up his coat, went away. Ethel let herself fall back into the water and the stream carried her slowly down to the ford.|$|E
6000|$|So he done it; and it {{satisfied}} him; and he {{was that}} glad to see me again he didn't know what to do. And {{he wanted to know}} all about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him. So he thought and thought, and pretty soon he says: ...|$|E
50|$|Recognizers: Their main {{job is to}} get rid of locked doors, {{which means}} that the Recognizer will not appear if no doors are locked. The {{precursor}} to its arrival is a loud rumbling noise, followed by it slowly drifting into the screen from any of the four walls. Its job is to close all locked doors, firing a black block at each door to do this. If the player touches the recognizer, he is instantly killed, and the recognizer is nearly invincible. It also launches a paralysis cage at Tron. If <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him,</b> he is paralyzed {{for the duration of the}} Recognizer's mission. Once the Recognizer has unlocked every door, it disappears through the bottom of the screen.|$|R
50|$|When Captain America {{repeatedly}} refuses his {{challenges to}} a fight, Super-Patriot attacks him. Although Captain America {{proves to be}} a more skilled fighter and lands blow after blow, Walker manages to absorb the attacks. With neither man going down after a lengthy brawl, Super-Patriot throws a throwing star at Captain America after they have stopped fighting. Captain America is too tired to dodge, and <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> in the chest. Super-Patriot remarks he chose not to throw it full force. A weary Captain America is left questioning his own fighting abilities. After his fight with Captain America, Walker kills a terrorist named Warhead who threatened to detonate a nuclear weapon in Washington, D.C.|$|R
50|$|Flying low {{and slow}} over enemy forces was very {{dangerous}} for the FACs; however the enemy usually held his fire to avoid discovery. However, when the enemy opened fire, <b>it</b> might <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> with anything from rifle bullets to 37mm antiaircraft cannon. A low pass for post-strike bomb damage assessment was another hazardous duty.|$|R
60|$|The Stalo grew red {{and angry}} {{when he heard}} these words, just as Andras meant him to do. He bounded {{into the air and}} fell {{straight}} into the river. Not that that would have mattered, for he was a good swimmer; but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries, and took aim at him. His aim was good, but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet. A second shot, directed at his forehead, fared no better, for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb. Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo's head, and when he sprang up, just an instant too soon, <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> between the ribs.|$|E
6000|$|The dame {{brought out}} the table now, and set it under the tree. It caused a visible stir of {{surprise}}, it being brand new and a sumptuous article of deal. But the surprise rose higher still when the dame, with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore, but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity, slowly unfolded an actual simon-pure tablecloth and spread it. That was a notch above even the blacksmith's domestic grandeurs, and <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> hard; you could see it. But Marco was in Paradise; you could see that, too. Then the dame brought two fine new stools--whew! that was a sensation; it was visible {{in the eyes of}} every guest. Then she brought two more--as calmly as she could. Sensation again--with awed murmurs. Again she brought two --walking on air, she was so proud. The guests were petrified, and the mason muttered: ...|$|E
60|$|Other toasts {{followed}} {{in honor of}} the great institutions and interests of the country, and speeches in response to each were made by individuals whom the Mayor designated or the company called for. None of them impressed me with a very high idea of English postprandial oratory. It is inconceivable, indeed, what ragged and shapeless utterances most Englishmen are satisfied to give vent to, without attempting anything like artistic shape, but clapping on a patch here and another there, and ultimately getting out what they want to say, and generally with a result of sufficiently good sense, but in some such disorganized mass as if they had thrown it up rather than spoken it. It seemed to me that this was almost as much by choice as necessity. An Englishman, ambitious of public favor, should not be too smooth. If an orator is glib, his countrymen distrust him. They dislike smartness. The stronger and heavier his thoughts, the better, provided there be an element of commonplace running through them; and any rough, yet never vulgar force of expression, such as would knock an opponent down, if <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him,</b> only it must not be too personal, is altogether to their taste; but a studied neatness of language, or other such superficial graces, they cannot abide. They do not often permit a man to make himself a fine orator of malice aforethought, that is, unless he be a nobleman (as, for example, Lord Stanley, of the Derby family), who, as an hereditary legislator and necessarily a public speaker, is bound to remedy a poor natural delivery in the best way he can. On the whole, I partly agree with them, and, if I cared for any oratory whatever, should be as likely to applaud theirs as our own. When an English speaker sits down, you feel that you have been listening to a real man, and not to an actor; his sentiments have a wholesome earth-smell in them, though, very likely, this apparent naturalness is as much an art as what we expend in rounding a sentence or elaborating a peroration.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the course}} of the {{conversation}} Hawkeye is looking at the skeleton hanging in Lt. Col. Blake's office and suddenly <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> as to what he wants...barbecued spareribs. He then remembers a place in Chicago near the Dearborn Street train station called [...] "Adam's Ribs" [...] (although Hawkeye doesn't remember the name at this time) and tells Blake that he wants ribs from there. Blake is willing to help to a point, as he knows the Dearborn Street station well (he remarks that it's where he first met his wife and was the first place he was allowed to go to the men's room alone as a child) and gives Hawkeye the phone number for the station. However, they can't call due to the time difference.|$|R
5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> in the backside.|$|R
50|$|As {{the game}} nears the end, Achilles {{has to make}} a {{decision}} whether he is going to win the game or make them lose. He thinks about it and suddenly decides {{that he is going to}} get the score even, and then kick the ball straight up into the commentary box where Wobbly Coates is sitting, and hopefully <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>him</b> and injures him. This decision was going to be his payback for all of the lies that he had told to Les Williams. The grand final game ends in a draw and is rescheduled to next week without the participation of the new team recruit, Achilles. He then decides that he is going to live back on the farm with Lil and spend a lot more time with her.|$|R
