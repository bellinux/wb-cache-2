One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.|$|E

5|$|Two {{recently}} designed national flags {{resemble the}} Japanese flag. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it adopted a national flag {{that had a}} green background, charged with an off-centered red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh.
