5|$|The Bill of Middlesex {{exploited}} the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior {{to the introduction}} of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and <b>detinue,</b> the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and <b>detinue,</b> he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the <b>detinue</b> and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and <b>detinue,</b> a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill of arrest. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} of the King's Bench was thanks to its use of Chancery-like procedure; centrally, the system of bills. Prior to this, a writ {{would have to be}} issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and <b>detinue,</b> the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated time delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was not needed. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and <b>detinue,</b> he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the covenant, <b>detinue</b> and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and <b>detinue,</b> a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; since the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred there, allowing the King's Bench to issue a bill of arrest on its own. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which would normally deal with such civil cases.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's Bench to gain {{jurisdiction}} over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or <b>detinue)</b> would be substituted.|$|E
25|$|Tort law - which governs civil wrongs such as negligence, trespass, defamation, nuisance, conversion, and <b>detinue.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the reign}} of Edward IV of England, the {{question}} arose whether a charter relating to land could be recovered by <b>detinue</b> {{in view of the}} fact that it had no value.|$|E
25|$|In Holdsworth's Case Clayt. 151, pl. 99, 1638, {{an attempt}} {{to bring an action}} in trover for the {{wrongful}} detention of chattels by a bailee failed, because the action sounded in <b>detinue</b> and not trover.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Mitchell v. Georgia & A. R. Co. {{it was noted that}} where action in trover is allowed by statute, and defined by such, it {{necessarily}} includes all three actions of trover, <b>detinue</b> and replevin.|$|E
25|$|Sir William Holdsworth {{described}} trover as {{an extension}} of <b>detinue,</b> which enabled not only a bailor and a dispossessed owner, but also a third person, to whose use goods had been bailed, to get full recognition of their interests.|$|E
25|$|In colonial America, {{replevin}} {{was used}} {{more often than}} <b>detinue.</b> In England the scope of replevin was usually limited to action in distress (where a chattel had been taken by a person who intended to hold it as a bargaining chip to force some action by the true owner).|$|E
25|$|Wager of law was a {{possible}} defense, {{at least in}} certain cases of <b>detinue</b> sur trover. Wager of law was a complicated medieval legal procedure which was used when other forms of proof were lacking. It involved the bringing forth of witnesses who would swear under oath, to God that the facts alleged in the writ or bill of complaint were true. Lacking such witnesses, the action would fail. This was locked into the old methods of proof, which were in turn, tied to the old forms of action. The records show a certain hardening of the courts toward this defense in the mid-fourteenth century. Wager of law was not used in debt on a covenant. Wager of law was abolished by statute in 1833. Prosser describes trover and wager of law in this way: Trover, as it developed, had certain definite procedural advantages over the older forms of action, {{not the least of}} which was that it avoided wager of law, a form of licensed perjury which made <b>detinue</b> singularly unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant.|$|E
25|$|This is a fragmentary {{case from}} Henry VI of England which {{indicates}} that there were sacks of flour left by the plaintiff to be stored and cared for by the defendant. The plaintiff had paid the defendant for this arrangement. The sacks of flour had been carried off by a third party. Counsel for the defence argued that action on the case did not lie, because <b>detinue</b> lay. Judge Prisot opined it was an action on the case. An action similar to trover was allowed.|$|E
25|$|It was {{doubtful}} whether <b>detinue</b> lay where, after bailment, a {{third party}} had destroyed the chattel bailed. This could be encountered when ships were lost at sea, or chattels being moved by wagon were destroyed by acts {{of nature and the}} like. Other cases might involve the finding or bailment of clothing which were destroyed while in the possession of a bailee. The case of a horse bailed to a smith, who bailed it to another smith who damaged, or killed the horse was encountered with some frequency. Action could not lie against the first smith. Contrary opinion is found in a ruling by Stratham.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the seventeenth}} century, the great bulk of {{litigation}} in England was conducted through the various forms of action which had developed from trespass. This remained the case until the nineteenth century, when these kinds of forms of action were abolished in succession by statute. By 1875, all remaining forms had been replaced by a single form uniform writ whereby the plaintiff endorses the statement for a claim. By that time, the change was purely procedural, but it also freed the substantive law from the old medieval forms of action. It permitted the development of broad concepts, such as liability in tort which could never have come about when confined by the old forms of action, such as trover. This served to rationalize the law. Just as forms of assumpsit replaced debt, so in the seventeenth century trover replaced <b>detinue.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in extending action on the case further than a supplementary remedy to <b>detinue</b> lay in the unwillingness of the judges before 1585 to uphold an action on a new writ where a remedy already existed, such as in <b>detinue.</b> In the fifteenth century some overlapping between the forms of debt, <b>detinue,</b> account and trespass had been recognized. [...] Judge Paston said in 1428, {{that it was a}} bad argument that a writ of debt could not lie where trespass did; [...] because for the same thing one may have a writ of account and a writ of debt.|$|E
2500|$|Actions of {{this kind}} were common in the manorial courts, but an obscure note in a Year Book {{suggests}} that in 1294 <b>detinue</b> could be brought against a finder of a chattel. [...] Cases of lost cattle had their own law, and never fit into the forms of trover. <b>Detinue</b> against the finder of a charter seems to have {{found its way into}} the common law by 1389.|$|E
2500|$|Action {{to recover}} {{possession}} which may include trover, <b>detinue</b> and replevin, {{which are now}} statutorily defined and vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{time during}} the fifteenth century, the common law courts seemed to draw a real {{distinction}} between the counts <b>detinue</b> sur trover and <b>detinue</b> sur bailment. A bailment occurs {{when there is an}} agreement for someone to transport or keep a chattel. [...] The normal rule was that [...] "ordinary" [...] care was necessary to protect the chattel while it was in the custody of the bailee. The former was a wrongful detention and a tortious wrong. [...] The latter a wrong based on the agreement between the parties.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} Isaac v Clark , it was laid down that a bailor could not {{maintain}} trover or <b>detinue</b> {{where he had}} pledged the goods, because the wrong [...] was an offense against the possession of the bailee.|$|E
2500|$|In Strafford v. Pell Clayt. 151, pl. 276, 1650, {{a similar}} action in trover as in Holdsworth's Case failed against a carrier of {{chattels}} {{for this was}} a declaration of a trover, and [...] "supposeth a losing of goods, where the carrier hath them by delivery." [...] Neither of these actions had anything to differentiate them from the old action of <b>detinue,</b> because both {{were based on a}} nonfeasance, before the character of conversion had been adequately realized.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the time}} of Bracton, despite the {{generality}} of the writ, the bailor of a chattel could only bring this action against the bailee of the chattel, or those who represent the bailee by testate or intestate succession. [...] Only two actions were available. [...] The plaintiff could claim, [...] "I lost the goods and you found them."; or [...] "I bailed the chattel to you." [...] The first of these was called <b>detinue</b> sur trover.|$|E
2500|$|No action {{could lay}} when a chattel was returned, {{but in a}} damaged condition. In 1478, Catesby said, [...] "And {{in the same manner}} I deliver my robes to you to keep for me and you wear them so that they perish, I shall have an action of <b>detinue</b> for in these cases the {{property}} is not altered, and afterwards an action on the case and recover damages for the loss sustained by your using the clothes." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{distinction}} between trover and conversion. Trover resolved the old procedural problem of wager of law which had developed {{as a form of}} licensed perjury, which made <b>detinue</b> unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant. [...] Wager at law allowed testimony from many witnesses, who might {{have nothing to do with}} the actual litigation. In this sense, it was not much different from champerty and maintenance. Because trover sidestepped these old problems, there was an effort to expand it into many different forms. The legal device to accomplish this at first was to treat the allegation of losing the goods and then finding them as a fiction. This method was seen in several cases in the 17th century. [...] As a technical factor, the defendant was not permitted to deny losing and finding, so the only issues to be litigated were those of the plaintiff's right to possession and the conversion as an existent fact. [...] With losing and finding no longer essential, trover became the standard remedy for any form of interference with a chattel. It entirely replaced <b>detinue,</b> which fell into complete disuse. It replaced trespass to chattels to such an extent that the former was rarely seen. In 1756, Lord Mansfield stated in Cooper v Chitty : ...|$|E
2500|$|Otherwise, {{conversion}} had {{its origin}} in the common law action in trover, as a branch of action on the case. [...] The earliest cases are most likely lost. [...] These probably involved cases when the finder of lost goods did not return them to the rightful owner, but used them himself or disposed of them to someone else. It became necessary to invent a new writ which covered the gap between action in trespass which lay for the wrongful taking of a chattel, and <b>detinue</b> which lay for its wrongful detention.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} remedy in a <b>detinue</b> {{action is}} {{an order that}} the property be returned. [...] The standard remedy in an action for trespass to chattels is a judgment for an amount equal {{to the value of}} loss of use of the property. [...] Damages from a trespass claim are based on the harm caused to the plaintiff, rather than the value of the chattel. Many actions can constitute both conversion and trespass. In these cases, a plaintiff must eventually choose which claim to press based on what damages they seek to recover. It is the difference between forcing a rental fee and a total sale upon a defendant.|$|E
2500|$|The preoccupation of <b>detinue</b> {{with the}} two special cases of stray cattle and lost title-deeds persisted, and the general problem of {{recovering}} chattels which had neither been stolen or bailed was only solved with {{a new form of}} writ. [...] This was invented by adding a novel preamble to be inserted in the writ ostensurus quare. [...] This preamble alleged that the plaintiff casually lost possession of the chattel, that the defendant had found it, refused to restore it and converted it to his own use. [...] The full development of trover and conversion is seen by 1510. A discussion of more modern cases of a bailee (holder) in possession of a title-deed is found in Columbia Law Review.|$|E
2500|$|In 1585, Edward Coke was {{reluctant}} to allow the principle of conversion to be extended so as to enable <b>detinue</b> to be largely superseded by trover on the case. [...] Coke laid down the first principles applicable to conversion. He {{pointed out that the}} finder had acquired the goods which were in no danger of being lost, there was earlier authority for saying that an action for trespass could be sustained and that non-delivery constituted conversions. [...] Consequently, the wrongful refusal to deliver on demand because evidence of a conversion, and this, after some vacillation is now the law. It was a rivalry between the various courts developing legal systems of the country which gave an impetus to the growth of the more modern remedies.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fifteenth}} century the plea of [...] "detinue sur trover" [...] {{gave rise to a}} special form of action of <b>detinue,</b> which came to be {{distinguished}} from the action of trespass on the case and its companion, trespass on the case sur trover. After a time, the latter became known simply as [...] "trover". Littleton called the plea [...] "per inventionem, sur trover, a new found halliday." [...] This remark by Littleton probably only applied to the simpler form of the new pleading, which made it unnecessary to allege by what means the chattel had come {{into the hands of the}} defendant. It was not really the novelty of the action, but the fact that it streamlined the old writs by-passing the details of possession by the bailee or finder of the chattel.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Edward IV of England, there were two cases {{indicating}} {{that there was a}} remedy for damage done by an intermediate bailee (sub-bailee). [...] In 1473, the weight of opinion of the judges allowed an action for damages due to the use of a sub-bailee. [...] In this case the plaintiff had made a bailment to the defendant to keep goods for him. [...] The defendant's bailee had used and damaged them, [...] This action was thought to be similar to trespass, since the bailees had no right {{to the use of the}} chattels, but it was not a trespass since there was no interference with the chattels while they were in the possession of the plaintiff. [...] Nor was there <b>detinue,</b> since there was no lawful detention.|$|E
2500|$|The {{remedy for}} {{conversion}} is {{usually in the}} form of damages equal to the fair market value of the chattel at the time of conversion. The converter can offer to return possession of the chattel to the complainant, but the complainant is not obligated to accept. If the complainant wants the chattel returned without any additional monetary damages, they can claim a related tort, <b>detinue.</b> One may use force in order to recover a chattel only if the wrongdoer is either in the process of taking the chattel or the owner of the chattel is in [...] "hot pursuit" [...] of the chattel. This is because a victim of conversion should use the legal remedies available as opposed to [...] "self-help" [...] or violence. Deadly force may never be used in the recovery of chattels.|$|E
2500|$|For centuries, {{through the}} 19th century, {{the common law}} {{recognized}} only specific forms of action, and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a writ) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, <b>Detinue,</b> Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment. To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific [...] "magic words" [...] encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a pro se ("for oneself," [...] without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting {{at the outset of}} a case over minor wording issues.|$|E
2500|$|In Sykes v Walls , a {{claim of}} {{wrongful}} detention by a bailee was upheld as a good claim {{on the ground that}} a refusal to deliver up constituted a [...] "misfeasance". [...] By this case, trover became virtually concurrent with <b>detinue.</b> [...] When a chattel had been found, and there was a subsequent refusal to deliver it to the owner, it was taken as evidence that a conversion had occurred. Trover was a wrong against the right of possession and not against the possession itself, because possession was prima facie in the wrong-doer. Even when trover was allowed to overlap trespass and replevin, which were concerned with possession, it remained necessary to define conversion, and this extension did not really affect the definition. Conversion became any act {{on the part of the}} defendant inconsistent with the plaintiff's right to possession. [...] This right had parts: [...] it had to be (1) absolute and (2) immediate.|$|E
2500|$|In those days, {{action in}} <b>detinue</b> sur trover could not lie against a third party. If a person bailed his {{chattels}} to another, and that bailee wrongfully gave, sold or bailed the chattels {{to a third}} party, the only action was against the original bailee. Liability to the third bailee was not transferable. In later times, lawyers would talk of trover and bailment. In 1292, {{there was a slight}} tendency to regard the detainer rather than the bailment as the gist of the action, where it was stated [...] "it is not enough to say, 'you did not bail to me' , but one must add, 'and I do not detain it [...] from you.'" [...] But there are other later cases which show that it is impossible or at least extremely difficult for the bailor to fashion any count that will avail him against the third party. The third party was called the [...] "third hand".|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, <b>detinue</b> is a {{possessory action}} having for its object the {{recovery}} of specific personal property and damages for its detention. At common law an action of <b>detinue</b> would lie for {{the recovery of}} specific personal property unlawfully detained, or its value, and for damages for its detention. <b>Detinue</b> differs from replevin in that possession of the chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in <b>detinue,</b> whereas in replevin possession is changed {{at the beginning of}} the proceeding. The gist of an action in <b>detinue</b> is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession of personal property which belongs to the plaintiff [...] whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure of the property. <b>Detinue</b> is distinguished from common-law trover which is for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property. In modern practice, <b>detinue</b> has been superseded almost entirely by statutory actions for the recovery of personal property.|$|E
50|$|<b>Detinue</b> {{allows for}} a remedy of damages {{for the value of}} the chattel, but unlike most other {{interference}} torts, <b>detinue</b> also allows for the recovery of the specific chattel being withheld.|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales, <b>detinue</b> was {{abolished}} from 1 January 1978 by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. However, the tort {{of conversion}} was extended {{at the same}} time to cover circumstances that had previously been covered only by <b>detinue.</b>|$|E
