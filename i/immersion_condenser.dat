50|$|The maximum NA {{is limited}} by the {{refractive}} index of the medium between the lens and the sample. As with objective lenses, a condenser lens with a maximum numerical aperture of greater than 0.95 is designed to be used under oil immersion (or, more rarely, under water immersion), with a layer of immersion oil placed in contact with both the slide/coverslip and the lens of the condenser. An oil <b>immersion</b> <b>condenser</b> may typically have NA of up to 1.25. Without this oil layer, not only is maximum numerical aperture not realized, but the condenser mat not be able to precisely focus light on the object. Condensers with a numerical aperture of 0.95 or less are designed to be used without oil or other fluid on the top lens and are termed dry condensers. Dual dry/immersion condensers are basically oil immersion condensers that can nonetheless focus light with the same degree of precision even without oil between the top lens and the slide.|$|E
30|$|Absorption spectra were {{recorded}} using a Jasco V- 670 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer with a slit width of 2 and 1  nm spectral resolution. Particle size distribution and zeta potential were {{measured by a}} Zetasizer NanoZS 90 instrument (Malvern Instruments). Analysis was performed at a scattering angle of 90 ° and temperature of 25  °C. Dark field images of OCI-AML 3 and THP 1 cells incubated with GNP-MDS-Pl were acquired using an inverted Zeiss Axio Observer Z 1 microscope. To capture the cells, a few microliters of cell suspension were dropped onto an Ibidi μ-Dish and enclosed with a cover slip. A 100 -W halogen lamp was used for illumination which {{was focused on the}} sample using a high numerical <b>immersion</b> <b>condenser</b> (NA[*]=[*] 1.4), and the scattered light was collected by an LD Plan-Neofluar × 20 objective (NA[*]=[*] 0.4, Zeiss).|$|E
