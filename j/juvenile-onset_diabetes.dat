5000|$|Moreover, an {{important}} role for DNAJC3 {{has been attributed to}} diabetes mellitus as well as multi system neurodegeneration. Diabetes mellitus and neurodegeneration are common diseases for which shared genetic factors are still only partly known. It was shown that loss of the BiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein) co-chaperone DNAJC3 leads to diabetes mellitus and widespread neurodegeneration. Accordingly, three siblings were investigated with <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes</b> and central and peripheral neurodegeneration, including ataxia, upper-motor-neuron damage, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss, and cerebral atrophy. Subsequently, exome sequencing identified a homozygous stop mutation in DNAJC3. Further screening of a diabetes database with 226,194 individuals yielded eight phenotypically similar individuals and one family carrying a homozygous DNAJC3 deletion. DNAJC3 was absent in fibroblasts from all affected subjects in both families. To delineate the phenotypic and mutational spectrum and the genetic variability of DNAJC3, 8,603 exomes were further analyzed, including 506 from families affected by diabetes, ataxia, upper-motor-neuron damage, peripheral neuropathy, or hearing loss. This analysis revealed only one further loss-of-function allele in DNAJC3 and no further associations in subjects with only a subset of the features of the main phenotype.

Sixty randomly selected DM 1 patients (14. 5 ± 3. 2 years) and 30 healthy (13. 5 ± 2. 8 years) volunteers were enrolled in the study. Our results indicate that three monocyte subsets are distinguishable in the groups of young diabetic patients and the healthy, similarly to in the blood of adults.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether the phenotypic heterogeneity of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes based on the GADA titer is associated with the PTPN 22 C 1858 T polymorphism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis for the C 1858 T polymorphism using the TaqMan assay was performed in 250 subjects with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, divided into two subgroups with low ( 32 arbitrary units) GADA titers and 450 subjects with classic type 2 diabetes (from the Non Insulin Requiring Autoimmune Diabetes [NIRAD] Study cohort of 5, 330 subjects with adult-onset diabetes) and in 558 subjects with <b>juvenile-onset</b> type 1 <b>diabetes</b> and 545 normoglycemic subjects. RESULTS: Genotype, allele, and phenotype distributions of the PTPN 22 C 1858 T variant revealed similar frequencies in autoimmune diabetes with high GADA titer and <b>juvenile-onset</b> type 1 <b>diabetes.</b> An increase in TT and CT genotypes was observed in individuals with a high GADA titer compared with a low GADA titer, those with type 2 diabetes, and control subjects (P < 0. 002 for all comparisons).

40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Potential for {{curative}} stem-cell {{treatments of}} <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes</b> has focussed research into pancreatic islet development. Islets were previously thought to originate solely from embryonic pancreatic epithelium, {{but we have}} demonstrated that islets can originate from mesenchyme, that is, islet mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the competence of foregut mesenchyme during mesenchymal islet development. METHODS: Embryonic chick pancreatic epithelium of gestational stage Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) 22 (J Morphol. 1951; 88 : 49 - 92) was combined with quail stomach mesenchyme of increasing gestation (stage HH 22 [n = 6], HH 26 [n = 6], HH 28 [n = 4], or HH 31 [n = 6]). Recombinants were cultured and analysed by immunocytochemistry for coexpression of insulin and quail-specific antigen to determine the embryonic origin of islets. RESULTS: Recombinants constructed using stage HH 22 mesenchyme yielded 34 islets, of which 35 % were mesenchymal. However, when recombinants were constructed using stage HH 26 mesenchyme, 24 % of 25 islets were mesenchymal. When using mesenchyme, 13 % of 15 islets were mesenchymal. All islets (n = 35) in recombinants constructed using stage HH 31 mesenchyme were epithelial derived. Islet mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition diminished significantly with increasing mesenchymal gestational stage (P =. 002). CONCLUSIONS: These data show foregut mesenchyme is competent to form islets between stages HH 22 and HH 28. Developmental competence of foregut mesenchyme in islet mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition diminishes as gestation increases. This may have important implications for identifying stem cells to treat <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies to islet-cell {{cytoplasm}} (ICA) and {{glutamic acid}} decarboxylase (GADA) can occur in apparently typical, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2). We investigated whether the presence of either or both antibodies characterises a subtype of diabetes and provides better prediction of requirement for insulin therapy by 6 years' follow-up than clinical variables. METHODS: We measured ICA and GADA at diagnosis of diabetes in a representative population of 3672 white patients with type 2 diabetes, aged between 25 and 65 years. The phenotype was assessed by age of onset, body-mass index, percentage haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), and islet beta-cell function. We investigated the need for insulin therapy among 1538 patients not assigned insulin and followed up for 6 years from diagnosis. FINDINGS: The proportion of patients with ICA and GADA decreased with increasing age at diagnosis (from 33 [21 %] of 157 patients aged 25 - 34 [corrected] to 66 [4 %] of 1769 aged 55 - 65 for ICA; from 53 [34 %] to 122 [7 %] for GADA). Among patients younger than 35 at diagnosis, those with ICA or GADA had lower body-mass index than those without (mean 24. 9 [SD 6. 0] vs 31. 7 [7. 3] kg/m 2; p or = 60 U/L) alone, or both GADA (> or = 20 U/L) and ICA (> 5 U/L), for insulin therapy were 52 % and 68 %. INTERPRETATION: Among young adults with type 2 diabetes, the phenotype of those with ICA or GADA antibodies {{was similar to that}} of classic <b>juvenile-onset</b> insulin-dependent <b>diabetes,</b> and either phenotype or antibodies predicted insulin requirement. In older adults, the phenotype was closer to that of patients without antibodies and only the presence of antibodies predicted an increased likelihood of insulin requirement...|$|R

Although the precise underlying mechanisms for enterovirus-mediated development of diabetes remain unknown, the systematic review andmeta-analysis of observational molecular studies demonstrates a clinically significant associ-ation between enteroviral infections de-tected by molecular methods and type 1 diabetes (2). Herewe report a case of <b>juvenile-onset</b> insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> resulting from various enteroviral infections. A 20 -year-old man was referred and admitted to our hospital because of a penile inflammation, suffering from general fa-tigue, and body weight loss for 2 weeks in March 2011. He had a high fever (38 – 39 °C) at 2 weeks before the admission. His plasma glucose (430 mg/dL) and HbA 1 c (10. 3 %) levels were significantly elevated. Serum ketone bodies were elevated (615 mmol/L; normal,, 130 mmol/L); however, blood pHwas normal. The intensive insulin therapy promptly ameliorated his blood glucose, and his blood glucose levels were 100 – 120 mg/dL by using 20 and 15 units of insulin glulisine before break-fast and dinner, respectively, and 11 units of insulin glargine at bedtime. His urinary C-peptide level was significantly reduced (19. 4 mg/day; normal, 29. 2 – 167 mg/day). b-Cell autoantibodies, anti-GAD, and anti-IA 2 autoantibodies were not detected.

Herein, we report the generation and characterization of iPSCs from fibroblasts of patients with sporadic or familial diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), <b>juvenile-onset,</b> type I <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (JDM), and Duchenne type muscular dystrophy (DMD), {{as well as from}} normal human fibroblasts (WT). As an example to modeling disease using disease-specific iPSCs, we also discuss the previously established childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD) - and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) -iPSCs by our group. Through DNA fingerprinting analysis, the origins of generated disease-specific iPSC lines were identified. Each iPSC line exhibited an intense alkaline phosphatase activity, expression of pluripotent markers, and the potential to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers: the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. Expression of endogenous pluripotent markers and downregulation of retrovirus-delivered transgenes [OCT 4 (POU 5 F 1), SOX 2, KLF 4, and c-MYC] were observed in the generated iPSCs. Collectively, our results demonstrated that disease-specific iPSC lines characteristically resembled hESC lines. Furthermore, we were able to differentiate PD-iPSCs, one of the disease-specific-iPSC lines we generated, into dopaminergic (DA) neurons, the cell type mostly affected by PD. These PD-specific DA neurons along with other examples of cell models derived from disease-specific iPSCs would provide a powerful platform for examining the pathophysiology of relevant diseases at the cellular and molecular levels and for developing new drugs and therapeutic regimens...|$|R
40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: <b>Juvenile-onset,</b> insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> is {{associated}} with islet cell antibodies and with specific "high-risk" HLA-DRB 1 and HLA-DQB 1 genotypes. Patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus can have islet-related antibodies, but the genotypic associations at different ages of onset have not been evaluated. Our aim was to determine (i) the prevalence of DRB 1 and DQB 1 genotypes in patients at diagnosis of Type II diabetes at different ages from 25 to 65 years compared with the general population, and (ii) whether the presence of islet cell antibodies (ICA) or glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) or both by age {{is associated}} with different DRB 1 and DQB 1 genotypes. METHODS: The antibodies to islet cells and those to glutamic acid decarboxylase were measured in 1712 white Caucasian diabetic subjects at diagnosis of diabetes and they were genotyped for HLA DRB 1 * 03 and DRB 1 * 04 and the high-risk DRB 1 * 04 -DQB 1 * 0302 haplotype. To assess over-representation of high-risk alleles for Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of high-risk alleles in diabetic patients was expressed relative to the prevalence of low-risk alleles, non-DR 3 /non-DR 4, that provided a reference denominator in both the diabetic patients and in 200 non-diabetic control subjects. The prevalence of ICA or GADA or both in patients with different HLA genotypes was assessed in those diagnosed in four age groups, 25 - 34 years, 35 - 44 years, 45 - 54 years and 55 - 65 years. RESULTS: In Type II diabetic patients presenting at ages 25 - 34, 35 - 44 and 45 - 54 years, there was an increased prevalence of DR 3 /DR 4 compared with the general population with approximately 6. 5 -fold, 2. 9 -fold, 2. 1 -fold over-representation, respectively (p < 0. 0001, < 0. 01, < 0. 05) {{but this was not}} found in those aged 55 - 65 years old. In the group aged 25 - 34 years, 32 % of patients with ICA or GADA or both had DRB 1 * 03 /DRB 1 * 04 -DQB 1 * 0302 compared with 10 % in those aged 55 - 65 years and expected 3 % prevalence. Conversely, only 14 % of those aged 25 - 34 years with antibodies had non-DR 3 /non-DR 4, compared with 35 % in those aged 55 - 65 years. There was thus pronounced age heterogeneity in DRB 1 and DQB 1 predisposition to Type II diabetes. The antibodies displaced DRB 1 or DQB 1 genotypes in the multivariate model for requiring insulin therapy by 6 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION/HYPOTHESIS: The age of presentation of Type I diabetes in adulthood was in part dependent on the DRB 1 /DQB 1 genotype. Islet cell antibodies and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were strongly associated with DRB 1 * 03 /DRB 1 * 04 -DQB 1 * 0302 in early adulthood but showed little relation with specific HLA genotypes after the age of 55 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{progression}} of {{type 1 diabetes}} after diagnosis is poorly understood. Our aim {{was to assess the}} relation of disease {{progression of}} <b>juvenile-onset</b> type 1 <b>diabetes,</b> determined by preserved beta cell function the first year after diagnosis, with systemic cytokine concentrations and number of autoantibodies. Juvenile patients (n = 227) had a meal-stimulated C-peptide test 1 and 6 months after diagnosis. On the basis of the C-peptide course for the duration of 1 – 6 months, four progression groups were defined: patients with persistently low beta cell function (‘stable-low’), rapid progressers, slow progressers and remitters. Serum concentrations of adiponectin, interleukin (IL) - 1 ra, inducible protein 10 (IP- 10), IL- 6 and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), IA- 2 A and islet-cell antibodies (ICA) were measured at 1, 6 and 12 months. We found that adiponectin concentrations at 1 month predicted disease progression at 6 months (P = 0 · 04). Patients with low adiponectin had a higher probability of becoming remitters than rapid progressers, odds ratio 3 · 1 (1 · 3 – 7 · 6). At 6 and 12 months, adiponectin differed significantly between the groups, with highest concentrations among stable-low and rapid progressers patients (P = 0 · 03 and P = 0 · 006). IL- 1 ra, IP- 10 and IL- 6 did not differ between the groups at any time-point. The number of autoantibodies differed significantly between the groups at 1 month (P = 0 · 04), where rapid progressers had the largest number. There was no difference between the groups in human leucocyte antigen-associated risk. We define progression patterns distinguishing patients diagnosed with low beta cell function from those with rapid decline, slow decline or actual increase in beta cell function, pointing to different mechanisms of disease progression. We find that adiponectin concentration at 1 month predicts, and at 6 and 12 months associates with, distinct progression patterns...|$|R
40|$|Despite intense {{scrutiny}} the precise etiology of diabetes mellitus remains unclear. There {{appear to be}} two major forms of diabetes: juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes, and late-onset or insulin-independent diabetes; the late-onset form, in itself, may be etiologically heterogeneous. Either form may occur at any age, with {{a clear distinction between}} the two often being difficult to make. <b>Juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes,</b> representing 5 % to 10 % of all cases, is characterized by abrupt onset, clinical manifestation of hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis, and generally by a requirement for exogenous insulin; in maturity-onset diabetes plasma levels of insulin are usually normal or elevated and the abnormality in glucose metabolism results from a {{decrease in the number of}} insulin receptors rather than a deficiency of the hormone itself...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2016. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Wolfram syndrome {{is a rare}} genetic disorder char-acterized by <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, hearing loss, and neurodegen-eration. Although there are currently no effective treatments that can delay or reverse the progression of Wolfram syn-drome, the use of careful clinical monitoring and supportive care can help relieve the suffering of patients and improve their quality of life. The prognosis of this syndrome is current-ly poor, and many patients die prematurely with severe neu-rological disabilities, raising the urgency for developing novel treatments for Wolfram syndrome. In this article, we describe natural history and etiology, provide recommendations for diagnosis and clinical management, and introduce new treat-ments for Wolfram syndrome...|$|E
30|$|The {{cellular}} {{features of}} psoriasis are epidermal hyperplasia and altered keratinocyte differentiation, but substantial evidence implicates both innate and acquired immunity in the disease pathogenesis (Gaspari [2006]). The disease state is triggered by an activated cellular immune system, marked infiltration of T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and inflammatory cytokines in psoriatic skin lesions (Bowcock and Krueger [2005]). As in other immune-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes,</b> psoriasis {{is regarded as}} a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease (Lowes et al. [2007]). Therefore, it fits the definition of an autoimmune disease (Davidson and Diamond [2001]). Recent progress in the understanding of both the immunological and genetic basis of the disease has provided a deep insight into the pathogenesis. In this review, we detail the recent advances in the understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis, including the information regarding immunological factors, genetic aspects, and susceptibility genes shared with other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.|$|E
40|$|Wolfram syndrome, seen in 1 / 770000 of the {{population}} is an autosomal recessive dysmorphogenetical disease with unknown pathogenesis. It is characterized with the association of diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness, and also known as DIDMOAD (Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness). Patients demonstrate diabetes mellitus followed by optic atrophy in the first decade,diabetes insipidus and sensorineural deafness in the second decade, dilated renal outflow tracts early in the third decade, and multiple neurological abnormalities early in the fourth decade. We present a boy 14 years old who had been followed-up with the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome in this article. He had been followed-up with <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus for 9 years. Physical and laboratory exam revealed neurogenic bladder, deafness and optic defect. We emphasize the importance of family screening regarding the early diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome in the other individuals of the family since the disease shows an autosomal recessive inheritance...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{diarrhea}} and steatorrhea occur predominantly in young adult males who have <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus complicated by neuropathy. The presentation is often severe, with nocturnal or postprandial watery {{diarrhea and}} tenesmus. Massive malabsorption of fat may occur; however, malabsorption of other nutrients and generalized wasting are quite rare. Because {{the symptoms are}} relatively refractory to treatment, {{it is important to}} rule out other, more easily treatable causes of this presentation. Bacterial overgrowth, exocrine pancreatic in-sufficiency, and celiac disease are also associated with diabetes mellitus and can mimic this pro-cess. Although the mechanism of diabetic diarrhea and steatorrhea remains unclear, neuropathy, gastrointestinal motor abnormalities, bacterial overgrowth, and bile acid abnor-malities have been implicated in the pathogenesis. Diabetic diarrhea and steatorrhea, although rare manifestations of diabetes mellitus, attain clinical importance because of their severity and refractory nature. Despite extensive investigation, the pathogenesis of this disorder remains unclear. In 1926, in their discussion of gastric secretion in the diabetic, Bowen and Aaron [1] described ten patients with severe diarrhea. It was not until 1936, however, tha...|$|E
40|$|This review compares two novel {{polygenic}} mouse {{models of}} {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D), TALLYHO/JngJ and NONcNZO 10 /LtJ, and contrasts both with the well-known C 57 BLKS/J-Leprdb (db/db) monogenic diabesity model. We posit that the new polygenic models are more representative of the “garden variety” obesity underlying human T 2 D {{in terms of their}} polygenetic rather than monogenic etiology. Moreover, the clinical phenotypes in these new models are less extreme, for example, more moderated development of obesity coupled with less extreme endocrine disturbances. The more progressive development of obesity produces a maturity-onset development of hyperglycemia in contrast to the <b>juvenile-onset</b> <b>diabetes</b> observed in the morbidly obese db/db model. Unlike the leptin receptor-deficient db/db models with central leptin resistance, the new models develop a progressive peripheral leptin resistance and are able to maintain reproductive function. Although the T 2 D pathophysiology in both TALLYHO/JngJ and NONcNZO 10 /LtJ is remarkably similar, their genetic etiologies are clearly different, underscoring the genetic heterogeneity underlying T 2 D in humans...|$|E
