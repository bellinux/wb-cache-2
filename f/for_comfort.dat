5|$|It is {{revealed}} in the third episode that Suzanne Warren (played by Uzo Aduba) is also involved in the fight {{at the end of}} season one. She punches Chapman in the face twice and knocks her unconscious (Doggett is already unconscious at this stage). This gives the impression that Doggett and Chapman were evenly matched and therefore equally responsible. Following Doggett's return to full health, she finds that her previous best friends, Leanne Taylor (played by Emma Myles) and Angie Rice (played by Julie Lake), no longer want to be associated with her. This leaves Doggett seeking prison counsellor Sam Healy (played by Michael J. Harney) <b>for</b> <b>comfort.</b>|$|E

At college, she sees the massive presidential {{campaign}} staged by Cook and JJ (Ollie Barbieri).

She flees to Kieran <b>for</b> <b>comfort</b> but leaves him, shocked and disgusted, when he kisses her. She goes home and, after finding a note from Emily in her bed, cries herself to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of the}} series' run, Blair grapples with {{a number}} of changes within her family. Two years prior to the opening novel, Blair's parents {{divorced}} after her father ran off with another man. When her mother remarries, and her father leaves the country, Blair has difficulty accepting her stepfather, Cyrus Rose. In addition, her stress over these matters occasionally affects her other relationships. However, Blair ultimately remains close to her father Harold, who she often turns to <b>for</b> <b>comfort.</b> By contrast, she maintains a somewhat tenser relationship with her mother Eleanor. It is also revealed that Blair has struggled with bulimia.|$|E
5|$|For a period, the {{situation}} continued to worsen. Ranulf of Chester revolted {{once again in}} the summer of 1144, splitting up Stephen's Honour of Lancaster between himself and Prince Henry. In the west, Robert of Gloucester and his followers continued to raid the surrounding royalist territories, and Wallingford Castle remained a secure Angevin stronghold, too close to London <b>for</b> <b>comfort.</b> Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou finished securing his hold on southern Normandy and in January 1144 he advanced into Rouen, the capital of the duchy, concluding his campaign. Louis VII recognised him as Duke of Normandy shortly after. By this point in the war, Stephen was depending increasingly on his immediate royal household, such as William of Ypres and others, and lacked the support of the major barons who {{might have been able to}} provide him with significant additional forces; after the events of 1141, Stephen made little use of his network of earls.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the late}} Medieval castles built in the borders were {{in the form of}} tower houses, smaller pele towers or simpler bastle houses. From the fifteenth century there was a phase of Renaissance palace building, which {{restructured}} them as castle-type palaces, beginning at Linlithgow. Elements of Medieval castles, royal palaces and tower houses were used in the construction of Scots baronial estate houses, which were built largely <b>for</b> <b>comfort,</b> but with a castle-like appearance. In {{the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries}} the military significance of castles declined, but they increasingly became tourist attractions. Elements of the Scots Baronial style would be revived from the late eighteenth century and the trend would be confirmed in popularity by the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle in the nineteenth century and its adoption as a retreat by Queen Victoria. In the twentieth century there were only isolated examples of new castle-influenced houses. Many tower houses were renovated, and many castles were taken over by the National Trust for Scotland or Historic Scotland and are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in a B story, Munch (Richard Belzer) {{repeatedly}} and loudly declares {{his love for}} his girlfriend Felicia, much to the annoyance of his lonely partner Bolander (Ned Beatty). The two confiscate a live tropical fish from the murder scene of a dead drug dealer. Upon learning it will not used as evidence, Munch decides to give it {{as a gift to}} Felicia, who loves fish. However, she breaks up with Munch after the fish, a Jack Dempsey, ends up eating all her other fish. The now lonely Munch turns to Bolander <b>for</b> <b>comfort,</b> but finds the tables have turned and that Bolander has met a local waitress named Linda (Julianna Margulies). The two get along very well and bond over their mutual love of music. The episode ends with Linda and Bolander getting together to play music: Linda plays the violin, while Bolander plays the cello.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} a castle was not simply militaristic, but was also {{considered}} to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor. The earliest castles in Greater Manchester are Dunham and Watch Hill in Trafford, Ullerwood in Manchester, and Stockport Castle in Stockport. They were first recorded in 1173 as belonging to barons who had rebelled against Henry II, and at least three were motte-and-bailey castles, probably because of the speed and ease with which they could be erected. Hamon de Massey, who owned the Trafford castles and Ullerwood, and Geoffrey de Constentyn, who owned Stockport Castle, were two of the three rebels from Cheshire; the other was the Earl of Chester, the owner of Chester Castle. Castles continued to be built in the area, although the last to be built in Greater Manchester were two fortified manor houses near Bury, built more <b>for</b> <b>comfort</b> than as utilitarian military structures. Bury Castle and Radcliffe Tower followed the national trend in the 13th century; they would most likely have acted as the centre of the manor they served.|$|E

5|$|When Cunard died in 1865, {{the equally}} {{conservative}} Charles MacIver assumed Cunard's role. The firm retained its reluctance about change and was overtaken by competitors that more quickly adopted new technology. In 1866 Inman started to build screw propelled express liners that matched Cunard's premier unit, the Scotia. Cunard responded with its first high speed screw propellered steamer, Russia which {{was followed by}} two larger editions. In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned the Oceanic and her five sisters. The new White Star record-breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines. White Star also set new standards <b>for</b> <b>comfort</b> by placing the dining saloon midships and doubling the size of cabins. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals. Throughout the 1870s Cunard passage times were longer than either White Star or Inman.|$|E
5|$|Zoe {{goes on a}} {{parachute}} jump with Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best), Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), Gilly and Sarah. Sarah's ex-girlfriend Lydia appears and is jealous of Sarah and Zoe's friendship. Lydia lies to Zoe, telling her that Sarah had attempted suicide after their affair the previous year, and warns her {{to stay away from}} Sarah. That night, Sarah and Zoe get drunk and return to their tent, where Sarah makes a pass at Zoe. Sarah reveals that whilst she had not intended to kiss her, Zoe was the only person she had ever been able to rely upon. Zoe and Sarah later discover Lydia's lies and Sarah decides to end their relationship for good during a discussion with Zoe. Lydia overhears the conversation and sabotages Zoe's parachute before the jump in an attempt to kill her. When the parachutes are mixed up by accident, Zoe's deploys successfully, but Sarah falls to her death. Upset, Zoe ends up sleeping with a grieving Mike <b>for</b> <b>comfort.</b> Lydia slits her wrists after planting the knife she had sabotaged the parachute with behind Zoe's bed. Zoe is then arrested in front of Mike under suspicion of Sarah's murder and is later charged.|$|E
5|$|Debra {{turns up}} unexpectedly, {{claiming}} she is homeless, but reveals she {{is planning to}} move to Greece when she has enough money and says Whitney can come with her. Whitney accepts, but later realises that Debra is using her and she is only there to hide from someone. Debra later tells Whitney she has a half-brother, Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott). Whitney then takes back her statement against Tony but after Whitney's barrister sees her mobile phone containing the messages from Tony, he is sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment. During the trial Whitney learns that Tiffany is Ricky's daughter. She is initially distressed, but accepts that Tiffany is still her sister although they are not related. She repairs her friendship with Todd, and they kiss at Ricky and Bianca's engagement party. Their reunion is short-lived, and Whitney breaks up with him in favour of Bianca's half-brother Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson). Whitney is attacked by Billie's jealous friend Kylie (Elarica Gallacher), and when his friends cause trouble at a grime night at The Queen Victoria pub (The Vic), Whitney asks him to choose between her and his former gang. Billie chooses Whitney, and Kylie takes revenge by attempting to shoot him, shooting his uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) instead. Jack is hospitalised with major injuries, and Whitney struggles to help Billie deal with his guilt and subsequent anger and rejection from the Branning and Jackson families. She is further deeply upset when Billie decides to join the army {{in an attempt to}} make Jack proud. At Billie's birthday party, Whitney ends up kissing Peter. She spends the night with him and the next day is upset to learn that Billie has died in his sleep. She blames herself for leaving the party after she sees a text message from Billie saying he still loved her. She sends a reply and lays flowers and candles for him. However, she later goes back to Peter <b>for</b> <b>comfort,</b> and he comforts her again {{on the day of the}} funeral. The pair then begin a relationship. However Billie's friend Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene), starts flirting with her, and asks her why she'd date someone like Peter after dating Billie. He also asks her to sell some stolen jewellery for him and she agrees.|$|E
