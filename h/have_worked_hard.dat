The towpath is used by walkers, cyclists and naturalists, with some parts used for angling and horse riding.

I <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E
25|$|During the 2010 census 'The Cat Women of Gir Forest' counted {{more than}} 411 lions in the park, and 523 in 2015. The {{women who do}} the {{counting}} are of traditional Muslim tribes in neighboring villages. There are over 40 women van raksha sahayaks, who seek only to protect the animals of the park. These women <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> to win cooperation not just from local villagers but also from maaldharis, the semi-nomadic tribal herdsmen {{who live in the}} sanctuary. While tourist numbers are increasing people do not seem to understand the phenomena taking place. The lions are almost tame in the presence of these female guards.|$|E
25|$|Symbolic racism {{represents}} {{a form of}} resistance {{to change in the}} racial status quo based on moral feelings that blacks violate such traditional American values as individualism and self-reliance, the work ethic, obedience, and discipline. Whites may feel that people should be rewarded on their merits, which in turn should be based on hard work and diligent service. Hence symbolic racism should find its most vociferous expression on political issues that involve 'unfair' government assistance to blacks: welfare ('welfare cheats could find work if they tried'); 'reverse discrimination' and racial quotas ('blacks should not be given a status they have not earned'); 'forced' busing ('whites <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> for their neighborhoods, and for their neighborhood schools'); or 'free' abortions for the poor ('if blacks behaved morally, they would not need abortions').|$|E

500|$|Morrissey's {{next major}} leading role was as Member of Parliament (MP) Stephen Collins in Paul Abbott's BBC serial State of Play (2003). Morrissey {{received}} the scripts {{for the first}} three episodes and was keen to read the last three. They had not been completed when he originally requested them but Abbott told him how Collins' story concludes. Unsure how to approach the role, Morrissey was advised by his friend, director Paul Greengrass, to get Collins' job as politician right. Morrissey contacted State of Play producer Hilary Bevan Jones, who set up meetings between Morrissey and select committee members Kevin Barron and Fabian Hamilton. Both politicians educated Morrissey on {{how difficult it is to}} commute to London from a constituency outside the capital. Morrissey was also able to shadow Peter Mandelson around the House of Commons for a fortnight. He questioned Mandelson about his job as a cabinet minister but did not ask about his personal life. Mandelson told him about how politics can quickly [...] "seduce" [...] MPs who <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> to get into Parliament.|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E

Negotiations eventually led to the provision of two culverts, one paid for by the Trust and the other by the road builders, which will be used in due course for the route of the re-aligned canal. In 2006, the engineers Arup produced a feasibility study for a replacement route for the destroyed section which would link to Grove Basin on the Cannock Extension Canal. Environmental concerns led to a second feasibility study being produced by Atkins in 2009, for a route which connected to the derelict Lord Hayes Branch on the Wyrley and Essington Canal. A short section near the junction with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal is navigable, and the cost of restoring the rest and building the new route to the Wyrley and Essington was estimated at £44.1million in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Under Gutiérrez Rodríguez, Unomásuno {{tried to}} {{discredit}} La Jornada, which criticized the PRI government {{and supported the}} movements of the Mexican left. La Jornada supported Cárdenas' political campaigns, the rebellion of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) in the early 1990s, and stood against other ideas promoted by the PRI government that they believed were regressing Mexico, like neoliberalism. Unomásunos efforts to sway public opinion were largely unsuccessful, however, as Mexican public opinion continued to favor independent media outlets like La Jornada. Gutiérrez Rodríguez promised his employees, however, that Unomásunos political stance and editorial tone would not change. Several reporters analyzed the publications done by the newspaper and tried to show Gutiérrez Rodríguez that their critical attitudes towards the Salinas de Gotari administration had changed. They showed him that in one of their recent publications, Unomásuno stated that in the first 100 days of the Salinas de Gortari administration, Mexico had a strong government and clear sense of direction. In addition, Unomásunos attitude towards its staff changed with the new ownership. On March 1989, Gutiérrez Rodríguez warned its employees that Unomásuno was [...] "now a business" [...] and not a [...] "club of friends". He also said he would look into the creation of a syndicate with the board of trustees, but told those interested in the syndicate that they should analyzed whether or not they <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> enough to earn their paychecks before asking for money.|$|E
