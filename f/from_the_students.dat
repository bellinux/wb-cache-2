They were given blueprints of all the four targets– The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Oberoi Trident, Nariman House and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.|$|E

To help illustrate the scientific topics, NASA supplied Haarsma with space related information to present.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed well away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> and partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E

The university's council of Regents decided to include UST's name in the new seal and drop the titles of Royal and Pontifical {{because they are not}} part of the official name of university. The seal was revised a month after and is currently being used today.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} several {{business}} schools which still {{rely on the}} lecture method to give students a basic business education. Lectures are generally given from the professor's point of view, and rarely require interaction <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> unless notetaking is required.

25|$|During {{their senior}} year, while still {{completing}} upper-division Cluster Courses, students are also {{required to complete}} a six-credit senior capstone project in order to graduate.

Capstone courses often conclude with a public presentation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> on their experiences with the community organization or cause which they explored.|$|E

Students who opposed the show's content often accepted its arrival on campus due to their support for freedom of speech.

The video was published on YouTube and news websites, attracting worldwide interest. Landowner Larisa Gerasimova reportedly charged visitors the equivalent of $2 each to view the crater.|$|E

Moreover, since the education bill is not under the category of bills that will go directly to the Union of Parliament, it has to go through the Lower House and the Upper House before it could be passed.|$|E

25|$|The {{years of}} {{dictatorship}} were gruesome. Apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> that got 7 {{years in prison}} for toasting to freedom which led directly to the foundation of Amnesty International in 1961, in 1968 students would spend the whole night greasing streets and sidewalks with soap so the mounted police {{would have a hard time}} chasing them down to break a demonstration. It is said that a student dared a policeman to get his shoes and feet wet chasing after a cigarette lighter, thrown in the duck pond, while he had the license for it in his pocket. In those days one needed a permit to own a cigarette lighter, as imposed by Salazar to protect the matches industry.|$|E
25|$|Warwickshire {{survived a}} scare as a virtual second XI still beat the Cambridge {{students}} by 18 runs. The {{first day at}} Fenner's was ruined by rain, with only 6 overs possible. Warwickshire batted first, losing three wickets for no runs to collapse to 48 for 4, but Jonathan Trott's three-hour 150 not out lifted the visitors to 296 for 6 declared. In reply, Zohail Sharif made an unbeaten fifty as the students {{made their way to}} 109 for 1 in just 24 overs. An overnight declaration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> was followed by an equalling blazing accumulation of runs from Warwickshire led them to 127 for 1. In the reply, Cambridge came too close for comfort, though, and at 281 for 6 with 34 runs left to hit it looked like they could do it - but opening batsman and off spinner Alex Loudon came to the rescue with three wickets for 48, as Cambridge collapsed to 296 all out and lost the match by 18 runs.|$|E
25|$|The first {{quadripartite meeting}} {{ended with the}} {{students}} reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators.

The first three preconditions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions. Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.|$|E
