5|$|Around 1760, <b>Jones</b> hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy clerk. Dew apprenticed under <b>Jones</b> for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk. Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, {{it is likely that}} <b>Jones</b> was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, <b>Jones</b> relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which <b>Jones</b> traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} of partially polarized radiation in an anisotropically scattering, inhomogeneous atmosphere containing an arbitrary polydispersion of particles is described using <b>Jones's</b> (1941) amplitude vectors and matrices. This approach exploits the close analogy between the quantum-mechanical states of spin 1 / 2 {{systems and the}} polarization states of electromagnetic radiation described by <b>Jones's</b> vector. The complete equivalence between the transport equation for <b>Jones's</b> vectors and the classical radiative-transfer equation for Stokes's intensity vectors is demonstrated in two independent ways after deriving the transport equations for the polarization coherency matrices and for the quaternions corresponding to the <b>Jones's</b> vectors. A compact-operator formulation of the theory is provided and used to derive the necessary equations for both a local and a global description of the transport of <b>Jones's</b> vectors. The integro-differential equations for the amplitude reflection and transmission matrices are derived and related to the usual corresponding equations...|$|R

5|$|After a short while, <b>Jones</b> {{was given}} command {{of his own}} {{surveying}} team. His first assignment was the surveying of Stamford Township, a task they began on November 5, 1787 and completed on January 8, 1788.

5|$|After the break-up, Strummer {{contacted}} <b>Jones</b> in {{an effort}} to reform the Clash. <b>Jones,</b> however, had already formed a new band, Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), that had released its debut late in 1985. The two did work together on their respective 1986 projects. <b>Jones</b> helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the Sid and Nancy soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second B.A.D. album, No.10, Upping St., which he also co-produced. With <b>Jones</b> committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called Havana 3am. Headon recorded a solo album, before once again spiraling into drug abuse. Chimes drummed with a succession of different acts.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Jones</b> took {{no part in}} {{the raising}} of his {{children}} by Tuhbenahneequay, he did take an active interest in their welfare. In 1805, he secured a pair of two-square-mile plots of land {{near the mouth of}} the Credit River for his two sons from the local Mississauga Indians, but the government of Upper Canada would not recognise the title. In 1816, <b>Jones</b> feared that the Mississauga band his sons John and Peter lived with would fall apart, {{in the aftermath of the}} War of 1812, the famine of 1816's harvest and the influx of settlers to the area in recent years. <b>Jones</b> travelled to find the boys, and brought them to his farm in Stoney Creek. He arranged for the boys to be schooled in Stoney Creek, as neither spoke much English. After nine months, <b>Jones</b> felt that Peter's command of English was sufficient, and took him out of school to teach him the farming craft. The next year, <b>Jones</b> and his family relocated to land along the Grand River, and <b>Jones</b> brought his son Peter with them. Peter lived with his father for seven years there.|$|E

In its preseason top 100 player ranking, <b>Jones</b> was listed at number 45 by ESPN. <b>Jones</b> was named to the 36-man Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List. He was also listed as a John R.
