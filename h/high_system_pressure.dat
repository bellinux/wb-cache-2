30|$|The {{situation}} of waves with large force {{at low speed}} can be well suited by the hydraulic PTOs since they can provide much larger force density than the electric PTOs, especially at <b>high</b> <b>system</b> <b>pressure</b> [2]. Thus, hydraulic PTOs should be more compact in size and weight, economically competitive, and relatively easy to install and maintain [2, 14]. Furthermore, since the wave energy is highly fluctuating, from both the wave-to-wave and wave states time scales, the required peak power capacity of the PTOs greatly exceeds the time-averaged power delivered to the grid. Energy storage system is thus generally required to smoothen the final electrical power output to avoid the impairment of power quality from the grid point of view [3, 14]. In {{order to reduce the}} power ratings of the key components of the PTO for achieving a compact and energy efficient design, the energy storage device is expected to be located directly after the wave energy absorbers. The gas accumulator, which stores the hydraulic energy and fluid by compressing the gas, is currently the most common choice [2, 3, 14].|$|E

First step is to perform linear stability analysis of the system with the state space approach. The analysis is used to obtain stability maps in N-pch, and N-sub plane.

This analysis leads to delineation of bifurcation characteristics of the system namely subcritical and supercritical bifurcations. The existence of limit cycles and their behavior are also presented. The effects of different design parameters on the aforementioned bifurcation phenomena are shown. It is observed that, these bifurcation phenomena are quite sensitive to the design parameters. The reduced order model used in the present work has been developed by keeping a new insight to include the density variation in single phase and the drift flux correlations in the two-phase.

40|$|The present model emphasises on the {{development}} of an analytical model to describe density wave oscillation in a heated channel. The study includes linear stability analysis of density wave instability in vertical flow channels for <b>high</b> <b>system</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. Unlike the previous models where the coolant density in single phase region was assumed to be constant (equal to saturated liquid density at given system pressure), the present work considers the density variation in the subcooled region. Drift flux model has been used to characterise the two-phase flow. The stability characteristics of the system have been depicted by stability boundaries plotted in parameter planes namely phase-change number (N-pch) and subcooling number (N-sub). The experimental data sets from Saha et al. (1974) [11] have been re-evaluated and are shown with corresponding operating conditions. Compared to the existing models where the equations run into several pages (Karve, 1998 [8]; Dokhane, 2004 [9]), it is seen that in the presence of linear-linear approximations for single phase enthalpy and two-phase quality that lead to simpler equations, the results obtained show good agreement with experimental data sets. In addition to higher subcooling numbers, the present model also best predicts the stability boundary for lower subcooling numbers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The roller {{swashplate}} {{bearing in}} hydraulic piston pumps is very unique in applications of roller element bearings. The main advantages {{of this type}} of bearings are low friction, very small difference between start torque and steady state torque, and no additional pressure source is required for their functioning. Therefore, better control performance and higher efficiency can be expected from piston pumps with roller swashplate bearings, compared with pumps with hydrostatic or plain ones. However, it is particularly challenging to design a roller swashplate bearing to meet the very demanding and widely varying load requirements for heavy duty off-highway machine operations, considering cost and pump size limitations. Quite different from most other roller bearing applications, a roller swashplate bearing for heavy duty hydraulic piston pumps is subject to (a) extremely high contact pressure between rollers and races due to <b>high</b> <b>system</b> <b>pressure,</b> (b) high frequency oscillating forces in three dimensions caused by the torque ripple and discharge pressure ripple inherent in pump rotating group, (c) very unfavorable local lubrication conditions when the pump is operated with no or little displacement change, and (d) sliding between rollers and races because of frequent sudden pump displacement changes. Based on the observed failure modes of bearings in this application, this paper discusses several measures to improve the fatigue life of the swashplate roller bearing for an axial swashplate type piston pump used in a heavy duty off-highway machine.

40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{this research}} is to produce hydrogen from biosustainable polyols, compounds containing a hydrocarbon chain with neighboring hydroxyl groups, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Hydrogen is an energy carrier which can replace oil and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when it is generated from renewable sources. At present, hydrogen is derived from fossil fuels such as natural gas, naphtha or coal. We show that hydrogen can be produced by reforming of glycerol, sorbitol, glucose or sucrose in water at a low temperature over supported metal catalysts. A thermodynamic analysis that forms the basis of the process compares aqueous phase reforming of polyols with steam reforming of alkanes. Catalyst screening involving different noble metals and different supports indicates that alumina supported platinum catalysts are effective for hydrogen production by aqueous phase reforming of polyols. In an attempt to achieve high hydrogen yields, the effects of operating temperature, pressure, and nature of the feed are studied. Higher operation temperatures favor higher hydrogen yields while hydrogen production is strongly inhibited by <b>high</b> <b>system</b> <b>pressure.</b> Short chain polyols have better hydrogen selectivities than long chain polyols. An effort is made to show that valuable chemicals can be derived from polyols. Glycerol and other polyols are potential sources of value-added chemicals, such as 1, 2 -propanediol, a major commodity chemical now obtained from petroleum derived propylene. It can be generated by an alternative renewable route through hydrogenolysis of biodiesel-derived glycerol. The effects of hydrogenolysis conditions such as reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, water content in the feed and catalysts are evaluated. Both high temperature and high hydrogen pressure favor 1, 2 -propanediol formation. This research discusses biorefinery processes and shows how biosustainable polyols {{can be used as a}} source of hydrogen and of chemicals.

40|$|One of {{the ways}} to lower the cost of nuclear energy is to {{increase}} the power density of the reactor core. Features of fuel design that enhance the potential for high power density are derived based on characteristics of the pressurized water reactor (PWR) and its related design limits. Those features include: large fuel surface to volume ratio, small fuel thickness, large fuel rod stiffness, low core pressure drop and an open fuel lattice design. Three types of fuel designs are evaluated from the thermal-hydraulic point of view: conventional solid cylindrical fuel rods, internally and externally cooled annular fuel rods, and spiral cross-geometry fuel rods, with the major effort allocated to analyzing the annular fuel. Limits of acceptable power density in solid cylindrical fuel rods are obtained by examining the effects of changing the core operation parameters, fuel rod diameter and rod array size. It is shown that the solid cylindrical geometry does not meet all the desired features for high power density well, and its potential for achieving high power density is limited to 20 % of current PWR power density, unless the vibration problems at the coolant higher velocity are overcome. The internally and externally cooled annular fuel potential for achieving high power density is explored, using a whole core model. The best size of fuel rods that fits in the reference assembly dimension is a 13 x 13 array, since the hot red will have a balanced MDNBR in the inner and outer channels. With proportional increase in coolant flow rate, this annular fuel can increase PWR power density by 50 % with the same DNBR margin, while reducing by 1000 'C the peak fuel temperature. Five issues involving manufacturing tolerances, oxide growth on rod surfaces, inner and outer gap conductances asymmetry, MDNBR sensitivity to changes in core operation parameter and resistance to instabilities were also evaluated. (contd.) It is found that the main uncertainty for this design is associated with the heat split between the inner and outer channels due to differences in the thermal resistances in the two fuel-clad gaps. Annular fuel is found to be resistant to flow instabilities, such as Ledinegg instability and density wave oscillation due to <b>high</b> <b>system</b> <b>pressure</b> and one-phase flow along most of the hot channel length. Similar power density uprate is found possible for annular fuel in a hexagonal lattice. Large break loss of coolant accident (LBLOCA) for the reference Westinghouse 4 -loop PWR utilizing annular fuel at 150 % power is analyzed using RELAP, under conservative conditions. The blowdown peak cladding temperature (PCT) is found to be lower because of the low operating fuel temperature, but the flow rate from the safety injection system needs to be increased by 50 % to remove the 50 % higher decay heat. Loss of flow analysis also showed better performance of the annular fuel because of its low stored energy. The fuel design that best meets the desired thermal and mechanical features is the spiral cross-geometry rods. The dimensions of this type of fuel that can be applied in the reference core were defined. Thermal-hydraulic whole-core evaluations were conducted with cylindrical fuel rod simplification, and critical heat flux modification based on the heat flux lateral non-uniformity in the cross geometry. This geometry was found to have the potential to increase PWR power density by 50 %. However, there are major uncertainties in the feasibility and costs of manufacturing this fuel. by Dandong Feng.
