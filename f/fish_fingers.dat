Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E

500|$|The opening sequence, {{in which}} the Doctor barely hangs onto the {{crashing}} TARDIS as it flies over London, was later added to the script to bridge from the conclusion of The End of Time to the TARDIS's crash into Amy's garden. Moffat {{thought it would be}} funny if they showed him hanging out of the TARDIS and nearly crashing into London, which would start an episode set {{in a small town in}} a big way. Moffat also referenced the scene from A.A. Milne's The House at Pooh Corner, where Tigger claims to like everything, but then proceeds to reject all food offered to him until he finally finds that he likes extract of malt. Moffat's variant had the newly regenerated Doctor reject a variety of foods, with the exception of <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> with custard, offered to him by the young Amy. Moffat felt that appealing to children was important to the show's success. The scene where the Doctor creates the virus using Jeff's laptop was originally set in a classroom where the Doctor used the students' computers; this was changed for production reasons. In the episode, the Doctor snaps his fingers to open the TARDIS, a trick his previous incarnation learned from River Song in [...] "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead". He also repeats the lines [...] "wibbley-wobbley, timey-wimey" [...] and [...] "some cowboys in here" [...] from the Moffat-written episodes [...] "Blink" [...] and [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace".|$|E
500|$|While Amelia {{waits for}} the Doctor in the garden, the camera returns to her house where something, presumably Prisoner Zero, darts past the camera. It is {{actually}} Smith in footage intended for the finale, [...] "The Big Bang", but when it did not fit into that episode it was recycled here. Originally the scene where the Doctor confirms {{that he is the}} man she remembers by showing her the apple she gave him that day was cut due to pacing issues and that the fact had been established in a previous scene. The previous scene was then cut and the apple scene returned. Due to the rain, the scene where the Doctor tries to gain the Atraxi's attention with his sonic screwdriver had to be simplified. Adam Smith based the style of the confrontation on a Western film. The destruction of the sonic screwdriver shortly after was achieved with a spark effect concealed inside the screwdriver, activated by an electrical charge that reached the screwdriver by an electrical wire that ran up Smith's sleeve and connected to a receiver. Special effects head Danny Hargreaves then used a remote control to activate the device. Contrary to reports, the effect did not injure Smith. The [...] "fish fingers and custard" [...] scene was shot in 12 takes. The <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> were actually a breaded coconut-flavored food item; Smith estimated that he had eaten some 14 of them.|$|E

5000|$|Lafayette Heritage Trail Park {{offers some}} of the best bank fishing in the Tallahassee area. Visitors have access to Lake Piney Z via 7 <b>fishing</b> <b>fingers</b> as well as a hand launch boat ramp. The boat ramp offers access for kayaks and small boats; however, the lake is {{electric}} motor only and all watercraft must be carried to the water by hand as there is no trailer access. Many local residents frequent the parks numerous <b>fishing</b> <b>fingers</b> in pursuit of the two most popular species at lake Piney Z; largemouth bass and bream. Thanks to efforts by the FWC, the park hosts a healthy population of fish. FWC officials have placed several vegetation patches and fish attractors throughout the lake in order to improve catch rates for fishermen and improve the habitat of the fishery. The lake hosts a very large population of largemouth bass with bass averaging on the small side in the 9"-12" [...] range with the occasional bass surpassing three pounds. Bass fishing can often be fast and furious from shore when a school of feeding bass swims within casting distance. It was originally prohibited to harvest largemouth bass from Piney Z; however, harvesting regulations have since been changed to align with the current FWC regulations for Florida lakes. Bluegill populations diminished over the years when largemouth bass harvest was prohibited. Numbers are expected to rebound with the repeal of the largemouth bass ban and the annual fall stocking of bluegill in Piney Z.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} the fish finger sandwich being created is probably during early 1981 when a nursing assistant at the old county psychiatric hospital of St Audry's in Melton, Suffolk found that he regularly {{had a lot of}} <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> left over following serving the patients breakfast. He discovered that although <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> were not particularly popular as a breakfast food, nevertheless, the kitchen served them each morning. So, rather than throw them away he decided to try them as a sandwich snack for his colleagues. Initially they simply consisted of four <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> between two slices of white bread along with a little tomato ketchup. They eventually proved popular with nursing staff and it seems quite likely that news of this simple, tasty snack spread by word of mouth and became popular throughout the UK.|$|E

5000|$|May {{was born}} in Dublin on 10 July 1974 in the Liberties in the south inner city. She is the {{youngest}} of five siblings, with sisters Edel Foy and Maria O'Reilly, and brothers Brendan Clabby and Fintan Clabby. In 1991, she attended Senior College Ballyfermot, where she studied Art, Graphics and Printmaking. Her early musical influences were folk and rock and roll, especially the music of Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent. By the age of nine, she was a fan of Rockabilly and Blues, particularly Elmore James and Billie Holiday. At 14, she sang in an advertisement for Findus Fish Fingers; of which she told Graham Norton on his talk show {{that she and her}} friends as a result [...] "got known as the <b>Fish</b> <b>Finger</b> Girls." [...] However, her career began at age 16 when she began touring the Dublin club circuit and she was occasionally barred from her own shows at Dublin's Bruxelles club for being underage. [...] "I was getting tips from the best musicians in Dublin," [...] May said. [...] "One of them said, 'your voice is great, but it needs to roughen.'" [...] It was around this time, when driving a tearful Imelda to a gig after a boyfriend break-up, that her father asked her, [...] "Is your heart broken? Excellent. Now you can sing the blues." [...] After moving to the UK in 1998, May began singing with Mike Sanchez.|$|R

5000|$|In 1966, {{with the}} project about to start, the Inuit {{families}} which would relocate were divided as to where their future village should be built. A choice {{had to be made}} between a site known as Qaamanialuk Paanga and the site of the old trading posts. Qaamanialuk Paanga was finally selected because it was easily accessible by boats used for summer hunting and <b>fishing,</b> nearby <b>Finger</b> River provided the necessary drinking water, and there was room to construct a landing strip. The new village was subsequently given the name Tasiujaq. The main reason the old trading post site was not selected as the site for the new village was its foreshore (tide land) was dotted with large boulders, and access by boat in summer would have been difficult. In 1971, once the community was organized, a cooperative store was established independently by residents, and is now associated with the Federation of Co-operatives of Northern Quebec.

40|$|Mixed reality {{applications}} {{can provide}} users with enhanced interaction experiences by integrating virtual and real world objects in a mixed environment. Through the mixed reality interface, {{a more realistic}} and immersive control style is achieved compared to the traditional keyboard and mouse input devices. The interface proposed in this paper consists of a stereo camera, which tracks the user’s hands and fingers robustly and accurately in the 3 D space. To enable a physically realistic experience in the interaction, a physics engine is adopted for the simulating the physics of virtual object manipulation. The objects can be picked up and tossed with physical characteristics, such as gravity and collisions which occur in the real world. Detection and interaction in our system is fully computer-vision based, without any markers or additional sensors. We demonstrate this gesture-based interface using two mixed reality game implementations: <b>finger</b> <b>fishing,</b> in which a player can simulate fishing for virtual objects with his/her fingers as in a real environment, and Jenga, which is a simulation of the well-known tower building game. A user study is conducted and reported to demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness and comfort of using this interactive interface...|$|R
