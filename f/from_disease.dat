5|$|More than 35 {{percent of}} the Hoosiers who joined the Union army became casualties: 24,416, roughly 12.6 percent of Indiana's {{soldiers}} who served, {{lost their lives in}} the conflict. An estimated 48,568 soldiers, double the number of Hoosiers killed in the war, were wounded. Indiana's war-related death toll eventually reached 25,028 (7,243 from battle and 17,785 <b>from</b> <b>disease).</b>|$|E

5|$|A Saxon–Prussian {{alliance}} {{fought the}} War of the Bavarian Succession (July 1778 – 21 May 1779) against the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy {{to prevent the}} Habsburgs from acquiring the Electorate of Bavaria. Although the war consisted {{of only a few}} minor skirmishes, thousands of soldiers died <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> and starvation, earning the conflict the name Kartoffelkrieg (Potato War) in Prussia and Saxony; in Habsburg Austria, it was sometimes called the Zwetschgenrummel (Plum Fuss).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|Australian and Papuan troops {{advanced}} {{along the}} coast of the Huon Peninsula, using infantry, tanks, and air strikes against the Japanese positions, which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed {{in the early stages of}} the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed; thousands more died <b>from</b> <b>disease,</b> malnutrition, exhaustion and suicide. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces.|$|E
5|$|Children {{arrived at}} the camp in an {{emaciated}} and weak condition from other camps within the Ustaše camp system, {{with a total of}} 3,336 children passing through the camp. Between 449 and 1500 children died there, mainly <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> and malnutrition. A sub-camp was established in nearby Donja Reka. The Yugoslav Partisans liberated about 350 children from the main camp inAugust 1942. In October 1942, about 500 of the surviving children were dispersed among local families by the Catholic aid group, Caritas; 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages, and another 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška.|$|E
5|$|Cook {{attributed}} the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered {{that it be}} purified with lime juice, but this had little effect. Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship's carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed Endeavour to resume her voyage. The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> being three ordinary seamen on 27 February.|$|E

5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E
5|$|New York's {{support for}} the Union cause continued, however grudgingly, and {{gradually}} Southern sympathies declined in the city. New York banks eventually financed the Civil War, and the state's industries were more productive {{than those of the}} entire Confederacy. By the end of the war, more than 450,000 soldiers, sailors, and militia had enlisted from New York State, which was the most populous state at the time. A total of 46,000 military men from New York State died during the war, more <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> than wounds.|$|E
5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records.

5|$|Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British effort in the First World War. It {{especially}} provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or <b>from</b> <b>disease,</b> and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Britain's commander on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom <b>from</b> <b>disease,</b> and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Brigade {{suffered}} 65killed and 136wounded on top {{of rising}} casualties <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> {{and was replaced by}} the 20th Brigade at this point. The 26th Brigade took over flank protection duties inland. The advance then rolled quickly as Japanese morale broke and organised resistance diminished. Large gains were made against only limited resistance, which often amounted to minor skirmishes against small groups of Japanese. Hubika fell on 22 December with no opposition, and Wandokai two days later. Blucher Point was reached on 28 December, where the 2/13th Infantry Battalion regained contact with the retreating Japanese and fought a sharp contact. Elsewhere, that same day, US forces landed further west at Saidor.|$|E
5|$|The Haitian {{campaign}} proved {{disastrous for}} the legionnaires. Combat casualties and tropical diseases, including the yellow fever, reduced the 5,280-strong Polish contingent {{to a few}} hundred survivors {{in the space of}} less than two years. By the time the French forces retreated from the island in 1803, about 4,000 Poles had died (either <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> or combat). Of the survivors, about 400 remained on the island, a few dozen were dispersed to the nearby islands or to the United States, and about 700 returned to France (Urbankowski claims 6,000 sent and 330 returned).|$|E
5|$|The Japanese counter-offensive on Morotai was not successful. The troops {{brought to}} the island {{suffered}} from high rates of disease and it proved impossible to bring sufficient supplies through the Allied air and naval blockade. As a result, while the 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit raided the US perimeter on several occasions, the reinforcements were unable to mount larger attacks and did not impede Allied airfield construction activities. The Japanese force subsequently withdrew into central Morotai where many soldiers died <b>from</b> <b>disease</b> or starvation. The last Japanese supply barges from Halmahera reached Morotai on 12 May 1945.|$|E
40|$|The {{health status}} of canine populations within {{developed}} and those within developing communities was studied in a retrospective survey and compared.

Dogs from developing communities were mainly young cross-bred dogs which suffered <b>from</b> infectious <b>diseases</b> (44), trauma (22) and parasitic diseases (11). There was a high mortality rate (30) and 82 of these patients suffered <b>from</b> <b>diseases</b> that could have been prevented. The dogs from developed communities were mainly adult or old pure-bred dogs that suffered mainly <b>from</b> organ <b>diseases</b> (57). There was a low mortality rate (10) while only 31 suffered <b>from</b> <b>diseases</b> that could have been prevented. Based on the epidemiological findings, it was evident that owners of dogs in the developing communities required education in primary and secondary prevention of disease...|$|R
