5|$|Console organs {{have two}} 61-note manuals and a pedalboard {{of at least}} two octaves. Most {{consoles}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> built-in power amplifier or speakers, so an external amplifier and speaker cabinet is required.|$|E
5|$|Crest badges, {{much like}} clan tartans, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century.

5|$|Elvish {{greetings}} can {{be expressed}} both by voice and by hand, and often involve {{a combination of the}} two. Elvish greetings are often, but not always, used just prior to a conversation.

5|$|I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high {{opinion of}} North American and their motives {{in the early}} days. Their first program manager was a {{first-class}} jerk....

50|$|If <b>a</b> surface <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{tangent plane}} at <b>a</b> point, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal {{at that point}} either. For example, <b>a</b> cone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal at its tip nor does it <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal {{along the edge of}} its base. However, the normal to the cone is defined almost everywhere. In general, it is {{possible}} to define a normal almost everywhere for a surface that is Lipschitz continuous.|$|R
50|$|The power {{spectrum}} of this example is not continuous, and therefore <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> derivative, and therefore this signal <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{power spectral density}} function. In general, the {{power spectrum}} will usually be the sum of two parts: a line spectrum such as in this example, which is <b>not</b> continuous and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> density function, and a residue, which is absolutely continuous and does <b>have</b> <b>a</b> density function.|$|R

5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E

5|$|Councils {{are divided}} into districts with {{leadership}} provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the district commissioner. Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman. Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> separate corporate status.|$|E
5|$|FIFA also organises {{international}} tournaments {{for youth}} football (FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup), club football (FIFA Club World Cup), and football variants such as futsal (FIFA Futsal World Cup) and beach soccer (FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup). The latter three <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> women's version, although a FIFA Women's Club World Cup has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce a loud call. Their buccal cavity is {{enlarged}} and dome-shaped, {{acting as a}} resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They need to use an alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E

50|$|Let's consider, {{for further}} explanation, an example used by Bolzano. The idea round square, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object, because the object {{that ought to}} be {{represented}} is self-contrary. A different example is the idea nothing which certainly <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object. However, the proposition idea of <b>a</b> round square <b>has</b> complexity has as its subject-idea idea of a round square. This subject-idea does <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object, namely the idea round square. But, that idea <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object.|$|R

5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Malón, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio would not allow it and that they would not reunite the band if the four members <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good personal relationship.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor {{do they have a}} consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E
