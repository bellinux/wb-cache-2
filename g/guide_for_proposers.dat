40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} {{at the request}} of STScI. It is intended to serve as a <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> HST <b>proposers</b> and TAC panel reviewers in evaluating the need for HST/NICMOS to accomplish the scientific goals of programs under consideration in specific observational domains. In the years since the first incarnation of NICMOS, ground-based technical capabilities in support of challenging astronomical observations have made great strides, notably in the arena of large telescopes augmented with adaptive optics systems. Some programs, which could once only have been attempted from space, might now be possible with suitable instrumentation on such ground-based facilities. Yet, many of these systems are still in there early evolutionary stages and their theoretical potentials as applied to any particular observation is far from assured, and performance is far from repeatable given the temporally variable line-of-sight conditions encountered at ground-based observatories. The delineation between programs best suited for space and ground, and the complementary nature of others has, in some cases, become blurred. In this report, we review the capabilities of HST/NICMOS and the current state-of-the-art of operational AO systems, as applied to astronomical investigations of contemporary import, and suggest areas o...|$|R
40|$|In equal {{punishment}} games {{first the}} proposer suggests how {{to split the}} pie, i. e. a positive monetary reward. Unlike in the ultimatum game, the responder can decide among many (<b>for</b> <b>proposer</b> and responder) equal penalty payments. To exclude negative payoffs, punishment was bounded from above depending on the proposal and the (<b>for</b> <b>proposer</b> and responder) same show up-fee, our only treatment variable. Although inequality aversion (Bolton and Oekenfels, 1999, and Fehr and Schmidt, 1999) predicts zero-punishments, we observe positive punishments which, however, became smaller in the repetition. Initial fairness is often substituted in the repetition by extreme greed. Whereas greed is sticky, fairness is more characteristic for initial inclinations and not a stable behavioral pattern...|$|R
