40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the theme of {{bilateral}} relations between the <b>EU</b> and <b>Switzerland,</b> focusing on the current phenomenon of migration. The <b>EU</b> and <b>Switzerland</b> cooperate on bilateral sectoral basis, since Switzerland (hence the citizens of Switzerland) {{does not want to}} integrate into the European internal market to maintain its sovereignty and autonomy. Within the first series of bilateral agreements between the <b>EU</b> and <b>Switzerland</b> an agreement on free movement of persons was signed, thereby Switzerland opened its labour market to EU citizens. In February 2014, however, the citizens of Switzerland used the institution of direct democracy and adopted by a narrow majority the initiative to stop mass immigration. This step disrupted the agreement on free movement of persons and the complex negotiations started in order to solve this impasse. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate the impacts of immigration on the Swiss economy and the subsequent evaluation of the reasonableness to mitigate the immigration through a citizens' initiative...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: According to {{the concept}} of {{distributed}} cognition or distributed intelligence (Pea, 1993; Wertsch, 1995), which is popular in current theories on learning, intelligence is not a property of individual minds. Instead it is achieved through the resources distributed in soci-ety: between people, and also between people, physical tools, and symbolic systems. Build-ing on this perspective, people can achieve very complex goals through distributed cogni-tion. When schools engage in joint projects with members of the community, many examples of socially distributed intelligence emerge; moreover, when people interact in more egali-tarian ways, using this kind of collective intelligence, both the processes and the results are much more effective. This article describes various ways that distributed cognition functions in four schools in Spain that are being studied within the INCLUD-ED integrated research project. This type of organisation in these schools is reflected in two key practices: <b>mixed</b> <b>committees</b> and interactive groups in the classroom. Evidence of the pedagogical benefits of this approach is also provided. Key words: Distributed cognition in community-based education, Interactive Groups, <b>mixed</b> <b>committees...</b>|$|R
