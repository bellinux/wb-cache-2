During the height of her reign, {{it was said that}} the chefs in her private kitchen could make more than 400 types of dim sum and more than 4,000 other dishes that {{included}} <b>fish,</b> <b>duck,</b> chicken, meat and shark fin. Every morning she would drink a bowl of [...] "snow fungus" [...] (Tremella fuciformis) soup specially made by a eunuch named Zhang Fu. It is said she started eating this soup because she had caught a persistent case of diarrhea that nothing worked to cure until an imperial doctor presented her with a bowl of tremella soup. According to traditional Chinese medicine, among other health benefits, snow fungus helps to boost the immune system. Cixi also was well known for her seasonal eating habits. At certain times of the year she would eat certain foods because she believed that this would balance her health and give her the nutrients she would need as her body changed with the seasons.|$|E

The farm was part of a $300 million 1500 acre project that was to raise fruits, vegetables and herbs, as well as lamb, venison, <b>fish,</b> <b>duck,</b> quail, pheasant, mushrooms, honey, and Christmas trees.

In {{the center of the}} ponds, Ligorio had originally planned to create a central pond with monumental fountains. However, when Ippolito died in 1572 only two of the ponds had been completed. In the late 16th century the ponds were lined by sixteen tall pilasters in the form of ermes which jetted out fan-shaped sprays of water, creating a multitude of rainbows on a sunny day.|$|E

A diverse vegetation covered the surrounding broad fluvial plains that extended to the coastal margins. Initially this was largely rainforest, which varied according to habitat and to changing climate. In particular, the climate and ecology appear to have fluctuated across the two major thresholds of fire/no-fire and of peat accumulation and no-peat. A major climate change, possibly the sharp global deterioration in conditions at about 14 Ma, profoundly changed the vegetation. Rainforest continuity fragmented, and herblands became widespread.
