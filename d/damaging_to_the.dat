5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane produces {{inorganic fluoride}} and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA). The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (<b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (<b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942 the Indies were {{occupied}} by the Empire of Japan. The occupation government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both clergy and laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade the use of Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties; several others, including the presbytery at Gedangan, were protected by the clergy. After two European head pastors, G. Schoonhoff and G. de Quay, were confined, ultimately on 27 August 1943 the ethnic Javanese Soegijapranata took on parish duties {{in addition to his}} work as vicar apostolic. Although he promoted non-compliance with Japanese demands considered <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church, Soegijapranata also endorsed some collaboration. For instance, on 28 February 1944 a Latin-language Mass was delivered at Gedangan by , bishop of Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Invasive weeds are {{prevalent}} in, and <b>damaging</b> <b>to,</b> <b>the</b> park. Species {{common in}} other formerly occupied {{parts of the}} foothills are also common in the park. Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), olives, blackberries, common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and dog rose (Rosa canina). In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of plant disease in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park. Mechanical countermeasures, in the form of boot scrubbing stations, have been introduced to control its spread.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{complications}} of diabetes due <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> in small blood vessels include <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eyes, kidneys, and nerves. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eyes, known as diabetic retinopathy, {{is caused by}} <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{blood vessels in the}} retina of the eye, and can result in gradual vision loss and blindness. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidneys, known as diabetic nephropathy, can lead to tissue scarring, urine protein loss, and eventually chronic kidney disease, sometimes requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nerves of the body, known as diabetic neuropathy, is the most common complication of diabetes. The symptoms can include numbness, tingling, pain, and altered pain sensation, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin. Diabetes-related foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcers) may occur, and can be difficult to treat, occasionally requiring amputation. Additionally, proximal diabetic neuropathy causes painful muscle atrophy and weakness.|$|R

5|$|Relations {{between the}} Song and Liao (led by the Khitans) were {{relatively}} peaceful {{in the first}} two decades after Song was founded, the disputed territories of the Northern Han and the Sixteen Prefectures notwithstanding. In 974, the two began exchanging embassies on New Years Day. However, in 979 the Song moved against the Northern Han, long under the protection of the Liao dynasty. The Song emperor succeeded in forcing the Northern Han to surrender, but when marching on the Liao Southern Capital (present-day Beijing) in the Sixteen Prefectures, Song forces were defeated at the Battle of Gaoliang River. This defeat was politically <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prestige of Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976â€“997), so much so that his top military commanders orchestrated an aborted coup to replace him with his nephew Zhao Dezhao.|$|E
5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> birds. In the {{great spotted woodpecker}} {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos I was {{the last}} of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople, {{although}} his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204. Nevertheless, Andronikos's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death. Andonikos's coup, together with his violent death, had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely. Furthermore, his so-called 'anti-Latin' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure, in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west. In particular, Andonikos's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant, since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti-Latin in the west. It has even been argued that Andronikos's attempts to crush the aristocracy were <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> empire's military power, since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state. On the other hand, his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire.|$|E
50|$|Horner's {{syndrome}} is a disorder resulting from <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic autonomic nervous pathway in <b>the</b> head. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SCG, {{part of this}} system, often results in Horner's syndrome. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> T1-T3 regions of the spinal cord is responsible for drooping of the eyelids (ptosis), constriction of the pupil (miosis), and sinking of the eyeball (apparent Enophthalmos; not truly sunken, just appears so because of the drooping eyelid). Lesion or significant <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SCG results in a third order neuron disorder (see Horner's Syndrome: Pathophysiology).|$|R

5|$|At the 1886 general election, Samuel Allsopp {{held his}} seat in {{parliament}} unopposed for the Conservative Party. In April 1887, his father, Henry Allsopp, 1st Baron Hindlip, died. As a result of this, Samuel Allsopp succeeded, entering the House of Lords as a peer. This left the parliamentary consistency of Taunton vacant. The Conservative Party offered Samuel Allsopp's brother, Alfred Percy Allsopp (commonly known as Percy Allsopp) the chance to contest the vacancy. Initially {{it was reported that}} the Liberal Party would not contest the seat if Percy Allsopp was the only Conservative candidate, but a meeting of the local executive could not reach a consensus: some believed that as the area was so strongly Conservative, a large loss would be <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> party, while others wanted to generate a debate on Home Rule. Despite the Taunton executive of the Conservative Party selecting Percy Allsopp as their preferred candidate, the town's Mayor, Samuel Farrant, declared that he would also stand for the Conservatives, which led to concern within that party that a split of the votes could result in a Liberal candidate being elected. Farrant later withdrew his candidacy, leaving Allsopp as the Conservative's sole representative. After their initial uncertainty, the Liberals opted to give the Taunton electorate the opportunity to show their views on Home Rule, and chose James Harris Sanders, of London, as their candidate.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since its}} {{establishment}} Girdap served political interests, {{and it was}} later tied to the Popular Liberal Party of Stefan Stambolov. On the other hand, the Bulgarian Commercial Bank (Balgarska targovska banka), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, {{was close to the}} Popular Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political ties in their competition. These relations were often <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather than that of the state. As the Bulgarian economy consolidated {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest private bank in the Kingdom of Bulgaria after the Bulgarian Commercial Bank and the Deutsche Bank-related Credit Bank (Kreditna banka). However, Bulgaria's privately owned banking sector remained comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|In September 1998, {{four months}} after the fall of Suharto, the Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah {{declared}} that the film would no longer be compulsory viewing material, reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto in the centre. Tempo reported in 2012 that Saleh Basarah of the Air Force had influenced this decree. The magazine stated that Basarah had called the Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono and asked him to not screen Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI, as it was <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Air Force. Two other films, Janur Kuning (Yellow Coconut Leaves; 1979) and Serangan Fajar, were likewise affected by the decree; Janur Kuning portrayed Suharto as the hero behind the 1 March 1949 General Assault while Serangan Fajar showed him as a major hero of the revolution. At the time it was suggested that TVRI was attempting to distance itself from the former president. This occurred in a period of desanctifying symbols related to the events, and by the early 2000s non-government versions of the G30S coup were easily available in Indonesia.|$|E
