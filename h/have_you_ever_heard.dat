You're doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don't know how to write a song... Have you ever listened to pop music? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> any rock-and-roll music... You should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E

It was {{a play on}} words. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of the Black Madonna? It has layers of meaning and for a minute, I {{thought it would be}} a fun title for my record. Then I thought, 'Twenty-five per cent of the world might get this, {{probably}} less, it's not worth it.' It happens all the time, because my references are usually off the Richter scale." ...|$|E

30|$|During expert {{committee}} review, {{a bilingual}} clinical expert reviewed the synthesis document of T 1 and T 2 translations and {{compared it to}} the source English language survey. This allowed issues of translation to be further assessed, and the subsequent discussion of key translated terms {{that needed to be}} conceptually aligned with the source language. One issue arose during expert committee review from the synthesis report with the question: “Before this test was described, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of a home stool test” as it was translated without the word “before”, and thus the meaning differed. Therefore, the wording was changed to be clear on what the question was asking with the inclusion of a term that made the question conceptually aligned.|$|R

6000|$|... "Man, since <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been in {{this part}} of the country, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> seen or <b>heard</b> of any wild beasts here? Are there any jaguars or pumas?" ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{a tour of}} United States {{in early}} 1974 and a Canadian tour later in the year, the group ended up playing small clubs. As Barry joked, [...] "We ended up in, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of Batley's the variety club in (West Yorkshire) England?".|$|E
6000|$|... "Crocker," [...] said he, at length, [...] "there's a {{man here}} from Boston, Charles Wrexell Allen; came this morning. You know Boston. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! and Alethea Weston,' said Lily. 'Her {{voice is}} so clear and distinct, that she hardly ever raises {{it to make}} him hear. And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> her sing?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{suppose the}} {{daughter}} hasn't waited for an opportunity. The mother had read that publisher's paragraph about your invalid, {{and wanted to}} know if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> from her again. Women are personal in their literary interests." ...|$|R
60|$|No doubt <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{listened to}} {{speakers}} of this kind, but I question whether <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> anything {{more typical of}} the sort of effect that I allude to than Mullins's speech at the big rally at the Fourth Concession.|$|R
6000|$|Bessie (Pain and shame). Oh!.... What are {{you waiting}} for? If I had more money I would give it all, all.

6000|$|... "Aye, Olaf, and {{the dream}} fits well with other things. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> Olaf, that {{there are those who}} say that men live more than once upon this earth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} if you'll only stop talking for a minute. It's quite an easy, {{pleasant}} job. You will enjoy it. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of Market Snodsbury Grammar School?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good. Now, your inclinations {{are to be}} consulted. I don't {{think that}} wise, mind, but it's my trust. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of any tutor whom you would prefer to another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, if {{you could}} only hear her sing it by moonlight, I venture to say, my dear Glastonbury, that you would confess that all <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> or seen, or imagined, of enchanted spirits {{floating}} in the air, and filling the atmosphere with supernatural symphonies, was realised.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Headache?" [...] said Uncle Chris, {{starting}} like a war-horse {{that has}} heard the bugle. [...] "I don't know if I have ever mentioned it, but I used to suffer from headaches at one time. Extraordinarily severe headaches. I tried everything, until one day a man I knew recommended a thing called--don't know if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of it...." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first poster titled [...] "Bang Bang Bang" [...] was {{released}} on May 27, YG Entertainment producer Yang Hyun-suk commented that the song was [...] "the most powerful music <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> before."

6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] I added, as I {{paid the}} bill, [...] "I {{have really been}} profoundly {{interested}} in {{what you told me}} about the New Shaving. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of a thing called the New theology?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> Julian," [...] he said, [...] "that our enemies {{on the other}} side of the North Sea are {{supposed}} to have divided the whole of the eastern coast of Great Britain into small, rectangular districts, each about a couple of miles square.

6000|$|... "It's {{conventional}} enough," [...] he began. [...] "Ghosts don't seem to {{have much}} originality. But it's firsthand, Jack, if that's what you want. I don't suppose any of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> me speak of my brother, Charles. He was my senior by two years, and was a quiet, reserved sort of fellow--not at all demonstrative, but with very strong and deep affections.|$|R
40|$|Whenever {{my friends}} {{find out that}} I did a PhD on golf-ball impacts, they think I'm joking. I {{remember}} arguing long into the night {{at a dinner party}} with a woman who just would not believe me. Every half an hour or so she would say, "Go on, tell me, what did you really do?" It's funny how people come up with the same joke, and then think {{it is the first time}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> it: "I suppose it's a load of balls then. ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is a {{singular}} idea of yours," [...] he at length said; [...] "not singular in itself, but strangely coincident {{with something that}} happened to be occupying my mind. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> any such instances as you speak of?" ...|$|E
60|$|That is a lie. And I {{say to you}} {{now that}} the average {{morality}} and desire for right conduct {{of the people of}} the United States is far higher than that of the government which misrepresents it.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said our}} Anglo-Jap {{as we all}} drew up our chairs round the smoking-room fire, [...] "it's an old tale out yonder, and may have spilt over into print for all I know.

6000|$|As she {{had been}} {{accustomed}} to riding from her childhood, she managed to travel as many miles daily as her brothers had done, and it was, as before, on the twentieth day that {{she arrived at the}} place where the dervish was sitting.

The band explained: [...] "This is no post-album cash in. It’s no B-Sides and rarities or 'songs that weren’t good enough to be on the album cobbled together with some remixes and field recordings of Cardiff's indie scene'; it’s ten all-new tracks that none of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> before."

6000|$|Lord Marshmoreton gave {{a little}} sigh. [...] "It's {{a long time since}} I went to see a musical performance. More than twenty years. When I was up at Oxford, and for some years afterwards, I was a great theatre-goer. Never used to miss a first night at the Gaiety. Those were the days of Nellie Farren and Kate Vaughan. Florence St. John, too. How {{excellent}} she was in Faust Up To Date! But we missed Nellie Farren. Meyer Lutz was the Gaiety composer then. But a good deal of water has flowed under the bridge since those days. I don't suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of Meyer Lutz?" ...|$|R
50|$|Throughout 2010 Finn {{worked on}} a new electro-acoustic project {{entitled}} “Music of the Mind” which deals with brainwaves in music and new forms of algorhythmically based composition and improvisation. This groundbreaking project, supported by the Arts Council and Californian based Neurosky, garnered press attention with appearances on Radio 4's “Today” programme, BBC World and GMTV on ITV. The album was described by The Independent as “nothing like <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> before.” The group toured the Music of the Mind in the UK, performing with live visuals and a film made about the project by Nick Hillel during 2010 and 2011. Music of the Mind is to be featured in an upcoming Channel 4 documentary.|$|R
