500|$|Debate {{continued}} {{over the}} field {{later in the season}} when Jacksonville runningback Fred Taylor called the field [...] "a lawsuit pending". Pittsburgh's ownership stated that the decision was up to the players, who once again defended the natural surface. In February 2008, the Steelers announced that they would keep the Desso GrassMaster surface. During the 2008 season quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was given a concussion after being hit at Heinz Field. He later stated, [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> weren't on FieldTurf. That grass—you know, the soft Heinz Field—might've helped a little bit." [...] After the 2008 season, a poll of 1,565NFL players rated the surface at Heinz Field as the worst of the 18natural surfaces in the League.|$|E

[...] During another interview with Der Spiegel, he added, [...] "For us {{it has always been}} a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Internet.

[...] A sound recordist commented: [...] "I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They really went at it."

500|$|Al Jean, showrunner since season thirteen, {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} criticism, with some arguing that the show has {{continued}} to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is [...] "on auto-pilot", [...] "too sentimental", and the episodes are [...] "just being cranked out." [...] Some critics believe that the show has [...] "entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny." [...] John Ortved, author of , characterized the Jean era as [...] "toothless", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{everything}} she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels {{free to make}} judgments of the scenes around her; Shelley writes that Claire [...] "on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed the one before, she cried, 'I am <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> did not stay at Charenton, but let us live here'". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed. As scholar Angela Jones contends, [...] "Shelley {{may be said to}} figure herself as a more knowledgeable, disinterested English outsider capable of rendering impartial judgment"—an Enlightenment value.|$|E

500|$|During World WarII, {{the palace}} was bombed nine times, {{the most serious}} and publicised of which {{resulted}} in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King GeorgeVI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed. War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> have been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the face". The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as The Sunday Graphic reported: ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
500|$|Forty-five {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Kahne clinched the 20th pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 30.525 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Edwards. McMurray qualified third, Bill Elliott took fourth, and A. J. Allmendinger started fifth. Johnson, David Reutimann, Mark Martin, David Ragan and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. Hamlin only managed 37th, having getting close to the wall. The two drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Patrick Carpentier, and Michael McDowell. Once the qualifying session completed, Kahne commented, [...] "That was the best qualifying run by far since I joined Red Bull. I look forward to Sunday’s race. It’s going to be exciting being up front now, being in the mix with Denny , Kevin [...] and Jimmie [...] They’re all going to be fast throughout the race. I’m just <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> are so far.

500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so much you can do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.

500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> lost the World Series, because it means that I still have a friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E
500|$|Various plotlines leaked {{before the}} episode's release, {{the most notable}} being {{the death of the}} Lone Gunmen. The choice to kill off the trio was controversial; Gilligan himself later {{admitted}} that [...] "I still think we made the wrong choice on that one." [...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, as you know, no one really dies in The X-Files [...] But I do feel tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note. I wish we'd ended it on a laugh or smile." [...] The actors who played The Lone Gunmen complimented the script. Harwood admitted that the episode would have either featured the trio's death or would have featured them [...] "walk off into the sunset without hobo bags over our shoulders." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "I was <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> were killed off in the end". Dean Haglund said that he [...] "liked the way we were sent off", and called the ending [...] "cool".|$|E

500|$|In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions {{other than}} Ireland {{declared}} war on Nazi Germany. George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The {{first night of the}} Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: [...] "I am <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face." [...] The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations {{as the rest of the}} country. They were subject to rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King's brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm <b>glad</b> <b>we</b> were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E
500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.
