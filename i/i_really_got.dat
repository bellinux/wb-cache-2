As of January 2014, the song is Ellis-Bextor's 18th best-selling single in the United Kingdom. Ellis-Bextor later talked on the chart success the song had, [...] "It just didn't get heard by enough people, [...] I suppose as well it felt {{slightly}} frustrating {{because it was a}} slightly different style of song for me, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> sort of punished for it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, an old video {{surfaced}} of Mills {{wearing a}} mink coat she had owned in 1989, but explained to reporters {{that she had}} bought it years before becoming involved in animal rights organisations or vegetarianism. Although she had separated from McCartney, Mills said: [...] "It's only since I met Paul [...] that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> to understand how vegetarianism not only benefits your health massively but also makes a huge difference to the planet, to animals, and to feeding the world."

500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Rihanna {{was signed}} to Rogers' and Carl Sturken's {{production}} company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions, who assigned her a lawyer and manager, before the completed demo tape was distributed to various record labels {{around the world in}} late 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings. Rihanna auditioned for him and music mogul L.A. Reid in his office. Looking back on the audition and meeting Jay-Z, Rihanna explained in an interview how she felt before walking into the room, saying: [...] "That's when <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> nervous..... I was like: 'Oh God, he's right there, I can't look, I can't look, I can't look!' I remember being extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I'm sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Zee. I was star-struck." [...] During the audition, Rihanna performed Whitney Houston's cover of [...] "For the Love of You", as well as [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] and [...] "The Last Time", which were written and produced by Rogers and Sturken and would be included on her debut album Music of the Sun.|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, and that I should just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time I had with her. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> to know the character, and she had so many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{signing a}} record deal with Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna was {{discovered}} in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers, who made the necessary arrangements for her to fly to New York. There, she recorded a collection of demos for a demo tape {{to be sent to}} record labels. One of the demos recorded was that of [...] "Pon de Replay", which was written and produced by Carl Sturken, Evan Rogers and Vada Nobles in 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings, where Rihanna auditioned for him and music executive L.A.

[...] During the audition, Rihanna performed Whitney Houstons cover of [...] "For the Love of You", [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] and [...] "The Last Time", the latter two of which would go on to be included on her debut album, Music of the Sun. Initially, Jay-Z was skeptical about signing Rihanna, because he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was too big for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists". [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was released via iTunes on July 26, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was after}} rehearsals at Western Recorders that Binder took special note of how Presley {{and the other}} musicians would spontaneously unwind by improvising old blues and rock 'n' roll numbers.

2500|$|Dilli Düdük {{was written}} {{one and a}} half years ago, when Tarkan went through a {{difficult}} period in his life. [...] "I wrote it when again the fruits of my work were unjustly stoned and muddied. In the same period one of my colleagues became a victim of such unfair attacks, as well. This time <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> angry. I wrote this song for those who break people's heart without thinking first, who make a mountain out of a molehill with their words." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through his teens, Hancock {{never had}} a jazz teacher, but {{developed}} his ear and sense of harmony. He was also influenced by records of the vocal group the Hi-Lo's. He reported that:"...by the time I actually heard the Hi-Lo's, I started picking that stuff out; my ear was happening. I could hear stuff and that's when I really learned some much farther-out voicings – like the harmonies I used on Speak Like a Child – {{just being able to}} do that. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> that from Clare Fischer's arrangements for the Hi-Lo's. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept...he and Bill Evans, and Ravel and Gil Evans, finally. You know, that's where it came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|The work {{of record}} {{producer}} Phil Spector, who popularized the Wall of Sound, was a focal obsession for Wilson. In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as [...] "the single most influential producer. He's timeless. He makes a milestone whenever {{he goes into}} the studio." [...] Brian later reflected: [...] "I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song." [...] He explains: [...] "Before Spector, people recorded all the instruments separately. They got great piano, great guitar, and great bass. But he thought of the song as one giant instrument. It was huge. Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded. And he had the best drums I ever heard." [...] In 1999, when asked if he was a religious man, Wilson responded: [...] "I believe in Phil Spector." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{her third}} divorce, Katori decided to support herself. She first ran a {{gasoline}} station, and, as of 2006, {{was running a}} company canteen. Reflecting on {{her role as a}} pioneering pink film star, Katori says, [...] "I enjoyed my acting, but <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> used to the atmosphere of the pink movie business." [...] However, she adds, [...] "I've got no regrets about my time in the entertainment world. I'd still go back there now to perform if there was a part for this old girl." ...|$|R

She had felt very respectable when she set out, {{but she could not}} avoid a lurking conviction that, beside Flora and Meta, it had a scanty, schoolgirl effect. [...] "And," [...] she continued quaintly, [...] "besides, <b>I</b> have <b>really</b> <b>got</b> a new gown on purpose--a good useful silk, that papa chose at Whitford--just the colour of a copper tea-kettle, where it turns purple." ...|$|R

Critic Michael Hann cites an [...] "extraordinary rush of avant-pop creativity between 1965 and 1967". In the belief of writer Richard Goldstein: [...] " [...] never realized his full potential as a composer. In the light of electronica and minimalism, you can see how advanced his ideas were, but they remain bursts of inspiration from a mind that couldn't mobilize itself into a whole. This was the major tragedy of rock in the sixties." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, one film {{in which}} Orbison {{refused to allow}} his music to be used was Blue Velvet. Director David Lynch asked to use [...] "In Dreams", and Orbison {{initially}} declined Lynch's request. Lynch used it anyway. The song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named Frank Booth (played by [...] Dennis Hopper). It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, [...] "I was mortified because {{they were talking about}} the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal... I thought, 'What in the world...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Yeston and David Hahn's In the Beginning, {{a musical}} poking good-natured {{fun at the}} first five books of the Bible from the {{perspective}} of ordinary people living through the events described, had been workshopped at the Manhattan Theatre Club with an initial Book by Larry Gelbart under the title [...] 1-2-3-4-5 in 1987 and 1988. [...] After various revisions and tryouts, it was finally produced under its current title at Maine State Music Theatre in 1998. A producer introduced Yeston to Alan Jay Lerner to show him a song from the show, [...] "New Words", and [...] "Lerner thought the song was so wonderful he invited me to stop by his office every couple of weeks so he could give me pointers. He said Oscar Hammerstein had done that for him and he wanted to do that for me. So, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> coaching lessons – mentoring – in a series of meetings with Alan Jay Lerner as a result of having written that song." [...] In 1988 Yeston recorded a studio recording of a musical entitled , produced by the noted Phil Ramone. Plácido Domingo sang the role of Spanish painter Francisco de Goya, with Jennifer Rush, Gloria Estefan, Dionne Warwick, Richie Havens, and Seiko Matsuda. [...] Domingo was interested in starring in a stage musical about Goya and suggested to producer Alan Carr that Yeston would be the right person to create the vehicle, since Domingo had admired Yeston's work on Nine. [...] Because of Domingo's time commitments, the musical was made into a concept album instead.|$|E

We see him from time to time, and I'm really glad he's coming because it's going to take the show up a notch, and I'm really looking forward to playing with him, finally." [...] It has been reported that former members Randy Meisner and Don Felder will not appear. Meisner had been invited but could not participate due to health problems, while Felder was reportedly not invited due to ongoing legal disputes with the band.|$|R
5000|$|Turner's father, also a guitarist (who {{played in}} Richard Clapton's band {{as well as}} various outfits around Adelaide), left before Turner was born and {{returned}} only briefly when Turner was two years old. He later died of a heroin overdose in 1999. Turner has expressed regret at not having known his father and considers his music career to be a tribute to his father's memory. [...] "I just felt sad that <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> the chance to know him. And because he didn't die in the nicest way. He died in a tragic way."

During those days I often saw Anscombe and Heda, {{but only for a}} few minutes at a time.

5000|$|Two more singles {{followed}} in 1970, [...] "Baby, Baby, Don't Stop Now," [...] and [...] "One Part Love, Two Parts Pain." [...] The {{first was a}} leftover Hayes-Porter recording from Stax; the second was produced by Wexler and Dowd in New York, and was written by Stax executive Al Bell and Allen Jones. Both failed to chart. According to Wexler, [...] "We just made some shit-ass records with them. <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> into their sensibilities as a producer." [...] Wexler then sent the duo south to Muscle Shoals and Miami to work with producers Brad Shapiro and Dave Crawford for their next single [...] "Knock It Out The Park," [...] which also failed to chart.|$|R
50|$|Devanny later regretted viewing her novels {{as a way}} {{to convey}} ideology, rather than trying to write to the best of her abilities. She later noted: 'I realise now that I have not {{exploited}} the small measure of ability for writing I possess one whit. <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> down to it and THOUGHT. Thought was reserved for politics'. Devanny moved to North Queensland during the 1940s and spent the last two decades of her life in the region. During the 1950s she wrote many articles and stories, which documented many details about the region during the mid Twentieth Century. She died on 8 March 1962 in Townsville, having been diagnosed with chronic leukaemia. Her remains were cremated in Rockhampton.|$|R
