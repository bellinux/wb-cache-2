2500|$|At the time, Protopopescu left Crainic's {{enterprise}} and became manager of Manoilescu's Buna Vestire. Toma Vlădescu also left for Buna Vestire, where he regularly attacked his former mentor and employer. One of his lampoons proclaimed Crainic [...] "a cadaver" [...] filled with [...] "stench", and suggested [...] "drowning [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> salubrious ink." [...] By then, Sfarmă-Piatrăs allies at Vremea also took distance from Crainic and rallied with Codreanu, accusing the former of [...] "amok" [...] and [...] "megalomania". Crainic also fell out with Curentul. In 1937, Gregorian's articles in Sfarmă-Piatră openly accused Curentul editor Pamfil Șeicaru {{of being a}} habitual blackmailer, land speculator and gang leader.|$|E
2500|$|Five of {{the songs}} on Armageddon are written by Sebastian alone, while the others {{have at least one}} co-writer. Sebastian began writing songs which appear on the album almost two years before its release, and {{performed}} two of them, [...] "Summer Love" [...] and [...] "Keeper", while touring as a support act on Lionel Richie's Australian and New Zealand tour in March 2011. Both are pop songs, with [...] "Keeper" [...] having a reggae feel. [...] "Summer Love" [...] is about bittersweet feelings for a lost love, and [...] "Keeper" [...] is about finding that special love, the one who is a keeper. [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy", released as the lead single in November 2012, is an upbeat pop song Sebastian wrote after he encountered an angry motorist in Los Angeles. Discussing the inspiration for the track he explained he could sometimes be caught up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> [...] "glass half empty" [...] in his life, and wrote the song as a reminder to himself and hopefully to others that life is too short to stress about the small things. Sebastian showcased two more songs, [...] "Amnesia" [...] and [...] "Armageddon", at the [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] media launch in December 2011. [...] "Amnesia" [...] is a soulful pop ballad about the anguish of coping with a broken relationship. Sebastian says of the power ballad [...] "Armageddon", [...] "The title track might sound pretty dark, but it's actually about not taking love for granted, and living like tomorrow is the last day on earth".|$|E

60|$|Arrived {{within the}} wall, {{we found the}} usual village sights and life. We moved along a narrow, crooked lane which had been paved in the Middle Ages. A strapping, ruddy girl was beating flax or some such stuff <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a good-box of a barn, and she swung her flail with a will--if it was a flail; I was not farmer {{enough to know what}} she was at; a frowsy, barelegged girl was herding half a dozen geese with a stick--driving them along the lane and keeping them out of the dwellings; a cooper was at work in a shop which I know he did not make so large a thing as a {{hogshead}} in, for there was not room. In the front rooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning, and ducks and chickens were waddling in and out, over the threshold, picking up chance crumbs and holding pleasant converse; a very old and wrinkled man sat asleep before his door, with his chin upon his breast and his extinguished pipe in his lap; soiled children were playing in the dirt everywhere along the lane, unmindful of the sun.|$|E

The skin-flint skipper carried no medicine; the water--shocking stuff it was--was getting so low, that there was only a pint a day served out to each, and though all of us Alcestes clubbed every drop we could spare for him--it was bad work! Owen and I never were more glad in our lives than when we heard we were to cast anchor at the Loyalty Isles! Such a place as it was! You little know what it was to see anything green! And there was this isle fringed down close to the sea with cocoa-nut trees! And the bay as clear!--you could see every shell, and wonderful fishes swimming in it! Well, every one was for going ashore, and some of the natives swam out to us, and brought things in their canoes, but not many; it is not encouraged by the mission, nor by David--for those Yankee traders are not the most edifying society--and the crew vowed they were cannibals, and had eaten a man three years ago, so they all went ashore armed." ...|$|E

6000|$|By and by {{our kind}} guide {{had to stop}} at an {{intermediate}} farm; but he gave us full directions how to proceed, and we went on till it began to shower again pretty briskly, and we took refuge <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> old stone cottage, which, small as it was, had a greater antiquity than any mansion in America. The door was open, and as we approached, we saw several children gazing at us; and their mother, a pleasant-looking woman, who seemed rather astounded at the visit {{that was about to}} befall her, tried to draw a tattered curtain over a part of her interior, which she fancied even less fit to be seen than the rest. To say the truth, the house was not at all better than a pigsty; and while we sat there, a pig came familiarly to the door, thrust in his snout, and seemed surprised that he should he driven away, instead of being admitted as one of the family. The floor was of brick; there was no ceiling, but only the peaked gable overhead. The room was kitchen, parlor, and, I suppose, bedroom for the whole family; at all events, there was only the tattered curtain between us and the sleeping accommodations. The good woman either could not or would not speak a word of English, only laughing when S----- said, [...] "Dim Sassenach?" [...] but she was kind and hospitable, and found a chair for each of us. She had been making some bread, and the dough was on the dresser. Life with these people is reduced to its simplest elements. It is only a pity that they cannot or do not choose to keep themselves cleaner. Poverty, except in cities, need not be squalid. When the shower abated a little, we gave all the pennies we had to the children, and set forth again. By the by, there were several colored prints stuck up against the walls, and there was a clock ticking in a corner and some paper-hangings pinned upon the slanting roof.|$|E

I mean, doesn't everybody wish that somebody was going to sing this about them? And the song is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different for me. It's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> vulnerable ... basically saying, 'I can't believe I have you, and everybody else thinks you're amazing, but you're all mine.' I love the fact that it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different. It's something that songs have said forever -- 'I love you' -- but it's said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different way, and I thought that was really cool." ...|$|R
