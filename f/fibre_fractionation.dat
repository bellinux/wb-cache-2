40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on pressure screen and hydrocyclone performance. The general contradictory interrelationships between capacity and selectivity in pressure screening and cleaning are commonly recognized, but deep understanding of the effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the state of operation is missing. As separation selectivity is closely dependent on thickening and pulp passage, an operation curve for separation was applied and its application further developed to examine the parameters affecting pressure screen and hydrocyclone separation. New information was found on the geometry of the screen plate, furnish quality parameters in pressure screen <b>fibre</b> <b>fractionation,</b> and the hydrocyclone separation of fibres, sand and gases. The capacity increases achieved by changes in the wire screen plate geometry were found to be achieved at the cost of separation selectivity in probability screening. The capacity of the screen plate was affected by the flow on the screen plate and through it. The hydraulic resistance both in the forward and reverse flow directions was found to be of great importance for the capacity of the screen plate. Previously unreported knowledge was found regarding the effects of wire width, height and shape. Pressure screening capacity was found to decrease with increasing fibre length, fibre network strength and flocculation. Pressure screen <b>fibre</b> <b>fractionation</b> selectivity was increased by broadening of the fibre length distribution of the feed furnish. The furnish properties also affected the separation selectivity of fibres, sand and gases in the hydrocyclone. An increase in fibre network strength reduced the separation selectivity of the hydrocyclone separation of fibres and sand. Any increase in the specific surface area, and especially in the amount of fines, was found to make gas removal more challenging. It was concluded that a broader range of the specific surface distribution can increase the selectivity of <b>fibre</b> <b>fractionation</b> in the hydrocyclone. Knowledge of the general effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the performance of pressure screen and hydrocyclone separation was deepened as a result of this work, which provides a framework for studying these effects further in pursuit of the general {{objective of}} maximizing capacity and selectivity while minimizing energy and investment costs...|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{improved}} deresination of sulphite pulps were evaluated, namely, alkaline washing, enzyme treatment, and pulp fractionation. Alkaline washing appears {{to come at}} a high cost, because caustic is expensive and affects cellulose chain length, as indicated by lower viscosity of the pulps. Thus {{this is not a}} viable option for pulps that are sensitive to changes in viscosity. Enzyme treatment did not completely degrade the glycerides under the mill conditions used. <b>Fibre</b> <b>fractionation</b> studies showed that the fines fractions contained 8 to 13 times more residual lipophilic extractives than the whole pulps. Removing this fraction, which represents {{only a small percentage of}} the whole pulp, could reduce by about a half the amount of lipophilic extractives in the remaining pulp. Thus pulp fractionation appears to be a viable option to achieve further deresination of sulphite pulps...|$|E
40|$|Localised axial {{consistency}} profiles {{within a}} pressure screen of a Pinus Radiata kraft pulp are reported. Axial Samples were also analysed using a Kajaani FS- 200 to obtain fibre length distribution data. Localised {{consistency in the}} feed annulus was found to vary considerably and the consistency {{was found to be}} less than the feed consistency over some portions of the screen (annular dilution). Changes in consistency along the accept side was fairly constant although subtle changes were observed. Pulp passage ratios for both the bulk and individual fibre length fractions were calculated using the consistency profiles and fibre length data. In all cases fibre passage decreased along the screen length. Fibre passage was affected by a position effect which is comprised of two factors: flocculation effects, and flow and rotor effects. <b>Fibre</b> <b>fractionation</b> efficiency was found to increase {{along the length of the}} screen. Mechanisms that account for the observed annular dilution, passage ratio and efficiency changes are proposed. These involve flow of both fluid and fibre in the forward and reverse directions across the screen plate, increased flocculation in the feed annulus and the slip velocity between incoming pulp and the rotor tip...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates a {{fractionation}} {{method of}} cellulosic fibres in dry state. Although processing of cellulosic fibres in airstream has been utilised for decades in airlaid processes, no attempts to fractionate fibres in dry state have been reported. Our main {{goal is to}} determine how fibre properties and fibre consistency affect fibre flocculation and thus the behaviour of <b>fibres</b> in <b>fractionation.</b> Also evaluations of quality and capacity of fractionation operation are made. Pulp flocculation behaviour is measured with digital imaging and image recognition technique {{before and after the}} fractionation device. A double-view, orthogonal imaging approach is applied obtaining statistics of three-dimensional shape, dimensions and coordinates of detected fibre flocs. Fraction and fibre properties are determined with Metso Fractionator and Metso Fiberlab. Results show that fibre behaviour in a given system strongly depends on the pulp properties. Flocculation was found to be strongly dependent on fibre consistency. Evaluation of fractionation operation was done with help of calculations of mass-reject rates and separation efficiencies. Calculations showed that highest separation efficiencies can be achieved with system when mass-reject rate is between 0. 30 an...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantitative}} analysis of organic compounds on submicron particulate matter (PM 1) collected on quartz filters was developed. The compounds analyzed encompassed C 22 -C 35 alkanes, {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), quinones, levoglucosan, cis-pinonic acid and short chain dicarboxylic acids such as malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, suberic, azelaic, malic and phthalic acids. The method included extraction with a pressure liquid extraction system, sample filtration though glass <b>fibre</b> filter, <b>fractionation</b> by high performance liquid chromatography and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The study of the extraction efficiency of different solvent mixtures showed that DCM:MeOH 1 : 1 was the one providing the highest recoveries for all compounds. Extraction temperatures of 100 °C provided better results than 60 °C or 80 °C. This method provided comparable extraction efficiency and qualitative and quantitative data to those involving Soxhlet extraction. Method recoveries for alkanes, most PAH, quinones and polar compounds calculated from spiked real samples were 52 - 72 %, 78 - 101 %, 50 - 62 % and 76 - 104 %, respectively, reproducibilities were 2 - 28 %, 7 - 29 %, 10 - 27 % and 5 - 28 %, respectively, limits of quantification were 0. 01 - 0. 1 ng/m 3, 0. 01 - 0. 27 ng/m 3, 0. 04 ng/m 3 and 0. 32 - 2. 8 ng/m 3, respectively, which affords the quantification of a broad number of primary and secondary organic constituents of submicron aerosols. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} shortage of raw materials, traditionally used for {{production of wood}} based panels and other composite materials, {{there is a growing}} call for the use of raw materials from agricultural production. Hemp shive, a by-product of hemp straw processing, is in eager demand due to its wood-like material properties. In order to be suitable for industrial use, respective agricultural raw material must be competitive in price, as well as be available in respective quantity and quality. ATB has developed a new processing technology for the cleaning of shive-fibre mixes for better accommodation such requirements. Ultimate goal is the generation of dust and fibre free shives as well as the recovering of high quality short <b>fibres</b> from shive <b>fractionation.</b> This is facilitated by a new type of axial fractionators, which utilizes a multi-stage paddle screw and a screen drum, corresponding with the screw. This allows classification and cleaning of the shives as well as recovering of the short fibres in only one processing step. Finished products are widely dust and fibre-free, high value shives; and shive-free short fibres. The shives can be used for the production of particle boards without further preparation. The recovered short fibres are mainly suitable for the use as reinforcing fibres in composite materials due to their short fibre length (< 50 mm). In cooperation with a machine engineering company, the design of the developed axial fractionator shall b...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocyclones {{can be used}} to {{fractionate}} fibres {{according to}} their papermaking potential. The obtained fractions typically differ in fibre wall thickness and/or degree of fibre treatment. Despite a multitude of potential application scenarios, the process has so far had little commercial success. This is largely explained by the low fractionation efficiency and unfavourable operating characteristics of the process. The fractionation efficiency of a hydrocyclone is closely related to its flow field. The influence of pulp concentration on the tangential velocity field was therefore studied, by using a self-cleaning pitometer. It was found that the pulp concentration had a strong influence on the tangential velocity. At a feed pulp concentration above 7. 5 g/l, the suspension rotated almost as a solid body. As a consequence, the magnitude of radial acceleration and shear stresses decreased dramatically. It is suggested that this is detrimental to the fractionation efficiency. The radial velocity field was measured using an Ultrasonic Velocity Profiler. The measurements showed that the rotational centre of the flow field did not correspond with the geometrical centre of the hydrocyclone. This displacement caused the tangential velocity component of the vortex to contribute substantially to the measurement result of the radial velocity component. Based on the findings in respect to the flow field studies, a novel design for a <b>fibre</b> <b>fractionation</b> hydrocyclone was proposed. The flow field inside this hydrocyclone was compared to that in a conventional hydrocyclone. It was found, that high radial acceleration and shear stresses could be maintained in the novel design even at high fibre concentration. The fractionation efficiency of the novel hydrocyclone was characterised in terms of surface roughness difference between fine and coarse fraction. When operated with refined bleached softwood kraft pulp, the novel hydrocyclone could produce fractions with a substantial surface roughness difference without deteriorating the dewatering characteristics of the fine fraction. A low thickening of the reject is proposed to be the explanation for that. When fractionating TMP, the best efficiency occurred at a concentration of 10 g/l. QC 2010080...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of ethanol industry {{for use as}} an alternative motor fuel has been steadily increasing {{around the world for}} several reasons. In South Africa, this industry is still {{in the early stages of}} development. In the National Biofuels Industrial Strategy, the South African government has made provision for support mechanisms to encourage investment in bioethanol production. There is thus an opportunity for grain-growing farmers to cultivate available or marginal lands for bioethanol crops, including triticale. This article examines the contribution of parametric uncertainty to economic feasibility studies for biomass-to-ethanol process plants. Monte Carlo (stochastic variable) simulation is employed as a tool to determine probability distributions for economic indicators (such as NPV and ROI) in the context of a proposed 200, 000 tonnes per annum triticale grain ethanol plant located in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Three process technology scenarios are considered: a conventional starch-to-ethanol plant (Scenario I), an advanced starch-to-ethanol with grain <b>fibre</b> <b>fractionation</b> and energy recovery (Scenario II) and an integrated starch-cellulose plant where fractionated fibre is converted to fermentable sugars by pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis and then fermented to fuel alcohol (Scenario III). By modelling prices of raw materials and products stochastically, based on historical data, the concurrent fluctuations in prices are accounted for, incorporating a quantifiable measure of the associated financial risk to a typical (deterministic) economic prefeasibility analysis. Risk assessment of all processing options reveals that Scenario II is the most preferred fermentation process, achieving very high probability of economic success (98 % probability of NPV > 0), suggesting that, under almost all conceivable circumstances of price fluctuation and plant availability, the investment will be successful. This is followed by Scenario III (96 % probability of NPV > 0) while the least preferred option is Scenario I (93 % probability of NPV > 0). The study also shows, however that without government subsidy, the plant exhibits only a 19 % chance of economic success. Economic performance is shown to improve when fast-growing biomass is used to replace electricity as a fuel source for process heating. Monte Carlo simulation could assist energy planners, investors, and policy/decision makers to make a better management decision by identifying possible public policy that could be used to enhance the economic viability of the proposed ethanol plant. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Pressure screens {{are used}} for {{contaminant}} removal and <b>fibre</b> length <b>fractionation</b> {{in the production of}} pulp and paper products. Axial variations and entry effects in the screen are known to occur and these variations have not been adequately quantified. This thesis describes a fundamental study of the axial variations of several factors that occur within an industrial pressure screen; namely, pulp consistency, fibre length distribution, rotor pressure pulse, and feed annulus tangential velocity. Axial variations of pulp consistency in the screen annulus and the accept chamber of the screen were studied using an internal radial sampling method. Localised pulp samples were taken and evaluated and common measures of screen performance such as fibre passage ratio and fractionation efficiency were calculated along the screen. Consistency generally increased {{along the length of the}} screen although under certain conditions the consistency toward the front of the screen was lower than the feed consistency. A two passage ratio model that incorporated forward and reverse passage ratio was derived to elucidate the flow of both fibre and fluid through the screen and their effects on overall screen performance. The passage of fibre through the screen decreased with screen length which generally had a positive effect on the fractionation efficiency toward the back of the screen. The passage of individual fibre length fractions was also studied and it was found that long fibre had a much lower passage than short fibre which caused the average fibre length in the annulus to increase. Rotor induced pressure pulse variations along the screen length were also investigated. The magnitude of the pressure pulse was significantly lower (up to 40 %) at the rear of the screen. The variation in pressure caused by the rotor is due to a Venturi effect and the shape of the rotor. The relative velocity of the fluid and the rotor, called the slip factor, also directly affects the size of the pressure pulse in the annulus. The slip factor decreases along the length of the screen due to the increase in tangential velocity of the fluid. Pressure pulse data was also used to estimate the instantaneous aperture velocity and back-flush ratio. The instantaneous aperture velocity was calculated to vary considerably from the superficial aperture velocity by up to 5 m/s in the forward direction and 10 m/s in the reverse direction. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to model tangential velocity changes in simplified screen annuli with axial through flow. For a smooth screen rotor the mean tangential velocity increased over the entire length of the annulus without reaching a maximum value. A step and bump rotor were modelled and the shape of the pressure pulses showed good agreement with experimentally measured pulses. The mean tangential velocity and the entrance length were found to be heavily dependant on the screen rotor used...|$|R
