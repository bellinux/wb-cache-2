40|$|Dehydration {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality. Dehydration risk increases with advancing age, and will progressively become an issue as the aging population increases. Worldwide, those aged 60 years and over are the fastest growing segment of the population. The study aimed to develop a clinically practical means to identify dehydration amongst older people in the clinical care setting. Older people aged 60 years or over admitted to the Geriatric and Rehabilitation Unit (GARU) of two tertiary teaching hospitals were eligible for participation in the study. Ninety potential screening questions and 38 clinical parameters were initially tested on a single sample (n= 33) with the most promising 11 parameters selected to undergo further testing in an independent group (n= 86). Of the almost 130 variables explored, <b>tongue</b> <b>dryness</b> was most strongly associated with poor hydration status, demonstrating 64 % sensitivity and 62 % specificity within the study participants. The result was not confounded by age, gender or body mass index. With minimal training, inter-rater repeatability was over 90 %. This study identified <b>tongue</b> <b>dryness</b> as a potentially practical tool to identify dehydration risk amongst older people in the clinical care setting.

40|$|Due to {{an absence}} of {{published}} primary data, this study explores dehydration prevalence and the change in physiological parameters frequently used to assess dehydration (fluid deficit) in older hospitalized people, as no standard measurement method exists. This observational longitudinal cohort study recruited 43 people aged 60 years or over, voluntarily admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital's Geriatric and Rehabilitation Unit (GARU). Over 40 clinical, hematological and urinary biochemical parameters employed by medical officers during dehydration assessment, identified through literature, interviews and focus group were investigated. Short-term weight changes, intra- and inter-rater repeatability of dehydration assessments were completed to assess validation and precision of the clinician's clinical dehydration assessment. Systolic blood pressure drop on standing, sternal skin turgor, <b>tongue</b> <b>dryness</b> and body mass index (BMI) were associated with hydration status; demonstrated clinically meaningful differences between groups. BMI negatively confounded the association between dehydration and systolic blood pressure drop on standing. Physical, rather than biochemical, parameters more often identified mild dehydration. The findings challenge common expectations of hematological and physiological measurement changes occurring in older people clinically assessed as dehydrated and emphasize the need to adjust for potential confounders during exploration of the associations of clinical parameters with dehydration status. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscoelasticity}} and secretion rate of {{stimulated saliva}} depends {{on food and}} beverage related stimuli, and it is demonstrated that this may subsequently influence the sensory properties and particularly the mouthfeel and after feel associated with the product being consumed. Using saliva donated by twelve volunteers, it is shown that acidic beverages such as peach flavoured iced tea and a fizzy cola stimulate significantly higher flow rates of whole mouth saliva that has greater elasticity in comparison to that generated following stimulation by water. In comparison, mechanical action from chewing flavourless gum and the stimulation from sucking a mint also stimulate high flow rates of saliva, although it is significantly less elastic than that from acid-based stimuli. However, the viscosity of human whole mouth saliva is relatively insensitive to beverage type, chewing, or mint. It is speculated that the stimulation of highly elastic saliva in response to acidic beverages is a defence mechanism for protecting the teeth from acid erosion. A separate sensory panel was used to identify key mouthfeel attributes {{that are likely to}} be related to the response of saliva, including: <b>tongue</b> <b>dryness,</b> mouth moistness, amount of saliva, tongue sensation, and throat drying. These results indicate that saliva viscoelasticity and flow rate alter dramatically in response to what a consumer eats and drinks, and that this in turn may affect mouthfeel and other organoleptic properties.

50|$|Symptoms of ML I {{are either}} present at birth or develop {{within the first}} year of life. In many infants with ML I, {{excessive}} swelling throughout the body is noted at birth. These infants are often born with coarse facial features, such as a flat nasal bridge, puffy eyelids, enlargement of the gums, and <b>excessive</b> <b>tongue</b> size (macroglossia). Many infants with ML I are also born with skeletal malformations such as hip dislocation. Infants often develop sudden involuntary muscle contractions (called myoclonus) and have red spots in their eyes (cherry red spots). They are often unable to coordinate voluntary movement (called ataxia). Tremors, impaired vision, and seizures also occur in children with ML I. Tests reveal abnormal enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and spleen (splenomegaly) and extreme abdominal swelling. Infants with ML I generally lack muscle tone (hypotonia) and have mental retardation that is either initially or progressively severe. Many patients suffer from failure to thrive and from recurrent respiratory infections. Most infants with ML I die before the age of 1 year.|$|R

40|$|An <b>excessive</b> cold <b>tongue</b> {{error in}} the {{equatorial}} Pacific has prevailed in several generations of climate models. However, the causes of this problem remain a mystery, partly owing to uncertainty and/or a lack of observational datasets. Based on the multimodel ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5), this study introduces a novel intermodel approach to identify the bias source by going beyond comparison with observational datasets. Intermodel statistics show that the <b>excessive</b> cold <b>tongue</b> bias could {{be traced back to}} a too strong oceanic dynamic cooling linked to a too shallow thermocline along the equatorial Pacific. A heat budget analysis suggests that the excessive oceanic dynamic cooling is balanced by the surface latent heat flux (LHF) adjustment. This is consistent with a variety of oceanic and atmospheric observations but at odds with the popular objectively analyzed air-sea heat fluxes (OAFlux) products. Further analyses suggest an alarming overestimation of OAFlux net surface heat flux (Q(net)) into the tropical Pacific, mainly ascribed to observational uncertainly in air specific humidity. Implications for intermodel statistics in assessing model processes, validating observational data, and regulating future climate projections are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{effective}} single intraoral, minimally invasive technique to reduce the enlarged tongue base in children with obstructive macroglossia. Methods: We present the anatomic dissection of fresh cadavers and a representative case series of children who under-went submucosal minimally invasive lingual excision (SMILE) with a plasma-mediated radiofrequency device (cobla-tion) under intraoral ultrasonic and endoscopic guidance. Multiple anatomic dissections determined the relative location of the hypoglossal nerve and lingual neurovascular bundle in relation to removable tongue base musculature. A pediatric case series demonstrates the straightforward SMILE technique. Results: Laboratory anatomic dissection and clinical lingual ultrasonography revealed the surgical safety borders for SMILE. The surgical safety and efficacy of SMILE is demonstrated by preoperative and postoperative clinical exami-nations and polysomnograms in children with obstructive macroglossia (such as Beckwith-Wiedemann and Down syn-dromes and tongue vascular malformation). Coblation submucosally removes <b>excessive</b> <b>tongue</b> base tissue through a small anterior tongue incision. SMILE was performed without excessive pain, bleeding, edema, infection, or tongue dysfunction. Conclusions: SMILE is an effective novel operation that incorporates coblation with ultrasonography and endoscopic guidance for children who need tongue base reduction. Anatomic dissection and clinical cases demonstrate the potential for aggressive yet relatively safe tissue removal by this minimally invasive technique. SMILE also has significant poten-tial for adults with obstructive sleep apnea due to a large tongue base.

5000|$|A nasopharyngeal airway is a {{soft rubber}} or plastic tube that is {{passed through the}} nose and into the {{posterior}} pharynx. Nasopharyngeal airways are produced in various lengths and diameters to accommodate for gender and anatomical variations. Functionally, the device is gently inserted through a patient's nose after careful lubrication with a viscous lidocaine gel. Successful placement will facilitate spontaneous ventilation, masked ventilation, or machine assisted ventilation with a modified nasopharyngeal airway designed with special attachments at the proximal end. Patients generally tolerate NPAs very well. NPAs are preferred over OPAs when the patient's jaw is clenched or if the patient is semiconscious and cannot tolerate an OPA. NPAs, however, are generally not recommended if there is suspicion of a fracture {{to the base of}} the skull. In these circumstances, insertion of the NPA can cause neurological damage by entering the cranium during placement. There is no consensus, however, regarding the risk of neurological damage secondary to a basilar skull fracture compared to hypoxia due to insufficient airway management. Other complications of Nasopharyngeal airways use includes laryngospasm, epistaxis, vomiting, and tissue necrosis with prolonged use.Oropharyngeal airways are curved, rigid plastic devices, inserted into the patient's mouth. Oropharyngeal airways are produced in various lengths and diameters to accommodate for gender and anatomical variations. It is especially useful in patients with <b>excessive</b> <b>tongue</b> and other soft tissues. OPAs prevent airway obstruction by ensuring that the patient's tongue does not obstruct the epiglottis by creating a conduit. Because an oropharyngeal airway can mechanically stimulate the gag reflex, it should only be used in a deeply sedated or unresponsive patient to avoid vomiting and aspiration [...] Careful attention must be made while inserting an OPA. The user must avoid pushing the tongue further down the patient's throat. This is usually done by inserting the OPA with its curve facing cephalad and rotating it 180 degrees as you enter the posterior pharynx.|$|R

30|$|According to Italian Ministerial Guidelines [22, 23], it is {{recommended}} to encourage breastfeeding, {{in order to promote}} more normal jaw development. In fact, proper labial and lingual posture, adequate nasal breathing, and correct transverse diameter of the palate are related to natural breastfeeding. Artificial feeding may promote malocclusion, when combined with non-nutritive sucking or with rhinitis; in fact, bottle-fed children can develop sucking habits more frequently than others. Non-nutritive sucking, together with allergic rhinitis, seems {{to be the most important}} factor for the development of a posterior crossbite in children under 5  years [22, 23]. It is also recommended to discourage non-nutritive sucking at 2  years of age, in order to definitively stop the habit by 3  years of age. Beyond 3  years, non-nutritive sucking is implicated in malocclusions, such as anterior open bite, posterior crossbite, and Class II molar relationship. It is also recommended to monitor patients with low posture of the tongue and mouth breathing, in order to prevent dental open bite and <b>excessive</b> mandibular growth. <b>Tongue</b> thrusting and an abnormal tongue position may be associated with anterior open bite, speech difficulties, and anterior protrusion of the upper incisors [22, 23].|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dehydration {{in the older}} person admitted to hospital {{has been associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. In spite of the high US hospital mortality and morbidity rates associated with dehydration (although presumably not the only contributing factor), no standardised or validated approach to assess or easily screen for dehydration in the hospital setting is reported in the international literature. Therefore, a series of studies was undertaken to assess the extent of this, and to identify other gaps in the current literature. The first study estimated the dehydration prevalence amongst older people upon admission to geriatric and rehabilitation unit in the Australian setting to estimate the morbidity burden in the Australian context. The second study assessed the application of dilution and bio-electrical impedance (BIA) techniques as alternative means to assess dehydration in the clinical setting. The third study undertook to validate against total body water the parameters required to confirm dehydration and to identify those that contribute little to discrimination. The final study integrated the information from the first two studies to identify a clinically practical, sensitive and specific screen suitable for the identification of those at risk of dehydration in a geriatric and rehabilitation unit. Older people aged 60 years or over admitted to the Geriatric and Rehabilitation Unit (GARU) of a tertiary teaching hospital in Brisbane. Australia, were eligible for participation in the study. Individuals were excluded if: involuntarily admitted, informed consent was not obtained, younger than 60 years or fitted with a pacemaker (due to contraindication with the use of BIA). Of 82 GARU participants approached, 43 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and consented, 21 declined and 18 were ineligible. Thirty-five (35) of the 43 were able {{to be involved in the}} assessment of prevalence. The studies in this thesis provide original insights into dehydration including prevalence, body water contents, useful clinical assessment and screening parameters. Results showed that dehydration prevalence amongst older people is substantially underreported in the Australian geriatric and rehabilitation unit setting (17. 1 %) when compared to the reported through coding from the medical record (5. 3 %). The presence of dehydration has frequently been measured in healthy populations by assessing total body water loss through short-term weight change. Gold standard dilution and bio-electrical impedance techniques were used to assess body water as the assessment of dehydration by weight change has practical and ethical limitations in the clinical setting for either research or assessment applications. Gold standard dilution studies and the bio-electrical impedance technique were not confirmed to be either practical or valid alternates to assess dehydration in the clinical setting. Weight and body mass index (BMI) confounded the association between body water and dehydration. Good agreement (78 - 87 %) of global clinical dehydration assessment (clinical assessment) was confirmed between the study's medical officer and the consultants of the Geriatric and Rehabilitation Unit (GARU) and thus become the alternate dependant variable. Although the optimal combination of parameters for clinical dehydration assessment was unable to be elucidated, clinically significant changes upon mild dehydration were more apparent with physical as opposed to biochemical parameters. BMI confounded the association between dehydration and some physical measurements, such as the drop in systolic blood pressure on standing and skin turgor. Of all the clinical assessment and screening variables explored, <b>tongue</b> <b>dryness</b> was validated and represents a practical, sensitive (64 %) and specific (62 %) dehydration screen suitable for use with all older people in a geriatric and rehabilitation unit setting. Dehydration was established to be more prevalent amongst older Australians admitted to hospital than previously acknowledged or identified by hospitals. The finding identifies dehydration as a significant clinical issue considering the ageing Australian population, limited health resources and the association of dehydration with increased morbidity and mortality. The validation of the simple dehydration screen will contribute to the identification and treatment of dehydration. Although the highest sensitivity and specificity is always desired for screening, it is not always achieved. Moderate sensitivity results in more people being identified at risk by the screen than confirmed to be dehydrated through clinical assessment. Moderate specificity results in the screen's failure to identify those who would be clinically assessed with dehydration. Moderate sensitivity and specificity necessitates the assessment of more people than those with the condition and results in other people with the condition of interest not being identified. Each situation is reduced with increasing levels of sensitivity and specificity. A valid and simple dehydration screen provides future opportunities to confirm improved clinical (prevent adverse events, improve or stabilise disease), cost (reduce intensity of care, hospital stay) and client (death, disability) outcomes as a result of improved identification and timely and appropriate treatment. New insights are provided into individual clinical assessment measures as well as valid and reliable screening. A number of recommendations and future dehydration studies are discussed. The key recommendation for future studies is to discern between intracellular and intravascular volume depletion to enable investigation of an homogenous sample. Further studies are needed to also establish optimal dehydration prevention methods (e. g. awareness and positioning of fluids, beverage carts) and provide evidence that hydration support enhances primary (e. g. morbidity and mortality) and secondary (e. g. cognitive or functional measures, quality of life) health outcomes. Through responsive systems in health delivery, dehydration amongst older hospitalised people can be identified, better managed if present, and avoided with suitable treatment...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Associated {{with the}} double ITCZ (Inter-tropical {{convergence}} zone) problem, a dipole SST bias pattern (cold in the equatorial central Pacific and {{warm in the}} southeast tropical Pacific) remains a common problem in current coupled models. Based on a newly-developed model, we demonstrated that a serious consequence of this SST bias is to suppress the thermocline feedback in El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulation. Firstly, the <b>excessive</b> cold <b>tongue</b> extension pushes the anomalous convection far westward, diminishing the convection-low level wind feedback and thus the air-sea coupling strength. Secondly, the equatorial surface wind anomaly exhibits weak meridional gradient, leading to a weakened wind-thermocline feedback. Thirdly, the equatorial cold SST bias induces a weakened upper-ocean stratification, yielding the underestimation of the thermocline-subsurface temperature feedback. Finally, the dipole SST bias underestimates the mean upwelling through both dynamic and thermodynamic effects. In recent decades, El Niño events have occurred more frequently over the equatorial central Pacific (CP Warming, CPW). Here, we ascribe this predominance of the CPW to a dramatic decadal change in the Pacific mean state and annual cycle. The mean state change characterized by a decadal La Niña-like pattern tends to anchor convection and surface zonal wind anomalies to {{the vicinity of the}} dateline, facilitating surface warming to occur in the CP. The annual cycle change, with the trade winds intensifying during boreal winter and spring, prevents the warming development but helps the warming decay in the EP. More CPW events are expected in the coming decade if the La-Niña-like pattern persists. The western North Pacific (WNP) Subtropical High (SH) has profound impacts on Asian summer monsoon, North Pacific storms. The cause of the interannual variability of WNPSH, however, remains controversial. Here we show that the anomalous WNPSH is primarily determined by a remote cooling/warming in the equatorial central Pacific and a positive thermodynamic feedback between the local circulation and a dipole sea surface temperature in the Indo-Pacific warm pool. We demonstrate that a physical-empirical prediction model built on these physical understandings has comparable performance with those of three state-of-the-art coupled climate models in re-forecast of the strength of the WNPSH...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Decreased salivation (sialopenia, hyposialia, hyposalivation) causes drying of {{the oral}} cavity mucosa (xerostomia) and makes it prone to fungal infections. Aim of the study: 1. To {{determine}} the prevalence of fungi in the oral cavity in patients with xerostomia with or without objective hyposalivation. 2. To determine the susceptibility of isolated fungi strains to antifungal drugs. Material and methods: The material was obtained from 42 individuals with xerostomia who reported to the Department of Periodontology and Diseases of the Oral Mucosa at the Medical University of Lodz. The amount of stimulated and unstimulated saliva was measured; the material collected for mycological examination consisted of mouth rinses, with a simultaneous application of Sabouraud liquid medium. Strain differentiating methods developed at the Department of Biology and Parasitology, the Medical University of Lodz were adopted in this examination. Then in vitro sensitivity of the obtained strains to nystatin, miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole was evaluated using a disc method. Results: The most frequently reported symptoms were: burning <b>tongue,</b> 24 -hour <b>dryness,</b> and idiopathic pain {{of the oral}} mucosa. The mycological examination revealed the presence of fungi in the oral cavity in 92. 9 % of patients with objective xerostomia and in 85. 7 % of patients with subjective xerostomia; a statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the groups (p&#x 003 C; 0. 05). C. albicans (81. 1 %) was the most frequently detected species; other species were observed only in individual cases. The greatest number of isolated strains of all species were sensitive to miconazole and nystatin, and the least number – to fluconazole (statistically significant differences; p&#x 003 C; 0. 05). Conclusions: 1. Hyposecretion of saliva causes an increase in the prevalence of Candida species in the oral cavity and the development of the pseudomembranous candidosis. 2. These cases should be primarily treated with locally acting antifungal drugs (miconazole, nystatin) to which fungal strains are highly sensitive. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} oral {{health status of}} Chinese hospitalised {{geriatric}} patients and identify its impacts on their oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Design: Cross-sectional correlational study. Setting: Geriatric wards of a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Subjects: A consecutive sample of Chinese hospitalised geriatric patients (N = 155) aged ≥ 65 years who were communicable. Measurements: The Brief Oral Health Status Examination (BOHSE) {{was used to evaluate}} oral status. The General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) was used to assess OHRQoL. Results: The oral health status of the Chinese hospitalised geriatric patients was fair, with the more prominent problems being decayed teeth, lack of occluded teeth, coated <b>tongue,</b> <b>excessive</b> tartar, dry and rough red oral tissue and diseased gum. The GOHAI score indicated their compromised OHRQoL. By using hierarchical regression analysis, fewer than eight pairs of occluding teeth (β = - 0. 33, P < 0. 001), unhealthy gum (β = - 0. 26, P = 0. 03) and perceived oral dryness (β = - 0. 18, P = 0. 04) significantly accounted for 17 % of variance in the OHRQoL of Chinese hospitalised geriatric patients. Conclusion: This study suggests that routine screening for dental and gum problems, providing adequate adaptation of denture prosthesis and reducing oral dryness of geriatric patients may be important care to optimise the OHRQoL of Chinese hospitalised geriatric patients. The study needs to be replicated in larger-scale multicentre settings and incorporate the use of more-comprehensive oral assessment indices. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.
