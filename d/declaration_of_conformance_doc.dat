40|$|Interoperability among {{telecommunications}} systems, {{possibly by}} different vendors, {{is essential for}} both the development of many telecommunications networks, and today's civilization development. Interoperability testing is very costly, as it has a complexity of (n** 2) for n systems, and somewhat informal. In this paper, we develop a 'Conformance Testing (CT) '-based formal technique to determine interoperability requirements/guarantees. It allows automated derivation of the interoperability' requirements of various networks {{as well as the}} interoperability guarantees among different telecommunications systems. This is achieved using static analysis <b>of</b> the <b>conformance</b> classes <b>of</b> the standard and knowledge of the implementation's degree <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> (<b>DoC)</b> <b>of</b> the telecommunications systems. Consequently, it results in a lot of cost saving {{in addition to being a}} formal technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Trajectory {{conformance}} monitoring {{is important}} for future air traffic control for reasons associated with optimal operation, increased safety, and improved efficiency. In this study conformance monitoring is considered with respect to preas-signed 4 D (space and time) trajectories and their margins (4 D contracts), and an adaptive time series probabilistic framework is postulated. Two problems are tackled and proper methods are developed: (a) present conformance monitoring and quality <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> evaluation via statistical tools, which leads to abnormal event detection, and (b) future conformance monitoring in which conformance is predicted ahead of time allowing for the early initiation of corrective actions. The framework is based on Recursive Integrated AutoRegressive (RIAR) modeling of contract deviations alone, with the underlying dynamics and non-stationarity accounted for. An initial assessment {{of the performance of}} the framework is based on two simulation scenarios. Through them, present conformance monitoring is shown to lead to quality assessment and the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> an alarm immediately following the emergence of an abnormal event. Future conformance monitoring is shown to lead to an early non-conformance alarm, with the lead time shown to be significantly longer than that achieved by a current probabilistic benchmark scheme.

40|$|Abstract. Conformance {{checking}} {{is becoming}} {{more important for the}} analysis of business processes. While the diagnosed results <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> checking tech-niques are used in diverse context such as enabling auditing and performance analysis, the quality and reliability <b>of</b> the <b>conformance</b> checking techniques them-selves have not been analyzed rigorously. As the existing conformance checking techniques heavily rely on the total ordering of events, their diagnostics are un-reliable and often even misleading when the timestamps of events are coarse or incorrect. This paper presents an approach to incorporate flexibility, uncertainty, concurrency and explicit orderings between events in the input {{as well as in the}} output <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> checking using partially ordered traces and partially or-dered alignments, respectively. The paper also illustrates various ways to acquire partially ordered traces from existing logs. In addition, a quantitative-based qual-ity metric is introduced to objectively compare the results <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> check-ing. The approach is implemented in ProM plugins and has been evaluated using artificial logs. ...|$|R

The problem of deciding whether an observed behaviour is acceptable is the oracle problem. When testing from a finite state machine (FSM) {{it is easy to}} solve the oracle problem and so it has received relatively little attention for FSMs. However, if the system under test has physically distributed interfaces, called ports, then in distributed testing we observe a local trace at each port and we compare the set of local traces with the set of allowed behaviours (global traces). This paper investigates the oracle problem for deterministic and non-deterministic FSMs and for two alternative definitions <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> for distributed testing. We show that the oracle problem can be solved in polynomial time for the weaker notion <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> but is NP-hard for the stronger notion <b>of</b> <b>conformance,</b> even if the FSM is deterministic. However, when testing from a deterministic FSM with controllable input sequences the oracle problem can be solved in polynomial time and similar results hold for nondeterministic FSMs. Thus, in some cases the oracle problem can be efficiently solved when using stronger notion <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> and where {{this is not the case}} we can use the decision procedure for weaker notion <b>of</b> <b>conformance</b> as a sound approximation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Even though {{generics}} {{became quite}} popular in mainstream objectoriented (OO) languages, approaches for checking at runtime the <b>conformance</b> <b>of</b> such programs against formal specifications still lack appropriate support.
