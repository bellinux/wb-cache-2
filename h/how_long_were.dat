No doubt these kept us alive, but even Higgs, who it may be remembered was a teetotaller, afterwards confessed {{to me that he}} has loathed the sight and taste of water ever since. Indeed he now drinks beer and wine like other people. It was torture; we could have eaten anything. In fact the Professor did manage to catch and eat a bat that got entangled in his red hair. He offered me a bite of it, I remember, and was most grateful when I declined.|$|E

Girls should be like daisies, nice and white, with an edge of red, if you look close, making the ground bright wherever they are, knowing simply and quietly that they do it, and are meant to do it and that it would be very wrong if they didn't do it.

60|$|My heart {{almost died}} within me; miserable longings {{strained}} its chords. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> the September days! How silent, how lifeless! How vast and void seemed the desolate premises! How gloomy the forsaken garden--grey {{now with the}} dust of a town summer departed. Looking forward at the commencement of those eight weeks, I hardly knew how I was to live to the end. My spirits had long been gradually sinking; now that the prop of employment was withdrawn, they went down fast. Even to look forward was not to hope: the dumb future spoke no comfort, offered no promise, gave no inducement to bear present evil in reliance on future good. A sorrowful indifference to existence often pressed on me--a despairing resignation to reach betimes {{the end of all}} things earthly. Alas! When I had full leisure to look on life as life must be looked on by such as me, I found it but a hopeless desert: tawny sands, with no green fields, no palm-tree, no well in view. The hopes which are dear to youth, which bear it up and lead it on, I knew not and dared not know. If they knocked at my heart sometimes, an inhospitable bar to admission must be inwardly drawn. When they turned away thus rejected, tears sad enough sometimes flowed: but it could not be helped: I dared not give such guests lodging. So mortally did I fear the sin and weakness of presumption.|$|E
60|$|Mendez and Fiesco had {{not long}} {{departed}} when the Spaniards in the wreck {{began to grow}} sickly, partly from the toils and exposures of the recent voyage, partly from being crowded in narrow quarters in a moist and sultry climate, and partly from want of their accustomed food, for they could not habituate themselves to the vegetable diet of the Indians. Their maladies were rendered more insupportable by mental suffering, by that suspense which frets the spirit, and that hope deferred which corrodes the heart. Accustomed {{to a life of}} bustle and variety, they had now nothing to do but loiter about the dreary hulk, look out upon the sea, watch for the canoe of Fiesco, wonder at its protracted absence, and doubt its return. A long time elapsed, much more than sufficient for the voyage, but nothing was seen or heard of the canoe. Fears were entertained that their messenger had perished. If so, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> they to remain here, vainly looking for relief which was never to arrive? Some sank into deep despondency, others became peevish and impatient. Murmurs broke forth, and, as usual with men in distress, murmurs of the most unreasonable kind. Instead of sympathizing with their aged and infirm commander, who was involved in the same calamity, who in suffering transcended them all, and yet who was incessantly studious of their welfare, they began to rail against him as the cause of all their misfortunes.|$|E

6000|$|We {{were told}} the other day--and {{this brings us to}} the root of policy--that there had been a {{momentary}} flash of courage in the Government, a momentary flash of courage when the Government of India and we here assented to the deportation of two men, and it is made a matter of complaint that they were released immediately. Well, they were not released immediately, but after six or eight months--I forget exactly how many months--of detention. They were there with no charge, no trial, nor intention of bringing them to trial. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> we to keep them there? Not a day, I answer, nor one hour, after the specific and particular mischief, with a view to which this drastic proceeding was adopted, had abated. Specific mischief, mind you. I will not go into that argument to-night: another day I will. I will only say one thing. To strain the meaning and the spirit of an exceptional law like the old Regulation of the year 1818 in such a fashion as this, what would it do? Such a strain, pressed upon us in the perverse imagination of headstrong men, is no better than a suggestion for provoking lawless and criminal reprisals. ("No.") You may not agree with me. You are kindly allowing me as your guest to say things with which perhaps you do not agree. (Cries of [...] "Go on.") After all, we understand one another--we speak the same language, and I tell you that a proceeding of that kind, indefinite detention, is a thing that would not be endured in this country. (A voice of [...] "Disorder.") Yes, if there were great and clear connection between the detention and the outbreak of disorder, certainly; but as the disorder had abated it would have been intolerable for us to continue the incarceration.|$|E
6000|$|The same {{politicians}} who throttle commerce at its neck, and threaten to confiscate trust-money, {{say that when}} the war is over, and the South is subdued, then {{the turn of the}} old country will come, and a direful retribution shall be taken for our conduct. This has been the cry all through the war. [...] "We should have conquered the South," [...] says an American paper which I read this very day, [...] "but for England." [...] Was there ever such puling heard from men who have an army of a million, and who turn and revile a people who have stood as aloof from their contest as we have from the war of Troy? Or is it an outcry made with malice prepense? And is the song of the New York Times a variation of the Herald tune?--"The conduct of the British in folding their arms and taking no part in the fight, has been so base that it has caused the prolongation of the war, and occasioned a prodigious expense on our part. Therefore, as we have British property in our hands, we &c. &c." [...] The lamb troubled the water dreadfully, and the wolf, in a righteous indignation, [...] "confiscated" [...] him. Of course we have heard that at an undisturbed time Great Britain would never have dared to press its claim for redress. Did the United States wait until we were at peace with France before they went to war with us last? Did Mr. Seward yield the claim which he confesses to be just, until he himself was menaced with war? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> the Southern gentlemen kept in prison? What caused them to be set free? and did the Cabinet of Washington see its error before or after the demand for redress?* The captor was feasted at Boston, and the captives in prison hard by. If the wrong-doer was to be punished, it was Captain Wilkes who ought to have gone into limbo. At any rate, as [...] "the Cabinet of Washington could not give its approbation to the commander of the 'San Jacinto,'" [...] why were the men not sooner set free? To sit at the Tremont House, and hear the captain after dinner give his opinion on international law, would have been better sport for the prisoners than the grim salle-a-manger at Fort Warren.|$|E
50|$|Irving Leitner {{quotes a}} story by Frank Blair, {{grandson}} of Francis P. Blair, one of Lincoln's political confidants:There were eight or ten of us, our ages ranging from eight to twelve years. Although I was but {{seven or eight years}} of age, Mr. Lincoln's visits were of such importance to us boys as to leave a clear impression on my memory. He drove out to the place quite frequently. We boys, {{for hours at a time}} played 'town ball' on the vast lawn, and Mr. Lincoln would join ardently in the sport. I remember vividly how he ran with the children; <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> his strides, and how far his coat-tails stuck out behind, and how we tried to hit him with the ball, as he ran the bases. He entered into the spirit of the play as completely as any of us, and we invariably hailed his coming with delight.|$|E

We asked each implant centre within the UK to describe their antibiotic protocol for cochlear implantation. Our results have showed that 100 % of UK implant surgeons use antibiotic prophylaxis. The type of antibiotic and duration vary significantly between centres. Interestingly, however, the regimes followed by most practices do not adhere to surgical principles of antibiotic prophylaxis...|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal {{research}} {{designs are}} relatively {{rare in the}} academic literature on rape and sexual assault despite their tremendous methodological rigor and scientific utility. In the interest of promoting wider use of such methods, we conducted a methodological review of projects that have used prospective longitudinal designs to study the occurrence of sexual victimization throughout the lifespan and/or {{the process of change}} during rape recovery (N = 32 projects). Five questions were examined: (a) What were the substantive foci of these longitudinal studies? (b) How were survivors recruited? (c) What participation rates were typical? (d) <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> participants followed over time and with what success rates? and (e) What incentives were used to increase participation? Most studies focused on postassault sequelae and recruited survivors from hospital emergency departments and other first-response help-seeking sites with highly variable participation rates.
