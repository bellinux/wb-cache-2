The objective of this work was to define optimal size, convenient sizes and suitable shape for <b>experimental</b> <b>plots</b> of Eremanthus erythropappus, for evaluation of main dendrometric characteristics in experimental plantations. To attain that, a uniformity trial was used containing 400 plants, all of which had circumference, height and volume measured. 31 combinations of size/shape were simulated for <b>experimental</b> <b>plots.</b> For determination of optimal size, three curvature methods and one method based on the segmented linear plateau model were used. For determination of suitable shape, the criterion of relative information and coefficient of variation was used. Convenient size was estimated by the Hatheway method. Results led {{to the conclusion that}} the size of <b>experimental</b> <b>plots</b> of candeia capable of allowing analysis of main dendrometric characteristics should be 60 useful plants, the most suitable shape being a rectangular configuration of 2 × 30 (rows × plants).

Although numerous {{studies suggest that}} in many cases populations across all organisms are limited by density-dependent processes, this conclusion often relies on correlative data. Here, using an experimental approach, we examined the effect of intraspecific competition on population regulation of the ant Aphaenogaster senilis. In this species females are philopatric while males disperse by flying over relatively long distances. All colonies were removed from 15 <b>experimental</b> <b>plots,</b> except for one focal colony in each plot, while 15 other plots remained unmanipulated. After the first reproductive season, nest density in the <b>experimental</b> <b>plots</b> returned to a level nonsignificantly different from that in the control plots, which was not expected if the populations were indeed regulated by density-independent phenomena. In both the control <b>plots</b> and the <b>experimental</b> <b>plots</b> colonies remained overdispersed throughout the experiment, suggesting colony mutual exclusion. Nests outside the plots rapidly extended their foraging span, but we did not detect any significant inward migration into the <b>experimental</b> <b>plots.</b> <b>Experimental</b> reduction in density did not significantly affect the focal colonies' biomass, measured just before the first reproductive season. However, the ratio of males to workers–pupae biomasses was smaller in <b>experimental</b> <b>plots,</b> suggesting that colonies there had redirected part of the resources normally allocated to male production to the production instead of new workers. Microsatellite analysis indicated that, after the reproductive season, many colonies in the <b>experimental</b> <b>plots</b> were headed by a young queen that was the mother of the brood but not of the old workers, indicating that reduction in colony density stimulated fission of the remaining colonies. Finally, {{at the end of the}} experiment, 14 months after experimental reduction in density, colonies that derived from fission were smaller in the experimental than in the control plots, suggesting that the former had undergone fission at a smaller size than in control plots, which presumably allowed them to colonize the emptied areas.

50|$|After Webber {{retired in}} 1929, Leon Dexter Batchelor became the second {{director}} of the CES. Under his direction, the land, capital facilities, and operating budget expanded significantly, and the station moved into several new areas of agricultural science, including statistics and <b>experimental</b> <b>plot</b> design, herbicides to reduce weeds, and the first studies {{of the effects of}} air pollution on crops. It was during this time that the station battled a mutation of Citrus tristeza virus, resulting in some 9000 trees (87% of the station's orchards) being destroyed in order to contain the outbreak. After Batchelor retired in 1951, Alfred M. Boyce became the new director, and the CES entered another period of growth as agricultural production in Southern California boomed after World War II. The old divisional structure was replaced along departmental lines, and five new departments were added, including the nation's first department of nematology. A committee on air pollution research was also developed in 1953.|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} of interactions between plants for pollination {{depends on the}} abundance of plants and pollinators in the community. The abundance of pollinators may influence plant associations and densities at which individual fitness is maximized. Reduced pollinator visitation may therefore affect the way plant species interact for pollination. We experimentally reduced pollinator visitation to six pollinator-dependent species (three from an alpine and three from a lowland community in Norway) to study how interactions for pollination were modified by reduced pollinator availability. We related flower visitation, pollen limitation and seed set to density of conspecifics and pollinator-sharing heterospecifics inside 30 dome-shaped cages partially covered with fishnet (<b>experimental</b> <b>plots)</b> and in 30 control plots. We expected to find stronger interactions between plants in experimental compared to controls plots. The experiment modified plant-plant interactions for pollination in all the six species; although for two of them neighbourhood interactions did not affect seed set. The pollen limitation and seed set data showed that reduction of pollinator visits most frequently resulted in novel and/or stronger interactions between plants in the <b>experimental</b> <b>plots</b> that did not occur in the controls. Although the responses were species-specific, there was a tendency for increasing facilitative interactions with conspecific neighbours in <b>experimental</b> <b>plots</b> where pollinator availability was reduced. Heterospecifics only influenced pollination and fecundity in species from the alpine community and in the <b>experimental</b> <b>plots,</b> where they competed with the focal species for pollination. The patterns observed for visitation rates differed from those for fecundity, with more significant interactions between plants in the controls in both communities. This study warns against the exclusive use of visitation data to interpret plant-plant interactions for pollination, and helps to understand how plant aggregations may buffer or intensify {{the effects of a}} pollinator loss on plant fitness. © 2014 The Authors.
