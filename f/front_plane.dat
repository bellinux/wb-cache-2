2500|$|For 1970, the Valiant {{was carried}} over with detail changes, {{including}} a new black plastic grille sculptured differently from 1969's metal item. The central portion protruded flush with the forward edge of the hood, while {{the remainder of the}} grille was set back from the <b>front</b> <b>plane.</b> The two-door sedan was dropped, replaced by the new Duster coupe. For all except export Valiants, the base 170 engine was replaced by a new [...] version of the Slant-6. The 198 gave better performance than the 170, and was less costly to make, since it used the same cylinder block as the 225. The Valiant was virtually unchanged for 1971; small revisions included removal of the center grille emblem and a new kind of finish treatment on the grille surround. It now had a blacked-out look instead of the previous argent silver treatment. For the 1970 and 1971 models, exterior and interior trim were slightly revised, and there were engineering changes for better driveability, improved soundproofing and decreased emissions, the latter in compliance with regulations mandated by the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implementing new devices such as an EGR valve and an activated charcoal evaporative emissions system. The 1971 Valiant eventually set sales records with 256,930 calendar year deliveries, so there was little motivation to change it for 1972. Only details of the taillights and grille were altered for the 1972 Valiants. New surface-mount sidemarker lamp-reflector units replaced the more costly previous flush-mount items.|$|E
50|$|The restyled Dart for 1967 {{featured}} a rear window with compound inverse curves. This created a unique {{appearance at the}} rear of the greenhouse, but tended to collect snow and created thick C-pillars that looked formal but created blindspots for drivers. Curved side glass was used for the first time on a Chrysler compact. Up front, there was a new dual-plane front end contour: the center section of the grille, bumper and leading edge of the hood were recessed from the <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> of the car. The single headlamps were placed forward of the recessed center section, defining the <b>front</b> <b>plane.</b> Park/turn lamps were set into the grille, in the corners formed by the transition area between the recessed and forward sections. This same front end treatment, with minor cosmetic changes to the grille and the park/turn lamps relocated to the front bumper, was also used by Chrysler Australia for their 1967 VE-model Valiant.|$|E

During sunset, the rays of the sun travel down through the front Gopura at the temple's entrance gate and through a small hole in the and travels across the <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> to fall directly onto the statue of Siva. The movement of the sun beam can be witnessed as it progresses across the front of the temple, making the lingam appear to glow.|$|E

Each paraxial plane wave component of the field in the <b>front</b> focal <b>plane</b> appears as a point spread function spot in the back focal plane, with an intensity and phase equal to the intensity and phase of the original plane wave component in the <b>front</b> focal <b>plane.</b> In other words, the field in the back focal plane is the Fourier transform of the field in the <b>front</b> focal <b>plane.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{distance}} {{scales on}} most medium- and small-format lenses indicate {{distance from the}} camera's image plane. Most DOF formulas, including those in this article, use the object distance [...] from the lens's <b>front</b> nodal <b>plane,</b> which often {{is not easy to}} locate. Moreover, for many zoom lenses and internal-focusing non-zoom lenses, the location of the <b>front</b> nodal <b>plane,</b> as well as focal length, changes with subject distance. When the subject distance is large in comparison with the lens focal length, the exact location of the <b>front</b> nodal <b>plane</b> is not critical; the distance is essentially the same whether measured {{from the front of the}} lens, the image plane, or the actual nodal plane. The same is not true for close-up photography; at unity magnification, a slight error in the location of the <b>front</b> nodal <b>plane</b> can result in a DOF error greater than the errors from any approximations in the DOF equations.|$|R
50|$|At this time, {{yet another}} land speed driver entered the fray. Englishman John Cobb, {{was hoping to}} reach 200 mph in his jet-powered Crusader. A radical design, the Crusader {{reversed}} the ‘three-pointer’ design, placing the floats {{at the rear of}} the hull. On 29 September 1952 Cobb tried to beat the world record on Loch Ness but, while travelling at an estimated speed of 210 mph, Crusaders <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> collapsed and the craft instantly disintegrated. Cobb was retrieved from the water but had already died of shock.|$|E
50|$|The reticle may {{be located}} at the front or rear focal plane (First Focal Plane (FFP) or Second Focal Plane (SFP)) of the {{telescopic}} sight. On fixed power telescopic sights {{there is no significant}} difference, but on variable power telescopic sights the <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> reticle remains at a constant size compared to the target, while rear plane reticles remain a constant size to the user as the target image grows and shrinks. Front focal plane reticles are slightly more durable, but most American users prefer that the reticle remains constant as the image changes size, so nearly all modern American variable power telescopic sights are rear focal plane designs. American and European high end optics manufacturers often leave the customer the choice between a FFP or SFP mounted reticle.|$|E
50|$|The pins of the Europlug are 19 mm long. They {{consist of}} a 9 mm long {{conductive}} tip of 4 mm diameter with a rounded ending, followed by a 10 mm long flexible insulated shaft of not more than 3.8 mm diameter. The two pins are not exactly parallel and converge slightly; their centres are 17.5 mm apart at the tip and 18.6 mm apart at the base. The elasticity of the converging pins provides sufficient contact force for the Europlug's current rating {{with a variety of}} socket-hole arrangements. The entire plug is 35.3 mm wide and 13.7 mm high, and must not exceed these dimensions within 18 mm behind its <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> (this allows for the recesses on many European socket types). The left and right side of the plug are formed by surfaces that are at 45° relative to the horizontal plane.|$|E

5000|$|The {{subject of}} the 1840s tempera, lithographed later, {{is one of the}} oldest north European Eastern Orthodox churches, built in Kalozha (formerly Kolozha) in Hrodna, now in Belarus. At the time, an art critic admired its harmony and saw the {{composition}} and color execution of the river vanishing in foggy distance as a vehicle of a deep sadness, an expression of the inertia, [...] "dull heaviness," [...] that permeated the provinces. The potential documentary value of the painting increased when the Neman River undercut the bank near the church in 1853, and its southern wall collapsed, but the picture pays scanty attention to architectural detail. In a modern interpretation, its focus is on the broader significance of what it depicts. The attractive darker outline of the church soaring on the steep embankment stands out against the sky, the fastidious composition of the landscape is enlivened with people in the picture's <b>front</b> <b>plane,</b> who underscore the human relevance of the pleasant location and the majestic glory of the historical temple.|$|E
50|$|While {{similar to}} modern movements, White and Yellow Package also mimics the old masters {{and their use}} of draping cloth. Bravo's use of light {{is similar to that}} of Caravaggio, a Baroque painter who used a {{dramatic}} lighting style called tenebrism to highlight a climatic moment and to bring attention to the <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> by concealing the background in darkness. Many of Caravaggio's works were spiritual and Bravo's Catholic upbringing left him with interest in themes of ritual, mystery, spirituality, death, and the idea of saints. This connection is made obvious through the title of one of his pieces, Homage to St. Theresa, also oil on canvas painted in 1969. A subtle reference to commercialism lingers in the simple fact that it is a parcel, but the mystery of what the paper conceals seems to be more important. The package is teasing the viewer by slowly opening up and while the internal structure is hinted at, it will never be revealed. In this painting, the act of teasing also becomes sexual, reinforced by the color scheme that resembles an egg - a symbol for rebirth and fertility. Overall, White and Yellow Package showcases his ability as a painter and is a mix of contemporary imagery done with traditional values.|$|E

40|$|The {{computer}} code LATIS {{is used to}} simulate midplane and backplane spallation resulting from short pulsed laser absorption. A 1 -D planar geometry is simulated with an exponential laser absorption profile.

The boundary conditions are a fixed <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> and free backplane (backplane spall) and a free <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> and a fixed midplane (midplane spall). The NBS/NRC equation of state for water is used with a self- consistent yet empirical material strength and failure model. The failure model includes the effects of void nucleation, growth and coalescence. Definite signatures of the nucleation and coalescence thresholds are found in the back surface motion for backplane spallation...|$|E
30|$|The {{failure of}} ‘stamp-rock foundation’ system is take place by tensile {{fracture}} {{at the front}} stamp plane and shear fracture or crushing (in the strongly heterogeneous rock) at the back one. In first case the angle between displacement vector and fracture plane is 60 °– 90 ° and in second case it is 30 °– 45 °. The foundation is stiffer the rupture under <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> is more clearly expressed. The typical macrofracture mode is represented in Fig.  8 a. The failure starts at the front (loaded) plane: the rupture fracture (9) is extended under the back plane. The final failure takes place along shear fracture (10) at the back plane. The stress state at the ‘stamp-rock foundation’ system is shown in Fig.  8 d. The calculations shown that under the <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> the “pressure–tension” stress zone and under the back plane the “pressure–pressure” stress zone are formed at the first load steps. In accordance with Mohr criterion [24] the plastic zone is formed at the <b>front</b> <b>plane</b> and extended under back plane. At the loading level of 0.85 from strength the plastic zone occupies the all contact zone (Fig.  8 e). At that the microfractures of the rupture mode are formed within almost all contact area apart from small zone located near the back plane where shear microfractures are formed.|$|E
