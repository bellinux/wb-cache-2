40|$|Abstract: In {{addition}} to their canonical roles in translation the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) have developed secondary functions {{over the course of}} evolution. Many of these activities are associated with cellular survival and nutritional stress responses essential for homeostatic processes in higher eukaryotes. In particular, six ARSs and one associated factor have <b>documented</b> <b>functions</b> in angiogenesis. However, despite their connection to this process, the ARSs are mechanistically distinct and exhibit a range of positive or negative effects on aspects of endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and survival. This variability is achieved through the appearance of appended domains and interplay with inflammatory pathways not found in prokaryotic systems. Complete knowledge of the non-canonical functions of ARSs is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying the physiological regulation of angiogenesis...|$|R

However, the language currently supports only the data shipping query evaluation model (through the <b>document()</b> <b>function)</b> : it fetches all data sources to a single server, then runs the query there. This is a major limitation for many applications, especially when some data sources are very large, or when a data source is only a virtual XML view over some other logical data model. We propose here a simple extension to XQuery that allows query shipping to be expressed in the language, in addition to data shipping.

This is the first microarray study indicating a possible involvement of EtrA in the regulation of gene expression in S. oneidensis MR- 1. In recent years, it has become apparent that microorganisms have developed complex regulatory mechanisms for control-ling gene expression in response to alterations in growth con-ditions (3, 23, 26). For example, Escherichia coli Fnr (fumar-ate-nitrate reduction regulator) mediates global changes in gene expression during transitions between aerobic and anaer-obic growth (12). Fnr homologs have been described for a number of bacterial species (7, 16, 22, 29), including Shewa-nella oneidensis MR- 1 (20) (formerly Shewanella putrefacien...|$|R

40|$|This paper gives a brief {{review of}} methods that assess objectively {{function}} in age-related maculopathy (ARM) with emphasis on a newer method, the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG). In contrast to other electrophysiological tests, such as the full-field and focal electroretinogram (ERG) or the electro-oculogram (EOG), which measure summed responses from various cells from larger areas of the retina, the multifocal electroretinogram maps function locally with a resolution as small as four degrees within the central 30 degrees. By using different paradigms it can measure local cone- and rod-mediated functional impairment at early and late stages of ARM. This improved mapping and higher resolution of the posterior pole compared to other objective methods might lead to earlier detection of ARM. Its usefulness has been demonstrated in documenting the effects of treatment after established laser treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and in <b>documenting</b> <b>function</b> after retinal pigment epithelial transplantation, a possible future treatment in late neovascular ARM...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzed the}} New Testament book of James as {{a sample of}} biblical literature to discern in what ways rhetorical critical methods supplement the grammatical/historical method as tools for interpretation. Accordingly, in four successive chapters James was criticized with four different methods: Grammatical/historical, cluster/agon, Toulminian, and generic. Each of the methods elucidated {{different aspects of the}} text. ^ In the final chapter, it was argued that a rhetorical approach to biblical interpretation is highly compatible with the grammatical/historical approach since both emphasize the importance of close textual reading, cultural context, and speaker-audience relationships as guides to meaning. A second conclusion was that a rhetorical approach supplements the grammatical/historical method in three areas: Textual analysis, biblical hermeneutical theory, and homiletical usage of the Bible. In brief, this dissertation argued that a rhetorical perspective is ideally suited to reveal that which the grammatical/historical method only hints at: How the ancient <b>documents</b> <b>functioned</b> to change the attitudes, beliefs, and actions of its readers. ...|$|R
