40|$|The {{focus of}} the project was to create an Excel Ribbon for the {{spreadsheet}} analysis tool PerfectXL. The tool allows users to upload <b>Excel</b> <b>workbooks,</b> have them analyzed for risks, and download the analysis results. The Ribbon would allow users to upload <b>Excel</b> <b>workbooks</b> and retrieve the analysis results from within the Excel environment. First, a two week research phase was conducted. During this research phase, it was established that Visual Studio 2015 would be used for the programming environment, and to use Windows Installer for the deployment of the Ribbon. The design is based on a separation between the functionality of the Ribbon and its presentation. This design decision was made so that the functionality code could easily be reused for new versions of Excel. Only the presentation would have to be modified. The implementation conforms to the design, and relies on background processes. These background processes allow the Ribbon to run in the background without blocking the Excel environment. The testing of the product is based on unit tests, where all classes are tested individually after every new functionality. The performance of the add-in was also tested with <b>Excel</b> <b>workbooks</b> of various sizes, where the upload time and the analysis time were separated. The findings of these performance tests was that the PerfectXL web application is the biggest bottleneck in the performance of the Ribbon. The final product conforms to the client’s needs and requirements. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer ScienceSoftware EngineeringTI 380...|$|R

40|$|Clinical SAS programmers receive {{clinical}} trial laboratory data from external sources, such as centralized laboratories, in non-SAS file formats e. g., Excel workbooks. Before beginning production data transfer, {{one needs to}} complete a test transfer to verify the completeness and accuracy of the data transfer. Once the test transfer is successful, the transfer of production data begins. There may be one transfer or multiple transfers, depending on the {{clinical trial}}. This paper discusses an approach in building and using specialized SAS program modules in order to automate the process of reading clinical laboratory data from an <b>Excel</b> <b>workbook</b> into SAS using SAS/BASE and DDE. This approach minimizes the manual intervention. In particular, this paper will detail a program that can readily be modified to create laboratory data sets, normal range data sets and formats catalog, {{based on the specifications}} and data provided in an <b>Excel</b> <b>workbook</b> with multiple data sets found in multiple Excel sheets. DDE is a viable option for importing or exporting data to or from MS Excel for those users who prefer to use SAS/BASE only. At SFBC New Drug Services, we receive laboratory data from our central facility located in Miami, Florida, as well as from many other external laboratories. Typically, we receive laboratory data as an ASCII file, which is our standard format. Sometimes laboratories send us data in an <b>Excel</b> <b>workbook...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Used Fuel Disposition (UFD) Campaign within DOE-NE is {{evaluating}} {{storage and}} disposal options {{for a range}} of waste forms and a range of geologic environments. For each waste form and geologic environment combination, there are multiple options for repository conceptual design. The Disposal Systems Evaluation Framework (DSEF) is being developed to formalize the development and documentation of options for each waste form and environment combination. The DSEF is being implemented in two parts. One part is an <b>Excel</b> <b>workbook</b> with multiple sheets. This workbook is designed to be user friendly, such that anyone within the UFD Campaign can use it as a guide to develop and document repository conceptual designs that respect thermal, geometric, and other constraints. The other part is an Access relational database file that will be centrally maintained to document the ensemble of conceptual designs developed with individual implementations of the <b>Excel</b> <b>workbook.</b> The DSEF <b>Excel</b> <b>workbook</b> includes sheets for waste form, environment, geometric constraints, engineered barrier system (EBS) design, thermal, performance assessment (PA), materials, cost, and fuel cycle system impacts. Each of these sheets guides the user through the process of developing internally consistent design options, and documenting the thought process. The sheets interact with each other to transfer information and identify inconsistencies to the user. In some cases, the sheets are stand-alone, and in other cases (such as PA), the sheets refer the user to another tool, with the user being responsible to transfer summary results into the DSEF sheet. Finally, the DSEF includes three top-level sheets: inputs & results, interface parameters, and knowledge management (references). These sheets enable users and reviewers to see the overall picture on only a few summary sheets, while developing the design option systematically using the detailed sheets. The DSEF Access relational database file collects the key inputs, results, and interface parameters from each <b>Excel</b> <b>workbook</b> implementation. The power of a relational database is available to sort and organize groups of designs, and to answer queries about what evaluations have been done in the UFD Campaign...|$|E
