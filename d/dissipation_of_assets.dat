40|$|April 2009 Using {{a sample}} of 231 {{entrepreneurial}} firm successions in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, we find that firms' unsigned discretionary accruals decrease while timely loss recognition increases subsequent to successions, suggesting a shift in accounting toward a less insider-based system.

In a two-period model, we discuss how the threat of knowledge spillover shapes the boundaries of a Multinational Enterprise. Similarly to the theoretical findings on the FDI-licensing trade off, we show that the integrated solution is more likely to emerge when know-how easily spills over – i. e. when firms are endowed with more Intangible Assets or they belong to high tech industries. Probit estimates, from a new firm-level dataset, show that Japanese manufacturing operations in Europe are in line with these predictions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{this paper is to}} study the design of {{securities}} when a firm must raise external capital from an asymmetrically informed capital market and when the firm has operating discretion in the management of the capital raised that embodies the essence <b>of</b> the <b>asset</b> substitution problem. It is shown that in this setting, if the operating discretion is sufficiently broad, there is no <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> value from <b>asset</b> substitution and hence no agency costs of this incentive problem, but the security design problem is severely constrained. Optimal operating policy decisions result in limiting security designs essentially to convex claims on firm cash flow. In this context, both equity and levered equity (the residual claim being inside debt) are natural candidates for optimal security designs. We characterize the private productivity information of the firm that yields equity as an optimal security design. This characterization involves an intuitive comparison of indices of mispricing gains of equity vis-a-vis those of levered equity. The relevant conditions are satisfied in a varietyof contexts, but they are not universal. We then pursue further the security designs that minimize mispricing and we show that in this context the optimal security designs are scaled versions of levered equity, which includes the conditions under which equity is optimal as a limiting case. This gives theoretical foundation for the use of inside debt in managing the asset substitution problem even when there are no agency costs <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> substitution...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{limiting}} factors {{for improving the}} sensitivity towards single spin detection using Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy is the working temperature. A component limiting this working temperature is the radio frequent (RF) source. The use of a superconducting NbTiN instead of a copper RF-source improves this working temperature and theory suggests that the <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> such a NbTiN RF-source is geometry dependent. The <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> 9 NbTiN RF-sources with different geometries was measured using two different methods. First a four-point measurement was used that returned inductive effects obscuring the <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> the RF-source. Secondly a calorimetric measurement was tried that returned dissipation originating in the supply cables overshadowing the <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> the RF-source.
