5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is <b>indeed</b> <b>an</b> element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is <b>indeed</b> <b>an</b> adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|Spain's first {{match of}} UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} was against Liechtenstein on 3 September 2010, Villa scored the second {{goal of the}} match which eventually ended 4–0. It was believed that this goal meant that he had equalled Raúl's record 44-goal tally, however after many debates about whether he or Dariusz Dudka scored the first goal in Spain's 6–0 win over Poland, FIFA eventually decided that the goal was <b>indeed</b> <b>an</b> own goal by Dudka, meaning Villa's goal tally would remain at 43. On 12 October 2010, he finally equalled Raúl's record, scoring a penalty against Scotland and helping Spain see off the Scots in a 3–2 victory at Hampden Park.|$|E

5|$|The castles made a clear, {{imperial}} {{statement about}} Edward's intentions to rule North Wales {{on a permanent}} basis. As already noted, they were typically located on sites that had {{been associated with the}} former Welsh princes. Caernarfon, in particular, stands out for its use of banded, coloured stone in the walls, statues of eagles and its polygonal, rather than round, towers. There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features. Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the Walls of Constantinople. The conscious use of imagery from the Byzantine Roman Empire was therefore an assertion of authority by EdwardI. Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was <b>indeed</b> <b>an</b> assertion of Edward's authority, but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion of Arthurian legitimacy for the king.|$|E

However, Justice Morrow held that Section 94(b) of the Indian Act is negated because it impermissibly violates section 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.|$|E

25|$|In the end, the mixed-calibre heavy {{armament}} proved unsuccessful, as gunnery officers {{found it}} impossible to distinguish between 12-inch (305-mm) and 9.2-inch shell splashes, making fire control impractical. This finding further pushed the navies of the world to move to all-big-gun dreadnought battleship designs. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>an</b> all-big-gun design had been considered for the Lord Nelsons in January 1905, but their design was too far advanced by then to be changed, and the all-big-gun layout had to await HMS Dreadnought.|$|E

The Mousai are addressed directly to John II and exhort him, amongst other things, to maintain justice during his reign and a full treasury.

Hardwick appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that the Georgia sodomy statute was <b>indeed</b> <b>an</b> infringement upon Hardwick’s Constitutional rights. The State of Georgia then appealed, and the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on 4November 1985, to review the case.|$|E

The Civil Aviation Administration of China reported that seven passengers, two security officers, and two flight attendants sustained injuries from the fighting. In addition, two of the suspects (identified as Ababaykeri Ybelayim and Mametali Yvsup) died from injuries on board; another two of the four detained were taken to the hospital due to self-mutilation.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} of the a posteriori methods are as follows. In this case, the collision detection algorithm need {{not be aware of}} the myriad of physical variables; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm, and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies. The collision detection algorithm doesn't need to understand friction, elastic collisions, or worse, nonelastic collisions and deformable bodies. In addition, the a posteriori algorithms are in effect one dimension simpler than the a priori algorithms. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>an</b> a priori algorithm must deal with the time variable, which is absent from the a posteriori problem.|$|E
