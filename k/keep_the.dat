5|$|Liverpool's triumph marked {{their fifth}} European Cup {{and the first}} by an English team since Manchester United had {{defeated}} Bayern Munich in the 1999 final in Barcelona. By winning the European Cup for a fifth time, Liverpool earned the privilege of wearing a multiple-winner badge {{and the right to}} <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> trophy (under normal competition rules, the winning club can <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> trophy for only 10 months, as they must deliver it to UEFA two months before the next year's final). The 2005–06 participants competed for a new identical trophy. The rule to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> trophy, which had been in effect since the 1968–69 season, was changed for the 2009–10 season, so that the actual trophy remained with UEFA at all times, thus Liverpool was the fifth and last club to accomplish the feat.|$|E

5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters.

5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E
