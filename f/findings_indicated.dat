Gloster et al. (2011) went on to examine {{the role of the}} therapist in CBT. [...] They randomized patients into two groups: [...] one being treated with CBT in a therapist guided environment, and the second receiving CBT through instruction only, with no therapist guided sessions. [...] The <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> that the first group had a somewhat better response rate, but that both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in reduction of panic symptomatology. [...] These findings lend credibility to the application of CBT programs to patients who are unable to access therapeutic services due to financial, or geographic inaccessibility. [...] Koszycky et al. (2011) discuss the efficacy of self-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (SCBT) in situations where patients are unable to retain the services of a therapist. [...] Their study demonstrates that it is possible for SCBT in combination with an SSRI to be as effective as therapist-guided CBT with SSRI. [...] Each of these studies contributes to a new avenue of research that allows effective treatment interventions to be made more easily accessible to the population.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from its}} direct {{clinical}} use, paclitaxel is used extensively in biological and biomedical research as a microtubule stabilizer. [...] In general, in vitro assays involving microtubules, such as motility assays, rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity {{in the absence}} of the various nucleating factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell. [...] For example, it is used for in vitro tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule motor proteins, or for studies of mutant motor proteins. [...] Moreover, Paclitaxel has been used in vitro to inhibit insulin fibrillation; in a molar ratio of 10:1 (insulin:paclitaxel), it hindered insulin fibrillation near 70%. Iso-thermal titration calorimetry (ITC) <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> a spontaneous tendency of paclitaxel to interact with insulin through hydrogen bonds and van der Waal’s forces. Paclitaxel is sometimes used for in vivo studies as well; it can be fed to test organisms, such as fruit flies, or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell. [...] Paclitaxel induces remyelination in a demyelinating mouse in vivo and inhibits hPAD2 in vitro though its methyl ester side chain.
