40|$|A new {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} calculation of the radiation field in <b>heterogeneous</b> photocatalytic <b>reactors</b> using the new concept of ‘‘effective radiation field model’’ or ERFM is proposed.

40|$|An in-core {{experiment}} is proposed to measure all delayed-neutron parameters (λᵢ and βᵢ for each delayed group) and the neutron generation time applicable {{for a given}} reactor system. The method uses a least-squares fitting technique to simultaneously fit a series of transient responses produced by step changes (or rapid ramps) in reactivity of arbitrary size. The function which is least-squares fit is the exact analytic solution describing a reactor response following a step change in reactivity as given by the standard multi-group point-reactor model. The method does not require any knowledge of the absolute reactivity of the system. The results are based solely upon the measurable quantities of relative power, time, and asymptotic inverse period. Unlike out-of-core delayed neutron experiments, the results are independent {{of the total number}} of fissions that have occurred in the fissioning isotope that produced the delayed neutrons, and are independent of the efficiency of the detector used to monitor the transients. Modal contamination is presumed not to be a serious problem in small or intermediate size cores as long as small reactivity changes are used (i. e. +$. 10 to -$. 25), which is consistent with the best method of performing this experiment. The method is equally applicable to both homogeneous and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> and may be used in either thermal or fast systems.

Their separation from spent fuel, fabrication and irradiation in homogeneous or <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>reactor</b> recycling modes provides a means to dramatically reduce their impact.
