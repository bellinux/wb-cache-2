40|$|Abstract- Operational modal {{analysis}} (OMA) allows {{to identify the}} modal parameters from the measured response to unknown random perturbations of a mechanical structure in operation. However, in all applications with rotating components (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>helicopters,</b> turbines, diesel motors, …), the structural vibration in operation {{is a combination of}} the response to the random perturbation and the harmonic excitation due to the rotating components. Classical OMA methods fail if the harmonic disturbance is close to, or coincides with a resonance frequency of the structure. Therefore, these methods have been extended to deal with harmonic disturbances with a known, fixed frequency. However, in many applications (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>helicopters,</b> wind turbines, diesel motors, …) the frequencies of the harmonic disturbances vary in time. This paper presents three methods for suppressing the influence of harmonic disturbances with unknown varying frequencies in operational {{modal analysis}}. Two of these methods can handle the case where the peak of the harmonic disturbance and the resonance peak completely overlap. The performance of the three methods is illustrated on simulations and real helicopter data...|$|R

40|$|Potentially {{dangerous}} spots (PDSs), for example, leaks {{in product}} pipelines (oil and gas pipelines), are revealed using optoelectronic systems (OESs) {{that are usually}} mounted on airborne vehicles (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>helicopters).</b> Earlier, a relevant problem consisted of revealing the onset of leaks in PDSs; however, today {{it is necessary to}} detect the PDSs of leaks in order to prevent their development. The complexity of the problem is related to the fact that product pipelines are most often located near densely populated areas and near reservoirs with drinking water. The appearance of PDSs is usually characterized by deviations in the temperature and other physical parameters from standard values in small areas. The detection of such spots necessitates decreasing the flying height of an OES carrier. As a rule, this yields a deterioration of imaging quality and OES overheating, which decreases the effi- ciency of this PDS detection method. Conservative OES developers believe that a low imaging quality and OES overheating result from random flaws in the OES assembly. Contrary to this, it is shown that failures occur due to a deterministic flaw at the stage of designing drives for an OES platform. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2012...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a simulation model designed to estimate aircraft Mission Capable Rates (MCR) for the United States Air Force. This simulation model originated out of the need to estimate the MCR for different modernization schemes to be implemented on the Air Force C- 5 Galaxy aircraft. Assigned to the Air Mobility Command (AMC), the C- 5 is one of our nations only two strategic airlift aircraft that can carry large outsize cargo (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>helicopters</b> and tanks). The other outsize capable strategic airlift aircraft is the C- 17 Globemaster III. At the same time, the C- 5 is one of the Air Forces least reliable aircraft. This means that AMC has a deficiency in meeting all of its wartime cargo airlift missions. To address this problem, AMC embarked on a year-long Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) study in 1999 to determine the best value solution for the Air Force to meet its cargo airlift requirements. Integral to this analysis is the aforementioned simulation model used to estimate C- 5 MCR.

40|$|In the {{modeling}} of complex dynamical systems, high-resolution {{finite element models}} are routinely adopted to reduce the discretization error. This is often implemented by exploiting cost-effective computing hardware through parallel processing to solve the resulting large scale linear systems. Such an approach fails to enhance confidence in simulation-based predictions when the dynamical systems exhibit significant variability in their data and model leading to so-called data and modeling uncertainty. When substantial statistical information is available, data un-certainty can be tackled using probabilistic methods by modeling {{the parameters of the}} data as random variables or stochastic processes. Model uncertainty poses significant challenges as no parameter is available a priori as opposed to the case of data uncertainty. In modelling complex systems such marine (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> ships, submarines) and aerospace systems (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>helicopters</b> and space shuttles) modeling uncertainty arises naturally {{due to the lack of}} complete knowledge and even presence of many subsystems attached to the main structural components. In the low frequency regions, effect of such substructure may be modeled by rigid masses attached to the primary struc-tures. In higher frequency, the mechanics of energy flow among the primary and secondary systems may not be captured by these rigid masses alone as dynamics of the subsystems becomes more important. The additional degree-of-freedom arising from the subsystems should be incorporated to model the entire system. A sprung-mas...|$|R
40|$|Wing pitch reversal, {{the rapid}} change of {{angle of attack}} near stroke transition, repre-sents a {{difference}} between hovering with flapping wings and with a continuously rotating blade (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>helicopter</b> flight). Although insects have the musculature to control the wing pitch during flight, we show here that aerodynamic and wing inertia forces are sufficient to pitch the wing {{without the aid of}} the muscles. We study the passive nature of wing pitching in several observed wing kinematics, including the wing motion of a tethered dragonfly, Libellula pulchella, hovering fruitfly, hovering hawkmoth and simplified drag-onfly hovering kinematics. To determine whether the pitching is passive, we calculate rotational power about the torsion axis due to aerodynamic and wing inertial forces. This is done using both direct numerical simulations and quasi-steady fluid force models. We find that, in all the cases studied here, the net rotational power is negative, signifying that the fluid force assists rather than resists the wing pitching. To further understand the generality of these results, we use the quasi-steady force model to analyze the effect of the components of the fluid forces at the pitch reversal, and predict the conditions under which the wing pitch reversal is passive. These results suggest the pitching motion of the wings can be passive in insect flight...|$|E

The work presented in this report describes {{the status of a}} compact and portable wireless vital signs (WVS) system that provides vital signs obtained in a traditional manner and is seamless from the field to definitive care. This system uses off-the-shelf, FDA-approved technology in a package that is lightweight, portable, and easy to use. WVS equipment is battery-powered and is comprised of a standard inflatable blood pressure cuff, a pulse oximeter, and a two-lead ECG.

Patient vital signs can be displayed on the PDA or on other devices such as a wearable ‘head-up ’ monitor or a pre-positioned stand alone displayer. From the PDA, the information can also be transmitted via Wi-Fi to a laptop server, which then allows the information to be used in a variety of ways.

40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{are those}} flying aircrafts that run without any humans being onboard. They are {{controlled}} either by an onboard computer or remote controllers. Utilizing UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) is beneficial in both military and civil applications. The various usages {{of these kinds}} of aircrafts are in different military missions such as battle damage assessment, communications relay, minesweeping, hazardous substances detection. However they can be used in other than military missions like monitoring the deployment of ballistics and projectiles while testing and locating there fall of shot. Aircrafts that are able of hovering and vertical flying can be used for this type of specific assignment. Having vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities and fast gliding provisions, tiltrotor aircraft is a very handy model which is perfectly compatible for many applications, which a nominal RC glider or a hovering helicopter may not perform efficiently. Combining the property of fast gliding of RC gliders and stable hovering capabilities of RC helicopter/quad copter, the tiltrotor mechanism works satisfactorily in spite of its complex flight dynamics. This mechanism presents a challenge for flight control designers and handling qualities engineers. Achieving consistent handling qualities and dynamic stability throughout an operational flight envelope is difficult since the aircraft’s flight dynamics change significantly at different operating conditions (e. g. speed, attitudes, etc.) and configurations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>helicopter</b> mode, conversion mode or airplane mode). The requirement to meet both helicopter and fixed wing flying qualities specifications always results in substantial cost and time.

Despite improvements in medical therapy and other devices modifying ventilatory support (2, 3) cardiopulmonary support based especially on closed chest compres-sion is pivotal to maximize survival chanc-es. However, manual chest compression is energy consuming and operator-intensive.

40|$|Composite conical and {{cylindrical}} shells {{are gaining}} more application in aerospace industry (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>helicopter</b> tailboom, airplane fuselage) {{due to their}} high specific strength and stiffness properties coming from material (composite) and geometry advantages. Stability is always a concern for these types of structures under different loading conditions. One of the major loading scenarios is the bending load in which composite conical shells can buckle under bending. Although there have been extensive studies on the buckling of conical and cylindrical shells under axial load, buckling under bending receives less attention in the literature from theoretical and experimental points of view. In this study, the bucking behavior of composite conical shells has been studied experimentally and theoretically. In the theoretical approach, a first order shear deformation shell theory has been proposed to study buckling and bending behavior of composite conical shells. A semi-analytical approach (Ritz method) {{has been applied to}} study buckling under axial load and buckling under bending of composite conical shells. An analytical solution (Levy type solution) has been applied to study the bending response of cross-ply conical shells under sinusoidal bending load. Also, a new formulation has been proposed to study bending, buckling and vibration of cross-ply cylindrical shells using an analytical solution (Levy type solution). A different displacement field from what was assumed in the literature has been proposed and consequently a new formulation has been obtained for the problem. In the experimental approach, a composite tube-bending setup has been designed and developed to study bending, and buckling under bending load, behavior of composite shells. The setup has been designed to apply equal bending moments at the both ends of the structure, simulating pure bending test conditions. Experimental result has been obtained for buckling under pure bending of composite conical shells. Regarding the manufacturing technique, Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) has attracted the aerospace industry due to its fast production rate, repeatability, and minimum material waste. Advanced thermoplastic composites obtain special attention in the aerospace industry as well, considering their superior properties (e. g., fracture toughness) and their capability to make aero-structures without requiring autoclave treatment with respect to thermoset ones. Considerable challenges remained unresolved regarding optimum process parameters for manufacturing of thermoplastic composites made by AFP and their quality. This thesis also addresses the effect of autoclave treatment on the stiffness quality of the thermoplastic composite cones made by AFP. The determination of optimum process parameters for AFP in the manufacturing of thermoplastic composite (AS 4 /PEEK) has been performed from both stiffness and strength point of view. ...|$|E

Many real world phenomena behave periodically, <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>helicopter</b> rotors, revolving satellites and dynamic systems corresponding to natural processes, like the water flow in a system of connected lakes, and can be described in terms of periodic eigenvalue problems. Typically, eigenvalues and invariant subspaces (or, specifically, eigenvectors) to certain periodic matrix products are of interest and have direct physical interpretations. The eigenvalues of a matrix product can be computed without forming the product explicitly via variants of the periodic Schur decomposition. In {{the first part of the}} Thesis, we propose direct methods for eigenvalue reordering in the periodic standard and generalized real Schur forms which extend earlier work on the standard and generalized eigenvalue problems. The core step of the methods consists of solving periodic Sylvester-type equations to high accuracy. Periodic eigenvalue reordering is vital in the computation of periodic eigenspaces corresponding to specified spectra. The proposed direct reordering methods rely on orthogonal transformations and can be generalized to more general periodic matrix products where the factors have varying dimensions and ± 1 exponents of arbitrary order. In the second part, we consider Sylvester-type matrix equations, like the continuoustime Sylvester equation AX −XB =C, where A of size m×m, B of size n×n, and C of size m×n are general matrices with real entries, which have applications in many areas. Examples include eigenvalue problems and condition estimation, and several problems in control system design and analysis. The parallel algorithms presented are based on the well-known Bartels–Stewart’s method and extend earlier work on triangular Sylvester-type matrix equations resulting in a novel software library SCASY. The parallel library provides robust and scalable software for solving 44 sign and transpose variants of eight common Sylvester-type matrix equations. SCASY also includes a parallel condition estimator associated with each matrix equation. In the last part of the Thesis, we propose parallel variants of the direct eigenvalue reordering method for the standard and generalized real Schur forms. Together with the existing and future parallel implementations of the non-symmetric QR/QZ algorithms and the parallel Sylvester solvers presented in the Thesis, the developed software can be used for parallel computation of invariant and deflating subspaces corresponding to specified spectra and associated reciprocal condition number estimates...|$|E

40|$|In most real-life environments, {{mechanical}} or {{electronic components}} {{are subjected to}} vibrations. Some of these components may have to pass qualification tests to verify that they can withstand the fatigue damage they will encounter during their operational life. In order to conduct a reliable test, the environmental excitations can {{be taken as a}} reference to synthesize the test profile: this procedure is referred to as “test tailoring”. Due to cost and feasibility reasons, accelerated qualification tests are usually performed. In this case, the duration of the original excitation which acts on the component for its entire life-cycle, typically hundreds or thousands of hours, is reduced. In particular, the “Mission Synthesis” procedure lets to quantify the induced damage of the environmental vibration through two functions: the Fatigue Damage Spectrum (FDS) quantifies the fatigue damage, while the Maximum Response Spectrum (MRS) quantifies the maximum stress. Then, a new random Power Spectral Density (PSD) can be synthesized, with same amount of induced damage, but a specified duration in order to conduct accelerated tests. In this work, the Mission Synthesis procedure is applied in the case of so-called Sine-on-Random vibrations, i. e. excitations composed of random vibrations superimposed on deterministic contributions, in the form of sine tones typically due to some rotating parts of the system (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>helicopters,</b> engine-mounted components, …). In fact, a proper test tailoring should not only preserve the accumulated fatigue damage, but also the “nature” of the excitation (in this case the sinusoidal components superimposed on the random process) in order to obtain reliable results. The classic time-domain approach is taken as a reference for the comparison of different methods for the FDS calculation in presence of Sine-on-Random vibrations. Then, a methodology to compute a Sine-on-Random specification based on a mission FDS is presented...|$|R

40|$|A large {{literature}} has documented statistically significant effects of monetary policy on economic activity. The central explanation for how monetary policy transmits {{to the real}} economy relies critically on nominal rigidities, which {{form the basis of}} the New Keynesian (NK) framework. This paper studies a different transmission mechanism that operates {{even in the absence of}} nominal rigidities. We show that in an OLG setting, standard open market operations (OMO) carried by central banks have important revaluation effects that alter the level and distribution of wealth and the incentives to work and save for retirement. Specifically, expansionary OMO lead households to front-load their purchases of durable goods and work and save more, thus generating a temporary boom in durables, followed by a bust. The mechanism can account for the empirical responses of key macroeconomic variables to monetary policy interventions. Moreover, the model implies that different monetary interventions (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> OMO versus <b>helicopter</b> drops) can have different qualitative effects on activity. The mechanism can thus complement the NK paradigm. We study an extension of the model incorporating labor market frictions...|$|R

40|$|Thin walled structures, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> {{aircraft}} and <b>helicopter</b> fuselages, but also domestic electrical machines, {{are characterized by}} poor acoustic behavior. This is mainly due to the very low damping properties of the high efficiency structural elements and materials, prone to transmitting bending vibrations. Such unsatisfactory behavior leads {{to the need for}} acoustic treatments, which engender installation costs, troubleshooting problems and weight penalties, especially undesirable in aircraft applications. A possible solution to improve acoustic performance is to dissipate the vibrational energy during its passage through the structure, before coupling with the air of the cabin and becoming noise. The metal–polymer–metal sandwich technique, also adopted with multiple layering, could be exploited to efficiently dissipate bending waves by viscoelastic layers placed through the thickness. Dynamic and acoustic experimental campaigns have been carried out on specimens and panels made of either aluminum alloy or carbon composite layers with viscoelastic inclusions made with styrene–butadiene rubber, testifying the correctness of the idea. The benefits of such approach are tested also in thick cases where multilayered stacking is very efficient.

The review included both findings on human behaviour in high-rise buildings and modelling techniques and tools. Different categories of building use were taken into account, namely office buildings, residential buildings and health care facilities. The individual or combined use of different egress components was analysed. Egress components include the use of stairs, elevators as well as alternative means of escape (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> sky-bridges, <b>helicopters,</b> etc.). The effectiveness of the egress components is strongly affected by the building use and the population involved. The review shows that evacuation models can be effectively employed to study relocation strategies and safety issues associated with high-rise buildings. The suitability of egress models for high-rise building evacuations is associated with their flexibility in representing different egress components and complex behavioural processes. The review highlights {{that there is not a}} definitive model to be used but that the predictive capabilities of evacuation modelling techniques would be enhanced if more than one model is employed to study different egress aspects. Future research and model developments should focus on the study of the impact of staff actions, group dynamics and people with disabilities.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRecent {{events in the}} United States of America and Pakistan have exposed the shortcomings of existing planning in relief and humanitarian assistance {{in the face of}} large-scale natural disasters. This thesis develops a two-stage stochastic optimization model to provide guidance in the pre-positioning of relief units and assets, where budget, physical limitations and logistics are taken into account. Stochastic data include the numbers of survivors in each potential affected area (AA), the amount of commodities that needs to be delivered to each AA and the transportation time from each relief location (which reflects sceanrios where, for example, roads are blocked). As first-stage decisions, we consider the expansion of warehouses, medical facilities and their health care personnel, as well as ramp space to facilitate aircraft supply of commodities to the AAs. The second-stage is a logistic problem respresented as a network, where maximizing expected rescued survivors and delivery of required commodities are the driving goals. This is accomplished through land, air and sea transportation means (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> CH- 53 <b>helicopters</b> configured for rescue missions), as well as relief workers. The model has been successfully assessed on notional scenarios and is expected to be tested on realistic cases by personnel who are involved in relief planning. Outstanding Thesi...|$|R
40|$|An {{inverted}} body posture is not common. During unusual situations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> overturned <b>helicopters</b> or {{motor vehicle}} accidents) {{when the body}} is inverted, the neuromuscular responses can change. In order to manage these situations, {{it is necessary to}} examine changes in muscle force output and activation. [...] Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, it is believed that both central And peripheral factors can contribute to changes in muscle force output. Increase in cerebral blood pooling, increase in hydrostatic pressure, and decrease in sympathetic activity during rapid and slow transitions from upright to inverted seated position are considered to be the main central factors leading to decrease in inversion-induced muscle force output. Peripheral factors such as decreased blood flow to the contracting muscle resulting in decrease perfusion pressure and oxygen deficit within the muscle are most likely to summate along with central factors inducing neuromuscular impairments during rapid and slower inversion rotations. [...] There is no evidence examining possible impairments in neuromuscular functioning with more rapid versus slower inverted rotations as compared to an upright seated position. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded and analyzed in biceps and quadriceps, concurrently and individually, for maximal force output and activation with upright seated position, and inverted within 1 s and 3 s rotations. It was anticipated that changes in muscle force and activation within 1 s and 3 s inversion rotations would suggest impairments in the functioning of neuromuscular system, as compared to the upright position. In addition, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were also recorded. [...] Both biceps and quadriceps exhibited significant decreases in maximal voluntary force and EMG activity, both concurrently and individually, when inverted within 1 s and 3 s rotations compared to an upright position. HR, SBP, and DBP also demonstrated significant decreases when inverted within 1 s and 3 s rotations compared to upright position. This suggests both rapid and slower inversion impairs neuromuscular function...|$|R

40|$|The {{helicopter}} {{constitutes a}} very important branch of the aeronautical industry despite being expensive, tricky to operate and requiring a high maintenance effort. Its ability to hover and operate under low airspeed, combined {{with the ability to}} land in almost every spot makes helicopters superior to fixed wing aircraft in certain missions. Moreover, helicopters also compete with earth bound vehicles when it comes to operations in sparsely populated areas or when the infrastructure impedes the use of automobiles. Therefore, the field of application for helicopters is wide ranging from aerial observation over general transport of passengers and cargo up to medical transport of severely injured patients. Recently, interest has grown to improve typical limitations of rotorcraft, such as to reduce noise and to extend the flight envelope by increasing cruise velocity. Novel and more effective helicopter designs might work in a wider operating range and/or could transport more payload in terms of mass and volume, for instance enhanced medical equipment allowing a better and faster treatment of the patient. These objectives lead to unconventional design concepts, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> compound <b>helicopters</b> that feature additional lifting surfaces and propellers. To date the statistical knowledge of such configurations that could be beneficial during early design phases is limited. However, the rotorcraft design process is very challenging since it is mainly driven by the desired functionality. Accordingly, helicopter fuselages often feature cut-outs that influence the load path and hence the structure and mass. In turn, a sufficiently precise estimation of the helicopter total mass is required for a feasible performance analysis, thus calling for an iterative design process. With the aim to create and evaluate traditional but also new unconventional rotorcraft concepts, an integrated, automated multidisciplinary process chain covering the conceptual and preliminary design stages has been established within the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It allows the design of virtual rotorcraft configurations starting from scratch, based on few minimum input parameters, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> mission range, cruise velocity, payload, blade number and rotor configuration. This process chain features a modular approach to allow for high flexibility concerning the redefinition of certain parameters that become available during the design process. The presented paper describes the process chain and the common data format used to combine the different tools. Particular attention is turned on the analysis of the fuselage structure. Exemplary, the generation of a generic rotorcraft is shown gradually from the very beginning by evaluating the required input parameters up to the structural analysis of the fuselage...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{inverted}} and supine body {{positions are}} not common postures humans adopt. During unusual situations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> overturned <b>helicopters,</b> motor vehicle accidents, gymnastics) when body position is altered, neuromuscular and cardiovascular (CV) responses can change. To optimally manage these situations, {{it is necessary}} to examine the changes in muscle force output, activation and CV parameters. In previous research, impairments during posture change were believed to be secondary to inhibition of sympathetic nervous system activity in recreational subjects. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the neuromuscular and CV changes in supine and inverted body positions on a group of aerobically trained athletes before and following physical fatigue. Methods: Twelve male athletes completed three trials in the upright, supine and inverted seated positions. At baseline (upright), leg extension (LE) and elbow flexion (EF) evoked contractile properties and MVCs were performed. The participant was then positioned for 150 s in each posture, followed by a 30 s MVC (MVC 30). During each trial, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (Q), heart rate (HR), time and frequency domain HR variability measures and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) measurements were recorded. As well, force-fatigue and EMG relationships were evaluated. Results: An ANOVA showed no statistical differences in EF MVC force, but a tendency (p= 0. 12) for LE MVC decline across positions with moderate effect size. EF evoked resting twitch (p= 0. 1) had a decline in force that was not significant from upright to inverted and no change from upright to supine. Potentiated peak twitch (p= 0. 06) force displayed a tendency towards an increase from upright to supine and decline in force from upright to inverted postures (p= 0. 1). LE evoked resting twitch had a non-significant (p= 0. 1) but large magnitude increase in force across the three positions and there was a significant increase in potentiated twitch force (p= 0. 03). Force-fatigue, electromyography-fatigue relationships and HR variability during MVC 30 fatigue across positions were not affected. HR and Q were significantly (p< 0. 01) lower with inversion following both LE and EF fatigue. Conclusions: The lack of significant postural changes in resting force and CV measures may demonstrate that highly trained individuals may adapt better to the supine and inverted positions...|$|R
