2500|$|Starting {{from the}} Parsi Theatre and Hindustani Theatre days {{the first phase}} of his Stage Portrayal culminated in Sheila Bhatia's Production which was written by Mehdi Saheb. Mohd Ayub {{performed}} his role so many times that many theatre goers used to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> Ghalib. Sheila Bhatia Production was basically celebration of his famous ghazals which used to be presented one after another. Ghalib's character lacked required nuances and was shown philandering with the Courtesan played famously by Punjabi singer Madan Bala Sandhu. Later Begum Abida Ahmed wife of late President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed supported many very costly Productions. This was perhaps the golden period of Ghalib productions as many other Productions also were done including Surender Verma's Play which was done by National School of Drama. Qaid-e-Hayat (Imprisonment of Life, 1983) written by Surendra Verma talks about the personal life of poet Ghalib, including his financial hardships and his tragic love for Katiba, a woman calligraphist, who was working on his diwan. Over the years, it has been directed by numerous theatre directors, including Ram Gopal Bajaj in 1989, at the National School of DramaThis period also saw numerous College and University Productions done by Students' Groupes. The writers whose scripts were more popular during this period were Jameel Shaidai, Danish Iqbal, Devender Singh and few others. Ghalib also inspired a chain of comedies. Once such classic comedy is 'Ghalib in New Delhi' which has been staged more than three hundred times by Dr Sayeed Alam. Danish Iqbal's Play 'Main Gaya Waqt Nahin Hoon' and Sayeed's Play 'Ghalib Ke Khutoot' are still being staged at various Indian cities ...|$|E
