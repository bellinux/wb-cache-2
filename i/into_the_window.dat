5|$|Inside a large, modernist house, Gerald (Lawson) {{turns on}} Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 {{and sits down}} to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen. Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked {{to see that the}} pair have come to steal an almost {{completely}} white painting. Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a Yorkshire Terrier out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an Irish Wolfhound. As Ray releases the wolfhound, Eddie accidentally throws the terrier <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> so Ray stuffs the dog into an umbrella stand.|$|E
25|$|On the March 14 {{episode of}} SmackDown Live, Styles ambushed SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon {{when he arrived}} at the venue and ended up {{slamming}} his head <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of a parked car. Afterwards, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan confronted Styles and—in storyline—fired him for his actions before having security escort Styles out of the building. However, later that night McMahon returned to the arena and stated that he would face Styles at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Styles defeated McMahon. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown Live, Styles made reconciliation with Shane McMahon via a handshake and thus turned back into a fan favorite in the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E

500|$|After {{noting the}} [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "almost onomatopoeic" [...] {{connotation}} that the Trump surname has with some people, Oliver {{says of the}} ancestral name, [...] "Drumpf is much less magical. It's the sound produced when a morbidly obese pigeon flies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of a foreclosed Old Navy. [...] It's {{the sound of a}} bottle of store-brand root beer falling off the shelf in a gas station minimart." [...] The segment closes with Oliver walking toward a lighted [...] "DRUMPF" [...] sign, informing those watching the segment who are considering voting for Trump, [...] "Don't vote for him because he tells it like it is. He's a bullshit artist. Don't vote for him because he's tough. He's a baby, with even smaller fingers. Don't vote for him because he's a builder. He's more of a shitty lifestyle brand."

Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways by Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation. The work is integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, {{as a series of}} 700 purple and grey colored glass panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name. [...] Creative Time worked with the artist to realize the site-specific concept that emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall.|$|E
