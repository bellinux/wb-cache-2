25|$|Visual FoxPro: Visual FoxPro is a <b>data-centric</b> {{object-oriented}} {{and procedural}} programming language produced by Microsoft. It derives from FoxPro (originally known as FoxBASE) which {{was developed by}} Fox Software beginning in 1984. Visual FoxPro is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine, which extends FoxPro's xBase capabilities to support SQL queries and data manipulation. Visual FoxPro is a full-featured, dynamic programming language that {{does not require the}} use of an additional general-purpose programming environment. In 2007, Visual FoxPro was discontinued after version 9 Service Pack 2. It was supported until 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Disaster {{recovery}} (DR) {{and business}} continuity {{refers to an}} organization’s ability to recover from a disaster and/or unexpected event and resume operations. Organizations often have a plan in place (usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "Disaster Recovery Plan" [...] or [...] "Business Continuity Plan") that outlines how a recovery will be accomplished. The key to successful disaster recovery is to have a plan (emergency plan, disaster recovery plan, continuity plan) well before disaster ever strikes. Often used together, the terms Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery are very different. Business Continuity refers to the ability of a business to continue critical functions and business processes after the occurrence of a disaster, where as Disaster Recovery refers specifically to the Information Technology (IT) and <b>data-centric</b> functions of the business, and is a subset of Business Continuity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Data-centric</b> {{programming}} language defines {{a category of}} {{programming language}}s where the primary function is the management and manipulation of data. A <b>data-centric</b> programming language includes built-in processing primitives for accessing data stored in sets, tables, lists, and other data structures and databases, and for specific manipulation and transformation of data required by a programming application. <b>Data-centric</b> programming languages are typically declarative and often dataflow-oriented, and define the processing result desired; the specific processing steps required to perform the processing are left to the language compiler. The SQL relational database language {{is an example of}} a declarative, <b>data-centric</b> language. Declarative, <b>data-centric</b> programming languages are ideal for data-intensive computing applications.|$|E
