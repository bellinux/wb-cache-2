40|$|BACKGROUND: Fractional exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (FE NO) {{is used in}} {{monitoring}} of asthma. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicenter study was to establish normal values of FE NO and assess feasibility in children with a standardized method and <b>equipment</b> <b>approved</b> for clinical use. METHODS: FE NO was measured in healthy subjects of 4 to 17 years according to American Thoracic Society guidelines (single breath online, exhalation flow 50 mL/s) with a chemiluminescence analyzer (NIOX Exhaled Nitric Oxide Monitoring System, Aerocrine, Sweden) in 3 European and 2 US centers. Each child performed 3 acceptable nitric oxide measurements within 6 attempts and completed an extended International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children questionnaire. RESULTS: Measurement of FE NO was attempted in 522 children. Four hundred five children completed the study according to the protocol. Geometric mean FE NO in 405 children was 9. 7 ppb, and the upper 95 % confidence limit was 25. 2 ppb. FE NO increased significantly with age, and higher FE NO was seen in children with self-reported rhinitis/conjunctivitis or hay fever. The success rate was age-dependent and improved from 40 % in the children 4 years old to almost 100 % {{from the age of}} 10 years. The repeatability of 3 approved measurements was 1. 6 ppb (95 % CI, 1. 49 - 1. 64 ppb). CONCLUSION: FE NO in healthy children is below 15 to 25 ppb depending on age and self-reported atopy. Measurement of FE NO by NIOX is simple and safe and has a good repeatability. Feasibility depends on age and may be difficult in the preschool child...|$|R
