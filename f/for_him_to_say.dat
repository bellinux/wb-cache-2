25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, {{he married}} a cousin the {{daughter}} of Mordechai Frances and, being amply provided for financially, {{he was able to}} continue his studies. Though he initially may have pursued a career in business, he soon turned to asceticism and mysticism. Around the age of twenty-two he became engrossed {{in the study of the}} Zohar (a major work of the Kabbalah that had recently been printed for the first time) and adopted the life of a recluse. Retreating to the banks of the Nile for seven years, he secluded himself in an isolated cottage, giving himself up entirely to meditation. He visited his family only on Shabbat. But even at home, he would not utter a word, even to his wife. When it was absolutely necessary <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something, he would say it in the fewest number of words possible, and then, only in Hebrew.|$|E
500|$|The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling, a British lawyer, {{author and}} professor. In 1989, he commented that he [...] "could not imagine {{then that the}} time would come when the power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities". Nonetheless, he commented that he supported review of the ISA {{but it was not}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if the law should be scrapped, as [...] "you've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly".|$|E
500|$|As they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards. [...] They stake {{their shares}} of the {{anticipated}} robbery spoils. Billy loses: his participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger, Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mill's money. [...] The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> his last words to her and die. [...] Julie strokes his hair, finally able {{to tell him that}} she loved him. [...] Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair ("You'll Never Walk Alone").|$|E
60|$|The news of Ralph's {{disappearance}} spread, {{and several}} parties went out <b>to</b> hunt <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Strange <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{one of the}} parties contained Squire Paget.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam {{wanted to}} draw up an agreement, but Ginger Dick and Peter Russet wouldn’t ’ear of it. They both said that that sort o’ thing wouldn’t look well in writing, not if anybody else {{happened}} to see it, that is; besides which Ginger said it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>’im</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> ’ow much money he would ’ave the handling of. Once the tattooing was done ’e began to take a’most kindly to the plan, an’ being an orfin, so far as ’e knew, he almost began to persuade hisself that the red-’aired landlady was ’is mother.|$|R
60|$|It {{was at this}} juncture, when Walt {{had just}} {{decided it was time}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> relieve the strain, that Wolf, who had been away nosing through the brush, trotted wolf-like into view.|$|R
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Perry at a wedding, about to {{exchange}} vows with her diffident fiancé Alexander (played by actor/model Alexander Rodriguez). Perry says her vows, but Alexander hesitates {{and the church}} anxiously waits <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "I do". Perry appears frustrated and the music begins to play, with the congregation dancing as disco lights flash. Perry begins to sing the song to Alexander before he flees the altar. She pursues him, and they proceed to play a cat-and-mouse game. Perry corners him in a warehouse, and Alexander is pulled into an audience and forced to crowd-surf while watching Perry perform the song on stage. He manages to escape but walks out to find Perry in her wedding dress surrounded by several other brides carrying baseball bats. Perry confronts him, but {{he is able to}} get away.|$|E
500|$|According to the New Straits Times, Hickling {{later wrote}} in 1989, [...] "I {{could not imagine}} then that the time would come when the power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities." [...] However, he commented {{that it was not}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if the Internal Security Act should be scrapped. [...] "As a lawyer, I'm all for its review but on whether it should be scrapped, I don't know. You've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly." [...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry to say that, in the light of my own experience, I'm inclined to think you couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment". Worldwide terrorist attacks such as 9/11 confirmed his views on the matter.|$|E
2500|$|David {{indicated}} {{after the}} sentencing {{that she would}} file a notice of appeal and indicated that Littlejohn remained silent. She maintained that he was framed to protect Dorrian. She said, [...] "there was really nothing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> [...] It's hard <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he's sorry for something he didn't do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aaron and Amy begin {{dating and}} fall for each other. Amy is worried {{she is going}} to mess up the relationship, but Kim tells her she is just doing what {{everyone}} else does. Gordon avoids taking his medication and dies. At his funeral, Aaron tells her, for the first time, that he loves her. She tells him that it was the wrong time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> start <b>saying</b> that <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "The whole male attendance!" [...] she muttered, {{repeating the}} Queen's last words, [...] "and well for thee {{had it been}} had thy train never been larger;" [...] then turning to Roland, in whose way she had stood while making this pause, she made room <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> pass, <b>saying</b> at the same time, [...] "Art thou already eaves-dropping? follow thy mistress, minion, and, if thou wilt, tell her what I have now said." ...|$|R
50|$|The church's Brisbane pastor {{resigned}} in March 2010 over {{a difference in}} doctrine. 25 {{members of the congregation}} followed him out of the church, some expressed their support <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the media, <b>saying</b> that the church was a money-making cult.|$|R
2500|$|... "It is crass <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a black West Indian was let off [...] {{he was a}} {{white man}} and {{therefore}} he was charged. Mr Hair was the senior umpire and he literally took over that Oval cricket match. I was present there.|$|E
2500|$|Allen is a Christian. Allen {{has spoken}} about his faith saying, [...] "My Bible’s my {{playbook}} for life" [...] and [...] "My {{ultimate goal is}} when I die, <b>for</b> <b>Him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> ‘Welcome home, you good and faithful servant.’ That’s how I try to gear my life and focus on Him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bloom never pissed me {{off because}} there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of {{intellectual}} prowess. He {{might be able to}} say that Mark Twain is a great writer, but it's impossible <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that there's a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, [...] "I never read him, but I know he's terrible." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Dylan, [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] was not {{a typical}} song <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write, <b>saying</b> that it [...] "comes off as {{sort of like a}} drunk man whos {{temporarily}} sober.". [...] Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin found the song a disappointing start to Planet Waves. [...] However, he did acknowledge some positive features: that [...] "playing swings" [...] and that Dylan is in good voice. [...] He also acknowledges some clever lyrics. For example, he sees in the lines: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{found the}} two French girls sitting with their mother, {{and they all}} {{expressed}} their great gratitude <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> coming <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye before he went. [...] "It's so very nice of you, Mr. Burgess," [...] said Camilla, [...] "and particularly just at present." ...|$|R
50|$|Giasone and Medea {{meet with}} Isifile. She {{approaches}} Giasone, but he reassures Medea {{that he is}} not interested in her. Giasone humors Isifile's pleas <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return. Isifile <b>says</b> that Giasone has given her a child, but Giasone denies that he ever loved her. Isifile's emotion switches from bliss to anger in this mad scene.|$|R
2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When I {{proposed}} to Lucio my original treatment for Per Sempre, which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per Sempre and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that he originated the story and that I stole it from him is pure science fiction".|$|E
60|$|It wasn't {{just the}} thing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> perhaps, but we are all human, even elders.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not answer}} to this, and she moved towards the door slowly, as if waiting <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} more.|$|E
6000|$|He {{held out}} his hand, and Clement did not refuse it, as he did that of his own nephew. Still, {{there was a certain}} {{satisfaction}} at his heart as he beheld the clear, honest young faces of the other two boys, and he bade Adrian run home and wait <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> Fergus— - ...|$|R

Knowing that it's time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go, Sam <b>says</b> goodbye <b>to</b> Oda Mae, and regretfully turns to Molly. They're able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> their goodbyes, Sam finally telling Molly that he loves her in the way that she wants to hear ("The Love Inside").|$|R

60|$|It was a crafty thing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Of course, I {{sprang from}} Rataplan's back {{and ordered the}} groom to lead {{him back into the}} stables.|$|E
5000|$|The {{protagonist of}} this story is Romesh, an East Indian young boy who has moved from the Cross Crossing sugar estate {{to the city to}} study. Romesh returns to Cross Crossing for his school {{holidays}} and there he realizes how different his life has become. He rejects the destiny his parents would like <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> an arranged marriage and a life dedicated to the land.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 June, Ganilau {{accused the}} Prime Minister of having {{committed}} a [...] "monumental deception" [...] by asking church leaders {{to support the}} legislation without honestly explaining its contents to them. He was reacting to revelations from Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca and other church leaders that at {{a meeting with the}} Prime Minister on 2 May, they had been told of the reconciliation and compensation provisions of the legislation, but not about its amnesty provisions. [...] "It does not say much about the credibility of the Prime Minister <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> publicly that the Christian churches support the bill after these deliberate acts of deception." [...] Ganilau said. He called on churches to join with other religions to put together an alternative blueprint to the government's reconciliation proposals.|$|R
50|$|Chandar and Sudha returns, Sudha {{is happy}} to see Pammi. She asks how she came. Pammi says that Chandar don’t come now, {{so she had to}} come. Sudha asks her to come in to have tea together. Pammi says that they both must come to her place for tea. Chandar says it is a bit {{difficult}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come. Pammi <b>says</b> it is his birthday so she has kept a small party for celebration. Sudha says she will come for sure.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll be on {{sick leave}} till to-morrow morning, when Josh Fernald is expecting you at headquarters, and then it'll be <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when we're {{to see you}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lydia waited awhile <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} more, but {{he added}} nothing, and she observed, with a furtive look: [...] "I presume you've seen some very severe storms at sea." ...|$|E
60|$|Stephen looked up. For {{the first}} time he {{actually}} liked Colfax. He had been long enough among Colfax's people to understand how difficult it was <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the thing he wished.|$|E
50|$|Ted {{notices the}} girl (Kaylee DeFer) {{that he has}} been {{watching}} at the bar is standing next to Cindy (Rachel Bilson), the girl he had briefly dated from his school, and whose roommate Future Ted says is the eponymous mother. After their one date, Cindy had treated him badly when they met during the school day. Ted assumes that the woman at the bar is Cindy's roommate, and is determined to meet her. Cindy sees Ted and takes him aside, thanking <b>him</b> <b>for</b> helping her realize what she was looking <b>for,</b> and invites <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye <b>to</b> her before he leaves.|$|R
5000|$|... "And {{they shall}} say, Thou art my God": (or rather, [...] "shall say, my God") There {{seems to be}} more affectionateness in the brief answer, which sums up the whole {{relation}} of the creature to the Creator in that one word, [...] "Elohai, my God." [...] The prophet declares, as before, that, when God thus anew called them His people, they by His grace would obey His call, and surrender themselves wholly <b>to</b> <b>Him.</b> <b>For</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "my God," [...] is to own an exclusive relation to God alone.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Mr. Crewe {{had made some}} new friends, as was {{inevitable}} when such a man unbent. Three of these friends owned, by a singular chance, weekly newspapers, and having conceived a liking {{as well as an}} admiration <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> began <b>to</b> <b>say</b> pleasant things about him in their columns--which Mr. Crewe (always thoughtful) sent to other friends of his. These new and accidental newspaper friends declared weekly that measures of paramount importance were slumbering in committees, and cited the measures. Other friends of Mr. Crewe were so inspired by affection and awe that they actually neglected their business and spent whole days in the rural districts telling people what a fine man Mr. Crewe was and circulating petitions for his bills; and incidentally the committees of Mr. Butcher and Mr. Bascom were flooded with these petitions, representing the spontaneous sentiment of an aggrieved populace.|$|R
