5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} his work, Kraft found it {{increasingly}} stressful, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> {{he did not}} consider {{himself to be a}} strong theoretician. In 1956, he was diagnosed with an ulcer and started thinking about a change of career.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> it is rarer {{than most of}} the other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E

5|$|<b>Especially</b> <b>since</b> the 1950s, {{religions}} {{from the}} former British colonies have grown in numbers, due to immigration. Islam {{is the most common}} of these, now accounting for around 5% of the population in England. Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism are next in number, adding up to 2.8% combined, introduced from India and South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|Illegal logging of {{precious}} hardwoods, such as rosewood and ebony, {{has become one}} of the greatest threats to the silky sifaka's habitat, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Its two largest protected areas, Masoala National Park and Marojejy National Park, have been the hardest hit. The disturbance caused by selective logging increases the likelihood of forest fires, helps invasive species take root, impairs habitat, and causes the loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.|$|E

5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted these numbers, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> the ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point. Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 {{being seen as}} more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|The first Armenian {{arrived in}} California in 1874 {{and settled in}} Fresno. Fresno and the Central Valley in general were the center of California Armenian community, but in the later decades, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> the 1960s, when {{significant}} number of Middle Eastern Armenians arrived in the US, Southern California attracted more and more Armenians.|$|E
5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> {{he is not}} financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, {{who had come to}} see her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|An {{event of}} grave {{embarrassment to the}} Soviet Union came in October 1981 when one of its {{submarines}} ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. As this was a militarily sensitive location, Sweden took an aggressive stance on the incident, detaining the Whiskey-class sub for two weeks as they awaited an official explanation from Moscow. Eventually it was released, but Stockholm refused to accept Soviet claims that this was merely an accident, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> numerous unidentified submarines had been spotted near the Swedish coast. Sweden also announced that radiation had been detected emanating from the submarine and they believed it to be carrying nuclear missiles. Moscow would neither confirm nor deny this and instead merely accused the Swedes of espionage.|$|E
5|$|Efforts were {{underway}} in 1997 to secure {{federal funding for}} the highway and other infrastructure near the Mexican border, largely supported by Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Bob Filner, and Representative Bud Schuster, {{the chairman of the}} House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, visited the region before giving informal approval to the proposal. In 1999, Governor Gray Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E
5|$|Fears of an Ottoman attack {{rose again}} {{after the fall of}} Candia in 1669, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited the military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga to improve the fortifications. At the time the Floriana Lines were still under construction, and a number of weak points had been identified in their original design, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> the demi-bastions forming the two extremities of the land front were too acute and could not be well defended. Valperga attempted to correct these flaws by making a number of alterations to San Salvatore Bastion on the western end of the lines, and constructing a faussebraye around the entire land front and a crowned hornwork near the eastern end. In the 1680s some minor modifications were made by the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh.|$|E
50|$|Aurland has {{rich and}} varied flora, {{which is more}} typical of eastern rather than western Norway. The {{mountain}} plant life is <b>especially</b> rich <b>since</b> the bedrock contains calcium rich deposits of phyllite.|$|R
5000|$|The band, {{and lead}} singer Jon Toogood <b>especially,</b> have <b>since</b> {{expressed}} displeasure with the album, calling it [...] "overproduced", and [...] "bullshit --- that would've been the wrong album {{to be big}} on." ...|$|R

5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result of}} defective casting, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
5|$|She {{was sent}} to Portsmouth {{after the end of}} the war where she was made {{available}} to investigate the cause of her sister ship Glattons magazine explosion. She was paid off on 31 August 1919 and joined the Reserve Fleet in September. She was offered back to the Norwegians, but they rejected her as unsuitable to their requirements, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> she was now too broad for their dock at Horten. Several attempts were made to sell her, but she was disarmed in 1922 and used as a target ship to evaluate the effects of bombs bursting underwater near a ship and the effects of six-inch gunfire. She was finally sold for scrap on 26 August 1928 and broken up at the former naval dockyard at Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|The stolen {{works were}} {{originally}} purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) and {{intended to be}} left on permanent display at the museum {{with the rest of}} her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were stolen, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> more valuable artwork was untouched. Among the stolen works was The Concert, one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $200 million. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only known seascape. Other works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were also stolen.|$|E
50|$|What would {{generally}} be an unfavourable environment for vegetation, this area experiences high floral diversity. Springbok is <b>especially</b> fascinating <b>since</b> {{almost half of}} the plant species here are found nowhere else in the world.|$|R
50|$|Upper Fruitland {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Fruitland, New Mexico which is located across the San Juan River. This is <b>especially</b> true <b>since</b> Upper Fruitland is inside the boundaries of the Navajo Reservation but Fruitland is not.|$|R
5000|$|In GF(2m), {{addition}} is <b>especially</b> easy, <b>since</b> addition and subtraction modulo 2 are {{the same}} thing (so like terms [...] "cancel out"), and furthermore this operation {{can be done in}} hardware using the basic XOR logic gate.|$|R
5|$|The toothcomb in lemurs {{normally}} {{consists of}} six teeth (four incisors and two canines), although indriids, monkey lemurs, and some sloth lemurs {{only have a}} four-tooth toothcomb due {{to the loss of}} either a canine or an incisor. Because the lower canine is either included in the toothcomb or lost, the lower dentition can be difficult to read, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> the first premolar (P2) is often shaped like a canine (caniniform) to fill the canine's role. In folivorous (leaf-eating) lemurs, except for indriids, the upper incisors are greatly reduced or absent. Used together with the toothcomb on the mandible (lower jaw), this complex is reminiscent of an ungulate browsing pad.|$|E
5|$|These ongoing {{victories}} belied {{the changing}} conditions applicable to Levants hunt for enemy vessels off Gibraltar. American vessels had become scarce, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> Spain had closed her ports {{to them in}} the winter of 1777 in retaliation for privateer attacks on Spanish ships. French trading vessels remained at sea but were occasionally accompanied by naval escorts large enough to prevent their capture by Gibraltar's small Royal Navy squadron. Levant was careened on a beach at Gibraltar over Christmas 1778 and then returned to sea, but her next capture was not until 14 March 1779 when in company with Captain Rich's Enterprise she seized a French vessel, Thésée. A further victory followed on 1 April when Levant, still in company with Enterprise, took Eclair, a French xebec carrying wine and brandy from Marseilles.|$|E
5|$|When the Roman fleet reached Africa, {{a council}} was held aboard Belisarius' {{flagship}} (The Vandalic War, I.15), {{where many of}} his officers advocated an immediate attack on Carthage itself, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> {{it was the only}} fortified city in the Vandal realm, the walls of the other cities having been torn down to prevent a rebellion. Belisarius, however, mindful of the fate of the 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with the Vandal fleet, spoke against it. Thus the army disembarked and built a fortified camp to spend the night.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s, more hobbyists {{have focused}} on using kiln-fused glass to make beads and {{components}} for jewellery. This has become <b>especially</b> popular <b>since</b> the introduction of glass manufactured for the specific purpose of fusing in a kiln.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, in {{collaboration}} with Peter Marino, Pei came out of retirement to re-design the 52nd Penthouse Suite floor. This is <b>especially</b> significant <b>since</b> Peter Marino is known to refuse collaboration in any hotel or resort development projects.|$|R
5000|$|Young Roberta [...] "Bobby" [...] Carter, {{only eight}} years old, catches her mother Joan as she kisses {{a man who}} isn't her father in a park. She is <b>especially</b> embarrassed, <b>since</b> her friends are present and {{recognize}} her mother.|$|R
