25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> link lead (ECU to <b>fuse</b> <b>box),</b> throttle body to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{company also}} carried out {{modifications}} to many FTOs {{during the period}} in which they were imported to the UK via that company, based at King Street in Dudley. These included installation of an aftermarket rear fog-light and its illuminated dashboard switch to meet UK legislation (Not OEM, or a requirement in Japan). The Company may also have fitted an 'English' text version of <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> cover in the engine bay, and/or a RalliArt oil cap.|$|E

The mitigation of the magnetic field that was achieved after covering the low-voltage (LV) <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes</b> with thin aluminum plates is also presented. The mean attenuation achieved is approximately 23 % during spring and 18 % during the summer at the region of up to 30 cm from the substations and at a height of 1. 0 m from the ground, at the measuring points near the LV <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes.</b> All of the measured magnetic-field values that were observed were lower in comparison with those specified as limits and introduced by ICNIRP.

25|$|As {{commonly}} used, 10-30 and 10-50 plugs {{required the}} frame of the appliance to be indirectly grounded via a strap connecting to the neutral blade. Safe operation relied on the neutral conductor in turn being connected to system ground at the circuit breaker or <b>fuse</b> <b>box.</b> If the neutral conductor were to break, disconnect, or develop high resistance, the appliance frame could become energized to dangerous voltages. Modern practice is to require a separate safety grounding conductor whose only purpose is to divert unsafe voltages, and which does not carry significant current during normal operation.|$|E
25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of The Things gameplay is the inclusion of multiple NPCs who join Blake at various points throughout the game. At any one time, the player can control up to four characters; Blake and three NPCs. There are three types of NPC in the game; engineers, soldiers and medics. Engineers can repair fuse boxes, which control locked doors, computers and save points. Soldiers have more health, and are better shots than engineers or medics. They are thus more suited to combat. Medics are capable of healing both Blake and any other injured NPCs, and carry unlimited health packs. The player can issue basic commands to each NPC, such as ordering them to follow Blake, ordering them remain where they are, ordering them to give Blake their weapon, and, {{in the case of}} engineers, ordering them to fix a <b>fuse</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Limiter fuses {{consist of}} a metal strip from a lock plate, for {{currents}} over 40 amperes. Frequently, these are used {{in close proximity to}} starter battery <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes.</b> They are used also in electric vehicles, e.g., in forklift trucks. Because strip fuses require the use of tools for replacement they are therefore legally considered non-serviceable components for end-users.|$|R
25|$|The {{distribution}} board system used in Irish homes also differs substantially from {{those used in}} the UK and elsewhere. All {{distribution board}}s (<b>fuse</b> <b>boxes)</b> are required to have a 'main fuse' or 'main breaker' rated at the maximum permissible load for that installation. Typically, this is a 63 A fuse and a switch, or a Minized fuse isolator which accepts a Neozed fuse.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fuse</b> <b>Boxes</b> {{normally}} use cartridge or rewirable fuses with {{no other}} protective device, and basic 4-ways boxes are very common. Some older boxes are made of brown-black bakelite, sometimes with a wooden base. Although their design is historic, these were standard equipment for new installs {{as recently as the}} 1980s, so they are very common. Fuseholders in these boxes may not provide protection from accidental contact with live terminals.|$|R

Skinner suspends Mulder, but Mulder vows to prove his theory right. He talks with Modell's therapist again, who mentions that a nun from the Little Sisters of Charity had called him a [...] "conquered warrior". On a hunch, Mulder tries to show her a picture of Linda. The phone rings and, after stating she is with Mulder, she sticks her hand into a <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> and is fatally electrocuted.|$|E
500|$|The chase scene {{involving}} Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as {{the crew}} had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a [...] "mechanical trip" [...] to support an electrical cable, which he then strung {{to the other side}} of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> with [...] "sparking devices", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, [...] "What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable will go up, sparking down to the ground." [...] Misiano said of the sequence, [...] "This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up. It really blew!" [...] The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, [...] "that was actually really scary" [...] to film. After he filmed his character hitting Joseph with a crow bar, actor Joshua Jackson joked, [...] "Finally I'm going to get a little respect on this set." ...|$|E
2500|$|Austin has {{a strong}} theater culture, with dozens of {{itinerant}} and resident companies producing a variety of work. [...] The Church of the Friendly Ghost is a volunteer-run arts organization supporting creative expression and counter-culture community. The city also has live performance theater venues such as the Zachary Scott Theatre Center, Vortex Repertory Company, Salvage Vanguard Theater, Rude Mechanicals' the Off Center, Austin Playhouse, Scottish Rite Children's Theater, Hyde Park Theatre, the Blue Theater, The Hideout Theatre, and Esther's Follies. The Victory Grill was a renowned venue on the Chitlin' circuit. Public art and performances in the parks and on bridges are popular. Austin hosts the <b>Fuse</b> <b>Box</b> Festival each April featuring international, leading-edge theater artists.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} electric distribution {{lines in}} Appleton {{were made of}} bare copper. This posed many challenges in the early development of commercial electricity, because just about everything was made out of wood or other flammable materials. The wiring used in buildings was insulated by {{a thin layer of}} cotton and was fastened to walls using wood cleats. Likewise, wood was used for <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes,</b> light sockets, and switch handles.|$|R
2500|$|In the UK, older {{electrical}} consumer units (also called <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes)</b> are fitted {{either with}} semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuses [...] or cartridge fuses [...] (Fuse wire is commonly supplied to consumers as short lengths of 5A-, 15A- and 30A-rated wire wound {{on a piece}} of cardboard.) [...] Modern consumer units usually contain miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) instead of fuses, though cartridge fuses are sometimes still used, as in some applications MCBs are prone to nuisance tripping.|$|R
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes</b> that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|R
2500|$|The 1979 VAM Pacer {{was exactly}} as the 1978 model {{in terms of}} appearance, with the {{exceptions}} of the previously standard wheel covers and a new hood bright molding with front ornament. All VAM Pacers were featured VAM's inhouse five-spoke wheels with trim rings and chrome volcano hubcaps with exposed lug nuts. New seat designs with a horizontally stripped pattern and Barcelona crests on the headrests as a luxury touch (the same ones used in the AMC Matador Barcelona models), a new steering wheel design with a soft rectangular center button, all-new door panels designs in plastic and vinyl with a rigid top pull strap and sliding locks with woodgrain accents. The headliner was changed to a cloth-wrapped unit. VAM started using {{for the first time}} the net rating system for measuring the output of its engines. This meant that the 1979 VAM [...] six-cylinder engine was now rated at [...] at 3900 rpm. The electrical system was revised with a new <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> located under the dashboard on the driver's side. A total of 369 VAM Pacers were sold.|$|E

50|$|A {{common design}} of <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> that was {{featured}} on homes built from 1940 to 1965 was the 60-amp <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> that featured four plug fuses (i.e. Edison base) for branch circuits {{and one or}} more fuse blocks containing cartridge fuses for purposes such as major appliance circuits. After 1965, the more substantial 100 A panel with three-wire (230 V) service became common; a <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> could have fuse blocks for the main shut-off and an electric range circuit plus a number of plug fuses (Edison base or Type S) for individual circuits.|$|E

5000|$|As well as {{releasing}} surges {{of electromagnetic}} energy, Static can also drain sources of electricity, such as power lines, batteries and <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes</b> to recharge/replenish his own energy supply. Whenever Static has used his powers {{to a high}} degree, or experience any other such large energy-drain, he will also experience a sudden, acute sense of fatigue, as his electromagnetic powers are tied into his own bioelectric energy levels. In the episode [...] "Aftershock", in the 1st season of the animated series, an analysis of his blood shows that Static's electrolytes/blood-salt levels are higher-than-normal, highlighting that Static needs higher blood-salt levels to {{support the use of}} his powers, but the higher sodium levels seem to have no effect on his health.|$|R

50|$|Wireless range may be {{substantially}} affected by {{objects in the}} way of the signal and by the quality of the antenna. Large electrical appliances, such as refrigerators, <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes,</b> metal plumbing, and air conditioning units can impede a wireless network signal. The theoretical maximum range of IEEE 802.11 is only reached under ideal circumstances and true effective range is typically about half of the theoretical range. Specifically, the maximum throughput speed is only achieved at extremely close range (less than 25 ft or so); at the outer reaches of a device's effective range, speed may decrease to around 1 Mbit/s before it drops out altogether. The reason is that wireless devices dynamically negotiate the top speed at which they can communicate without dropping too many data packets.|$|R
