The most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by William Crookes. That tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury vacuum pump created by Hermann Sprengel. Research conducted by Crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the electron in 1897 by J. J. Thomson and X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Roentgen. But the Crookes tube, as it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated luminescence.|$|E

In his March 1893 St. Louis lecture, Tesla demonstrated a wireless system {{that was the first}} use of tuned circuits in radio, although he used it for wireless power transmission, not radio communication. A grounded spark-excited capacitor-tuned Tesla transformer attached to an elevated wire antenna transmitted radio waves, which were received across the room by a wire antenna attached to a receiver consisting of a second grounded resonant transformer tuned to the transmitter's frequency, which lighted a <b>Geissler</b> <b>tube.</b> This system, patented by Tesla on September 2, 1897, was the first use of the [...] "four-circuit" [...] concept later claimed by Guglielmo Marconi. However, Tesla was mainly interested in wireless power and never developed a practical radio communication system. He never believed that radio waves could be used for practical communication, instead clinging to an erroneous theory that radio communication was due to currents in the Earth.|$|E

Initially the lamp generated white light by using a <b>Geissler</b> <b>tube</b> filled with carbon dioxide. However, the carbon dioxide tended to break down.

50|$|The {{father of}} the {{low-pressure}} gas discharge tube was German glassblower Heinrich Geissler, who beginning in 1857 constructed colorful artistic cold cathode tubes with different gases in them which glowed with many different colors, called <b>Geissler</b> <b>tubes.</b> It was found that inert gases like the noble gases neon, argon, krypton or xenon, as well as carbon dioxide worked well in tubes. This technology was commercialized by French engineer Georges Claude in 1910 and became neon lighting, used in neon signs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Geissler</b> <b>tubes</b> {{had enough}} air {{in them that}} the {{electrons}} could only travel a tiny distance before colliding with an atom. The electrons in these tubes moved in a slow diffusion process, never gaining much speed, so these tubes didn't produce cathode rays. Instead they produced a colorful glow discharge (as in a modern neon light), caused when the electrons or ions struck gas atoms, exciting their orbital electrons to higher energy levels. The electrons released this energy as light. This process is called fluorescence.|$|R

Radio waves {{generated by the}} Hertzian spark-gap oscillator at right travel down the parallel wires. The wires are short-circuited together at the left end, reflecting the waves back up the wires toward the oscillator, creating a standing wave of voltage along the line. The voltage goes to zero at nodes located at multiples of a half-wavelength from the end. The nodes were found by sliding a <b>Geissler</b> <b>tube,</b> a small glow discharge tube like a neon light, {{up and down the}} line (two are shown on the line). The high voltage on the line makes the tube glow. When the tube reaches a node, the voltage goes to zero and the tube goes out. The measured distance between two successive nodes is multiplied by two to get the wavelength λ of the radio waves. The line is shown truncated in the drawing; the length of the line was actually 6 meters (18 feet). The radio waves produced by the oscillator were in the UHF range, with a wavelength of several meters. The inset shows types of <b>Geissler</b> <b>tube</b> used with Lecher lines.|$|E
