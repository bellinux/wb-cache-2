50|$|The earlier {{discovery}} of plasmons created {{the view that}} metal at plasmon frequency fp is a composite material. The effect of plasmons on any metal sample is to create properties in the metal such that it can behave as a dielectric, independent of the wave vector of the EM <b>excitation</b> (<b>radiation)</b> field. Furthermore, a minute-fractionally small amount of plasmon energy is absorbed into the system denoted as γ. For aluminium fp = 15 eV, and γ = 0.1 eV. Perhaps the most important result of the interaction of metal and the plasma frequency is that permittivity is negative below the plasma frequency, {{all the way to}} the minute value of γ.|$|E
5000|$|Photothermal {{deflection}} spectroscopy {{is a kind}} of spectroscopy {{that measures}} the change in refractive index due to heating of a medium by light. It works via a sort of [...] "mirage effect" [...] where a refractive index gradient exists adjacent to the test sample surface. A probe laser beam is refracted or bent in a manner proportional to the temperature gradient of the transparent medium near the surface. From this deflection, a measure of the absorbed <b>excitation</b> <b>radiation</b> can be determined. The technique is useful when studying optically thin samples, because sensitive measurements can be obtained of whether absorption is occurring. It is of value in situations where [...] "pass through" [...] or transmission spectroscopy can't be used.|$|E
5000|$|In both {{collinear}} and transverse PDS, {{the surface}} is heated using a periodically modulated light source, such as an optical beam passing through a mechanical chopper or regulated with a function generator.

In that case, a boxcar average {{can be used to}} measure the temporal deflection of the probe beam to the <b>excitation</b> <b>radiation.</b> The signal falls off exponentially as a function of frequency, so frequencies around 1-10 hertz are frequently used. A full theoretical analysis of the PDS system was published by Jackson, Amer, et al. in 1981.

5000|$|Efficiency of UCNPs doped {{with only}} {{activators}} is usually low, {{due to their}} low absorption cross section and necessary low concentration. Sensitizer ions are doped into the host lattice along with the activator ions in UCNPs to facilitate Electron Transfer Upconversion. The most commonly used sensitizer ion is trivalent Yb3+. This ion provides a much larger absorption cross-section for incoming near-IR radiation, while only displaying a single excited 4f state.
