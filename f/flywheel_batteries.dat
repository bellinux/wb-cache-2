40|$|With {{advances}} in carbon composite material, magnetic bearings, microprocessors, and high-speed power switching devices, work has begun on a space qualifiable Energy Momentum Wheel (EMW). An EMW is {{a device that}} can be used on a satellite to store energy, like a chemical battery, and manage angular momentum, like a reaction wheel. These combined functions are achieved by the simultaneous and balanced operation of two or more energy storage flywheels. An energy storage flywheel typically consists of a carbon composite rotor driven by a brushless DC motor/generator. Each rotor has a relatively large angular moment of inertia and is suspended on magnetic bearings to minimize energy loss. The use of <b>flywheel</b> <b>batteries</b> on spacecraft will increase system efficiencies (mass and power), while reducing design-production time and life-cycle cost. This paper will present a discussion of flywheel battery design considerations and a simulation of spacecraft system performance utilizing four <b>flywheel</b> <b>batteries</b> to combine energy storage and momentum management for a typical LEO satellite.

40|$|Abstract — Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs) {{offer an}} {{alternative}} to conventional ball bearings. Their main advantages stem {{from the lack of}} physical contact between the rotor and the stator, and their potential for active disturbance rejection. AMBs are indispensable for high-speed electromechanical <b>flywheel</b> <b>batteries,</b> which have been proposed recently as a replacement of chemical batteries on-board orbiting satellites. In order to be competitive with chemical batteries, these <b>flywheel</b> <b>batteries</b> must operate at very high speeds and have low dissipative losses. Low-losses imply AMB operation in low flux or current bias. In this paper we analyze the disturbance rejection properties of a recently proposed low-bias AMB controller subject to an imbalance force. We use describing functions to analyze and predict the magnitude of position oscillations of the AMB under the imbalance force. I...|$|E
40|$|Control Designs for Low-Loss Active Magnetic Bearings: Theory and Implementation Brian C. D. Wilson 327 Pages Directed by Dr. Panagiotis Tsiotras and Dr. Bonnie Heck-Ferri Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) {{have been}} {{proposed}} for use in Electromechanical <b>Flywheel</b> <b>Batteries.</b> In these devices, kinetic energy is stored in a magnetically levitated flywheel which spins in a vacuum. The AMB eliminates all mechanical losses, however, electrical loss, hich {{is proportional to the}} square of the magnetic flux, is still significant. For fficient operation, the flux bias, which is typically introduced into the electromagnets to improve the AMB stiffness, must be reduced, preferably to zero. This zero-bias (ZB) mode of operation cripples the classical control techniques which are customarily used and nonlinear control is required. As a compromise between AMB stiffness and efficiency, a new flux bias scheme is proposed called the generalized complementary flux condition(gcfc). A flux-bias dependent trade-off exists between AMB stiffness, power consumption, and power loss. This work theoretically develops and experimentally verifies new low-loss AMB control designs which employ the gcfc condition. Particular attention is paid to the removal of the singularity present in the standard nonlinear control techniques when operating in ZB. Experimental verification is conduced on a 6 -DOF AMB reaction wheel. Practical aspects of the gcfc implementation such as flux measurement and flux-bias implementation with voltage mode amplifiers using IR compensation are investigated. Comparisons are made between the gcfc bias technique and the standard constant-flux-sum (cfs) bias method. Under typical operating circumstances, theoretical analysis and experimental data show that the new gcfc bias scheme is more efficient in producing the control flux required for rotor stabilization than the ordinary cfs bias strategy.

This crisis has escalated the power disruptions, which have had adverse effects on various sectors.

40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) design layout was completed. The intended application was for coupling the flywheel to the driveline of a <b>flywheel</b> <b>battery</b> hybrid electric vehicle. The requirements were that the CVT accommodate flywheel speeds from 14, 000 to 28, 000 rpm and driveline speeds of 850 to 5000 rpm without slipping.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{experimental}} {{issues associated with}} the implementation of the recently developed generalized complementary flux constraint (GCFC) flux-biasing scheme on a spacecraft reaction wheel that is magnetically suspended by a low-loss active magnetic bearing (AMB). Implementation of the GCFC depends fundamentally on the ability to estimate the electromagnet flux. Once addressed, other fundamental issues including the synthesis of a (possibly time-varying) bias flux and the realization of the state-dependent, voltage-switching rule that imposes the GCFC are studied. Significant filtering is required to obtain clean flux measurements and avoid spurious voltage switchings. Open-loop tests experimentally verify that the voltage-switching rule imposes the GCFC flux constraints on the operation of the electromagnets. A passivity-based control algorithm is used to illustrate the closed-loop functioning of the GCFC in large-bias and zero-bias modes of operation to demonstrate the effect of the bias flux on the closed-loop bearing stiffness, damping, and flux slew-rate.

The electromagnets of the AMB are constrained by a generalized complementary flux constraint (GCFC). This constraint allows one to operate the AMB with a large bias flux, to obtain a desired bearing stiffness and force slew-rate, or with a very small (or even zero) bias flux for low-loss AMB operation. Experimental evidence is provided to illustrate {{the role of the}} flux bias in the control design and highlight the singularity issues associated with zero- and very low-bias AMB operation. Specifically, the tradeoff between bearing stiffness, power consumption, and power dissipation {{as a function of the}} bias is verified.

In order to verify the performance of the 3 -DOF PMBMB, the radial force mathematical model and the coupling determination equations of radial two DOF are calculated according to an equivalent magnetic circuit, and radial–axial coupling is analyzed through finite element analysis. Moreover, a control system is presented to solve the control problems in practical applications. The rotor returns to the balanced position in 0.05 s and maintains stable suspension.

It introduces a system of computer models, known as the Oxford Vehicle Model (OVEM), which provide for the novel simulation of the powertrains of electric (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). OVEM has a three-level structure that makes a unique contribution {{to the field of}} vehicle analysis by enabling a user to proceed from performing scoping and sizing exercises through to accurately simulating the energy flows in powertrains of EVs and HEVs utilizing existing and emerging technologies based on real world data. Level 1 uses simplified models to support initial component scoping and sizing exercises in an analysis environment where uncertainty regarding component specifications is high. Level 2 builds on Level 1 by obtaining more refined component scoping and sizing estimates via the use of component models based on well-understood scientific principles that are product-independent – a crucial feature for obtaining unbiased scoping and sizing estimates. Level 3 employs a high degree of fidelity in that its models impose actual physical limits and are based on data from real technologies. This dissertation concludes with two chapters based on studies published as journal articles that used OVEM to address key issues facing the development of EVs and HEVs.
