The many streams that <b>emanate</b> <b>from</b> the glaciers and from springs at its base flow into two more major river systems, the Cispus River and the Klickitat River. The streams on the north and west portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the Cowlitz River near Riffe Lake, and the Lewis River.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} {{songs on}} the soundtrack, or employing a score, The Wire primarily uses pieces of music that <b>emanate</b> <b>from</b> a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot {{of a little girl}} {{sleeping}} in her bed. As the music starts, rays of light <b>emanate</b> <b>from</b> the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music. The sun rises inside a picture on the wall and the girl wakes and starts playing with her doll. A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large, golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout. A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and, interpreting the lyrics of the song, catches a falling star and rides over the moon.|$|E
5|$|Planula larvae exhibit {{positive}} phototaxis, swimming towards {{light to}} reach surface waters, where they drift and grow before descending {{to seek a}} hard surface to which they can attach and begin a new colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards sounds that <b>emanate</b> <b>from</b> the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony, few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually two to three days, but can be up to two months. The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.|$|E

5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to <b>emanate</b> <b>from</b> a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E

The distance from this point to the lens is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.|$|E

25|$|The Feminist (history {{as gender}} struggle) view {{of women in}} the Arab world, and {{in other areas of the}} world, is that such women have {{throughout}} history experienced discrimination and have been subject to restrictions of their freedoms and rights. Some of these practices are based on religious beliefs, but many of the limitations are cultural and <b>emanate</b> <b>from</b> tradition as well as religion. These main constraints that create an obstacle towards women's rights and liberties are reflected in laws dealing with criminal justice, economy, education and healthcare.|$|E
25|$|All honours in Canada <b>emanate</b> <b>from</b> the country's monarch, who is {{regarded}} as the fount of honour. A complex system of orders, decorations, and medals by which Canadians are honoured has evolved. The Victoria Cross, Order of Military Merit, Cross of Valour, Star of Courage, Medal of Bravery are some of the military awards that have been created for Canadians serving in a military capacity. The Victoria Cross has been presented to 94 Canadians and 2 Newfoundlanders between its creation in 1856 and 1993, when the Canadian Victoria Cross was instituted. However, no Canadian has received either honour since 1945.|$|E

The sovereign's representative in Canada, the governor general, administers most of the honours system through the Chancellery of Honours, which {{is a part of the}} Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada. The governor general also sets out, via Order in Council, the order of precedence for the wearing of insignia, decorations, and medals.|$|E

In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.|$|E

25|$|The {{background}} forms a semi-urban {{landscape that}} possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, consistent with Courbevoie of the 1910s (except {{perhaps for the}} rock-like outcrops), a village or town with delicate smokestacks or factory chimneys billowing smoke that blends into the cloudy sky. Evidence that factories were already located on the Seine (billowing smoke) {{can be seen in}} Gleizes' Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie of 1908. The statuesque nudes themselves are highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves, yet they are graceful, balletic and elegant.
