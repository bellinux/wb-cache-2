5|$|There {{are several}} {{missions}} {{in which the}} player controls a motor vehicle. Though the game engine {{is the same as}} the third-person mode, these missions are based on being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle.</b> They usually involve getting to a certain location in a certain time period, often while avoiding pursuers while heading to the end point. Weapons can not be used while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle.</b> While the PDA is not available in these mission types, a map of the city is. Cell phone calls are also sometimes received in these missions.|$|E

5|$|Players use melee attacks, {{firearms}} and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons {{such as the}} Micro Uzi, an M16 rifle and a flamethrower. The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle, rocket launcher and the M16 rifle. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The game gives players {{a wide variety of}} weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
5|$|Transport of gas {{cylinders}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle,</b> for commercial purposes, must follow basic legal safety requirements and, unless specifically exempted, {{must comply with}} ADR.

5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle,</b> which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no evidence to suggest the two incidents were related.|$|E

5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Bell alleged in his 2003 {{lawsuit that}} the {{government}} employees had actually planted an illegal GPS tracking device in his car months before the one ostensibly allowed by the October 2000 warrant, at least as early as Bell's April 2000 release from prison. The information from that prior device could not be used, however, {{because there was no}} warrant allowing it to be planted. Bell also alleged that federal government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand disclosure of all such secretly planted devices.|$|E
5|$|In September 1936, Bill's brother, the Catholic priest Reverend Denny, and his sister, Mary Catherine Denny, were {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> accident in which Mary received fatal injuries. Reverend Denny suffered from an illness {{that resulted from}} the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941. Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, A Digger at Home and Abroad, {{which was published in}} 1941. He continued to practice law until his death, despite difficulties associated with rheumatoid arthritis. He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he returned from his office in Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a state funeral, and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery.|$|E

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has seen enormous {{growth in the}} size and complexity of electrical and electronic system architectures. As complexity increases the problem of diagnosing faults <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> electrical and electronic systems is becoming increasingly difficult. Many faults are {{as a result of}} system-level disturbances or interactions that are difficult to interpret and diagnose using existing component-level diagnostics which have been traditionally focused on mechanical system diagnostics. The problem of rising complexity is exacerbated by increasing in-service warranty periods with some automotive OEMs now offering 5 or 7 year, or even life-time warranties. This paper discusses the need for a new system-level approach to the management of faults <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> networked electronic systems and how this might be achieved by using the data that flows over <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> data networks. This paper compares different industry approaches to system-level health monitoring of complex distributed computing environments and presents a proposal for the application of health monitoring to an automotive electrical and electronic architecture. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

5|$|Leaving behind six {{fatalities}} {{and forty}} more injuries, the tornado maintained its intensity {{as it moved}} into the Talladega National Forest. It downed {{a significant number of}} trees before moving into Bibb County north of Alabama State Highway 25. In Bibb County, the tornado continued moving northeastward through the Talladega National Forest at EF3 intensity, with thousands more trees being knocked down and partially debarked. Almost immediately after exiting the national forest, the tornado directly impacted the small community of Eoline along U.S. Highway 82, northwest of Brent and Centerville. Around one dozen mobile homes and single-family site-built homes were destroyed, while many more sustained anywhere from minor to major damage. Additionally, the Eoline Volunteer Fire Department and another business were destroyed. One fatality occurred in Eoline, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> near the fire department building, along with ten other injuries.|$|E
5|$|Often {{people try}} to avoid or outrun a tornado <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Although cars can travel faster than the average tornado, the {{directive}} from the National Weather Service is for house-dwellers {{in the path of}} a tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle. This is a result of several factors and statistics. An interior room inside a well-built frame house (especially one with a basement) provides a reasonable degree of protection from all but the most violent tornadoes. Underground or above-ground tornado shelters, as well as extremely strong structures such as bank vaults, offer almost complete protection. Cars, on the other hand, can be heavily damaged by even weak tornadoes, and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances, even into buildings. High-profile vehicles such as buses and tractor trailers are even more vulnerable to high winds.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May 1943, {{a forward}} {{detachment}} of the German 1st Mountain Division entered Kolašin and seized Đurišić by deceiving the Italian troops who were guarding his headquarters. Đurišić and the Chetniks did not resist their capture {{and there were}} no casualties. The Italians vigorously protested Đurišić's capture but the Germans overruled them. With the capture of Đurišić's Chetniks and another Chetnik group west of Kolašin a few days later, Case Black became an almost entirely anti-Partisan operation. Đurišić was driven away <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> carrying Red Cross markings; he was then flown from Berane to a prisoner-of-war camp at Stryi in the Lviv region of Galicia which formed part of the German occupation area of the General Government. He escaped three months later and was recaptured by the authorities of the Serbian puppet government in October 1943 while attempting to cross the Danube near Pančevo in southern Banat. He was handed over to the Germans and held in the Gestapo prison in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|The Red Wings {{have also}} made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer {{available}} for issue. However, the numbers are {{not considered to be}} officially retired. Although Aurie's uniform was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris, current team owner Mike Ilitch does not consider the number to be retired. Konstantinov's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
