40|$|Editorial Biofilms {{are defined}} as {{bacterial}} communities surrounded by a structured extracellular polymeric matrix which is adhered to biotic or abiotic surfaces [1]. Biofilm formation develops in two steps: firstly, a primary attachment occurs onto polymeric surfaces, mediated partly by cell-wall associated adhesins; secondly, cell-cell proliferation forms a multilayered biofilm, mediated by production of extracellular factors [2]. In the food industry, bacterial biofilms are considered a main problem especially in dairy, <b>fresh</b> products, <b>poultry</b> and <b>meat</b> processing plants.

This independent consulting firm compared supplier shipment data with point-of-sale data from six large national and regional supermarket retailers to identify loss in 2005 and 2006. The new estimates, when incorporated into the ERS Loss-Adjusted Food Availability data, had little impact on aggregate per capita food loss estimates in 2006 because the new estimates were, on average, close to the previous loss assumptions. The new estimates increased annual per capita estimates of fresh fruit available at the retail level by 0. 7 pounds (0. 6 percent), 4. 2 pounds (2. 7 percent) for fresh vegetables, and 4. 8 pounds (2. 7 percent) for <b>fresh</b> <b>meat,</b> <b>poultry,</b> and seafood.

40|$|Campylobacteriosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bacterial food-borne illnesses in humans. One significant source of infection is the handling and consumption of poultry meat, although other sources also contribute considerably. Controlling Campylobacter in broilers reduces the human burden of illness. Broilers can easily become colonised with Campylobacter and preventive measures in primary production have a limited and unpredictable effect. Vaccination, competitive exclusion, bacteriophage therapy and the use of bacteriocins are not yet commercially available. However, measures in the slaughterhouse can reduce contamination in the final product. At present, the most promising control strategy is to keep colonised and non-colonised flocks separate during slaughter ('scheduled processing'). The virtually Campylobacter-free meat can supply the <b>fresh</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> market, while the meat from infected flocks can be treated to reduce the Campylobacter concentration. Meat from infected flocks can be treated by freezing but chemical decontamination appears to be more cost effective. A variant of this scenario is to treat only highly contaminated meat.

40|$|The Netherlands saw an unexplained {{increase}} in campylobacteriosis incidence between 2003 and 2011, following {{a period of}} continuous decrease.

However, the counterfactual population-attributable fraction for PPIs was largest for the elderly (ca 45 % in 2011) and increased at population level from 8 % in 2004 to 27 % in 2011. Using the regression model and updated covariate values, we predicted a trend break for 2012, largely due to a decreased number of PPI prescriptions, that was subsequently confirmed by surveillance data. Although causality was not shown, the biological mechanism, age effect and trend-break prediction suggest a substantial impact of PPI use on campylobacteriosis incidence in the Netherlands. We chose the ecological study design to pilot whether it is worthwhile to further pursue the effect of PPI on campylobacteriosis and other gastrointestinal pathogens in prospective cohort studies.

40|$|In the {{perspective}} of an announced prohibition to bring Salmonella-contaminated <b>fresh</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> on the retail market as of December 2010, requirements are postulated for rapid methods for detection of Salmonella in poultry meat. These rapid methods should deliver reliable results in time {{to make it possible}} to steer the finished products in poultry slaughterhouses into the direction of the fresh poultry market or into the direction of industrial treatment. The most important requirements are the detection limit (1 cfu/ 25 g), the time of analysis (within hours up to a maximum of 24 h), the sensitivity and specificity, and the validation of the rapid detection method. To determine a requirement for the number of samples to be analyzed per unit of time of the detection methods, a sampling plan for pooling of samples is suggested. Information of commercially available detection methods from literature and data provided by the suppliers was compared to the postulated requirements. The results showed that none of the commercially available detection methods meet all the suggested requirements. For all available methods, the time of analysis is too long to steer the production process in time. This implicates that faster methods should be developed before the announced prohibition can be sensibly introduced. Also, information about sensitivity and specificity, which is essential for the reliability of the rapid test method, should be examined in a more uniform wa...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler {{carcasses}} presenting cachexia, {{as determined}} by the federal inspection agency, were submitted to microbiological, physicochemical, and histological analyses. Over a 2 -month period, 278 carcasses from straight-run flocks of 43 - to 48 -d-old Cobb broilers from two different farms were condemned due to cachexia and subjected to gross examination in the final inspection sector. Out of the 278 carcasses, 131 did not present any gross signs of infection, and were submitted to microbiological analyses (n= 83), physicochemical analyses (n= 28), and viscera and muscle samples of 20 carcasses were evaluated by histology. The microbiological results of cachectic carcasses complied with the current legislation on the consumption of <b>fresh</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>meat.</b> Lower lipid and higher protein, moisture, and volatile matter contents, and higher pH (p< 0. 05) were determined in the cachectic than in the control carcasses from a same flock, but no ash content differences.

The histological analysis showed that 65 % of the cachectic carcasses did not have any muscle injury, 20 % showed mild hyalinization and 15 % moderate proliferation of fibrous connective tissue. The findings of this study indicate the importance of further technical and scientific studies on the utilization of cachectic broiler carcasses for the manufacture of edible products, rather than whole carcasses rendering, thereby preventing the resulting economic losses...|$|E

Campylobacteriosis was the most commonly reported zoonosis. After several years of an increasing European Union (EU) trend, the human campylobacteriosis notification rate has stabilised. In food and animals no EU trends were observed and the occurrence of Campylobacter continued to be high in broiler meat at EU level. The decreasing EU trend in confirmed human salmonellosis cases observed in recent years continued. Most Member States met their Salmonella reduction targets for poultry.

40|$|On the {{surfaces}} of <b>fresh</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> bacteria such as salmonella or campylobacter, which can cause gastrointestinal diseases in humans, are regularly detected. The pathogens can {{be transferred to the}} meat, if they already populated the live animals. In addition, germs can be transferred through cross-contamination during slaughtering, when cutting the meat into pieces and during treatment of the carcasses. In order to avoid infections transferred through contaminated foods, an integrated hygiene concept must be applied throughout the entire meat production process, i. e. from rearing and slaughtering down to the point of sale. Since these measures are, especially for poultry, effective only to a limited extent, a discussion is currently taking place within the European Union on the use of antimicrobial substances such as chlorine dioxide and peroxy acid for the purpose of removing germs from poultry carcasses. So far the use of such chemical substances for the decontamination of poultry carcasses is banned in the EU, because questions of resistance formation and environmental impact have not been conclusively answered. In addition, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge of unwanted health effects which may result from the fact that apart from the pathogenic germs, bacteria naturally occurring on the surface of poultry meat are killed as well.

The selected approach taken was to estimate, based on certain assumptions, possible n and c values of an FSC that performs detecting a similar Salmonella prevalence to that detected by the current PHC with a given degree of certainty. Calculations presented consider both batch and carcass prevalence. Guidance was additionally provided on a possible revision of both the PHC and the FSC when the EU target (1 % or less broiler flocks remaining positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium) would be achieved. If a target for only these two serovars is set for flock prevalence, the impact on the prevalence of Salmonella on carcasses will depend on the relative contribution of those two serovars to all Salmonella serovars. Thus, if the current flock prevalence target is changed to a prevalence target for all serovars there may be a better relationship between the occurrence of flock infection and the prevalence of Salmonella in carcasses. Advice is given on possible changes in both the PHC and the FSC under such low Salmonella flock prevalence scenario.

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare different sample types (both at the farm and the slaughterhouse) and methods (direct culture, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], propidium monoazide [PMA]-qPCR) applied for the quantification of the Campylobacter colonization level. In addition, the applicability of the lateral flow-based immunoassay, Singlepath((R)) Direct Campy Poultry test (Singlepath((R)) test), was evaluated as a rapid method for the qualitative detection of Campylobacter in highly colonized broiler batches. Campylobacter counts differed significantly between sample types collected at farm level (cecal droppings, feces, boot swabs) and at slaughterhouse level (cecal content, fecal material from crates). Furthermore, comparison of Campylobacter counts obtained by different methods (direct culture, qPCR, PMA-qPCR) in cecal droppings revealed significant differences, although this was not observed for cecal-content samples. Evaluation of the Singlepath((R)) test on cecal droppings and cecal-content samples revealed an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, cecal droppings and cecal content are proposed as the most representative sample types for quantification of Campylobacter colonization level of broilers at farm and slaughterhouse, respectively. Direct culture and qPCR are equally sensitive for quantification of Campylobacter in fresh cecal-content samples. PMA treatment before qPCR inhibits the signal from dead Campylobacter cells. Consequently, when samples are extensively stored and/or transported, qPCR is preferred to direct culture and PMA-qPCR. Furthermore, the Singlepath((R)) test offers a convenient alternative method for rapid detection of Campylobacter in highly colonized broiler batches...|$|E

These CC 398 isolates carried SCCmec elements of type IV or V and exhibited spa type t 011, t 034, t 899, t 2346 or t 6574 and either the known dru types dt 2 b, dt 6 j, dt 10 a, dt 10 q, dt 11 a, dt 11 v, and dt 11 ab or the novel dru types dt 6 m, dt 10 as, and dt 10 at. In addition, two MRSA sequence type 9 (ST 9) isolates with a type IV SCCmec cassette, spa type t 1430, and dru type dt 10 a as well as single MRSA ST 5 and ST 1791 isolates with a type III SCCmec cassette, spa type t 002, and dru type dt 9 v were identified. All but two isolates were classified as multiresistant. A wide variety of resistance phenotypes and genotypes were detected. All isolates were negative for the major virulence factors, such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, or exfoliative toxins. In contrast to the MRSA CC 398 isolates, the four ST 9, ST 5, or ST 1791 isolates harbored the egc gene cluster for enterotoxin G, I, M, N, O, and U genes. Although the relevance of contamination of <b>fresh</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> or poultry products with MRSA is currently unclear, the presence of multiresistant and, in part, enterotoxigenic MRSA emphasizes the need for further studies to elucidate possible health hazards for consumers...|$|E
