40|$|Guinea pigs {{infected}} by intradermal injection of living toxigenic diphtheria bacilli and protected by horse antitoxic globulin, given either {{before or after}} infection, develop delayed hypersensitivity of the tuberculin type to diphtherial proteins. The highest degree of hypersensitivity is specifically directed against diphtheria toxin (or toxoid) itself, although smaller delayed skin reactions may be evoked in sensitized animals by other diphtherial proteins common to both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. Animals sensitized to diphtheria toxin by infection with a toxigenic strain in this way react positively to the Schick test and their serum usually contains no detectable antitoxin 2 to 3 weeks after the initial infection. Animals infected with living non-toxigenic diphtheria bacilli become sensitized to proteins common to both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains but do not show sensitivity to toxin. The observations suggest that a minute amount of toxoid, or of toxin comparable to that which might be liberated during infection, might <b>induce</b> the <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>state</b> if injected {{in the form of}} a complex with excess antitoxin.

(Z. -M. Wei, R. J. Laby, C. H. Zumoff, D. W. Bauer, S. Y. He, A. Collmer, S. V. Beer [1992] Science 257 : 85 - 88). Activity of a 49 -kD Mg 2 +-dependent and Ca 2 +-independent kinase in tobacco leaves increased 50 -fold 15 min after infiltration of harpin from Erwinia amylovora (harpinEa). Much less pronounced and more transient activation was detected in water-infiltrated leaves. Biochemical characteristics of the harpinEa-activated protein kinase (HAPK) activity {{are consistent with those}} of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. HAPK is cytosolic and phosphorylates myelin basic protein on serine/threonine residues. Treatment with a protein tyrosine phosphatase completely eliminated HAPK activity, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for posttranslational activation. Sustained HAPK activation after cycloheximide treatment implies that HAPK may be negatively regulated by a translation-dependent mechanism. The extracellular Ca 2 + chelator EGTA or the protein kinase inhibitor K 252 a, infiltrated in planta together with harpinEa, partially blocked HAPK activation.
