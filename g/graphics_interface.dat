In {{standard}} Amstrad livery and priced at £399 {{it was a}} success, capturing more than 25% of the European computer market. It was MS-DOS-based, but with the GEM <b>graphics</b> <b>interface,</b> and later Windows. In 1988 Amstrad attempted {{to make the first}} affordable portable personal computer with the PPC512 and 640 models, introduced a year before the Macintosh Portable. They ran MS-DOS on an 8MHz processor, and the built-in screen could emulate the Monochrome Display Adapter or Color Graphics Adapter. Amstrad's final (and ill-fated) attempts to exploit the Sinclair brand were based on the company's own PCs; a compact desktop PC derived from the PPC 512, branded as the Sinclair PC200, and the PC1512 rebadged as the Sinclair PC500.|$|E

The results also indicated that the combined haptic and <b>graphic</b> <b>interface</b> was less mentally demanding than either the graphic or the haptic interface.

After the birth of the www, the <b>graphic</b> <b>interface</b> of the computer, which was used to design graphic pages, turned also to be a tool to design digital environments. With the emergence of multiuser environments, the <b>graphic</b> <b>interface</b> should not only mediate the relationship man / machine, but also interface the relationship man / man.

40|$|The main {{target of}} this {{research}} was the analysis, design and implementation of a PACS system based on DICOM standard. This project was developed in four stages: Analysis. - identification of the system’s needs based on the Problem Recognition, Shaping and Specification.

Implementation. - creation of the <b>graphic</b> and web <b>interfaces.</b> Testing. - application of images acquisition tests to the <b>graphic</b> <b>interface</b> and information display to the WEB interface. The result was a system with the following characteristics: it manages the patient’s information database; it has the libraries for the different types of images; an image and database server that can give service to multiple clients and that supports the DICOM protocol for the acquisition of medic images loading Composed Information Objects (IOD-Composed); it possesses a <b>graphic</b> <b>interface</b> for the image acquisition – the system shows the information of the patient, medical research, equipment, series, and image according to the user (Visualizer) request, using a WEB interface; Mechanisms were implemented for the privacy protection of the system, controlling the access to the database through SSL.
