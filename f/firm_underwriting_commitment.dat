40|$|There seem to {{be little}} discussions on the {{influences}} of different underwriting mechanisms on offering prices. Under different underwriting mechanisms, the issuer, the investment bank and the investor will consider the offering prices based on his own benefit. As a result, the offering price is affected by different underwriting mechanisms. In China, most of the stock IPO {{takes the form of}} stand-by underwriting. Because of the huge demand on the new share issue from Chinese investors, the investment bank almost has not unsold stocks to underwrite. Therefore, there is no big difference in the risk that the investment bank faces between the <b>firm</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>underwriting</b> and best-effort underwriting. As a result, when the Chinese investment bank is allowed to participate in the procedure of pricing offering price, the pricing behavior of the investment bank has no big difference in the two risk- similar mechanisms. Considering different advantage and suitability of different mechanisms, China needs to change the single underwriting mechanism situation and encourage the practice of the <b>firm</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>underwriting</b> mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The monthly {{volatility}} of IPO initial returns is substantial, fluctuates dramatically over time, and is considerably larger during "hot" IPO markets. Consistent with IPO theory, the {{volatility of}} initial returns is higher among firms whose value {{is more difficult to}} estimate, i. e., among firms with higher information asymmetry. Our findings highlight underwriters' difficulty in valuing companies characterized by high uncertainty, and, as a result, raise serious questions about the efficacy of the traditional <b>firm</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>underwritten</b> IPO process. One implication of our results is that alternate mechanisms, such as auctions, may be beneficial, particularly for firms that value price discovery over the auxiliary services provided by underwriters. ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{initial public}} {{offering}} is when a company issues public stock newly to investors, called an [...] "IPO" [...] for short. A company can later issue more new shares, or issue shares that have been previously registered in a shelf registration. These later new issues are also sold in the primary market, {{but they are not}} considered to be an IPO but are often called a [...] "secondary offering". Issuers usually retain investment banks to assist them in administering the IPO, obtaining SEC (or other regulatory body) approval of the offering filing, and selling the new issue. When the investment bank buys the entire new issue from the issuer at a discount to resell it at a markup, it is called a <b>firm</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>underwriting.</b> However, if the investment bank considers the risk too great for an underwriting, it may only assent to a best effort agreement, where the investment bank will simply do its best to sell the new issue.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{evidence}} that the post-issue accounting profitability of <b>firms</b> <b>underwritten</b> by bank affiliated underwriters that are also borrowers from the same bank in the IPO (Initial Public Offerings) year is significantly better than average, but that the stock price performance of these firms {{during the first year}} following the IPO is lower than average. Furthermore, the stock price performance of firms whose equity is purchased by an investment fund that is affiliated with the underwriting and lending bank is even lower. We interpret this as evidence that universal banks use their superior information regarding <b>underwritten</b> <b>firms</b> to float the cherries, not the lemons, but that the combination of bank lending, underwriting, and investment fund management results in conflict of interest.

50|$|The {{cost and}} {{schedule}} reduction and decreased litigation associated with design-build project delivery {{have been demonstrated}} repeatedly. Researches on Selecting Project Delivery Systems by Victor Sanvido and Mark Konchar of Pennsylvania State University found that design-build projects are delivered 33.5% faster than projects that are designed and built under separate contracts (design-bid-build). Sanvido and Konchar also showed that design-build projects are constructed 12% faster* and have a unit cost that is 6.1% lower than design-bid-build projects. Similar cost and time savings were found in a comparison study of design-build, and design-bid-build for the water/wastewater construction industry, a peer-reviewed paper authored by Smith Culp Consulting that {{will be published in}} July 2011 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

30|$|Panel B of Table 4 further {{presents}} the OLS results {{used to analyze}} the effects of entrepreneurs’ possession of foreign residency rights on post-IPO 3 -year BHAR. A main variable of interest in the regression models is an indicator variable, TREATED, which takes the value 1 if the sample firm has at least one leaving entrepreneur among its controlling persons and 0 otherwise. Market-adjusted underpricing, firm size, ROA, leverage and IPO offer size are also included in our regression model to control for firm fundamental characteristics. We include an indicator variable, LEADUNDERWRITER, to control for the effects of lead underwriter on BHAR, which equals 1 if the sample <b>firm</b> is <b>underwritten</b> by one of top 10 underwriters that are ranked according to the market share of underwritten new share issues in the previous year. We also include industry (classified by China Securities Regulatory Commission, CSRC) and year fixed effects. The coefficient on TREATED in Column (1), which uses full sample firms in the regression, is −[*] 17.6 % and is significant at the 1 % level, indicating that compared with firms controlled by staying entrepreneurs, those firms controlled by leaving entrepreneurs are more likely to perform worse in the long run. The above result is consistent with our univariate analysis. All other variables in the regression model are loaded with coefficients that are generally consistent with theoretical predictions. For example, firms with greater underpricing, larger firm size and higher IPO offer size are more likely to perform worse in the long run, but <b>firms</b> <b>underwritten</b> by lead underwriters tend to perform better in the long run, which corroborates the theory of lead underwriter certification (Carter et al. 1998).|$|R

40|$|I provide {{evidence}} that following deregulation allowing for private information transfers within banks, an underwriter is better able to certify a seasoned equity issue {{if it has a}} lending relationship with the firm. An unexpected announcement of being <b>underwritten</b> by the <b>firm’s</b> lending-relationship bank reduces ex-post information asymmetry and improves the announcement return. Consistent with this enhanced certification effect, firms reveal a preference for lending-relationship banks as underwriters. In turn, these banks select which <b>firms</b> to <b>underwrite</b> based on their private information about the firm and strategically set lower fees the more favorable that information is. Also consistent with their higher certification ability, lending relationships are associated with a fee premium after controlling for the effect of private information on the firm-underwriter match.
