It {{is found}} in the {{tropical}} New World from southern Mexico south to Brazil, and on Trinidad. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Chlorophanes. The purplish honeycreeper (Chlorophanes purpurascens), a bird from Venezuela known only from the type specimen, is now thought to be an intergeneric hybrid between the <b>green</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> and either the red-legged honeycreeper or the blue dacnis.|$|E

It is less heavily {{dependent}} on nectar than the other honeycreepers, fruit being its main food (60%), with nectar (20%) and insects (15%) as less important components of its diet.|$|E
50|$|The purplish {{honeycreeper}} (Chlorophanes purpurascens) is {{a bird in}} the Thraupidae, or tanager family. It {{is known}} only from the type specimen, a trade-skin held in the British Museum, and {{is thought to be}} an intergeneric hybrid between the <b>green</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> (Chlorophanes spiza) and either the red-legged honeycreeper (Cyanerpes cyaneus) or the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana), though Hellmayr, in his Catalogue of birds of the Americas and the adjacent islands, considered it a good species.|$|E
