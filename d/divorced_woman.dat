However, later that year Edward {{revealed}} his desire to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a <b>divorced</b> <b>woman</b> and remain king. Edward abdicated to marry Simpson, and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the House of Windsor.|$|E

5|$|Edward became king on his father's {{death in}} early 1936. However, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among {{politicians}} by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced {{her first husband}} and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that a <b>divorced</b> <b>woman</b> with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, {{which at the time}} disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew that the British government, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent that he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.|$|E
40|$|Objective: In this study, it {{is aimed}} to {{investigate}} efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in <b>divorced</b> <b>women.</b> For this aim, it was evaluated levels of depression, anxiety and loneliness by pre and post therapy. Method: Study sample {{was obtained from}} a special family consulting center. The sample of the study consisted of 7 <b>divorced</b> <b>women.</b> The participants was selected from <b>women</b> whom was <b>divorced</b> between 0 - 2 years. Among <b>divorced</b> <b>women</b> a CBT intervention program was used. This study was a pilot study about <b>divorced</b> <b>women</b> in Turkey. In this study, sociodemographic data questionnaire, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and UCLA loneliness were administered. For the aim of evaluating the CBT intervention among <b>divorced</b> <b>women</b> before and after CBT sessions all the questionnaires was applied. Results: For the data analyse Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used. All the study questionnaires was compared pre and post therapy. It was found that, both depression (z= - 2, 64 p< 0, 01), anxiety (z= - 2, 08 p< 0, 05) and loneliness levels (z= - 3, 34 p< 0, 001) were significantly reduced after CBT sessions in the study sample of <b>divorced</b> <b>women.</b> Conclusion: Depression, anxiety and loneliness levels were reduced significantly after CBT sessions therefore it is interpreted that CBT was effective in <b>divorced</b> <b>women.</b> Many research in the literature highlights that divorce effected negatively on women and many common psychological problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness were been occured.

25|$|A {{priest of}} Aaron's lineage (i.e. Kohen) is {{forbidden}} by the Mosaic Law (Torah) {{to marry a}} <b>divorced</b> <b>woman</b> even {{if she were a}} native Israelite. Likewise, a male descendant from Aaron's line is prohibited to marry a Jewish woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew, whether she had been raped or she had willfully done so. So, too, he cannot marry a Jewish woman whose birth was by a father who is a Kohen but who violated one of these prohibitions. If he went ahead and did one of these three things, his male issue born from such union is no longer a priest (i.e. Kohen), but rather becomes a Ḥallal (Lev. 21:7, 14) - a term designating one who is no longer a priest, but profaned. A priest must maintain an untainted lineage, and his mother must be of Jewish birth. If he married a non-Jewish woman from the gentile nations, his children are no longer priests, but gentiles. Had a priest of Aaron's lineage transgressed this prohibition and married a <b>divorced</b> <b>woman,</b> and they had children together, all of his female issue - whether his, or his sons, or his grandchildren - would be prohibited from marrying into the priestly stock for all generations.|$|E

The Church would not {{recognise}} the marriage of a <b>divorced</b> <b>woman</b> with a living ex-husband as valid.

500|$|Divorce: According to the Catholic New American Bible translation, Jesus taught, [...] "whoever divorces {{his wife}} (unless the {{marriage}} is unlawful) causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a <b>divorced</b> <b>woman</b> commits adultery." [...] Explaining Church interpretation of this teaching, Kreeft says Jesus considered divorce to be an accommodation that had slipped into Jewish law. The Church teaches that marriage was created by God and {{was meant to be}} indissoluble: like the creation of a child that cannot be [...] "un-created", neither can the [...] "one flesh" [...] of the marriage bond. The Catechism states, [...] "Divorce is a grave offense against the natural law. It claims to break the contract, to which the spouses freely consented, to live with each other till death." [...] By marrying another, the divorced person adds to the gravity of the offense as the remarried spouse is considered to be in a state of [...] "public and permanent adultery".|$|E

She played Roslyn, a recently <b>divorced</b> <b>woman</b> who becomes friends with three aging cowboys, played by Clark Gable, Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift. The filming in the Nevada desert between July and November 1960 was again difficult. The four-year marriage of Monroe and Miller was effectively over, and he began a new relationship with Inge Morath. Monroe disliked that he had based her role partly on her life, and thought it inferior to the male roles; she also struggled with Miller's habit of re-writing scenes the night before filming. Her health was also failing: she was in pain from gallstones, and her drug addiction was so severe that her make-up usually had to be applied {{while she was still}} asleep under the influence of barbiturates. In August, filming was halted for her to spend a week detoxing in a Los Angeles hospital.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to shed light on the {{potentially}} differing dynamics of violence against separated and <b>divorced</b> <b>women</b> by their ex-husbands and violence against married women by their current husbands. Using a nationally representative sample of 7, 369 heterosexual women from Cycle 13 of Statistics Canada's General Social Survey, available risk markers were examined in the context of a nested ecological framework. Separated women reported nine times the prevalence of violence and <b>divorced</b> <b>women</b> reported about four times the prevalence of violence compared with married women. The strongest predictors of violence against married women, namely, patriarchal domination, sexual jealousy, and possessiveness, were not significant predictors of violence against separated and <b>divorced</b> <b>women.</b> This suggested that post-separation violence is a complex phenomenon the dynamics of which can be affected by much more than domination and ownership. © 2008 Sage Publications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
