6000|$|But {{the first}} touch of dry land makes {{the sea and}} all upon it unreal. Five minutes after the {{traveller}} is on the C.P.R, train at Vancouver there is no romance of blue water, but another kind--the life of the train into which he comes to grow as into life aboard ship. A week on wheels turns a man into {{a part of the}} machine. He knows when the train will stop to water, wait for news of the trestle ahead, drop the dining-car, slip into a siding to let the West-bound mail go by, or yell through the thick night for an engine to help push up the bank. The snort, the snap and whine of the air-brakes have a meaning for him, and he learns to distinguish between noises--between the rattle of a loose lamp and the ugly rattle of small stones on a scarped embankment--between the 'Hoot! toot!' that scares wandering cows from the line, and the dry roar of the engine at the distance-signal. In England the railway came late into a settled country fenced round with the terrors of the law, and it has remained ever since just a little outside daily life--a thing to be respected. Here it strolls along, with its hands in its pockets and a straw in its mouth, {{on the heels of the}} rough-hewn trail or log road--a platformless, regulationless necessity; and it is treated even by sick persons and young children with a familiarity that sometimes affects the death-rate. There was a small maiden aged seven, who honoured our smoking compartment with her presence when other excitements failed, and it was she that said to the conductor, 'When do we change crews? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> water-lilies--yellow ones.' A mere halt she knew would not suffice for her needs; but the regular fifteen-minute stop, when the red-painted tool-chest was taken off the rear car and a new gang came aboard. The big man bent down to little Impudence--'Want to pick lilies, eh? What would you do if the cars went on and took mama away, Sis?' 'Take the, next train,' she replied, 'and tell the conductor to send me to Brooklyn. I live there.' 'But s'pose he wouldn't?' 'He'd have to,' said Young America. 'I'd be a lost child.' ...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} Like and like is the everyday, in {{particular}} ordinary designed objects {{that we all}} come in contact with. For pragmatic reasons, they make an easier target. We all see them. They have a universal quality to them. At first <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> an object that we design for. I also picked a designed object that has so many characteristics and provokes so much change. Transportation, moving through space, {{is one of the}} fundamental principles of architecture.

This grew out into a large comparison of other elements in the city such as housing, office buildings, parking garages, etc. The project Like and like is about the similarities and differences in the world around us. The point of my thesis investigation is looking at the similarities and revealing their differences. For me, the most interesting manifestation of this exchange between similar and different is in the designed object and designed environment. This is important because the differences relate to identity; my task is to point this identity out. Identity is brought out through the use of the designed object. Using photography as my method, I started to compare "like" things. In photographing them I produced a new way of seeing: seeing as an act of stilling "like" things and therefore I could examine them. Through documenting moments in our cities I could compare like against like...|$|R

Of course, Stier does not attempt to cover this issue extensively, since he focuses rather on the Irreducibilty-Thesis (IT) and tries to show that “psychiatric diseases are irreducible to the brain even if the mental as such may in principle be reducible” (p. 2). Admittedly, such anti-reductionism is not an uncontroversial position (for an overview of the debate see Perring, 2010, ch. 3).

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a {{particular}} {{element of the}} analysis of responsibility drawn in The claims of parenting (Ramaekers & Suissa, forthcoming). In this book we argue that under {{the conditions of the}} expert culture within which parenting has come to be defined today – something we call the scientization of childrearing and the parent-child relationship – the notion of parental responsibility is understood in a particular, narrow sense. Specifically, as parents are seen as responsible for ensuring the optimal conditions for their children‟s growth and for maintaining a firm grip on this developmental process. Parental responsibility is, in this sense, defined narrowly in terms of the “needs” of “the child” (which are determined, largely, by empirical/scientific research in psychology), and is confined to the one-to-one-interaction scheme between parent and child. Parental responsibility is thus in danger of being reduced to a state of “vigilance”: parents are positioned {{in such a way as}} to be constantly vigilant – for every new day is a day with new challenges – regarding developmental opportunities, risks, etc. Here I want to develop this further by drawing on Michael Sandel's concept of “explosion of responsibility” and on the analysis of this idea of vigilance by the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler. Drawing on the combined insights of both of these scholars I will show that the way in which parental responsibility is understood today – either explicity in policy rhetoric or implicitly in conceptions of parenting support – is an impoverished conception of responsibility in the sense that it strips this notion of what is characteristically human about it and thus asks parents to assume a sort of animal-like attitude. Whereas responsibility-as-vigilance is based on the premise that parents need to keep everything under control (whereby every piece of new research is something parents should take in since this adds a further element to have under one's control), responsibility in childrearing (as a deeply human notion) has to do with introducing one's own child into a common world. Crucially, this cannot be premised on some form of control but is to be understood in terms of “relinquishing our hold on the world”. What this implies is an understanding of the relationship with one's child that is fundamentally different from the way this relationship is understood in the current expert culture on parenting – something I will develop by drawing on the work of Stanley Cavell. status: publishe...|$|E

Lazenby described the movie at the time as [...] "anti-guns and anti-Bond... a comedy with no plot. It is really just a series of happenings which keep the audience entertained. This is the kind of film which is coming out in Europe now."He later elaborated:I believe that there is a true revolution going on in the youth of today which is far more than just a fad or a passing fashion. The kids are beginning to learn that the world's economy is dependent on the arms race, and they don't like it. They feel the people going on and on making guns could be building new irrigation schemes to make the deserts productive, or making agricultural equipment to help feed all the hungry. People would be far happier employed this way than they are in wars and they would be saving lives instead of taking them.

40|$|New {{opportunities}} {{may well}} emerge for commercially viable free news services suggests Terry Flew. With the revenue downturn for Fairfax Media being announced on Monday, I {{got the call}} from Ashley Hall at the ABC’s PM program to give my opinion. At 2. 45 pm I {{may not have been}} sure that I had an opinion, but {{the nature of the relationship}} between news journalists and academics is that it would be good for all concerned if you could get an opinion, and give that to us to put on air. With Crikey publisher Eric Beecher and former ACCC head Allan Fels also offering their opinions, I was in good company on the PM program. My comments were picked up by Shaun Carney, the associate editor of The Age, for his opinion piece on Wednesday. In Carney’s view I am one of those who argues that the future of digital media is free content, as we are moving from an environment of information scarcity to one of information abundance, and that is driving down the price of online content of all sorts. The editor of WIRED magazine, Chris Anderson, is another seen to be holding to this view, in his most recent book Free: The Future of a Radical Price. Carney disagrees with this, arguing that the era of free online content will be seen as a short-lived phase, since commercial businesses ultimately need to set a price for their content or they will go out of business. Carney is also of the view that consumers will ultimately accept the need for this. Just as what were once free sample bags given out at the various Royal Shows around Australia (Easter Show, The Ekka etc.) became show bags with a price attached, so too will once free online news become a commodity for which consumers will pay. Since Rupert Murdoch said the hares running on this issue earlier in August by declaring that News Corporation sites around the world will move to a pay model, there has been a lot of commentary on this. Among those offering views have been Brian McNair, Roy Greenslade and James Harkin. The jury is clearly out on what will happen next, with there being some high profile examples where a subscription model for premium content has worked, such as the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, and some high-profile failures, most notably The New York Times. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up on a specific criticism that Carney makes of my claim that we have been moving from information scarcity to information abundance in ways that affect the ability to charge for access to online news: It 2 ̆ 7 s true that there are a lot more places where people can get information 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 about 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 news, such as boutique political websites and one or two email newsletters, but when it comes to finding actual news he 2 ̆ 7 s wrong. So far, the Internet has not ushered in any substantial new news organisations; the vast bulk of Australian online media consumers still rely on Fairfax, News, ninemsn and the ABC for their news. Scarcity still applies. Carney is right to argue that the big news organisations continue to dominate the online news space in Australia, and no substantial new players have emerged that are Internet only. News, The Age, SMH, ninemsn and the ABC are all sites that are in the Alexa top 25 most accessed Internet sites in Australia, and probably account for about 80...|$|R
40|$|When Paula {{asked me}} to be the keynote speaker at this conference, <b>I</b> {{naturally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a big, important topic that was relevant to consumer researchers, you, the audience. I am working on three big topics at the moment, between editions of the Rossiter and Percy textbook. One topic is marketing knowledgewhat it is and how we can test it. I have a large ARC grant for that one. A second topic is a new procedure for the measurement of marketing constructs-a replacement for the narrow Churchill procedure that everyone seems to follow. Some of you have seen working paper versions of this and I hope it will be published in a major marketing journal soon. The third topic, the one I have chosen, is certainly a big topic and one that has been on my mind for some time, and that is: which theoretical perspective is best for studying and doing research in consumer behaviour? The title refers to three forms of behaviourism-eognitive, emotional, and hard-core. This is deliberate, because I think we are all behaviourists in some form or other in that the dependent variable that we try to describe, explain and predict is the behaviour or behaviours of consumers. Most of us are also philosophically behaviourists, although there might be a few relativists, existentialists, and even just plain hedonists out there. However, no consumer researcher whom I know, with the single exceptioq of Gordon Foxall in England, is a hard-core behaviourist, or what is called in psychology a radical behaviourist. Radical behaviourism denies the existence of mental events, such as attitudes, or at least refuses to accord them explanatory status. B. F. Skinner was of course the ultimate radical behaviourist, describing thinking, a main part of what we would now call cognition, in behavioural terms as 2 ̆ 2 inner speech, 2 ̆ 2 as had John B. Watson earlier. This is to be distinguished from methodological behaviourism, which allows mental events but prefers the recording of observable behaviour, ratherthan, say, the elicitation ofself-reports, as theway ofstudying them. It is a pity that we don 2 ̆ 7 t have more radical behaviourists among consumer researchers, because this perspective, as we shall see, has certain advantages, one of them parsimony, which is a refreshing change from the 2 ̆ 2 kitchen sink 2 ̆ 2 approach favoured by. many cognitive behaviourists...|$|R

The race was run later than scheduled after several jockeys (including Ruby Walsh and Daryl Jacob) were injured in earlier races and was further delayed by two false starts. After racing in last place {{for most of the}} way, Lord Windermere began to make progress after the fourth last, but was still in eighth place turning into the straight. He jumped the last in fourth behind Silviniaco Conti, Bobs Worth and On His Own. On the run-in Silviniaco Conti and Bobs Worth, racing on the inside, were unable to make further progress and the race for first place turned into a struggle between Lord Windermere, On His Own and The Giant Bolster all of whom drifted to {{the right side of the}} course. In a finish described as [...] "dramatic" [...] and [...] "controversial", Lord Windermere prevailed by a short head from On His Own, with The Giant Bolster three quarters of a length back in third.

Jim Culloty, who had won the race three times as a jockey on Best Mate said [...] "Halfway round I was going to sack the jockey! He's not moved a muscle and he's come from nowhere.
