25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elevators}} in {{that particular}} building were operated by young girls, and I made special arrangements with one in advance. She agreed to cooperate and {{thought it would be}} fun. I went with the gentleman to the elevator. He wasn't afraid of walking into an elevator, but when it started to move it became an unbearable experience. So I chose an unbusy time and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> walk {{in and out of the}} elevator, back in and out. Then at a point when we walked in, I told the girl to close the door and said, [...] "Let's go up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barresi: [...] "I {{called the}} editor at The Globe and I said, 'I have a tape, I'm {{on the way}} down town to hand it to the District Attorney.' And his words were, 'let us come with you.' And then I knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him.</b> The next thought in my mind was I'm going to ask for $30,000. You always ask for twice as much as what you hope to get. He put me on hold, and within less than a minute he came back and he said 'well, we can't give you thirty, we'll give you ten.' I said 'make if fifteen,' he said 'you have a deal.'" [...] Reporter: [...] "Could you see the {{headlines}} coming? Barresi: [...] "Oh yeah, sure, and I could see that money coming too." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, thought <b>I,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him.</b> No skins, no {{tangible}} return; and evidently he {{is set on}} receiving that tangible return.|$|R
60|$|MARTHA--[With a wan smile.] Well, I've helped--all I could. His {{work has}} me in it, I like to think--and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Rebuke <b>him!</b> How could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> rebuked <b>him?</b> though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{never owned}} {{it to myself}} I now feel that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> loved <b>him</b> before he <b>had</b> ever spoken to me of love." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> beaten, {{although}} I {{was afraid of}} his short thumps as he headed away and tugged. Finally <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> within twenty feet circling around me, tired and loggy, yet still strong enough to require careful handling.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> by the {{shoulders}} in a minute, and crushed him back--except his legs kept agitating.|$|E
60|$|So I {{led him to}} {{the canoe}} and, ascertaining that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> well hooked, I lifted him in.|$|E
6000|$|Almayer walked {{towards the}} table. [...] "I {{give you my}} word of honour, gentlemen, that he shall not escape; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> safe enough." ...|$|R
60|$|Sab. Not {{to put off}} {{the gentleman}} neither; for if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> not, <b>I</b> am {{resolved}} to die a maid, that's once, mother.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} he is,' said Thomas Pinch; 'and, saving that I wish him no ill, I don't care. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> left <b>him,</b> John. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> left <b>him</b> for ever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|As he {{put those}} questions, {{he thought to}} himself--seriously thought--"Is this fellow's brain softening? I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> on my table!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him.</b> He colored up (fancy that, at his age!), {{and owned}} the truth, {{in defense of}} his own {{precious}} character.|$|E
6000|$|... "The pup didn't just calmly walk overboard. Nor was {{he washed}} overboard. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> fast and triced in the blanket {{with a rope}} yarn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{will do well}} at last,' said James. 'Manhood <b>has</b> come on <b>him</b> with a rush, and borne him off his feet; {{nor would}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> over-tame.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Abner looked troubled. 'I don't mind so much waitin' myself,' said he, 'but it's {{the horse}} I'm thinkin' about. <b>I</b> promised I'd <b>have</b> <b>him</b> fed at twelve o'clock sharp every day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him.</b> He's used to it, and I don't want him givin' out afore I'm through with him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That as I love Mr. Tregear, and as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told <b>him</b> so, and as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> promised <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> will {{be true to}} him. I cannot {{let there}} be an end to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Approve?" [...] cried Newman. [...] "I {{wish that}} when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> there, night before last, I had locked {{him up in}} my cabinet de toilette!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a cowboy. He was {{crippled}} by falling under his horse, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> instructed {{to run the}} car. He can drive, don't you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will give}} no more trouble, sheriff," [...] {{the young man}} who fired said. [...] "I fancy <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> plum between the eyes. How about the others?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{the giant}} answered, 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen <b>him</b> pass, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not seen <b>him</b> come back. The spell must have worked upon him.' ...|$|R
60|$|ANTONIUS. No {{thought was}} mine of torture or of death, But <b>had</b> <b>I</b> found <b>him</b> plotting, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> counsell'd <b>him</b> To rest from vain resistance. Rome is fated To rule the world. Then, if he <b>had</b> not listen'd, <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> sent <b>him</b> {{prisoner}} to Rome.|$|R
6000|$|The English gentleman had {{something}} to say upon this matter, but never mind what he said--I'm not arguing his case. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> at a disadvantage, now. I proceeded: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> for my son," [...] said Colonel Clark, kindly; [...] "but the lad is eleven, and I {{shall not}} be twenty-six until next November." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That settles the matter," [...] he said, as {{he threw}} the letter angrily down upon the table. [...] "A {{malicious}} young viper! I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> here." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> draw {{a map of}} Omean, {{indicating}} plainly {{the position}} of Shador and of the opening in the dome {{which led to the}} outer world.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no, {{he shall}} not,' rejoined Frank. 'You see <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> secure here. But may I {{ask you what}} this means, and whether you {{expected}} this old gentleman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” I said, “not yet. Now that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> {{helpless}}, helpless {{he shall}} remain. From this day {{we live in}} the cabin. Wolf Larsen shall live in the steerage.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Use?" [...] {{answered}} Sharpitlaw--"You {{can guide}} the party--you ken the ground. Besides, I {{do not intend}} to quit sight o' you, my good friend, till <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{stranger}} {{gave it to}} me," [...] groaned {{the restaurant}} keeper. [...] "I thought he was mighty smooth. He treated me to a cigar! I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want nothing}} of the kind. I would make almost any {{sacrifice}} rather. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> yesterday night by the collar of the coat, and I let him go free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Iss it carryin' him {{you will}} be taalkin' of?" [...] said Fergus. [...] "Ay, ay! I would be forgettin' that he wass on my back if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> there." ...|$|E
60|$|Hate. My lord, this Atheism {{is one of}} the vilest wretches {{that ever}} I came near, or had to do with in my life. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard <b>him</b> say that there is no God; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard <b>him</b> say that there is no world to come, no sin, nor {{punishment}} hereafter, and, moreover, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard <b>him</b> say that it was as good to go to a whore-house as to go to hear a sermon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Basil, with a {{slow and}} {{singular}} smile, [...] "the fact is I was detained by a visitor. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>him,</b> {{as a point of}} fact, in my bedroom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I am {{sure that}} he wouldn't," [...] Tom said. [...] "All the years that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never heard <b>him</b> tell {{anything}} like an untruth." ...|$|R
