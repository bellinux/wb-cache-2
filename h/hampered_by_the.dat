5|$|The Battle of Wau, 29–31 January 1943, was {{a battle}} in the New Guinea {{campaign}} of World War II. Forces of the Empire of Japan sailed from Rabaul and crossed the Solomon Sea and, despite Allied air attacks, successfully reached Lae, where they disembarked. Japanese troops then advanced overland on Wau, an Australian base that potentially threatened the Japanese positions at Salamaua and Lae. A race developed between the Japanese moving overland, <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> terrain, and the Australians, moving by air, <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weather. By the time the Japanese reached the Wau area after a trek over the mountains, the Australian defenders had been greatly reinforced by air. In the battle that followed, despite achieving tactical surprise by approaching from an unexpected direction, the Japanese attackers were unable to capture Wau.|$|E

A 2013 peer-reviewed literature review concluded neonicotinoids in the amounts typically used harm bees and safer alternatives are urgently needed.

5|$|Both {{operations}} were <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German need {{to rely on}} their Croatian allies {{as well as the}} fact that both forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions. The Croatian units had proven not to be a useful addition to the operation, as they possessed {{little in the way of}} fighting power, had little unit cohesion and suffered from serious supply problems.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} was noted to have some flaws. The game was criticized for its uneven {{difficulty}}. Reviewers have also noted some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of dialog, particularly at the introduction, which was also <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> computer-generated voices used instead of voice acting.|$|E

5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} Electoral College by constitutional amendment have been introduced in Congress over the decades.

50|$|In the end, though, the Steelers {{were one}} of the quickest teams to adjust to the new rules; the team's offense benefited more from the changes than <b>the</b> defense was <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> them. <b>The</b> rule changes catalyzed the team's {{transition}} from a power running game to more of an air attack.|$|R
60|$|When she {{was left}} alone she waited patiently, but Jude did not come back.

An emotion at sight of them, {{assisted}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> growing dusk of evening, caused her to act on impulse, and first looking around her quickly, she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and went on. The cover was lifted from within, and the pigeons flew away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and swearing to the door.|$|R
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that most of}} the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} {{race of the}} season in Melbourne, Webber {{qualified}} in 7th place and held that position for {{the early part of the}} race, managing to finish in 13th position after the RB3 suffered from a throttle-related malfunction and a jammed fuel flap. At the , he again out-qualified his more experienced teammate Coulthard and finished tenth, which was encouraging for the team in such a new and radical car. Bahrain was also going well for both drivers, who were running in sixth and seventh positions, until both cars retired due to mechanical malfunctions. Webber again was <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned jammed fuel flap, radically affecting the aerodynamic drag, a vital set-up consideration for the Sakhir circuit.|$|E
5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his {{activities}} as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066.

The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|During the 1973–74 season, {{the team}} was <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out. Goodrich, {{averaging}} 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge. Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division. They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. <b>Hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E

His initial attempts were <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez {{was convicted}} on bank fraud charges {{and became an}} FBI {{informant}} {{in exchange for a}} lower sentence. However, due to the EPB's policies of anonymity, most of the information was <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of codenames and useless for the investigation. During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E
5|$|In the Duchy of Warsaw, Poniatowski {{defeated}} the Austrians at Raszyn on 19 April, prevented Austrian forces from crossing the Vistula river, {{and forced the}} Austrians to retreat from occupied Warsaw.

The Austrians also won a few battles but were <b>hampered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of Russian troops whose intentions were unclear and that did {{not allow them to}} advance. Eventually, the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war.|$|E
