40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the compositional techniques of skaldic poetry and determine if any oral formulae or other compositional methods {{played a role in}} the creation of skaldic poetry, I have collected the alliterating and rhyming words from 1486 couplets by 68 different poets, including 19 anonymous poems, and investigated whether any of these word combinations were repeated within the poetry of different skalds. Many such examples of recurrent word constellations were found in this study; including some couplets by different poets which shared almost word for word similarity within and without the alliteration and hending categories, others couplets which shared a number of similar words within both hending and alliteration contexts, but few or none outside of those categories, and yet others that shared similarities only between alliteration or hending word pairs. While there are many examples of these word constellations of various sizes occurring within the works of different skalds, very rarely do they recur between more than two different poets. From this, it seems unlikely that oral formulae played a significant role in the composition of alliterative and hending word combinations in skaldic poetry. Rather, it seems that skalds may have appropriated convenient alliterating and hending word constellations from <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>s</b> <b>works</b> and incorporated these choice word combinations or phrases, often with great subtlety into their own work in an original context. This subtle appropriation allowed for originality in composition while, at the same time, taking inspiration or compositional aide from an earlier skald <b>s</b> <b>work.</b> Appropriation as a compositional technique supports the idea that skalds were very much aware of the skaldic corpus, both from their own time and from earlier centuries. The frequent subtlety of the appropriation which is found in my research could also be a way to avoid being accused of plagiarism by other knowledgeable skalds. Intelligent and original use of these borrowed word constellations also supports the argument for the importance of originality in the composition of skaldic poetry. From my research it appears that the appropriation of alliterative and hending word constellations was likely used as a compositional technique by skalds from the 9 th to 11 th centuries. The most notable skalds with inter-related alliterative and hending word constellations mentioned in this paper include Glúmr Geirason, Arnórr Þórðarson jarlaskáld, and Óttarr svarti, but a great number of other skalds also share word constellation similarities and I believe that with a more throrough and all encompassing analysis of the skaldic corpus, many more such examples may be found...|$|R
40|$|In {{this short}} {{introduction}} to the life and work of Henri Wallon, we have compared the ideas of Wallon and Piaget. We have discussed their ideas concerning {{the concept of the}} child, stages of development, language and education. We can thank Piaget for drawing our attention to the stages and mechanisms of cognitive growth in the child. By studying this one aspect of development, he traced the childs ability to interact with her environment in increasingly complex ways. However, it was Wallon who insisted that cognition should not be studied in isolation. He insisted that the child's development must be viewed in terms of the interaction of emotional as well as cognitive factors. He also insisted that the child is basically a social organism, and that her interaction with the environment affects all aspects of development, at all times. We noted that Piaget and Wallon considered, criticized and respected <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>work.</b> Piaget' <b>s</b> <b>work</b> has become very popular throughout the world. We {{would like to think that}} Wallon' <b>s</b> <b>work</b> with its emphasis on the child and its relation to the society in which it grows will become as widely considered in the English speaking, as well as other areas of the world. Wallon, a man before his time, wrote about issues which are today of great importance to all of us, who are concerned with the health and mental growth of all children. Birns Beverly, Voyat Gilbert.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, {{advertising}} effects on sales have been studied without appropriately taking into consideration competitors advertising activities. As a result, advertisers often instinctively match competitors spending proportionately when it is monitored. The weakness of such a competitive parity approach is that they implicitly assume zero-sum competition only. This study identifies a variety of competitive conditions under which better budgeting strategies can be formulated. Specifically, four types of competition are conceptualized based on how an advertiser and its competitors affect <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>s</b> sales according to level of media advertising spending. In addition, appropriate strategies for setting advertising budgets to deal with each situation are discussed. A mathematical method is developed to measure advertising effectiveness for both the advertiser and competitors on sales of a focal brand. The method computes current and carryover effects, identifies in which type of competition the advertiser is operating, and, accordingly, determines which budgeting strategy best suits the situation. In an empirical illustration, the method was applied to data collected monthly over eight years. The analyzed product was Scotch whisky sold in Thailand. ...|$|R

40|$|Smaller (volume, mass, power) {{electronics}} for a Ka-band (36 GHz) radar interferometer were required. To reduce {{size and}} achieve better control over RFphase versus temperature, fully hybrid electronics were {{developed for the}} RF portion of the radar s two-channel receiver and single-channel transmitter. In this context, fully hybrid means that every active RF device was an open die, and all passives were directly attached to the subcarrier. Attachments were made using wire and ribbon bonding. In this way, every component, even small passives, was selected for the fabrication of the two radar receivers, and the devices were mounted relative to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{in order to make}} complementary components isothermal and to isolate other components from potential temperature gradients. This is critical for developing receivers that can track <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>s</b> phase over temperature, which is a key mission driver for obtaining ocean surface height.

The fully hybrid fabrication enables control over every aspect of the component selection, placement, and connection. Since the two receiver channels must track <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to better than 100 millidegrees of RF phase over several minutes, the hardware in the two receivers must be "identical," routed the same (same line lengths), and as isothermal as possible.

The expansion of rainwater harvesting in rural areas of Africa has been underway for some time, and a CTA study visit in Kenya in June 2000 allowed practitioners to exchange experiences.

The visit ended with a pooling of lessons about the best uses of kitchen and underground tanks, terracing, retention techniques using plants and the sand-dam, a technology which is growing in interest.
