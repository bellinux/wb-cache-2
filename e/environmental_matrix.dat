Targeting the variation in the 16S rRNA gene, a microarray (PhyloChip) was used to conduct comprehensive identification of both bacterial and archaeal organisms in bioaerosols. New U.S. EPA methods {{have been developed to}} utilize qPCR to characterize indoor environment for fungal spores. In a study by Lange et al., FISH method successfully identified eubacteria in samples of complex native bioaerosols in swine barns. Nonetheless, molecular biological tools have limitations. Since PCR methods target DNA, viability of cells could not be confirmed in some cases. When qPCR technique is used for bioaerosol detection, standard curves need to be developed to calibrate final results. One study indicated that “curves used for quantification by qPCR needs to be prepared using the same <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix</b> and procedures as handling of the environmental sample in question” and that “reliance on the standard curves generated with cultured bacterial suspension (a traditional approach) may lead to substantial underestimation of microorganism quantities in environmental samples”.

40|$|Effects of {{plantation}} forestry {{on biodiversity}} are controversially discussed in literature. While some authors stress positive effects, others tend to attribute a largely negative influence to plantations. One important factor steering the influence on biodiversity are management practices. A second important {{factor is the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix.</b> Chile offers the option to analyse both factors jointly. The coastal range of central Chile has experienced rapid and widespread replacement of native Nothofagus spp. forests in favour of Pinus radiata plantations. Here, native forests remain limited to small patches surrounded by an <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix</b> of plantations. Management is rather intensive and not designed to maintain biodiversity. While in the coastal range of central Chile the transformation from native forests to non-native tree plantations has almost come to an end, spatial extension of P. contorta and P. ponderosa plantations has just recently begun in Chilean Patagonia. While the management is similar to central Chile, plantations rather exist as small patches surrounded by an <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix</b> of native plant formations (e. g. Nothofagus spp. forests and Nothofagus spp. scrublands). In the framework of this work, effects of the two diametric land usages on biodiversity are assessed and compared. Biodiversity is assessed at the α-, β- and γ-scale. At the α-scale, biodiversity impacts are inferred statistically, using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s PostHoc test. Biodiversity of plants at both sites is significantly reduced in plantations when compared to native forests or scrublands. Plantation forestry lowers α-biodiversity and does not provide additional habitats for specialists. At the β-scale, weak edge effects due {{to the presence of}} native forests are observed. In total, plantation forestry tends to promote plant invasions and impairs the survival of endemics. At the γ-scale, plant species communities where predominantly native and endemic in forests, predominantly introduced in plantations. Positive effects of the more native <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix</b> in Patagonia are not found to be stronger than in central Chile, therefore it is concluded that management imposes a much stronger influence. Results show, that the biodiversity impacts in Central Chile are transferable to Chilean Patagonia, where plantation forestry is increasingly established...|$|E

The abovementioned methods have been improved by coupling the elemental content with the carbon isotope analysis, which represents a powerful tool for the discrimination of the distinct carbon pools in heterogeneous environmental materials (Lopez-Capel et al. 2006; Manning et al. 2005, 2008).

Results for the sediment matrix are reliable, showing a range 25 – 35 % of analytical variability associated with intermediate conditions. The analytical methodology for the water matrix determines the selected compounds with acceptable recoveries and the combined uncertainty ranges between 20 and 30 %.

40|$|The thesis {{investigated}} statistical {{tools to}} improve the derivation of direct and indirect environmental quality guidelines (EQGs). Direct EQGs use measurements taken directly from the <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix</b> or phase of interest to estimate an EQG. An example is the set of Ontario Typical Ranges (OTR) that are used as criteria for lakefill, storm water pond sediment, brownfields remediation, application of non-agricultural source materials to farmland and as general soil benchmarks for use in risk assessments. An OTR for a specific analyte is estimated as a quantile of a dataset comprised of jurisdiction-specific direct measurements. OTRs are estimated {{in a variety of}} matrices; currently the most sampled matrix is surficial soil. OTRs estimated using rural park data include background concentrations and non-point source and/or long range transport contributions. As such, these are estimates of ambient levels (ALs) used by many jurisdictions including Canada, as source terms in human health and ecological risk assessments. A limitation of soil OTRs is that OTRs are estimated within administrative regions without consideration of soil taxonomy or pedogenic processes. Further limitations are the logic underpinning how administrative regions are combined and the choice of sub-optimal statistical tools. Weaknesses of the current OTR derivation method were addressed in this thesis by geostatistical models that do not consider administrative regions thereby obviating the logic paradigm for combining administrative regions and choice of sub-optimal statistical tools. Geostatistically derived site-specific ALs reduce the bias implicit in more broadly based ALs such as those generated using the current OTR paradigm. Given the myriad uses of OTRs in Ontario and ALs globally, reduced bias will result in improved environmental decision making. Indirect EQGs use measurements taken from a surrogate <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix</b> or phase to estimate an EQG in the <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix</b> or phase of interest. An example is the set of Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) water quality guidelines (WQGs). In this EQG derivation paradigm, analyte concentrations are measured in water (the surrogate <b>environmental</b> <b>matrix)</b> and calibrated to responses in aquatic species (the environmental phase of interest). Those responses are used to estimate a concentration in water to achieve the desired level of protection (a calibration experiment in statistical terminology). CCME WQGs are used to derive effluent quality criteria and as general water quality benchmarks for use in risk assessments. A limitation of the indirect EQGs (CCME WQGs) is in the application of the CCME- preferred species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach to datasets that represent mixtures of sensitivities due to the presence of two or more modes of toxic action. In this thesis, the presence of multimodal SSDs for a pesticide with a known mode of toxic action is demonstrated. Multimodal SSDs are also demonstrated in non-pesticide contaminant SSDs (nonylphenol in water and zinc in soil). The implication of ignoring multimodality is an inadvertent and unknown degree of over or under-protection at the ecosystem level. One alternative to ignoring multimodality is to restrict attention to only those species with the most sensitive mode of toxic action. This approach is not preferred because: 1) it is wasteful of toxicity test data leading to unnecessarily wide confidence intervals (the lower of which comprises the EQG) and; 2) the species comprising sub-distributions may not be known for a required element such as soil zinc due to the inclusion of multiple phyla. Another alternative is to statistically identify sub-distributions and estimate EQGs from the most relevant sub-distribution as appropriate. This is done by estimating the parameters of the mixture distribution, identifying the relevant distribution and using the jointly estimated parameters to estimate the EQGs. The advantage of this approach is that the lower confidence interval (which is the EQG) is less biased than it would be otherwise. Thus because the bias is reduced, the level of environmental protection afforded is more consistent with the nominal level of protection...|$|E

Their presence has attracted considerable attention due to their potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and on public health, so their quantification has become a necessity. Various extraction procedures as well as gas/liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry detection techniques are found as suitable for reliable detection of such compounds.
