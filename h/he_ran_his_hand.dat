60|$|Mr. Sumner was in deep perplexity. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{through his}} hair.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the room}} that {{sheltered}} him Crispin chuckled, as <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{along the edge of}} the door until he found the bolt, and softly shot it home.|$|E
60|$|Calm {{and dignified}} <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over them feeling their muscles, and then forced back their lips and {{examined}} their teeth and mouths.|$|R
60|$|A {{tall man}} in a white sweater towered over Ken. It was the famous trainer. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over Ken's smooth skin and felt of the muscles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! the old {{equatorial}} wind {{is blowing}} today, and my hair crackles with electricity." [...] He smiled as <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> through <b>his</b> hair. [...] "On such days I long for my pony again. Sometimes, when I can't stand it any longer, I take a train to some little station {{and go out and}} lie flat down on the grass on my back, so that I can't see anything but sky; then I can almost imagine myself back again where the lone old peaks bulge against the sky. Do you know John Muir and Joaquin Miller?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} not stay {{here in the}} cold. I'll come when I have heard that boy's {{imposition}} and looked over these exercises.' And <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his hair again.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} gate, {{and crossed the}} road to where he held the horse. Shelton, to conceal embarrassment, looked at the horse's legs, and noticed that the grey was resting one of them. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> down.|$|E
60|$|Before him, in the darkness, stood a roadster. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{over the}} pedals and levers, {{breathing}} {{a sigh of}} relief as his touch revealed the familiar control of a standard make. Then he went to the double doors. They opened easily and silently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, madam," [...] Collins interposed. [...] "The {{trick is}} {{absolutely}} safe. And it's a good one, a money-maker. Straighten up a moment." [...] With <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> he began feeling out {{her shoulders and}} back under her jacket. [...] "The apparatus is all right." [...] <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> down her arms. [...] "Now! Drop the hooks." [...] He shook each arm, and from under each of the fluffy lace cuffs fell out an iron hook fast to a thin cable of steel that evidently ran up her sleeves. [...] "Not that way! Nobody must see. Put them back. Try it again. They must come down hidden in your palms. Like this. See.--That's it. That's the idea." ...|$|R
60|$|A wave {{of smoke}} rolled {{about them and}} sparks drove past like hail. A fiery shower fell on Carrie's thin dress and Jim, seizing her, beat them out. This was needful and he began without embarrassment but {{presently}} thrilled, and Carrie's scorched face got red as <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> smarting <b>hands</b> across the thin material.|$|R
6000|$|She gave {{a little}} start and scream, and stood up to let him pass. He was about to rebuke her for doing such work at such an hour; but he saw her flushed, panting, and evidently very tired, and his wrath was averted. Hurrying on to the drawing-room, he found Isabel eagerly writing. She looked up {{with a pretty smile}} of greeting; but <b>he</b> only <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> already disordered hair, and exclaimed-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, a young millionaire like Waltham can {{get hold}} of cash {{whenever}} he wants it," [...] answered Dick. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his hair thoughtfully. [...] "This looks bad to me. Perhaps I had better take a train back to New York without delay." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{three long}} strides, and by steps that were softer than a cat's, Crispin {{crossed to the}} door which he had rather guessed than seen. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> along until he caught the latch. Softly he tried it; it gave, and the door opened. Kenneth was by then beside him. He paused to look back.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a conspiracy," [...] cried De Coude angrily. [...] "There are no {{cards in}} my coat," [...] {{and with that}} <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> into his pocket. As he did so tense silence reigned in the little group. The count went dead white, and then very slowly he withdrew his hand, and in it were three cards.|$|E
6000|$|A single terrible idea now took {{possession}} of him. He had been [...] "sold," [...] "taken in," [...] "done for." [...] He saw it all. In {{a state of}} intoxication {{he had lost his}} way, had been dragged into some vile den, stripped of his clothes and valuables, and turned adrift upon the quiet town in this shameless masquerade. How should he keep his appointment? how inform the police of this outrage upon a stranger and an American citizen? how establish his identity? Had they spared his papers? He felt feverishly in his breast. Ah!--his watch? Yes, a watch--heavy, jewelled, enamelled--and, by all that was ridiculous, FIVE OTHERS! <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> into <b>his</b> capacious trunk hose. What was this? Brooches, chains, finger-rings,--one large episcopal one,--ear-rings, and a handful of battered gold and silver coins. His papers, his memorandums, his passport--all proofs of his identity--were gone! In their place was the unmistakable omnium gatherum of an accomplished knight of the road. Not only was his personality, but his character, gone forever.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Boney! So help me, it's Boney!" [...] <b>he</b> yelled. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> out {{to catch}} me, but luckily for himself his drunken feet {{stumbled}} {{and he fell}} on his face on the road. The other was more dangerous. He had rushed into the inn, and just as I passed I saw him <b>run</b> out with <b>his</b> musket in <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> He dropped upon one knee, and I stooped forward over my horse's neck.|$|R
60|$|He {{was a man}} {{of about}} fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, {{strongly}} marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon <b>his</b> legs. As <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>he</b> jerked <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{over his}} chin, looked at himself steadfastly for some time, and curled his {{insufficient}} moustache {{up with some}} care. Then he fell a-meditating on his beauty. He considered himself, three-quarter face, left and right. An expression of distaste crept over his features. [...] "Looking won't alter it, Hoopdriver," [...] he remarked. [...] "You're a weedy customer, my man. Shoulders narrow. Skimpy, anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Barney. [...] "I {{need the}} practice; but wait and you'll {{see that a}} diamond may be {{infinitely}} more valuable than even the broker claims," [...] {{and he was gone}} again into the shadows of the garage. Here upon the window pane he scratched a rough deep circle, close to the catch. A quick blow sent the glass clattering to the floor within. For a minute Barney stood listening for any sign that the noise had attracted attention, but hearing nothing <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through the hole that he had made and unlatched the frame. A moment later he had crawled within.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not sell}} my gifts; I bestow them freely. If your friend--your {{anonymous}} friend--desires to behold the cosmic wonders that are wrought through my hands, I {{am glad to}} show them to him. Fortunately, as often happens when {{it is necessary to}} convince and confound a sceptic (for that your friend is a sceptic I feel instinctively), I chance to have no engagements at all this evening." [...] <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his fine, long hair reflectively. [...] "Yes, I go," [...] he continued, as if addressing some unknown presence that hovered about the ceiling; [...] "I go; come with me!" [...] Then he put on his broad sombrero, with its crimson ribbon, wrapped a cloak round his shoulders, lighted a cigarette, and strode forth by my side towards the Hôtel des Anglais.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last leg}} of the narrator's return trip must be by train, as she wishes to get from Paris to Great Britain, where she will meet up with Bennett again. As {{she is trying to}} swing her {{suitcase}} into the overhead train compartment, a young attendant wearing a blue uniform walks up and takes her suitcase from her. She thanks him, and reaches for her purse, but this supposedly universal gesture indicating [...] "tip" [...] seems foreign to him; he walks away. [...] "You will be alone?" [...] he asks ambiguously. He begins to pull down all the shades and to convert the compartment into a sleeper. At least, <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> along the seats and the narrator assumes a linguistic gap and supplies reasons for his gestures within her own mind: she considers it most probable that he is just doing his train attendant job. She remarks that [...] "this", possibly meaning all this attention, may not be fair to all the other passengers, for although she has travelled to Vienna, she is still an American, with an American code of politeness and consideration. And next: ...|$|R
50|$|When That Girl {{ended its}} <b>run,</b> <b>he</b> tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> at another sitcom, Me and the Chimp, created by Garry K. Marshall, {{which had a}} short, {{unsuccessful}} run in 1972. In 1974, Bessell carried the lead role in the television film Bobby Parker and Company.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{had laid}} their plans, you see," [...] says the Captain, {{taking up the}} Spanish gun across his knees, and looking, lazily, at the {{inlaying}} on the stock, [...] "with {{a great deal of}} art; and the corrupt or blundering local authorities were so easily deceived;" [...] <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> left <b>hand</b> idly along the barrel, but I saw, with my breath held, that he covered the action of cocking the gun with his right--"so easily deceived, that they summoned us out to come into the trap. But my intention as to future operations--" [...] In a flash the Spanish gun was at his bright eye, and he fired.|$|R
60|$|At the {{far corner}} of the field Yaqui halted, and slowly the line of white horses merged into a compact mass. There was a trail here leading down to the river. The campfires were so close that the bright blazes could be seen in movement, and dark forms crossed in front of them. Yaqui slipped out of his saddle. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over Diablo's nose and spoke low, and {{repeated}} this action for each of the other horses. Gale had long ceased to question the strange Indian's behavior. There was no explaining or understanding many of his manoeuvers. But the results of them were always thought-provoking. Gale had never seen horse stand so silently as in this instance; no stamp--no champ of bit--no toss of head--no shake of saddle or pack--no heave or snort! It seemed they had become imbued with the spirit of the Indian.|$|E
60|$|He spoke quietly, leaning {{with one}} elbow {{against the side}} of his reading stand. The {{occasional}} pulsations of applause were almost immediately hushed, as though the people feared to lose even a word that should fall from his dry lips. What was it he was talking about? I tried to concentrate my attention, with only partial success. He was explaining the new theory of city government that did not attempt to evade, but dealt frankly with the human needs of to-day, and sought to meet those needs in a positive way... What had happened to me, though I did not realize it, was that I had gradually come under the influence of a tragic spell not attributable to the words I heard, existing independently of them, pervading the spacious hall, weaving into unity dissentient minds. And then, with what seemed a retarded rather than sudden awareness, I knew that he had stopped speaking. Once more <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through his hair, he was seemingly groping for words that would not come. I was pierced by a strange agony--the amazing source of which, seemed to be a smile on the face of Hermann Krebs, an ineffable smile illuminating the place like a flash of light, in which suffering and tragedy, comradeship and loving kindness--all were mingled. He stood for a moment with that smile on his face--swayed, and would have fallen {{had it not been for}} the quickness of a man on the platform behind him, and into whose arms he sank.|$|E
60|$|On {{the edge}} of the {{sidewalk}} sat a poor, crippled beggar, holding out his hat, and beside him stood a prosperous-looking gentleman who was about to drop a penny into the beggar's hat. Jim knew this gentleman to be very rich but rather stingy, so <b>he</b> ventured to <b>run</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> into the man's pocket and take out his purse, in which was a $20 gold piece. This glittering coin he put in the gentleman's fingers instead of the penny and then restored the purse to the rich man's pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Shore your {{breast-bone}} ain't smashed," [...] replied Wilson, hopefully. And <b>he</b> {{began to}} <b>run</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> around {{one side of}} Anson's body and then the other. Abruptly he stopped, averted his gaze, then slowly ran the hand all along that side. Anson's ribs had been broken and crushed in {{by the weight of}} the horse. He was bleeding at the mouth, and his slow, painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth, which showed that the broken bones had penetrated the lungs. An injury sooner or later fatal! ...|$|R
50|$|Famous for knives (and {{his love}} of using them) Basta is never seen without one. Occasionally when he is {{in an attempt to}} kill one of the main characters, <b>he</b> caresses and <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over the knife, presumably {{addicted}} to the sense of power that it gives him. Though Dustfinger steals a couple of them at various points during the course of Inkheart, he always replaces them quickly. Dustfinger and Basta have a history that began when Basta slashed Dustfinger's face several times as revenge for his pursuit of Roxane, the woman that Basta loved.|$|R
60|$|Outside, in {{the piazza}} before the church, {{there was an}} idle, cruel crowd, amusing itself with the efforts of a blind old man to find the entrance. He {{had a number of}} books which he desperately laid down while <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> {{helpless}} <b>hands</b> over the clustered columns, and which he then desperately caught up again, in fear of losing them. At other times he paused, and wildly clasped <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> upon <b>his</b> eyes, or wildly threw up his arms; and then began to run to and fro again uneasily, while the crowd laughed and jeered. Doubtless a taint of madness afflicted him; but not the less he seemed the type of a blind soul that gropes darkly about through life, to find the doorway of some divine truth or beauty,--touched by the heavenly harmonies from within, and miserably failing, amid the scornful cries and bitter glee of those who have no will but to mock aspiration.|$|R
5000|$|Jean de Lattre de Tassigny {{was buried}} in a state funeral lasting five days, in what Life {{magazine}} described as the [...] "biggest military funeral France had seen {{since the death of}} Marshal Foch in 1929". The Marshal's body was conveyed through the streets of Paris in a series of funeral processions, with the coffin lying in state at four separate locations: his home, the chapel at Les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe and before Notre Dame. Those marching in the funeral processions, following the gun carriage on which the tricolor-covered coffin was carried, included members of the French cabinet, judges, bishops, and Western military leaders. The pallbearers included other Allied generals of World War II, such as Bernard Montgomery and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The route included the Rue de Rivoli and the Champs-Élysées, and the processions went from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre Dame, and then from Notre Dame to Les Invalides. The stage of the journey from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre Dame took place in the evening, and cavalrymen from the Garde Républicaine flanked the coffin on horseback bearing flaming torches. Walking behind the soldiers marching in the funeral processions was the lone figure of the Marshal's widow, Simonne de Lattre de Tassigny, dressed in black and praying as she walked. Thousands of people lined the funeral route, forming crowds standing ten-deep. The pageantry included the tolling of bells, and flags being flown at half-mast. The final stage of the funeral was a journey of 250 miles to the Marshal's birthplace of Mouilleron-en-Pareds in western France. In attendance there was the Marshal's 97-year-old father, Roger de Lattre. Aged and blind, and the last of the de Lattres, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over the ceremonial accoutrements on the coffin, which included the posthumously awarded marshal's baton and his son's kepi. Then the coffin was lowered into the ground and the Marshal was laid to rest beside his only son, Bernard, who had been killed fighting under his father's command in Indochina some eight months previously.|$|R
60|$|Two of them sprang on {{the instant}} into the pool, and washed {{out with the}} {{crackling}} ice-cake into the rapid at the tail of it. It was precisely what most men who could swim would have done, but Nasmyth stayed, and Mattawa stayed with him. Nasmyth did not think very clearly, but he remembered subconsciously what the construction of that derrick had cost him. There was a lever which would release the load and let it <b>run.</b> <b>He</b> had <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on it {{when he turned to}} his companion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} German {{title is}} [...] "" [...] (The passenger). [...] "On the Tram" [...] {{is a short}} story told in first-person perspective. It describes a man standing on a tram platform, contemplating the uncertainties of {{his place in the}} world. At one point, a woman approaches the tram and the narrator is struck by her vibrance. The story focuses on images of the uncertainty of existence and one's purpose in the world, and the tone is contemplative and existential. The man on the tram cannot even defend {{the fact that he is}} on the tram, holding onto the strap, and watching people move about in the streets. When he sees the woman, however, his perspective changes. The narrator sees the girl “as distinctly as if <b>he</b> had <b>run</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over her.” <b>He</b> goes on to describe the woman's physical attributes with incredible detail, from her clothing to her hair. He ends his contemplation by wondering, “How is it that she is not astonished at herself, that she keeps her lips closed and says nothing of that kind?” Although the narrator does not understand his own place in the world, he understands the woman's with strange clarity.|$|R
50|$|The student's uneasy {{feelings}} were verified by {{an incident that}} happened a short time after {{coming out of the}} trance. After finishing up in the bathroom, the young man who had been uneasy flushed the urinal only to see a thick, red, blood-like fluid running {{down the side of the}} opposite urinal. This sent the student into a panic, and <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> to wash <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> but when he turned on the faucet, the same liquid poured out of the tap. <b>He</b> then <b>ran</b> out of the bathroom to hear an invisible figure chase him. The reports say that he heard the bathroom door close behind him, open again as if someone passed through it, and close again. He also heard footsteps running behind him when he turned around and saw no one behind him.|$|R
