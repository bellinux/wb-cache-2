5|$|At Brooklyn, {{still an}} {{independent}} city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets. Damage was widespread {{throughout the area}} and flood waters reached waist-high levels. The storm was the most severe in years at Jersey City, New Jersey, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> damage was moderate. Trees were blown down and cellars filled with water there and in nearby areas, such as Hoboken.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.|$|E
5000|$|Treasure {{is now a}} dive spot. The ship's {{large size}} and the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> hull is only 50 m down, and its main deck is within 30 m of the surface, coupled with its {{location}} in the Bloubergstrand area near Cape Town, South Africa, have contributed to its popularity.

To overcome this difficulty, we shall firstly establish the L^∞ estimate for solution u, by the technique of rearrangement which is differs from the usual Stampacchia L^∞ regularity procedure. Then, by constructing suitable approximate problems, and using a priori estimates and a test function method, we shall finish the proof of this existence results.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 12th century, Angkor Wat {{gradually}} {{transformed from}} a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned, its preservation being {{due in part to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> moat also provided some protection from encroachment by the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Tower C is {{different}} from Towers A and B in several ways, but primarily in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> rooms are single occupancy. The rooms are 2/3 the size of rooms in Towers A and B, and like Tower A and Tower B, every third floor has a lounge containing a television, couches, and tables for extra study. In addition, each floor has 30 rooms, except floors containing a lounge, which have 27. No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C, but designated male and female floors are 24-hour Quiet Living Communities. Up until 2010-11, Tower C was open to students of any year, however it now houses primarily first-year students.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a Country Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, {{so long as he}} agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have been searching for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought to fracture the Christian community by publicizing the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some of the clergy sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were eager to be rid of the clergy in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, had his hands seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were told they had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E
5|$|The taxonomical {{history of}} this fungus has been {{complicated}} by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> life cycle allows for both an imperfect (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; at various times authors have assigned names to {{one or the other}} form, but these names have often been at odds with the accepted rules of fungal nomenclature. It was originally described in 1781 by the Dutch scientist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin as Lichen sarcoides. Christian Hendrik Persoon called it Peziza sarcoides in 1801. Elias Magnus Fries, in his 1822 publication Systema Mycologicum, described the imperfect state of the fungus under the name Tremella sarcoides. The genus name Coryne was first used in 1851 by Bonorden, who proposed Coryne sarcoides for the imperfect state; in 1865 the Tulasne brothers (Charles and Louis René) used Coryne to refer to both the perfect and imperfect forms. It was designated the type species for the genus in a 1931 publication by Clements and Shear.|$|E

25|$|Also {{hurting the}} NHLPA was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> players had very visibly high salaries, which removed much sympathy from lower-to-middle class fans.

25|$|The {{cylinder}} {{is a line}} bundle {{over the}} circle, by the natural projection R × S1 → S1. It is a trivial line bundle, so it possesses a nowhere-zero section, and so its Euler class is 0. It is also isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the circle; the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> Euler class is 0 corresponds {{to the fact that}} the Euler characteristic of the circle is 0.|$|E
25|$|Understanding of the Akkadian Empire {{continues}} to be hampered by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> capital Akkad {{has not yet been}} located, despite numerous attempts. Precise dating of archaeological sites is hindered by {{the fact that there are}} no clear distinctions between artifact assemblages thought to stem from the preceding Early Dynastic period, and those thought to be Akkadian. Likewise, material that is thought to be Akkadian {{continues to}} be in use into the Ur III period.|$|E

25|$|In June 2014, Mosul {{was taken}} over by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The militant group {{destroyed}} the monastery sometime between 27 August and 28 September 2014, along with a number of other cultural sites. The destruction of the monastery was not publicized by ISIL, and it was only confirmed by satellite imagery released in January 2016. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> destruction went unreported for about 16 months led to fears that many other Christian sites in Iraq might have also been destroyed secretly.|$|E
25|$|The Berg River Dam was {{the first}} dam in South Africa to be designed, {{constructed}} and operated {{in accordance with the}} guidelines of the World Commission on Dams. According to the South African government this was confirmed by a 2001 a review of the project's processes. This is despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> planning phase preceded the World Commission on Dams, which was formed in 1997 and presented its report in 2000. The experience under the Berg River Dam thus influenced the work of the Commission, not vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Hyperion {{is unique}} among the large moons {{in that it}} is very irregularly shaped, has a fairly {{eccentric}} orbit, and is near a much larger moon, Titan. These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 orbital resonance between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> rotation is not locked probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion's surface, in contrast to many of Saturn's other moons, which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.|$|E
