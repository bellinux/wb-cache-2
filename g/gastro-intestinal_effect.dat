Despite their bene-fits, bisphosphonates suffer from very poor oral bioavailability (1 – 2 %) (1 – 3). The low bioavailability is {{likely due to}} the extensive ionization and highly hydrophilic nature of bisphosphonates, which prevent the transcellular transport across intestinal epithelium and favor the paracellular route (4 – 5). Higher localized concentration of bisphosphonates has resulted in severe <b>gastro-intestinal</b> side <b>effects</b> such as dysphagia, esophagitis and gastric ulceration (6). To improve the bioavailability of bisphosphonates, structural modification of the bisphosphonate molecule, use of absorption enhancers and design of drug delivery sys-tems have been attempted (7 – 11).

40|$|As {{metabolic}} substrates, {{ketone bodies}} provide {{an alternative to}} glucose in order to pro- long survival during starvation. A low carbohydrate, high fat diet {{can be used to}} promote ketogenesis without fasting, but long-term compliance can be difficult. Dietary ketone bod- ies may be an alternative method to induce ketosis, so the aim of the work in this Thesis was to investigate the metabolism of exogenous ketones. In the first experimental Chap- ter, the effects of ketone ester and salt drinks on blood β-hydroxybutyrate (Î²HB), glucose, lipids, electrolytes and pH were determined in healthy humans at rest. Blood D-βHB levels were higher following ketone ester drinks, but it was found that total βHB levels with ke- tone salts were similar, as over 50 % of Î²HB delivered in the salt was the L-isoform, which was only slowly removed from the blood. Circulating glucose and lipid concentrations fell following both ketone drinks. Blood pH fell following ketone ester consumption, but rose following ketone salt drinks, whilst both compounds raised blood sodium and chloride, and lowered potassium. Work in the second Chapter investigated the repeatability of ketone es- ter metabolism with food, successive drinks or continuous nasogastric (NG) infusion. Peak D-βHB levels were repeatable between- and within- subjects at rest but were lower after a meal, although blood acetoacetate, breath acetone and urine βHB were unaffected by feed- ing. βHB kinetic parameters were not altered by existing hyperketonemia from successive ketone ester drinks and total βHB uptake was identical when isovolumetric amounts of ketone ester were continuously infused through a NG tube. The third Chapter explored side-effects of ketone drinks: ketone ester drinks decreased appetite compared to isocaloric dextrose; which may have been linked to effects of βHB on enteroendocrine cells. Fur- thermore, both ester and salt drinks were found to be unpalatable, and to cause a few, mild <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>effects</b> that increased with intake. As exogenous ketones could be a per- formance enhancing supplement in sport, the fourth Chapter used a survey to investigate supplement use by endurance athletes. The results demonstrated widespread supplement use, which was highest at the elite level. In the final Chapter, the effect of glycogen lev- els on the oxidation of βHB was determined in isolated perfused rat hearts. Low cardiac glycogen levels decreased βHB oxidation and levels of the intermediates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, whilst increasing muscle amino acid levels, suggesting that low glycogen may have impaired anaplerosis. In conclusion, this work extends current understanding of the novel physiological ketosis that occurs following exogenous ketone consumption. </p...|$|R

EMP is considered as a first choice for treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. It {{is at least as}} effective as conventional chemotherapy, yet less aggressive with regard to its toxicity profile. EMP is particularly useful in patients with limited bone marrow reserve, e. g. in case of prior or associated radiotherapy.

Although the role of aspirin on gastro-intestinal injury has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying aspirin-induced liver and spleen pathophysiology are poorly defined. The present study has been conducted to investigate whether phyllanthus niruri protein (PNP) possesses any protective role against aspirin mediated liver and spleen tissue toxicity, and if so, what signaling pathways it utilizes to convey its protective action. Aspirin administration in mice enhanced serum marker (ALP) levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reduced antioxidant power and altered oxidative stress related biochemical parameters in liver and spleen tissues. Moreover, we observed that aspirin intoxication activated both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, as well as down regulated NF-kB activation and the phosphorylation of p 38 and JNK MAPKs. Histological assessments and TUNEL assay also supported that aspirin induced tissue damages are apoptotic in nature. PNP treatment after aspirin exposure effectively neutralizes all these abnormalities via the activation of survival PI 3 k/Akt pathways. Combining all results suggest that PNP could be a potential protective agent to protect liver and spleen from the detrimental effects of aspirin...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuraxial {{adjuvant}} {{drugs are}} used to improve analgesia and to decrease complications associated with a high dose of a single drug. Opioids are used in routinely, but alpha 2 -agonists, such as clonidine or cholinesterase inhibitors (neostigmine), have also been used for labour analgesia or to relieve pain following caesarean section. Both drugs possess a common mechanism of action that can be beneficial. RECENT FINDINGS: Small doses of intrathecal clonidine (30 microg), combined with local anaesthetics and opioids, prolong labour analgesia. Hypotension can occur and must be promptly treated by ephedrine to avoid fetal side effects. Epidural clonidine (60 to 75 microg) produces prolonged analgesia from local anaesthetics and opioids and allows a ropivacaine sparing effect. Intrathecal neostigmine has analgesic properties, but its <b>gastro-intestinal</b> side <b>effects</b> contraindicate its clinical use. Epidural neostigmine, combined with sufentanil or clonidine, initiates labour analgesia (minimum 6 to 7 microg/kg; 500 microg) without side effects, however, and allows a 'mobile epidural'. Epidural and spinal clonidine {{can be used to}} improve postcaesarean section analgesia. Epidural neostigmine at the doses studied produces modest analgesia following caesarean section.

This survey reviews the literature on non-selective and selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenases, {{with an emphasis on}} the efficacy and safety profile reported in SLE patients. No lupus-specific data on <b>gastro-intestinal</b> side <b>effects</b> of NSAID exist. Both non-selective Cox inhibitors and selective Cox- 2 inhibitors induce renal side effects, including sodium retention and reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. Lupus nephritis is a risk factor for NSAID-induced acute renal failure, but not for rare idiosyncratic toxic renal reactions to NSAID. In refractory nephrotic syndrome, NSAID have been used successfully. Cutaneous and allergic reactions to NSAID are increased in SLE patients as well as hepatotoxic effects, particularly with high dose aspirin. Whereas a variety of central nervous system side effects of NSAID are probably no more common in SLE patients than others, aseptic meningitis has been reported more frequently. Ovulation and pregnancy can be adversely affected by Cox inhibitors. The antiplatelet effect of aspirin and non-selective Cox inhibitors has a therapeutic potential in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

Although some compounds of this group are already used for tumor therapy (e. g. hexadecylphosphocholine, HePC), not much is known about their molecular mechanisms of anticancerogenic action. HePC is approved for topical treatment of skin metastases of breast cancer, but systemic application is not possible due to <b>gastro-intestinal</b> side <b>effects.</b> Therefore, new APC compounds were synthesized with the aim to reduce the side effects of HePC while preserving the antineoplastic activities. In the present study, the toxic effects of eight new APC compounds on in vitro cell culture systems of human tumor cells were investigated. Three of the new APC showed higher toxic potency than HePC towards HL- 60 leukemia cells. The most active compound was R- 1 -O-phosphocholine- 2 -N-acetyl-octadecane (R-N-acetyl), with which further studies were mainly carried out. The uptake of R-N-acetyl by tumor cells was slow and dependent on the content of foetal calf serum in the culture media. R-N-acetyl was metabolically stable and degradation was only marginal. The effect of APC on intracellular signal transduction was further specified. It was demonstrated that APC activate the Ras/MAP kinase cascade via a G-protein coupled mechanism.

Besides genetic and sex dispositions, previous knee injury in sports is one of several identified risk factors.

Oxaliplatin improves the efficacy of this combination in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We evaluated the efficacy of treatment with FL plus oxaliplatin in the postoperative adjuvant setting. METHODS: We randomly assigned 2246 patients who had undergone curative resection for stage II or III colon cancer to receive FL alone or with oxatiplatin for six months. The primary end point was disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 1123 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} each group. After a median follow-up of 37. 9 months, 237 patients in the group given FL plus oxaliplatin had had a cancer-related event, as compared with 293 patients in the FL group (21. 1 percent vs. 26. 1 percent; hazard ratio for recurrence, 0. 77; P= 0. 002). The rate of disease-free survival at three years was 78. 2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 75. 6 to 80. 7) in the group given FL plus oxaliplatin and 72. 9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 70. 2 to 75. 7) in the FL group (P= 0. 002 by the stratified log-rank test). In the group given FL plus oxaliplatin, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was 1. 8 percent, the incidence of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> adverse <b>effects</b> was low, and the incidence of grade 3 sensory neuropathy was 12. 4 percent during treatment, decreasing to 1. 1 percent at one year of follow-up.

40|$|Canine {{hereditary}} copper-associated hepatitis {{is characterized}} by gradual hepatic copper accumulation eventually leading to liver cirrhosis. Therapy is aimed at creating a negative copper balance with metal chelators, of which d-penicillamine is the most commonly used. d-penicillamine often causes <b>gastro-intestinal</b> side <b>effects</b> and life-long continuous therapy {{may lead to a}} deficiency of copper and zinc. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of a low-copper, high-zinc diet as an alternative to continuous d-penicillamine treatment for the long-term management of canine copper-associated hepatitis. Sixteen affected Labrador retrievers were followed for a median time period of 19. 1 months (range, 5. 9 – 39 months) after being effectively treated with d-penicillamine. The dogs were maintained on a diet containing 1. 3 ± 0. 3 mg copper/ 1000 kcal and 64. 3 ± 5. 9 mg zinc/ 1000 kcal. Liver biopsies were taken every 6 months for histological evaluation and copper determination. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase, as well as serum albumin were determined. Dietary treatment alone was sufficient to maintain hepatic copper concentration below 800 mg/kg dry weight liver in 12 dogs during the study period. Four dogs needed re-treatment with d-penicillamine. ALT activity and albumin concentration were not associated with hepatic copper concentration, but showed a significant association with the stage and grade of hepatitis respectively. In conclusion, a low-copper, high-zinc diet can be a valuable alternative to continuous d-penicillamine administration for long-term management of dogs with copper-associated hepatitis. The copper re-accumulation rate of an individual dog should be considered in the design of a long-term management protocol and in determining re-biopsy intervals...|$|R

Our results show a decrease in gastric lipolysis when interfacially active molecules are incorporated into a food matrix. However, only the Sn- 2 monopalmitin caused a systematic decrease in triglyceride hydrolysis throughout the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of ibuprofen’s anti-inflammatory activity by Dr (now Professor) Stewart Adams and colleagues (Boots Pure Chemical Company Ltd, Nottingham, UK) 50 years ago represented {{a milestone in}} the development of anti-inflammatory analgesics. Subsequent clinical studies were the basis for ibuprofen being widely accepted for treating painful conditions at high anti-rheumatic doses (≤ 2400 mg/d), with lower doses (≤ 1200 mg/d for ≤ 10 days) for mild–moderate acute pain (e. g. dental pain, headache, dysmenorrhoea, respiratory symptoms and acute injury). The early observations have since been verified in studies comparing ibuprofen with newer cyclo-oxygenase- 2 selective inhibitors (‘coxibs’), paracetamol and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The use of the low-dose, non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drug was based on marketing approval in 1983 (UK) and 1984 (USA); and it is now available in over 80 countries. The relative safety of OTC ibuprofen has been supported by large-scale controlled studies. It has the same low <b>gastro-intestinal</b> (GI) <b>effects</b> as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and fewer GI effects than aspirin. Ibuprofen is a racemate. Its physicochemical properties and the short plasma-elimination half-life of the R(-) isomer, together with its limited ability to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) and thus prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, compared with that of S(+) -ibuprofen, are responsible for the relatively low GI toxicity. The R(-) isomer is then converted in the body to the S(+) isomer after absorption in the GI tract. Ex vivo inhibition of COX- 1 (thromboxane A 2) and COX- 2 (PGE 2) at the plasma concentrations of S(+) -ibuprofen corresponding to those found in the plasma following ingestion of 400 mg ibuprofen in dental and other inflammatory pain models provides evidence of the anti-inflammatory mechanism at OTC dosages. R(-) -ibuprofen has effects on leucocytes, suggesting that ibuprofen has anti-leucocyte effects, which underlie its anti-inflammatory actions. Future developments include novel gastro-tolerant forms for ‘at risk’ patients, and uses in the prevention of neuro-inflammatory states and cancers...|$|R
40|$|BAC KGRO UND: Tooth {{extraction}} is a {{very common}} procedure in oral surgery. Despite this, very little information {{is available in the}} literature as to the antibiotic management of the patient. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate whether the antibiotic prophylaxis could be beneficial in preventing postextraction local complications and whether the use of a probiotic could help reduce the antibiotic <b>gastro-intestinal</b> side <b>effects.</b> METHODS: One hundred eleven patients meeting the inclusion criteria were initially included in this randomized clinical trial and randomly allocated to one of the three experimental groups according to a computer-generated randomization list. Patients allocated to the group 1 were given amoxicillin+clavulanic acid (2 g/day for 6 days), patients allocated to the group 2 received antibiotic + probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum+lactoferrin) and patients allocated to the group 3 received no antibiotic therapy after the extraction. To evaluate post-extractive complications, controls were performed at days 7, 14 and 21 after the extraction. RESULTS: At T 1 pain at the surgical site was present in the 48 %, 30 % and 71. 4 % of the patients belonging respectively to the antibiotic alone group, to the antibiotic+probiotic group and to the control group. The mean Numeric Rating Score (NRS) score was 1. 56 Â± 1. 91, 1. 08 Â± 1. 93, 2. 02 Â± 2. 27 respectively (P= 0. 0498). Two patients belonging to the control group experienced dry socket. In addition, 9 patients (33. 3 %) in the antibiotic-alone group and 1 patient (2. 7 %) in the antibiotic+probiotic group reported intestinal distension (P= 0. 0012), 7 days after surgery. Finally, diarrhea was recorded in 5 patients of the antibiotic alone group (18. 5 %), on the other hand, no patients of the antibiotic+probiotic group and the control group reported diarrhea. CONCL USION S: Postextractive complications observed in each group have been mild and fast to resolve. The antibiotic administration showed a decrease in pain suffered by patients but a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal distension and diarrhea, which seemed to be relieved by the concomitant use of the probiotic...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we use a}} model {{gastro-intestinal}} system to study the influence of different food-grade surface-active molecules (Sn- 2 monopalmitin, beta-lactoglobulin, or lysophosphatodylcholine) on lipase activity. The interfacial activity of lipase and surfactants are assessed with the pendant drop technique, a commonly used tensiometry instrument. A mathematical model is adopted which enables quantitative determination of {{the composition of the}} water-oil interface as a function of bulk surfactant concentration in the water-oil mixtures. Our results show a decrease in gastric lipolysis when interfacially active molecules are incorporated into a food matrix. However, only the Sn- 2 monopalmitin caused a systematic decrease in triglyceride hydrolysis throughout the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract. This <b>effect</b> is most likely due to exclusion of both lipase and triglyceride from the water-oil interface together with a probable saturation of the solubilization capacity of bile with monoglycerides. Addition of beta-lactoglobulin or lysophopholipids increased the hydrolysis of fat after the gastric phase. These results can be attributed to an increasing interfacial area with lipase and substrate present at the interface. Otherwise, beta-lactoglobulin, or lysophopholipids reduced fat hydrolysis in the stomach. From the mathematical modeling of the interface composition, we can conclude that Sn- 2 monopalmitin can desorb lipase from the interface, which, together with exclusion of substrate from the interface, explains the gradually decreased triglyceride hydrolysis that occurs during the digestion. Our results provide a biophysics approach on lipolysis that can bring new insights into the problem of fat uptake...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (LC n- 3 PUFA) {{are associated with}} reduced risk for inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. These fatty acids, however, are rapidly oxidized, generating highly reactive malondialdehyde (MDA), 4 -hydroxy- 2 -hexenal (HHE) and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (HNE). These oxidation products may interact with DNA and proteins, thus possibly leading to impaired cell functions. Little {{is known about the}} formation of MDA, HHE and HNE in fish oil in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, the effect of dynamic in vitro digestion of cod liver oil on the generation of MDA, HHE and HNE was evaluated using the TNO <b>Gastro-Intestinal</b> Model (tiny-TIM). <b>Effects</b> of pre-formed oxidation products, pre-emulsification of the oil, and addition of oxidants (EDTA and hemoglobin, Hb) on GI oxidation were evaluated. Formation of aldehydes occurred during GI digestion. However, only emulsified oil fortified with 11. 5 μM Hb oxidized to a degree that overcame the dilution induced by gastric secretion, which caused increased aldehyde concentrations in gastric lumen up to 90 min. The maximum levels of aldehydes generated in this study were 24. 5 μM MDA, 1. 6 μM HHE and 0. 07 μM HNE. Oils containing different amounts of pre-formed lipid oxidation products maintained the same oxidation ranking order during digestion, even though the relative changes were not directly proportional. Emulsification of the oil had an unclear effect in the gastric phase, but a pro-oxidative effect in the intestinal phase. In general, higher aldehyde levels were reached in the intestinal lumen than in the initial meal, demonstrating that GI digestion promotes oxidation. Hence, epithelial cells may be exposed to elevated amounts of reactive aldehydes for several hours after a meal containing fish oil...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Intervertebral disc (IVD) disease {{characterized}} by {{low back pain}} is common in both humans and large breed dogs. Inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) {{play a key role}} in IVD degeneration, causing structural changes of the IVD and low back pain. The current conservative and surgical treatment modalities do not reverse IVD degeneration and have certain drawbacks. Long term systemic administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause <b>gastro-intestinal</b> side <b>effects.</b> Decompressive surgery is effective in over 80 % of the patients, but is rather costly and has a long recovery period. Injectable formulations that enable local sustained release of anti-inflammatory drugs aim at decreasing inflammation and thereby inhibiting degeneration and pain. In vitro, controlled release of celecoxib, a COX- 2 inhibitor, from a thermoreversible acetyl-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA hydrogel inhibited PGE 2 production and enhanced matrix production for 28 days in 3 D culture of canine nucleus pulposus cells that were subjected to the catabolic effects of TNF-α. In vivo, sustained release of celecoxib by the hydrogel for up to 60 days was shown and safely applied intradiscally in laboratory dogs with naturally occurring IVD degeneration. The aim of the present study is to report the safety and feasibility of intradiscal application in client-owned dogs with low back pain related to IVD degeneration. Material and Methods: Client-owned dogs with low back pain were diagnosed by MRI with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis marked by mild to moderate IVD degeneration and protrusion. The dogs were surgical candidates but were offered intradiscal injection. The PCLA-PEG-PCLA thermogel, loaded with 0. 013 mg/ml celecoxib, was percutaneously injected into the nucleus pulposus of L 7 -S 1 under fluoroscopy guidance. Follow-up consisted of clinical examination, owner questionnaires, and objective gait analysis by measurement of ground reaction forces (GRFs) using force plate analysis (FPA) at 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after injection. MRI was repeated after 3 months and included T 2 - and T 1 -weighted images and T 2 -mapping. Results: Ten dogs with DLLS were injected with the celecoxib-loaded hydrogel. None of the dogs showed adverse reactions after intradiscal injection. Follow up MRI showed no worsening of the IVD degeneration. Clinical improvement was achieved by reduction of low back pain in 9 / 10 dogs, as was shown by clinical examination, force plate analysis and owner questionnaires. In 3 / 10 dogs low back pain recurred at 3 months and they subsequently underwent standard-of-care surgical treatment. Conclusion: This study showed the safety and feasibility of intradiscal injections with a thermoresponsive hydrogel loaded with celecoxib. Ongoing studies concentrate on the long term clinical follow up of these patients. Future studies will determine the optimal loading dose of celecoxib for clinical efficacy. In this setup, the dog can be used as a model for the development of novel treatment modalities in both canine and human patients with chronic low back pain...|$|R

SETTING: All 579 general practitioners (GPs) in one geographical area, Lothian, Scotland, UK. METHOD: Postal questionnaires; simple and factorial designed case series questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Categorisation of responses to clinical and non-clinical factors into highly, partially or not influential. The quantitative influence {{of the most prominent}} clinical factors on prescribing choice and the tendency of co-prescription of gastro-protection with these agents. RESULTS: Responses from 229 (40 %) GPs suggested the following as most influential: Drug Evaluation Panel recommendations, Lothian Joint Formulary, local practice formulary, history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), history of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> (GI) adverse <b>effects</b> with NSAIDs and advanced age. Advice from other physicians, patient demand, history of alcohol gastritis, history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, history of functional dyspepsia, concomitant use of low dose aspirin and concomitant use of gastro-protective agents were regarded to have moderate influence. Information directly from pharmaceutical industry and regular smoking were regarded as having weak influence. An 18 % response to the factorial designed questionnaire using the most prominent clinical factors suggested that history of either GI adverse effects associated with non-selective NSAIDs or PUD resulted in more pronounced increase in the frequency (15 %) of decision to prescribe COX- 2 selective inhibitors than advanced age (10 %). Concomitant use of low dose aspirin had little effect on GPs' decisions. The mean percentage of GPs choosing to co-prescribe gastro-protection was higher with non-selective NSAIDs (64 %) than with COX- 2 selective inhibitors (22 %). CONCLUSION: Local authoritative guidance and history of GI complications highly influenced the GPs in their use and choice of either COX- 2 selective inhibitors or non-selective NSAIDs. As expected the use of gastro-protection was more frequently chosen with non-selective NSAIDs than COX- 2 selective inhibitors...|$|R
