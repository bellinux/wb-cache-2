500|$|The song is {{included}} on the U.S. release of The Essential Mariah Carey. [...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing {{it over and over}} to myself as I was taking a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981 Hanneman, who {{was working}} as a {{telemarketer}} at the time, met Kerry King, when King was auditioning for a southern rock band called [...] "Ledger". King remembered: [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving,</b> I saw Jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing stuff that I was into, like Def Leppard's 'Wasted' and AC/DC and Priest". After the try-out session, the two guitarists started talking and playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs. Slayer was born when King asked [...] "Why don't we start our own band?", to which Hanneman replied [...] "...Fuck yeah!".|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty/has to flourish in the light/wild horses run unbridled/or their spirit dies/you have given me the courage/to be all that I can/and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was {{going to go back to}} the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Coodie and Chike and it premiered in November 2003. Kanye West, who financed the video, conceived ideas for the clip after seeing an Adidas advertisement in BlackBook magazine. He stated, [...] "I don't like gettin' ideas from direct shit ... I like to pull ideas from {{all the way over}} here. Sometimes my vision can't be explained in words, 'cause I couldn't have even told you in words how I envisioned that video ending up." [...] Chike recalled the making of the clip, saying, [...] "one day Coodie calls me out the blue about a concept he and Kanye had for a video revolving around Polaroid snapshots. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> work at 7 PM only to come back at 10 PM, work all night then go home at 7 AM". Coodie stated that [...] "If we would have wrote a treatment" [...] for the video, [...] "they would have shot that down. They had to see it to understand. Otherwise they'd have said, 'No, Kanye should be rapping at a party, with lots of girls poolside'". It was awarded the Video of the Year at the 2004 Source Hip Hop Awards.|$|E
500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life was just really coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I am right now. Also, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; {{she was able to}} get through the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open.|$|E

2500|$|Punk band Dropkick Murphys {{covered the}} song for their 2017 album 11 Short Stories of Pain & Glory. Vocalist/bassist Ken Casey {{said in a}} December 2016 {{interview}} discussing the reason behind their version. [...] "As you may know, opiate overdoses are an epidemic in America now particularly in (the Boston) area. I've been to thirty wakes in two years, three this week, one being my cousin, Al's lost a brother in law. It's hit home close to us. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> one of the wakes and this song came on and as I {{was listening to the}} lyrics it summed up exactly how I was feeling. Sad, but knowing there is hope. You never have to be alone. I hope you our version".|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, {{newly married}} and having moved to Manhattan [...] from her parents' home, Cotton sought {{to become a}} student of William Merritt Chase. He agreed to teach her {{and at the same}} time asked whether she would sit for a portrait. In 1908 Chase {{described}} the meeting: [...] "One morning a young lady came into my Tenth street studio, just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> for an art class in Brooklyn. She came as a pupil, but the moment she appeared before me I saw her only as a splendid model. Half way to the elevated station I stopped, hastened back, and overtook her. She consented to sit for me; and I painted that day, without an interruption, till late in the evening. The result is the Lady in Black, now hung in the Metropolitan Museum." [...] In 1889 a second Chase portrait of her, [...] "Lady in Pink," [...] was shown at the Spring Exhibition at the National Academy of Design in New York.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1996, Westbrook's axing was {{reported}} in the press. According to press reports, producers had tired of her off-screen antics and were angered that she had appeared on the Channel 4 chat show, The Girlie Show, and had given away the outcome of a storyline she was involved with, a love-triangle between Sam, Ricky and his new girlfriend Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). The character departed for Spain on 26 March 1996 after falling for a Spanish tourist. Westbrook has since commented, [...] "The producers were very nice about it all. Rather than killing [...] off they sent her to Spain, once again leaving the door open for her to return [...] There was no official line as to why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving,</b> and when the announcement was made [...] they were kind enough to let me say in interviews that I was going because I wanted 'a change of direction'. 'Hopefully, one day I'll return to the show', I told journalists".|$|E
2500|$|Between his smelter job and his music, {{he made a}} {{good living}} in the Helena area. He moved {{his wife and son}} to join him and they lived in Helena until 1967, {{purchasing}} their first home there, and with their children Dion and Angela being born at the local hospital. [...] The Pride family moved to Great Falls, Montana, in 1967, because Pride's music career was taking off and he required quicker access to an airport. The family ultimately left Montana and moved to Texas in 1969. [...] In a 1967 interview with the Helena Independent Record, Rozene commented that the family encountered minor racism in Montana, citing an incident where they were refused service in a restaurant and another time when a realtor refused to show them a home, but she felt that the family endured less racism than she saw leveled against local Native American people, whose treatment she compared to that given to black people in the South. Pride has generally spoken with fondness of the near-decade he spent there. “Montana is a very conservative state...I stood out like a neon. But once they let you in, you become a Montanan. When the rumor was that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving.</b> They kept saying, ‘we will let you in, you can’t leave.’" ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eberhard Grisebach {{visited him}} in March, writing to Helen Spengler of Kirchner's condition: [...] "I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never forget. I found him sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving,</b> I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E
