40|$|Background/PurposeHealing of gastric ulcers {{requires}} repair by epithelial {{migration and}} proliferation. We {{have found a}} small proportion of patients with acquired hyperplastic polyps at the <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> site. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify clinical characteristics that might be associated with the development of hyper-plastic polyps at the site of healed gastric ulcers. MethodsThis was a retrospective review of 86 patients with gastric ulcers from April 2006 to September 2008. After initial endoscopy, the patients were all treated with proton pomp inhibitors, after which a second en-doscopy was performed. Demographic data, polyp characteristics (endoscopic and histological), Helicobacter pylori status, and duration of treatment were analyzed. ResultsA total of 24 hyperplastic gastric polyps were found in 18 patients; all at the site of the <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> (20 in the antrum and 4 in the corpus). The mean size of the ulcers prior to treatment was 14. 5 ± 9. 1 mm. Hyperplastic gastric polyps were more likely to occur at the site of ulcers larger than 10 mm (odds ratio = 9. 57, 95 % confidence interval = 2. 50 – 36. 65). Age, sex, H. pylori status, ulcer location and duration of treatment did not differ significantly between patients with and without polyps. ConclusionHyperplastic polyps that develop after healing of gastric ulcers are likely to be extensive mucosal injury. A gastric ulcer larger than 10 mm is associated with a significantly increased risk of hyperplastic polyps...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis was a {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature to determine which compression method is superior in promoting <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> and reducing recurrence in patients with lower extremity venous ulcer disease. MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases for randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies from 1990 to December  2013. ResultsWe identified 36 studies and two Cochrane systematic reviews. Many studies had moderate risk of bias. We found no overall difference between compression stockings vs compression bandages with respect to <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing,</b> time to <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing,</b> or <b>ulcer</b> recurrence outcomes. When we compared stockings vs short stretch bandages, stockings were superior with respect to <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing.</b> However, stockings compared with four-layer systems showed no difference in <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> outcomes. When four-layer systems were compared with compression with less than four layers, there was also no significant difference in <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> outcomes. Similarly, short stretch bandages were not superior to long stretch bandages with respect to <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing,</b> time to <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing,</b> or <b>ulcer</b> recurrence. One Cochrane review presented many additional comparisons and reported increased wound healing with compression compared with no compression, with multicomponent systems over single component systems, and compression systems with an elastic component over no elastic component. Another Cochrane review demonstrated a reduction in recurrence with compression in patients with <b>healed</b> <b>ulcers.</b> ConclusionsAt least moderate-quality evidence supports compression over no compression, multicomponent systems over single component systems, and systems with an elastic component over those without. We did not find significant differences with respect to <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> outcomes for other comparisons. Low-quality evidence supports the effect of compression on ulcer recurrence...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Clinical {{examination}} of diabetic foot {{to find out}} its pathological Complications and analysis of plantar foot pressure of diabetic foot patients in Indian population. Method: This was prospective analytical study in Indian diabetic patients. 102 patients were evaluated through clinical, vascular, neurological and plantar foot pressure assessment. Results: 35 % patients developed diabetic neuropathy. ABI- 62 % patients had vascular complication. On foot examination 51 % patients had nail changes, 32 % had foot lesion and 52 % had foot deformity. 7. 8 % had Charcot joint arthropathy, 5. 8 % had interdigital infection, 38. 2 % had restricted joint mobility of first MTP joint. 20 % had past history of foot ulceration; out of which 71 % had high peak pressure point areas at <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> area. High pressure values were seen in <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> group patients. Average value of peak foot pressure in dynamic mode is- left foot 156. 41 Kpa (min 105 Kpa- max 346 Kpa) and right foot is 153. 05 Kpa (min 100 Kpa-max 245 Kpa). Maximum values of peak pressure were seen at abnormal pressure point areas such as 4 - 5 th metatarsal heads, lateral aspect of foot and middle of arch. Conclusion: Meticulous clinical examination can easily identify diabetic neuropathy and related pathological complications of diabetic foot. This shall help for early diagnosis and prevention of diabetic foot complications. Foot pressure analysis can be useful tool to screen patients of diabetic foot for abnormal high pressure point areas and can predict future risk of ulceration due to high foot pressure.

Altogether, 194 patients (143 men) were randomly allocated according to a prearranged treatment schedule to either drug and were treated double blind. Each received 40 mg omeprazole {{in the morning and}} a ranitidine placebo morning and evening or 150 mg ranitidine morning and evening with an omeprazole placebo in the morning. A total of 188 patients (94 taking omeprazole, 94 taking ranitidine) completed the trial. Sixty four (68 %) omeprazole treated and 45 (48 %) ranitidine treated patients had <b>healed</b> <b>ulcers</b> at two weeks, 91 (99 %) omeprazole treated and 79 (88 %) ranitidine treated had <b>healed</b> <b>ulcers</b> by four weeks, and 91 (100 %) omeprazole treated and 86 (97 %) ranitidine treated patients had <b>healed</b> <b>ulcers</b> by eight weeks. The overall difference in healing rates was significant (p = 0. 0008, Mantel-Haenszel test). The differences were significant also at two weeks (20 %, 95 % confidence interval 5. 6 to 34. 4, p less than 0. 01) and at four weeks (11 %, 95 % CI 3. 7 to 17. 3, p less than 0. 01), but not at eight weeks (3 %, 95 % CI - 0. 5 to + 7. 3, p = 0. 25), using the chi 2 statistic, the study having a power to detect a 20 % difference on 90 % of occasions. After two weeks of treatment complete symptom relief was observed in 70 (74 %) patients receiving omeprazole and in 58 (62 %) receiving ranitidine. Diary cards showed a significantly lower percentage of days with pain in the omeprazole treated group (7. 4 % v 21. 4 %, p < 0. 02) when assessed over either the first two weeks or over weeks three and four treatment. A total of 144 patients with <b>healed</b> duodenal <b>ulcer</b> were followed up, with no treatment, for six months. At the end of this period 19 (26 %) of 74 patients healed with omeprazole and 17 (24 %) of 70 patients healed with ranitidine were still in remission. A similar protocol was used for 46 patients (25 men) with gastric ulcer who were randomly allocated to treatment with omeprazole or ranitidine as described above. Forty patients (16 omeprazole, 24 ranitidine) completed trial.

40|$|Background: Recurrent {{peptic ulcer}} after {{previous}} gastric operation {{is a difficult}} surgical problem and abdominal re-operation is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and recurrence rate. Methods: The authors report on five patients with recurrent ulcers who, after previous gastric operation, were treated with thoracoscopic vagotomy. Results: All patients tolerated the procedure well without complications, and the median hospital stay was 5 days. Endoscopy confirmed healing of the ulcers in all patients. Pre-operative and postoperative gastric acid studies showed a significant post-operative reduction in both basal and maximal acid output (P < 0. 05). In a follow-up period of 18 - 33 months, one patient had a recurrent ulcer presenting with bleeding. Gastric biopsy revealed presence of Helicobacter pylori and repeated gastroscopy after a course of H. pylori eradication treatment showed a <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer.</b> The other four patients were asymptomatic.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>healing</b> of gastric <b>ulcer</b> is a {{complicated}} process that involves the proliferation of epithelial and endothelial cells and the concerted actions {{of a wide range}} of growth factors. Prostaglandins play an important role in <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing.</b> Expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) is markedly upregulated around the margins of gastric ulcers and its inhibition leads to a delay of <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing.</b> Several of the growth factors that promote <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> may work in part through COX- 2 -dependent mechanisms. Angiogenesis, which is crucial to <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing,</b> is tightly regulated by growth factors. Treatment with selective COX- 2 inhibitors appears to alter the balance of serum levels of growth factors, favoring an inhibition of angiogenesis. Given the importance of COX- 2 in regulating <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing,</b> caution should be taken in the use of selective inhibitors of COX- 2 by patients at risk of ulcer disease.

40|$|Angiogenesis {{is crucial}} to all types of wound <b>healing,</b> {{including}} gastric <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing.</b> The most potent promoter of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We hypothesized that a 15 -amino acid peptide designed to mimic the angiogenic action of VEGF would accelerate gastric <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing.</b> Gastric <b>ulcers</b> were induced in mice by serosal application of acetic acid. Treatment with the VEGF mimetic accelerated gastric <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> when administered orally or intraperitoneally, at a dose of 50 ng/kg or greater. Such healing was not observed when the reverse sequence pentadecapeptide or the full-length VEGF protein was administered. Contrary to our hypothesis, the VEGF mimetic did not significantly increase angiogenesis in the ulcerated stomach. The enhancement of <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> by the VEGF mimetic occurred independently of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) activity but was blocked by inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These results demonstrate that a VEGF mimetic is a potent stimulus for gastric <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing,</b> even when given orally. The effects of the mimetic were independent of stimulatory effects on angiogenesis and COX- 2 activity but were dependent on iNOS-derived NO production...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is impaired in duodenal ulcer disease and affected by treatment and healing. This was investigated by a study of maximal PGE 2 synthesis rates in duodenal and antral mucosal biopsies obtained at endoscopy. The patients were divided into three groups. Group (a) : endoscopically normal controls (n = 56); group (b) : treatment controls (non-DU disease: gastric ulcer or oesophagitis treated by histamine H 2 receptor antagonists) (n = 41); and group (c) : patients with DU disease (n = 183) further subdivided into group (c 1) active ulcer not on treatment (n = 47), (c 2) treated active ulcer (n = 35), (c 3) <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> on treatment (n = 86), and (c 4) <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> not on treatment (n = 15).

No difference was found between group (a) and (b) at either site. Group (c 1) ulcer rim made 49. 8 (22. 7) and at all stages ulcer rim and scar made less than the control duodenal bulb (p less than 0. 02).

Biopsies of control antrum synthesised 124. 5 (32. 2) but only 93. 7 (44. 2) in group (cl) (p < 0. 005). All stages of duodenal ulcer healing were associated with a decreased capacity to synthesise the major prostaglandin PGE 2 at the ulcer site and the uninvolved duodenal bulb and, in acute untreated duodenal ulcer, the uninvolved antrum.

We conclude that, in order to prevent a high ulcer recurrence rate, maintenance treatment should start only after the assessment of a complete endoscopic healing of duodenal ulcers...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{randomized}} controlled trial in South Africa found a beneficial effect of acyclovir on genital ulcer healing, but no effect {{was seen in}} trials in Ghana, Central African Republic and Malawi. The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess whether the variation in impact of acyclovir on ulcer healing in these trials can be explained by differences in the characteristics of the study populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: Pooled data were analysed to estimate the impact of acyclovir on the proportion of ulcers healed seven days after randomisation by HIV/CD 4 status, ulcer aetiology, size and duration before presentation; and impact on lesional HIV- 1. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Of 1478 patients with genital ulcer, most (63 %) had herpetic ulcers (16 % first episode HSV- 2 ulcers), and a further 3 % chancroid, 2 % syphilis, 0. 7 % lymphogranuloma venereum and 31 % undetermined aetiology. Over half (58 %) of patients were HIV- 1 seropositive. The median duration of symptoms before presentation was 6 days. Patients on acyclovir were more likely to have a <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> on day 7 (63 % vs 57 %, RR = 1. 08, 95 % CI 0. 98 – 1. 18), shorter time to healing (p = 0. 04) and less lesiona...|$|E
40|$|In a {{randomised}} open {{study of}} 28 outpatients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers, 14 patients {{were treated with}} colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) and 14 patients with cimetidine tablets. Clinical and endoscopic assessments were made before starting therapy and then four and six weeks after the commencement of therapy. The trial {{was carried out in}} adult patients and included 21 men and 7 women. After four weeks treatment, 9 of the CBS-treated ulcers (64 %) and 8 of the cimetidine treated ulcers (57 %) were completely healed. After 6 weeks of therapy, complete ulcer healing was seen in 86 % of ulcers in each group. In both groups the reduction of the pain scores after 4 and 6 weeks was highly significant. No adverse reactions were observed in respect of blood pressure or the various laboratory data. The blood bismuth levels after four and six weeks treatment with CBS remained within the safety limits. To determine the ulcer relapse rate, 20 of the 24 completely <b>healed</b> <b>ulcer</b> patients (10 of each group) were followed-up for a period of three months. Endoscopic control showed that recurrent ulcer was found in one CBS-treated patient and in three cimetidine-treated patients. The results showed that CBS tablets are as effective as cimetidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer. Our results confirm the previously reported CBS efficacy in duodenal ulcer after using the liquid preparation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} between chronic ulcers and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is well established. Their clinical presentations, however, are varied, ranging from innocuously appearing lesions to overtly exophytic growths. We present {{a series of}} cases with heterogeneous clinical presentations and different treatment outcomes. Case series – patient 1 was a 69 -year-old man with an 18 -month history of static non <b>healing</b> venous leg <b>ulcer,</b> but no sinister features, biopsy was performed to rule out Marjolin's transformation, histology revealed SCC and treatment was simple excision and skin grafting; patient 2 was a 73 -year-old lady with an 18 -month history of non <b>healing</b> <b>ulcer</b> (innocuous appearance) over distal interphalangeal joint of index finger, histology revealed SCC with deeper extension and treatment was amputation of distal half of finger; patient 3 was a 73 -year-old lady with a 12 -month history of non <b>healing</b> fungating leg <b>ulcer</b> with irregular borders and everted edges, histology revealed SCC (tumour eroding tibia and distant metastasis) and treatment was above-knee amputation, radiotherapy and palliation. Whilst SCC is amenable to simple excision in the early stages, delay in diagnosis could result in loss of the affected digit or limb; an SCC which has metastasised is also life threatening. Therefore, a low threshold to biopsy static non <b>healing</b> <b>ulcers</b> or ulcers in unusual sites should be adopted even in those not manifesting any evidence of malignancy...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveUlcer {{healing is}} a seldom {{reported}} outcome {{in studies of}} critical leg ischemia (CLI). The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze local factors affecting <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time after infrainguinal bypass surgery (IBS) for CLI Fontaine IV. MethodsIn this prospective single center cohort study, 110 patients (113 legs) undergoing IBS due to CLI with ischemic tissue defects during year 2006 were followed prospectively for 1 year after the bypass. Ulcer location, duration, presence of gangrene, and the University of Texas wound classification (UTWCS) were determined at presentation. Healing time of the ischemic tissue defects, leg salvage, patency, and survival were calculated. The characteristics of the ischemic tissue lesions and patient comorbidities were analyzed to determine risk factors for adverse outcome. ResultsComplete <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> (±SE) was achieved in 74 % ± 5 % of the legs 12 months after IBS. Median <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time was 186 days (range, 11 to > 365 days). Leg salvage, secondary patency, and survival at 12 months were 87 % ± 3 %, 82 % ± 4 %, and 76 % ± 5 %, respectively. Amputation-free survival with <b>healed</b> <b>ulcers</b> was attained in 55 % at 12 months. Ischemic tissue lesions located in the mid- and hindfoot had significantly prolonged <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 1 to 0. 9, P =. 044). None of the UTWCS classes predicted either <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time or leg salvage. Median ulcer duration before IBS was 68 days, range, 6 to 1154 days. Ulcer duration did not correlate with <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time (Spearman r = 0. 138, P =. 267). Ischemic ulcers with gangrene were not associated with prolonged <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time (P =. 353). ConclusionThe location of the ischemic tissue lesions influences <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time. According to our study UTWCS can be used as descriptive classification of ischemic ulcers but it does not predict the <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> time or leg salvage after infrainguinal bypass surgery...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-two {{patients}} with duodenal ulceration took trimipramine 50 mg or placebo. Fifteen patients on each treatment completed the study. Endoscopy at four weeks showed <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> in seven (46 %) patients on trimipramine, {{compared with only}} two (15 %) on placebo (P less than 0. 05). However, by eight weeks there were eight (53 %) patients in both groups with <b>healed</b> <b>ulcers.</b> There {{were no significant differences}} between the two groups in ulcer symptoms. Drowsiness was reported by eight patients on trimipramine compared with only one on placebo. Trimipramine 50 mg appears to increase the rate of <b>ulcer</b> <b>healing</b> in the short term.
