30|$|Limited {{research}} {{was carried out}} on <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effect</b> on the bonded joints strength. Most of the researchers [41, 157, 158, 174] reported the reduction in strength of ageing specimen (joints) at elevated temperature. However {{the strength of the}} pre-saturated joint up to 1.0 % of the moisture content increase in both room and elevated temperature conditions. A decrease in strength was observed in the case of higher temperature and longer exposure time to humidity. The tensile strength and ILSS decrease when the material has been exposed to moisture and tested at elevated temperature. But, no significant difference was reported for strength in between autoclave and vacuum-cured materials. This result supports the feasibility of scarf joint repairs with pre-cured or cocured patches under vacuum curing conditions in field-level facilities. Therefore, repairs with vacuum pre-cured or vacuum co-cured patches requiring less equipments seem to be a serious potential alternative to the composite patch repair requiring autoclave conditions which might be only available at depot level maintenance centers [96].|$|E

The outstanding influence of moisture on thermo-mechanical properties of biomass composites was confirmed through thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} hygrothermal {{conditions}} on the dynamic response of shear deformable laminated plates resting on a two-parameter (Pasternak-type) elastic foundation is investigated using a micro-to-macromechanical analytical model. The material properties of the composite {{are affected by the}} variation of temperature and moisture, and are based on a micromechanical model of a laminate. The governing equations are based on higher order shear deformation plate theory and include the plate–foundation interaction and hygrothermal effects. All four edges of the plate are assumed to be simply supported with no in-plane displacements. Analytical solutions of dynamic response for symmetric cross-ply and antisymmetric angle-ply laminated plates subjected to a transverse dynamic load under different sets of hygrothermal environmental conditions are obtained by using the state variable approach. The numerical illustrations concern the free vibration and dynamic response of shear deformable laminated plates resting on Pasternak-type elastic foundations with the Winkler elastic foundations being a limiting case. The influences played by temperature rise, the degree of moisture concentration, fiber volume fraction and foundation stiffness are studied. The results show that the hygrothermal environment has a significant effect on the natural frequency as well as dynamic response of the plate.

The combined temperature and humidity environments weaken the interfacial adhesion between the CNT surfaces and the epoxy matrix. Moreover, the experimental results show that the addition of 0. 5 wt. % of carbon nanotubes improved the static and fatigue strengths considerably under the same hygrothermal environments. However, when an excessive amount of CNTs was used (1. 0 wt. %), the nanocomposite exhibited the lowest strengths compared with the specimens with 0 and 0. 5 wt. % CNTs.

And simulation {{studies on the}} compressive strength of Z-pinned laminates of [0] 12 and [45 / 0 /– 45 / 90] 2 S are conducted by using finite element analysis (FEA). A microstructural unit cell for FEA is created to simulate a representative laminates unit with one pin. Within the unit cell, the first directions of the elements' material coordinate systems are changed to simulate the fibres' deflecting around the pin. The <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effect</b> is simulated by the material properties' adjustments which {{are determined by the}} compressive tests of non-pined laminates. The experimental results indicate that the percentage of reduction in the compressive modulus of Z-pinned laminates caused by Z-pin becomes smaller with the percentage of 0 ° fibres decreasing in the laminates; the compressive strength of quasi-isotropic laminates reduces and the percentage of the reduction in the compressive strength declines with Z-pin volume content increasing, and the moisture absorption ratio of the Z-pinned specimens is greater than that of the non-pinned specimens, because the cracks around Z-pin increase the moisture absorption. In addition, the simulations show that the deflection of fibres around Z-pin is the main factor for the reduction in the compressive strength of Z-pinned unidirectional laminates, the dilution of fibre volume content caused by resin-rich pocket is the principal factor for the decline in the compressive strength of Z-pinned quasi-istropic laminates, and the compressive strength of Z-pinned specimens in hygrothermal environment reduces as the result of superimposition of some factors, including the changes in material properties caused by hygrothermal environment, the deflection of fibres and the resin-rich pocket caused by Z-pin...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are increasingly used in aerospace, underwater, and automotive structures. Their use in structural applications is {{dictated by the}} outstanding strength and stiffness while being lightweight {{in addition to their}} flexibility in tailoring the desired performance in the design of structures. The present study focuses on the failure analysis and shape control of smart composite laminates under coupled hygrothermal, electric and mechanical stimuli. A linear thermo-electro-elastic constitutive model for transversely isotropic materials is used for each ply in the composite laminates. The first-ply failure and ultimate laminate failure criteria of composite laminates are used to predict the failure stress and mode of the composite laminate where we incorporate various commonly known macroscopic failure criteria including Tsai-Hill, Tsai Wu, maximum stress and maximum strain for each lamina. We study the use of piezoelectric materials such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and piezoelectric fiber composites as actuators for controlling deformation in composite laminates; this study focuses on bending deformation. The purpose is to minimize unwanted deformation, such as the one due to <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effect,</b> by applying counter deformation to avoid failure in such composite laminates. In addition, analysis based on the Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) is performed for Carbon/Epoxy (AS 4 / 3501 - 6) thin laminate with stacking sequence [90 / 45 /- 45 / 0]s under uniaxial and biaxial in-plane loading. One of the major types of failure in smart structures is caused by debonding of the actuator from the host structure which is caused by the high stress discontinuity between the interface of the host structure and the active part. By using embedded actuators, such that the active part is incorporated into one of the layers of the composite beam during the manufacturing process, the stress concentration effect can be reduced while obtaining similar actuation values. Moreover, a control algorithm is proposed that enables the composite laminate to overcome the failure load by using piezoelectric materials where a counter electric voltage could be applied which prevents failure from occurring. Furthermore, computer software called ?Hyper Composite? was developed using Action Script? and Adobe Flash? in order to perform stress and failure analysis for general composite laminates. Several carpet plots were also generated to show the interacting behavior of two independent variables such as Young?s modulus, Poisson?s ratio, shear modulus and the coefficient of thermal and moisture expansion at different percentile constitutions for the laminate different plies. This computer software is useful for estimating overall properties of smart composite laminates in designing smart composite structures...|$|E
40|$|Delaminations {{at various}} {{interfaces}} {{are one of}} the most critical reliability issues in plastic packages. Delamination is formed as a result of the imperfect interface adhesion between the integrated circuit (IC) package components. Adhesion has been identified as one of the key factors to improve delamination related problems. A thorough understanding of substrate, surface coatings, polymeric materials, interface adhesion properties and hygrothermal effects on reliability performance of the packages are necessary in order to minimize the problem of delamination and the associated package cracking issue. Previous research works have focused on dimples to improve the interfacial bond strength without full consideration of the surface coatings and hygrothermal effects on interfacial adhesion. In the present investigation of interfacial adhesion improvement between lead frame and epoxy molding compound (EMC), special emphasis has been placed on: i) the effects of dimple and metallic coating and; ii) the effects of temperature and hygrothermal ageing excursions simulating the practical package assembly processes. Moreover, the extension of copper oxide coating technology from printed circuit board (PCB) to IC packages, especially for copper lead frame and the heat sink/substrate for tape ball grid array (TBGA) packages, have necessitated a more detailed study of characterization and optimization of black oxide coating material, effect of debled treatment and <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effect</b> on interfacial adhesion. A study is made of the effects of dimple and metallic coatings by evaluating the surface characteristics, such as wettability, surface roughness and elemental compositions, which in turn are correlated with the maximum pull force measured from the lead pull tests. It is found that the dimples enhanced the maximum pull force through improved mechanical interlocking of molding compound, depending on the type of coating. The wettability of metal surface represented by the surface energy played a predominant role in controlling the interfacial adhesion. Hygrothermal ageing at 85 ℃/ 85 % RH followed by solder reflow process reduced the maximum pull force significantly especially for the hydrophilic and polar metal surfaces. The reduction in maximum pull force for hydrophilic surfaces is higher than hydrophobic surfaces. There was approximately a linear correlation between the reduction in interfacial bond strength and the differential work of adhesion between the dry and wet environments. The mechanical interlocking provided by dimples retained the interfacial adhesion in humid environment and stopped the propagation of delamination. In addition to the aforementioned metal plating and dimples, black copper oxide is another very useful chemical conversion coating for improved adhesion of copper with various polymers, and has been widely employed since the early days of printed circuit technology. The surface was characterized and it's thickness was optimized based on several state-of-the-art analytical instruments and interfacial adhesion study. The maximum shear force between the black oxide coated substrate and glob-top resin increased rapidly at a low range of oxide thickness, and became saturated at thicknesses greater than about 800 nm. There were functionally similar dependence of interfacial bond strength on oxide thickness, surface energy and surface roughness. A treatment for 150 sec is sufficient to produce a coating thickness with maximum adhesion with glob top resins. Mechanical hardening involved in the debleeding process consolidated the fibrillar cupric oxide into a flat surface, which reduced in turn both CuO/Cu 2 O ratio and the interfacial bond strength. Analysis of fracture surfaces indicated that cohesive failure occurred within the oxide layer for the black oxide coated substrate (cohesive failure), while fracture tended to occur along the coating-resin interface (adhesive failure) once the coated surface was processed with debleeding treatment. The presence of black oxide coating discouraged the moisture absorption, and encouraged the desorption of moisture within the coating. Autoclave test (or pressure cooker test, PCT), is regarded as the most severe test affecting the adhesion performance. The major contributions of this thesis are: i) to incorporate dimple and metallic coatings under hygrothermal conditions and to study its interfacial adhesion strength; ii) to report that the improvement in the interfacial adhesion due to dimples was higher for the coatings with inherently weak interfacial adhesion than those with inherently strong adhesion characteristic; iii) to study the correlation between interfacial adhesion and differential work of adhesion at dry and wet condition of metallic coatings; iv) to report the correlation between the work of adhesion difference and polar surface energy of metallic coatings; v) to report that dimples retains the interfacial adhesion under humid environment; and; vi) to compare the surface characteristics and interfacial adhesion of as-received black oxide and debled black oxide under different oxidation treatment time and hygrothermal conditions...|$|E

A further parametric study reveals that some other lay-ups can have negligible <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effects</b> even when the sublaminates above and below the delamination are not symmetric about their own mid-planes.

Another Interesting set of lay-ups investigated is a class of antisymmetric laminates with (+/-(theta/(theta - 90) (2) /theta)) (n) lay-ups. It is observed that when n takes on even numbers (2 and 4), both hygrothermal and mode 1 effects can be neglected. From this point of view, these lay-ups provide a way to determine the mode 3 toughness between two dissimilar layers. However, when n takes on odd numbers (1 and 3), both hygrothermal and mode 1 effects may be strong in these lay-ups.

The coupled model {{takes into account the}} main <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effects,</b> like moisture sources and sinks inside the room, moisture transfer through the envelope, vapor sorption-desorption at the exterior and interior wall surfaces, heat sources and sinks inside the room, heat input from the envelope, the solar energy input through walls and windows, and hygrothermal sources or sinks due to the air-conditioning system. The new model was implemented in MATLAB-Simulink, and was validated by using a series of testing and validation tools...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effects</b> on the failure {{mechanisms}} in bending of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. Accelerated diffusion testing {{was carried out}} by immersion at 50 °C constant temperature and 70 bar hydrostatic pressure to study the effects of fresh or sea water diffusion into pre-preg CFRP laminates. Consequently the composite laminates were tested in bending after 1 and 3 months’ immersion. A three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) model was developed to couple the moisture diffusion, hygrothermal expansion and bending. Optical and field emission scanning electronic microscope (SEM) were employed to analyse the failure mechanisms of CFRP composites in bending after immersion. The study showed that the mechanical properties are significantly reduced after short term immersion due to the edge effects, while the damage to the fibre/polymer interface becomes more significant to laminate degradation after longer-term immersion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe coupled heat, air and {{moisture}} transfer between building envelopes and indoor air is complicated, {{and has a}} significant influence on the indoor environment and the energy performance of buildings. In the paper, a model for predicting coupled multi-zone hygrothermal-airflow transfer is presented. Both heat {{and moisture}} transfer in the building envelope and multi-zone indoor airflow are simultaneously considered; their interactions are modeled. The coupled system model is implemented into Matlab–Simulink, and is validated by using a series of testing tools and experiments. The new program is applied to investigate the moisture transfer effect on indoor air humidity and building energy consumption in different climates (hot-humid, temperate and hot-dry climates). The results show that not accounting for <b>hygrothermal</b> <b>effects</b> in modeling will result in overestimation of energy costs for hot and humid climate situations and possible over sizing of plant leading to inefficient operation...|$|R
