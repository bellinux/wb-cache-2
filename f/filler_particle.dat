40|$|Pressure Sensitive Ink is an {{electrically}} conductive composite material made by Peratech Ltd. The conductivity of the inks {{is sensitive to}} touch pressure, which {{have a range of}} applications in areas including telecommunications and robotics and are printable as functional electronic devices. The inks are complex and composed of {{electrically conductive}} acicular (needle-like) refractory filler particles dispersed in an insulating organic base ink. Inks mixed, prepared and stored in a variety of conditions have been studied using high resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy, focused ion beam and EDX elemental analysis in conjunction with DC electrical characterization. The research has aimed to investigate possible links between the structure and electrical behaviour of the inks. The results have shown that inks stored for greater amounts of time, prior to printing, lose touch sensitivity. Causes for this are uncertain, but may be linked with the growth of nanoscale features on the filler particles and partial settling of constituents. EDX analysis revealed candidate elements for the nanoscale features found on filler particles. Modeling current-voltage plots with non-linear fits has shown there might be a switching of conduction mechanism with increasing compression of the inks. Additionally, the unclear process by which inks lose touch sensitivity was shown to be temperature dependent. Inks more vigorously blended were found to have shorter filler particles through a statistical survey of <b>filler</b> <b>particle</b> lengths, measured through scanning electron microscopy imaging. Inks produced with a lower <b>filler</b> <b>particle</b> to base ink ratio were found to be less sensitive to touch pressure than those made with comparatively more filler particles.

Although there are some significant differences in scale between the simulated model polymer composite and the system used in the experiments, some important qualitative similarities in shear behavior are observed. The trends in the steady-state shear viscosities of the simulated polymer-filler system agree with those seen in the experimental results; shear viscosities, zero-shear viscosities, and the rate of shear thinning are all seen to increase with filler content in both the experimental and simulated systems. We observe {{a significant difference between the}} filler volume fraction {{dependence of}} the zero-shear viscosity of the simulated system and that of the experimental system that can be attributed to a large difference in the ratio of the <b>filler</b> <b>particle</b> radius to the radius of gyration of the polymer molecules.

PBS is one of the biodegradable polymers, made from the condensation reaction of 1, 4 -butanediol and suc-cinic acid that can be naturally degraded in the natural environment. We compared the mechanical properties be-tween conventional plastics and agro-flour–filled PBS bio-composites. We evaluated the biodegradability and mechan-ical properties of agro-flour–filled PBS biocomposites ac-cording to the content and <b>filler</b> <b>particle</b> size of agro-flour. As the agro-flour loading was increased, the tensile and impact strength of the biocomposites decreased. As the <b>filler</b> <b>particle</b> size decreased, the tensile strength of the biocom-posites increased but the impact strength decreased. The addition of agro-flour to PBS produced a more rapid de-crease in the tensile strength, notched Izod impact strength, and percentage weight loss of the biocomposites during the natural soil burial test. These results support the application of biocomposites as environmentally friendly materials...|$|E

The glass transition behavior of the PDMS/SiO 2 composites was determined with differential scanning calorimetry. A clear influence on the o-Ps lifetime (73) in the polymer upon addition of nano-sized fumed SiO 2 was observed at all temperatures. The observed o-Ps lifetime behavior was related to filler content and <b>filler</b> <b>particle</b> size. A transition in the temperature dependence of the o-Ps lifetime was observed close to - 35 degreesC above which temperature PDMS exhibits long o-Ps lifetimes.

The o-Ps yield was strongly reduced in the crystallization region and by addition Of SiO 2. The reduction due to filler addition did, however, in the case of nano-sized SiO 2 not follow a linear relationship with filler weight, which was observed for micron-sized fillers. The nonlinear relationship between filler weight and o-Ps yield could be due to out-diffusion of positrons and/or o-Ps from the filler particles to the matrix. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

MAIR-IR spectrometry used in our study detects such functional groups and most other covalent bonds (Smith 1998) but will not detect inorganic leaching ions from <b>filler</b> <b>particles,</b> which might also affect cells in the proximal vicinity of the resin composite restorations in the mouth.|$|R

These results show the potential of these materials for use as electrical insulation in some specific applications. A small section of the article addresses {{the health and safety}} issues related to the use of nanoparticles in the electrical power engineering industry. We define epoxy nanocomposites as epoxy-based materials containing exclusively nanosized <b>filler</b> <b>particles.</b> Epoxy microcomposites are defined as epoxy materials containing exclusively microsized <b>filler</b> <b>particles,</b> and epoxy micro+nano composites are materials containing both microsized and nanosized particle...|$|R
