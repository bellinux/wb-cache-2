When R is a Noetherian local ring and M is a finitely generated R-module, {{the depth of}} M, written depthR(M) or just <b>depth(M),</b> means depthR(m, M); that is, it is the supremum of the lengths of all M-regular sequences in the maximal ideal m of R. In particular, the depth of a Noetherian local ring R means the depth of R as a R-module. That is, the depth of R is the maximum length of a regular sequence in the maximal ideal.|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point for this work is Auslander’s seminal paper [A]. The main focus of his paper was to understand when the tensor product M⊗RN of finitely generated modules M and N over a regular local ring R is torsion-free. This condition forces the vanishing of a certain Tor module associated to M and N, which in turn, by Auslander’s famous rigidity theorem, implies that Tor R i (M, N) = 0 for all i ≥ 1. The vanishing of Tor carries {{a great deal of}} information; for example it implies the “depth formula ” <b>depth(M)</b> + depth(N) = dim(R) + <b>depth(M</b> ⊗R N). From this formula one can deduce, for example, the highly non-trivial fact that if M ⊗R N is torsion-free and non-zero, then M and N must both be torsion-free. In [HW] Huneke and Wiegand generalized some of Auslander’s results to hypersurfaces, though with some unavoidable extra hypotheses. In particular, they proved a rigidity theorem [HW,(2. 4) ] and the following vanishing theorem: 0. 1. Theorem [HW,(2. 7) ]. Let R be a hypersurface, and let M and N be non-zero finitely generated R-modules such that M ⊗R N is reflexive. Assume, in addition, that one of M, N has constant rank. Then Tor R i (M, N) = 0 for every i ≥ 1. They also showed [HW, (2. 5) ] that vanishing of Tor implies the depth formula (for arbitrary complete intersections). A consequence is that both of the modules in the theorem above must be reflexive. Given that regular rings and hypersurfaces are complete intersections of codimension 0 and 1, respectively, and that torsion-free and reflexive are equivalent to Serre’s conditions (S 1) and (S 2), respectively, it seems reasonable to raise the question of whether over a complete intersection of codimension c, if M ⊗R N satisfies (Sc+ 1) then Tor R i (M, N) = 0 for every i ≥ 1. There are certain necessary conditions which must be satisfied. If Tor R i (M, N) = 0 for every i ≥ 1 then the depth formula holds for Mp and Np for every prime p in R, depth(Mp) + depth(Np) = dim(Rp) + <b>depth((M</b> ⊗R N) p) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Let K be a {{field and}} S = K[x 1, [...] .,xn]. In 1982, Stanley defined {{what is now}} called the Stanley depth of an S-module M, denoted sdepth(M), and conjectured that <b>depth(M)</b> ≤ sdepth(M) for all finitely {{generated}} S-modules M. This conjecture remains open for most cases. However, Herzog, Vladoiu and Zheng recently proposed a method of attack in the case when M = I/J with J ⊂ I being monomial S-ideals. Specifically, their method associates M with a partially ordered set. In this paper we take advantage of this association by using combinatorial tools to analyze squarefree Veronese ideals in S. In particular, if In,d is the squarefree Veronese ideal generated by all squarefree monomials of (n) degree d, we show that if 1 ≤ d ≤ n < 5 d + 4, then sdepth(In,d) = d+ 1 / (n) d + d, and ⌊ (n) if d ≥ 1 and n ≥ 5 d + 4, then d + 3 ≤ sdepth(In,d) ≤ d+ 1 / (n) d + d. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Let R = k[[x 0, [...] ., xd]]/(f), where k is a {{field and}} f is a non-zero non-unit of the formal power series ring k[[x 0, [...] ., xd]]. We {{investigate}} the question of which rings of this form have bounded Cohen–Macaulay type, that is, have a bound on the multiplicities of the indecomposable maximal Cohen–Macaulay modules. As with finite Cohen–Macaulay type, if the characteristic is different from two, the question reduces to the one-dimensional case: The ring R has bounded Cohen–Macaulay type {{if and only if}} R ∼ = k[[x 0, [...] .,xd]]/(g+x 2 2 + · · ·+x 2 d), where g ∈ k[[x 0, x 1]] and k[[x 0, x 1]]/(g) has bounded Cohen–Macaulay type. We determine which rings of the form k[[x 0, x 1]]/(g) have bounded Cohen–Macaulay type. This paper is dedicated to our friend and colleague Wolmer Vasconcelos. Throughout this paper (R, m, k) will denote a Cohen–Macaulay local ring (with maximal ideal m and residue field k). A maximal Cohen–Macaulay R-module (MCM module for short) is a finitely generated R-module with <b>depth(M)</b> = dim(R).

40|$|In this lecture {{we study}} the {{conjecture}} of Stanley [4]. Let K be a field, S = K[x 1, [...] .,xn] be the polynomial ring in n variables, and M be a finitely generated Zn-graded S-module. Let u ∈M be a homogeneous element in M and Z {{a subset of}} {x 1, [...] .,xn}. We denote by uK[Z] the K-subspace of M generated by all elements uv where v is a monomial in K[Z]. The Zn-graded K-subspace uK[Z]⊂M is called a Stanley space of dimension |Z|, if uK[Z] is a free K[Z]-module. A Stanley decomposition of M {{is a presentation of}} the Zn-graded K-vector space M as a finite direct sum of Stanley spaces D: M = m⊕ i= 1 uiK[Zi] in the category of Zn-graded K-vector spaces. The number sdepthD = min{|Zi | : i = 1, [...] .,m} is called the Stanley depth of D. The Stanley depth of M is defined to be sdepthM = max{sdepthD: D is a Stanley decomposition of M}. Stanley conjectured [4] that <b>depthM</b> ≤ sdepthM for all Zn-graded S-modules M. We discuss in the present lecture the relationship between Stanley decompositions and prime filtrations (see also [1],[2], [4]). We will also recall some basic upper and lower bounds for the Stanley depth of a finitely generated Zn-graded S-module (see [2]) ...|$|E
40|$|DSDP Hole 504 B was drilled into 6 Ma crust, about 200 km {{south of}} the Costa Rica Rift, Galapagos Spreading Center, {{penetrating}} 1. 35 km into a section that {{can be divided into}} four zones [...] Zone I: oxic submarine weathering; Zone II: anoxic alteration; Zones III and IV: hydrothermal alteration to greenschist facies. In Zone III there is intense veining of pillow basalts. Zone IV consists of altered sheeted dikes. Isotopic geochemical signatures in relation to the alteration zones are recorded in Hole 504 B, as follows: Zone <b>Depth(m)</b> Average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr Average delta 18 O (per mil) Average deltaD (per mil) I 275 - 550 0. 7032 7. 3 - 63 II 550 - 890 0. 7029 6. 5 - 45 III 890 - 1050 0. 7035 5. 6 - 31 IV 1050 - 1350 0. 7032 5. 5 - 36 Alteration temperatures are as low as 10 °C in Zones I and II based on oxygen isotope fractionation. Strontium isotopic data indicate that a circulation of seawater is much more restricted in Zone II than in Zone I. Fluid inclusion measurements of vein quartz indicate the alteration temperature was mainly 300 +/- 20 °C in Zones III and IV, which is consistent with secondary mineral assemblages. The strontium, oxygen, and hydrogen isotopic compositions of hydrothermal fluids which were responsible for the greenschist facies alteration in Zones III and IV are estimated to be 0. 7037, 2 per mil, and 3 per mil, respectively. Strontium and oxygen isotope data indicate that completely altered portions of greenstones and vein minerals were in equilibrium with modified seawater under low water/rock ratios (in weight) of about 1. 6. This value is close to that of the end-member hydrothermal fluids issuing at 21 °N EPR. Basement rocks are not completely hydrothermally altered. About 32 % of the greenstones in Zones III and IV have escaped alteration. Thus 1 g of fresh basalt including the 32 % unaltered portion are required in order to make 1 g of end-member solution from fresh seawater in water-rock reactions...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notions of}} depth and of when a local ring (or module over a local ring) is “S 2 ”. These notions are found in most books on commutative algebra, see for example [Mat 89, Section 16] or [Eis 95, Section 18]. Another excellent book that is focussed on these ideas is [BH 93]. We won’t be focussing on the commutative algebra, but one should be aware, at the very least, that this background exists. In particular, we won’t really use any of the theory on Cohen-Macaulay rings. However, since one ought {{to build up the}} same machinery in order to define S 2, we include these definitions as well. All rings will be assumed to be noetherian. Definition 1. 1. Let (R,m) be a local ring and let M be a finite R-module (which means finitely generated). An element r ∈ R is said to be M-regular if rx 6 = 0 for all x ∈M, x 6 = 0 (in other words, r is not a zero divisor on M). A sequence of elements r 1, [...] ., rn ∈ R is said to be M-regular if (i) ri is a regular M/(r 1, [...] ., ri− 1) element for all i ≥ 1 (in particular r 1 is M-regular) (ii) (r 1, [...] ., rn) M (M (that is, the containment is proper). Remark 1. 2. If condition (i) is satisfied, but condition (ii) is not necessarily satisfied then such a sequence is called weakly M-regular. Remark 1. 3. Notice that condition (ii) implies in a regular sequence, all ri ∈ m ∈ R. Remark 1. 4. One can (and often does) consider the notion of a regular sequence without the hypothesis R is local or that M if finitely generated. However, in that case these notions are not as well behaved (for example, whether or not a sequence is regular depends on the order of the sequence without these hypotheses). Definition 1. 5. Let (R,m) be a local ring and suppose that M is a finite R-module. We say that M has depth k (or in some books, the grade of m on M is k) if the maximal length of an M-regular sequence is k. We state a few basic properties of depth below. Please see any of the above references for proofs. Proposition 1. 6. Let (R,m) be a local ring and suppose that M if a finite R-module. Then (a) If we define a maximal M-regular sequence in the obvious way (it can’t be extended to a longer M-regular sequence), then every maximal M-regular sequence has the same length. (b) Modules have a notion of dimension (dimM = dim(A/AnnRM)) and one has <b>depthM</b> ≤ dimM. In particular, R is a finite R-module so we have depthR ≤ dimR...|$|E
