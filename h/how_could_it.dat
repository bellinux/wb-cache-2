The raising of revenue {{would be one of}} them. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> be determined which was the primary or predominant one; or whether it was necessary that revenue shd: be the sole object, in exclusion even of other incidental effects.|$|E
25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> be possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E
500|$|Yeats delayed visiting Olivia in London a month later; he instead {{tended to}} Johnson who was {{involved}} in the Wilde case and descending into the alcoholism that would kill him. Yeats appeared to have persuaded himself that Olivia and her cousin shared a flaw, writing, [...] "here is the same weakness I thought... Her beauty... dark and still, had the nobility of defeated things, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> help but wring my heart. I took a fortnight to decide what I should do". He constructed a plan to reconcile his desire with what he believed to be her wickedness: he would ask that she leave her husband to live with him. Until then their friendship would remain platonic.|$|E

500|$|Tracy Hickman once ran the {{adventure}} as a Dungeon Master. According to him, {{the experience was}} like an old scary movie, with [...] "the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire was {{up there in the}} castle. To most of the players it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." [...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. [...] "He deserved to die better than that," [...] his friend said, to which Hickman replied [...] "Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> be any different?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In Moltmann's opinion, {{all should}} be seen from an eschatological perspective, looking toward the days when Christ will make all things new. [...] "A proper {{theology}} would therefore have to be constructed {{in the light of}} its future goal. Eschatology should not be its end, but its beginning." [...] This does not, as many fear, 'remove happiness from the present' by focusing all ones attention toward the hope for Christ's return. Moltmann addresses this concern as such: [...] "Does this hope cheat man of the happiness of the present? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> do so! For it is itself the happiness of the present." [...] The importance of the current times is necessary for the Theology of Hope because it brings the future events to the here and now. This theological perspective of eschatology makes the hope of the future, the hope of today.|$|E
