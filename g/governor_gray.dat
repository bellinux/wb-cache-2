In 1999, <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E

Based on objections from <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> Davis, {{who did not want}} a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant was less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis approved it on October 2, 1999.

The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partner’s estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> Davis signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{of legal}} {{recognition}} for same-sex couples filed two lawsuits in the Superior Court of California. In the first case, state senator William “Pete” Knight sued <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> Davis (later substituting Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger) {{on the grounds}} that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended Proposition 22, which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed.|$|E
