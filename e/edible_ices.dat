40|$|Abstract Background Vibrio cholerae is the causative {{organism}} of waterborne disease, cholera. V. cholerae has caused many epidemics and pandemics of cholera for many years. In this study, V. cholerae recovered from <b>edible</b> <b>ice</b> were investigated for their genetic diversity using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) PCR and Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic (REP) PCR. Isolation was done using selective medium and the presumptive isolates were confirmed through biochemical and serological assays. Results Seventy-five isolates of V. cholerae were recovered from ice samples collected from different locations of Jakarta. Specifically, 19 {{of them were}} identified as O 1 serotype, 16 were Ogawa, 3 isolates were Inaba and the remaining isolates were non-O 1. The fingerprinting profiles of V. cholerae isolated from ice samples were very diverse. Conclusion This result showed that the ERIC sequence is more informative and discriminative than REP sequence for analysis of V. cholerae diversity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of highly swollen, strong, conductive hydrogel materials {{is necessary for}} the advancement of edible device research. Using a gellan gum/gelatin ionic-covalent entanglement (ICE) hydrogel, a simple method of producing conductive, edible hydrogels is described. ICE gels containing NaCl or CsCl were developed which exhibited conductivities of 200 ± 20 mS cm− 1 and 380 ± 30 mS cm− 1, respectively. Furthermore, the potential of food grade products for use as edible electrodes was examined by analysing the electrical properties of alginate-gelatin hydrogels, Vegemite, Marmite, jelly and gold leaf. Lastly, these <b>edible</b> <b>ICE</b> gels were used to demonstrate a capacitive pressure sensor from consumable materials, which displayed a sensitivity of 0. 80 ± 0. 06 pF kPa− 1 for a range of 4 - 20 kPa. The pressure exerted by the GI tract on its contents is standardly 0. 7 kPa to 6. 3 kPa. This suggests potential for application in the detection of digestive pressure abnormalities such as intestinal motility disorders...|$|R
40|$|Vibrio cholerae is a {{bacteria}} that lives naturally in an aquatic environment. It causes a waterborne disease {{which is called}} cholera. Infection of waterborne disease occurs via the fecal-oral route, mostly through drinking water. As we know, ice is made from city water sources and {{it is commonly used}} in beverages. Most of publications about V. cholerae come from clinical samples, while {{little is known about the}} presence of these bacteria in potable water, especially in ice. In this study, we isolated V. cholerae from ice in Jakarta and continued with detection of the virulence genes. We recovered V. cholerae from ice samples and then continued with detection of virulence genes including toxR, ctxA, ompU, tcpA, ace, zot using multiplex PCR. The results indicated that all of the samples were non-toxigenic strains, but were classified as pathogenic strains because they have at least one of the virulence genes present. The presence of pathogenic V. cholerae in <b>edible</b> <b>ice</b> needs to be emphasized since they have some of the virulence factors and also the class 1 integron...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} figures have an association with Pinner. The Poet Laureate Henry James Pye retired to East End House {{at the end}} of his career in 1811, the novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton wrote Eugene Aram at Pinner Wood House in 1832, and Samuel and Isabella Beeton lived on the Woodridings estate between 1856 and 1862, during which Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management was published. The novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett was born in the village in 1884, and the playwright W. S. Gilbert, though he did not live in Pinner, was a magistrate there from 1893 onwards. Another Victorian food writer, Agnes Marshall, whom most credit with the invention of <b>edible</b> <b>ice</b> cream cones, had a country home there and died there in 1905. Twentieth-century figures include the cartoonist William Heath Robinson, who lived in Moss Lane between 1913 and 1918 (and now has a museum dedicated to him at West House in Pinner Memorial Park), and the former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen, who writes children's books such as We're Going on a Bear Hunt, lived in Pinner from the time he was born in 1946, until 1962.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Escherichia coli {{was used}} to {{investigate}} quinolone resistance and mutations in gyrA gene of E. coli isolated from pet (dog and cat), human (pet’s owner), vegetable and <b>edible</b> <b>ice</b> in Bangkok and vicinity. Susceptibility test for nalidixic acid (NA) showed similar percent resis-tance among the sample sources but a lower ciprofloxacin (CIP) resistance was found particu-larly in human source. Mutations within quinolone resistance determining region of gyrA gene analyzed using non-radioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequenc-ing showed 10 different SSCP patterns. E. coli isolates from pet, vegetable and ice showed more variety of patterns than strains isolated from human. Four out of 10 SSCP patterns were identified as having mutations in amino acids positions 83 (Ser to Leu) and position 87 (Asp to Asn). These mutations were observed only in NA-resistant strains and combined mutations were observed only in E. coli isolated from humans and pets. As only 24 % of NA- and CIP-resistant E. coli isolates contained gyrA mutations, other quinolone resistant mechanisms may be involved. Nevertheless, gyrA mutations {{may be used to}} monitor nalidixid acid resistance in E. coli. posed of 2 pairs of subunits. The subunits o...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable <b>edible</b> <b>icing</b> or {{frosting}} is {{an alternative}} to synthetic packaging that causes environmental concerns. This work evaluated the effect {{of different types of}} frosting on the physical-chemical properties of chocolate cake during storage in comparison to cakes without icing or frosting (C) and cakes without frosting packed in polypropylene (CP). The following frostings were applied to the cakes: 10 % gelatin (GE), 10 % gelatin with 10 % stearic acid (GE+SA), 18 % "carnauba" wax (CW), 10 % modified starch (MS), and fondant (FO). The cakes were analyzed during 10 days of storage. FO and CP presented the lowest mass loss while all other treatments presented higher values than C. GE, GE+SA, and CP presented the lowest reduction of water activity while CW and C presented the highest reduction. The surfaces of the frosted cakes were harder than C and CP. The highest values for hardness and chewiness were found for CW and C and the lowest for CP, GE, and GE+SA. With respect to color, GE+SA was different from the remaining cakes due to the presence of the stearic acid. The results indicate that the mass loss of the cakes could also be attributed to the loss of water from the frostings...|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to perform}} the {{physicochemical}} characterization of the flour from the bark of jabuticaba, as well as developing three ice cream formulations (enriched with 0, 5 and 10 % of this flour) and evaluate the physicochemical and sensory characteristics. Fruits were pulped, the peels were dehydrated, dried, crushed and sieved to obtain the flour that was analyzed for physicochemical levels. Then, three ice cream formulations were developed (with 0 %, 5 % and 10 % flour from the bark of jabuticaba), considering the physicochemical and sensorial characteristics. The {{results showed that the}} flour from the bark of jabuticaba showed high ash and fiber. The ice creams showed differences (p 0. 05) was soluble solid. The overrun was ecreasing with increasing addition of flour. In the sensory evaluation, only attributes that differ (p < 0. 05) were flavor, texture and overall appearance of the formulation with 10 % flour from the bark of jabuticaba, which represents that incorporation of 5 % flour from the bark of jabuticaba did not affect the cceptability of ice creams. It can be concluded that the enrichment of blemish bark flour provides <b>edible</b> <b>ice</b> increase in nutritional value without affecting the sensory characteristics at the level of 5 % added. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Agnes Bertha Marshall (24 August 1855 - 29 July 1905) was an English culinary entrepreneur. She {{became a}} leading cookery {{writer in the}} Victorian period, and was dubbed the [...] "Queen of Ices" [...] for her works on ice cream and other frozen desserts. In time before {{practical}} domestic refrigeration, her success increased the demand in London for ice imported from Norway. Her 1888 cookery book included a recipe for [...] "cornets with cream", possibly the earliest publication of the <b>edible</b> <b>ice</b> cream cone. Marshall was born in Walthamstow. Her father, John Smith, was a clerk, but {{died when she was}} young and his widow, Susan, remarried. Marshall's early life remains obscure, but it was later written in the Pall Mall Gazette that she studied cooking from an early age, and [...] "practised at Paris and with Vienna's celebrated chefs". She married Alfred William Marshall in 1878. She wrote four books: Ices Plain and Fancy: The Book of Ices (1885), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery (1888), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes (1891) and Fancy Ices (1894). She also gave public lectures on cooking, and ran an agency for domestic staff. She was granted a patent for an improved ice cream machine that could freeze a pint of ice cream in five minutes, and also suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream. With her husband, she established the Marshall School of Cookery in Mortimer Street in 1883, and published a weekly magazine, The Table, from 1886. The couple also sold cooking supplies and equipment. She fell from a horse in 1904 and never fully recovered. She died in Pinner the following year, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. After her death, the rights to her books were sold to Mrs Beeton's publisher, Ward Lock. Her husband took over the business that they had run together, but it failed. Unlike Mrs Beeton, Marshall quickly faded from public memory. A biography was published in 1998 entitled Mrs Marshall: the Greatest Victorian Ice Cream Maker, including a facsimile of her 1885 Book of Ices.|$|R
