The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization.

The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both <b>equal</b> and unequal. Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the <b>equal</b> and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E

5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive.

The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: <b>equal</b> worth of citizens, <b>equal</b> rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens <b>equal</b> political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship.
