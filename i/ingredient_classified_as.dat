5000|$|Polydextrose is a {{synthetic}} polymer of glucose. It is a food <b>ingredient</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> soluble fiber by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{as well as}} Health Canada, [...] It is frequently used to increase the non-dietary fiber content of food, to replace sugar, and to reduce calories and fat content. It is a multi-purpose food ingredient synthesized from dextrose (glucose), plus about 10 percent sorbitol and 1 percent citric acid. Its E number is E1200. The FDA approved it in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|In the US, state {{regulation}} applies {{in addition to}} federal regulation. For example, California's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed off fiercely contested toxics legislation that requires cosmetic producers to report use of <b>ingredients</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> carcinogenic or toxic to reproduction, a measure primarily aimed at phthalates. The legal basis for monitoring cosmetics in the European Union is derived from Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC. [...] This 1976 directive requires that cosmetic products 'must not cause damage to human health when applied under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use'. The safety officer of a company with marketed cosmetics files product information, including a safety report, in electronic or other format to the competent authority of the Member State. This takes place after placing cosmetic products on the market, with updates by state requirement.|$|R

We verified the use of 201 rural products (pesticides) in the region, comprising 151 active ingredients. Regarding the active ingredients evaluated, 15. 9 % were associated with sediment and 29. 8 % were dissolved in surface water. The study showed that 13. 2 % to 36. 4 % of the active <b>ingredients</b> evaluated were <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> potential contaminants of groundwater resources.

30|$|The {{following}} substances were {{ingredients in}} the products under scrutiny here, but their amounts stayed below the thresholds for labelling the mixtures: Several products contain <b>ingredients</b> which were <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> ‘Toxic if swallowed.‘ (e.g. Thioglycolic Acid) or ‘Harmful if swallowed.’ (e.g. Sodium Laureth Sulfate, PVP/VA Copolymer or Calcium Thioglycolate). Substances <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> ‘Harmful if inhaled.’ were e.g. PEG- 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil which was for example part of the baby shampoo. Substances <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> ‘May cause respiratory irritation.’ were present, but only the sum of these ingredients would {{have led to a}} classification of the mixture, not the single substances. Substances present in products of the retail shops, where the exact percentage in the final product is unknown to the author, were for example Coumarin which is classified among other H-statements with ‘May cause damage to organs.’ or Laureth- 4 classified among other H-statements as ‘May cause respiratory irritation.’.|$|R
40|$|Many {{chemicals}} {{are present in}} cleaning and personal care products, which after use are washed down the drain and {{find their way into}} water bodies, where they may impact the environment. This study surveyed individuals to determine what products were used most in the home, in an attempt to prioritize which compounds may be of most concern. The survey resulted in the identification of 14 categories of products consisting of 315 specific brands. The survey estimated that individuals each discharge almost 33 L of products per year down the drain. Dishwashing liquids and hand wash gels, which accounted for 40 % of this volume, were selected for identification of specific <b>ingredients.</b> <b>Ingredients</b> were <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> surfactants, preservatives, fragrances or miscellaneous, with hand wash gels having a wider range of ingredients than dishwashing liquids. A review of the literature suggested that preservatives, which are designed to be toxic, and fragrances, where data on toxicity are limited, should be prioritized. The approach undertaken has successfully estimated use and provisionally identified some classes of chemicals which may be of most concern when used in cleaning and personal care products...|$|R

Within {{the last few years}} a new area of s tudy has developed con-cerning the use of man made compounds as energy contributors in poultry diets. One compound which has been investi-gated as an energy source is the polyhy-droxy alcohol, 1, 3 butanediol (1, 3 BD). Early investigations of 1, 3 BD by Stoewsand et al. (1965) and Mehlman et al. (1966) suggested 1, 3 BD was direct-ly involved in lipid metabolism. Miller et al. (1965) reported the effects of admin-istering labeled butanediol- 1 -C 14 and pro-posed tha t 1, 3 BD was metabolized through carbohydrate pathways. Miller and Dymsa (1967) presented da ta which indicated 1, 3 BD can supply 6. 5 cal. /g. metabolizable energy to rat diets.

5000|$|In India, Reddiars are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Forward caste.In Tamilnadu, Reddiars are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Forward Caste by the British. For example, {{the first}} chief {{minister}} of Tamil Nadu (Madras Presidency in 1920) was a Reddiar. [...] Today, Reddiars are generally <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Forward Caste in Tamilnadu. For example, a Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha in 2006 distinguished between Reddiars who are generally <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> forward castes in Tamilnadu and Koda Reddys who are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Scheduled Tribes in Tamilnadu. Similarly, the Madras High Court in 2015 considered this distinction between Reddiars who are generally <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> forward castes and konda reddys who are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Scheduled Tribes as dispositive a writ petition in a reservation case in Tamilnadu. After Independence, some sub-castes among Reddiars in Tamilnadu such a Ganjam Reddys {{have been included}} in the Backward Class list by the state government. Some sub-castes like Ganjam Reddys from Tamilnadu have now sought classification as backwards caste in the central government list. Konda Reddys are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Scheduled Tribes.Some reddiars are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Backward caste, in Kerala where they migrated to in early 1900 (excludes Malabar district where Reddiars are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> forward). [...] For example, Reddiars in Malabar excluding Ganjam Reddys are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> forward. [...] Reddiars in other districts are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> backward since 1993. [...] Some Reddiars in Kerala are considered protected minorities, who need better educational access due to merchantile roots of Reddiars in Kerala and lack of significant land ownership, except in Malabar district of Kerala. There is a separate section of Reddiars called Konda Reddy who were considered Shudras in British surveys, who follow tribal customs. Recently, Konda Reddys in Odissa have been pressing for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes list.|$|R
