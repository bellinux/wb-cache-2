40|$|The {{notion that}} inanimate {{objects such as}} brands can be {{associated}} with a set of human characteristics is well ac-cepted by social psychologists (e. g., Bern and Funder 1978; Prentice 1987; Snyder and Gangestad 1986), as well as ad-vertisers (e. g., Biel 1993; Ogilvy 1983; Plummer 1985). The basic argument is that attitude objects, such as brands, {{can be associated with}} personality traits that provide self-expressive or symbolic benefits for the consumer. Despite this knowledge, much of consumer behavior research, par-ticularly in the realm of consumer experimental psychology, has focused solely on the role of brand attributes and the utilitarian function of consumer attitudes (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975), neglecting the role of brand personality and the symbolic function of consumer attitudes.

Revision rates for aseptic failure have been reported between 1.5 % and nearly 20 % in mid- to long-term follow-up [1]. Many stem designs and surgical techniques have been utilized in revision of the femoral stem. These include: cement fixation [2], cementless proximally-coated stems [3], extensively-coated stems [4], and modular stems [5, 6]. Regardless of the stem design, the principle pre-requisites for femoral revision are: maximizing fit, immediate press-fit stability, control of axial and rotational stability, and optimal bone-remodeling in the long-term. Variable success rates have been reported with each design and technique.|$|R

As the Canadian urban system developed during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, these small towns played a vital role in supporting regional economies. Over time this system came to be dominated by a small number of metropolitan centres which, in turn, created and rein-forced core-periphery or heartland–hinterland relationships on both national and regional levels (McCann and Smith, 1991).

Methods: Electronic questionnaire survey of 185 UK Stop Smoking Services Managers. Results: Ninety six Stop Smoking Service managers returned completed questionnaires (52 % response rate). Of these, 58. 3 % (n = 56) ran NHS Stop Smoking Services which provided relapse prevention interventions for clients with the most commonly provided interventions being behavioural support: telephone (77 %), group (73 %), and individual (54 %).

Both cemented and uncemented implant designs are commonly used in the United Kingdom for primary and revision THA and much controversy still exists as to the ideal method of stem fixation. In this article we discuss revision of the femur using cemented components during revision THA.

Several techniques have been described for the repair of acetabular bone defect, including the use of cemented cup onto the structural bone graft (Paprosky and Magnus 1994), bilobed cup (Moskal et al. 2008), metal mesh (Jasty and Harris 1988), acetabular cage (Sembrano and Cheng 2008), Müller reinforcement ring (Stöckl et al. 1997), and reinforcement plate, such as Kerboull or KT plate (Okano et al. 2010; Kawanabe et al. 2007; Baba and Shitoto 2010) with or without allografting. In 120 revision THA cases conducted in our department, only two demonstrated acetabular bone defect with pelvic discontinuity. While the frequency of pelvic discontinuity in the revision THA is within a clinically acceptable range, reconstruction of the acetabulum with massive bone defect, including pelvic discontinuity, is a still perplexing problem in revision <b>THA</b> <b>despite</b> the currently available solutions.

40|$|SUMMARY The excitability of the monosynaptic reflex pathway {{was tested}} in infants and {{children}} from birth to four years of age during waking and sleeping. The H reflex, evoked in the soleus muscle, was {{used to calculate the}} ratio, maximal H to maximal M, construct recruitment curves and test reflex excitability by the paired stimulus method. The excitability of the monosynaptic reflex pathway during the waking state is greatest at birth; it diminishes gradually during the first years of life without reaching the average level observed in adults {{by the end of the}} fourth year of age. From birth, regard-less of age, sleep always depresses excitability. The mechanisms that underlie this change with age, and with waking or sleeping, are discussed. The characteristics of monosynaptic reflex responses have formed the subject of numerous studies in normal adult humanl- 3 and in the spastic man. 4 - 9 In the child, monosynaptic reflexes have been studied most in the upper limbs. 10 - 12 Few authors have used Hoffmann's monosynaptic reflex evoked in the soleus muscle of the child, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>tha...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{dilemma that}} was {{presented}} to the scientific world by Chandrasekhar’s early work (1931) on the existence of a maximum mass for white dwarf stars took some while to be fully appreciated. There were some, such as Eddington, who did seem to understand the alarming implications of Chandra’s conclusions. Assuming the correctness of the relativistic equations of state, it seemed that a white dwarf star of mass more than about 1. 4 of a solar mass would have to collapse inwards, its density increasing indefinitely as the body approached a singular configuration at the centre. However, Eddington himself regarded this as a reductio ad absurdum, concluding, instead that there must be something wrong with Chandra’s use of the relativistic equations. Eddington supposedly had in mind that some new physical principles must come into play in order to save the star, perhaps such as embodied in his own approach to a deeper fundamental theory (Eddington 1946).

Method Pubmed and Embase were systematically searched to find studies that described factors that influence return to work (RTW) after surgery. The following inclusion criteria had to be met: (1) inclusion of patients with primary or revision TKA or THA; (2) description of return to work after surgery or employment status; and (3) description of a beneficial or restricting factor affecting return to work. Results Only three studies were found that fulfilled the three inclusion criteria. Three factors were discussed: (1) the mini-posterior approach compared to the two-incision approach; (2) patient movement restrictions after surgery compared to no restrictions; and (3) patient discharge based on guidelines compared to discharge without guidelines. Conclusions This systematic review revealed that knowledge is sparse regarding beneficial or limiting factors affecting return to work after TKA or <b>THA.</b> <b>Despite</b> that, the results suggests that the two-incision approach is beneficial, patient movement restrictions are limiting, and patient discharge guidelines have no effect on the time patients take to RT...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if pre-operative {{psychological distress}} was associated with adverse functional outcome after primary THR. We analysed the database of a prospective multi-centre study undertaken between January 1999 and January 2002. We recorded the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and SF 36 score preoperatively and up to five years after surgery for 1055 patients. We dichotomised the patients into the mentally distressed (Mental Health Scale score - MHS = 56) and the not mentally distressed (MHS > 56) groups based on their pre-operative MHS of the SF 36. 762 (72. 22 %). Patients (595 not distressed and 167 distressed) were followed up at 5 years. Both pre and post-operative OHS and SF- 36 scores were significantly worse in the distressed group (both p< 0. 001). However, both groups experienced statistically significant improvement in OHS and MHS, which was maximal at 1 year after surgery and was maintained over the follow up (p= 0. 00). There was a substantial improvement in mental distress in patients who reported mental distress prior to surgery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In our {{hospital}} a fast-track setting {{including a}} multimodal pain protocol {{is used for}} total hip arthroplasty (<b>THA).</b> <b>Despite</b> this multimodal pain protocol {{there is still a}} large range in reported postoperative pain between patients, which hinders mobilization and rehabilitation postoperatively. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify which patient-specific and surgical characteristics influence postoperative pain after THA in a fast-track setting. METHODS: All 74 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip who underwent primary THA procedure by anterior supine intermuscular approach between November 2012 and January 2014 were included in this prospective cohort study. The protocol for pain medication was standardized. Postoperative pain determined with the Numeric Rating Score was collected at 17 standardized moments. Linear mixed models were used to examine potential patient-specific and surgical factors associated with increased postoperative pain. RESULTS: Pain patterns differed substantially across individuals. Adjusted for other variables in the model, preoperative use of pain medication (regression coefficient 0. 78 (95 % CI 0. 28 - 1. 26); p = 0. 005) and preoperative neuropathic pain scored by DN 4 (regression coefficient 0. 68 (95 % CI 0. 15 - 1. 20); p = 0. 02) were the only factors significantly associated with higher postoperative pain scores. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of which factors are associated with higher postoperative pain scores after THA in a fast-track setting may help optimizing perioperative postoperative pain management and preoperative education of these patients.

40|$|We now {{delve into}} one final major theme of our text: distribution. In {{this part of}} the book, we will explore some of the {{underlying}} tech-nology {{in one of the most}} important aspect of modern systems: how to build distributed systems. Distributed systems have changed the face of the world. When your web browser connects to a web server somewhere else on the planet, it is participating in what seems to be a simple form of a client/server distributed system. When you contact a modern web service such as Google or facebook, you are not just interacting with a single machine, however; behind the scenes, these complex ser-vices are built from a large collection (i. e., thousands) of machines, each of which cooperate to provide the particular service of the site. Thus, it should be clear what makes studying distributed systems interesting. Indeed, it is worthy of an entire class; here, we just intro-duce a few of the major topics. A number of new challenges arise when building a distributed system. The major one we focus on is failure; machines, disks, net-works, and software all fail from time to time, as we do not (and likely, will never) know how to build “perfect ” components and sys-tems. However, when we build a modern web service, we’d like it to appear to clients as if it never fails; how can we accomplish this task? Interestingly, while failure is a central challenge in constructing distributed systems, it also represents an opportunity. Yes, machines fail; but the mere fact that a machine fails does not imply the en-tire system must fail. By collecting together a set of machines, we can build a system that appears to rarely fail, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>tha...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{series of}} {{experiments}} had its origin in an experiment on the mesenteric vein innervation in the intact animal, which was itself negative, in result. The animal was a rabbit, which was anesthetized previous to the experiment with 1 grams urethane per kilogram of body weight. As a control to the experiment, the effect of urethane was tested on a rabbit’s mesenteric vein ring, which was suspended between two hooks in a beaker of Ringer’s solution kept at 37 #{ 176 }C. The rabbit’s mesenteric vein is small in diameter, about 0. 15 cm., and yet this preparation gave a relaxation as great as 0. 6 cm. with a lever which magnified movements eighteen times. The effect was therefore considerable, and likely to be of importance in any experiment on veins in the urethanized animal. It seemed of equal importance and of some interest to investigate the effect of urethane on other tissues {{in which there is}} involuntary muscle, seeing that, although urethane is little used in the case of man, it is often used as a laboratory anesthetic. If it be taken, as seems justified by a summary of the results of a large {{series of experiments}} (1), that the rabbit’s blood weight is equal to approximately one-twentieth of its body weight, then a dosage of 1 grams per kilogram body weight would be equal to a concentration of over 1 : 40, if it were all in the blood. This is, of course, not claimed for an instant, but it is useful for the pres-ent purpose because it means that the concentration is nowhere likely to be greater than this, and experiments in which it is necessary to use urethane in larger amounts can reasonably be accounted of little practical importance, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>tha...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Compromised rheumatic bone is a {{potential}} risk factor for mechanical complications in cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) in cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Increased rates of intra-operative fractures, component migration and (early) aseptic loosening are to be expected. <b>Despite</b> this, cementless <b>THA</b> is performed in cases of RA. Methods A literature search on cementless THA in RA was performed in EMBASE (1993 - 2011), Medline (1966 - 2011) and the Cochrane Library. A systematic review was conducted with a special emphasis on mechanical complications. Results Twenty-three case series and five studies of implant registries were included. Acetabular fractures and/ or migration of the cup were reported in 9 out of 22 studies of the cup. Proximal femoral fractures and/or subsidence of the stem were reported in 14 out of 20 studies of the stem. Six studies compared failure rates of uncemented and cemented components due to aseptic loosening. The overall failure rate ratio (uncemented/cemented) for the cup was 0. 6 (95 % CI: 0. 14 - 2. 60) and for the stem 0. 71 (95 % CI: 0. 06 - 8. 55), both favoring uncemented fixation. The failure rates in case series without a control group were compared to the NICE criteria (failure rate/ 1). The overall failure rate for the cup was 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 50 - 1. 88) and for the stem 0. 79 (95 % CI: 0. 44 - 1. 41). Failure rates of aseptic loosening of higher than 1 (favoring cemented fixation) were reported in 6 out of 26 studies of the cup and in 2 out of 25 studies of the stem. In all these studies, the inferior implant designs were blamed, and {{not the type of}} fixation or the quality of the bone.

40|$|Owing to an ageing population, {{the impact}} of {{unhealthy}} lifestyle, or simply congenital or gender specific issues (dysplasia), degenerative bone and joint disease (osteoarthritis) at the hip pose an increasing problem in many countries. Osteoarthritis is painful and causes mobility restrictions; amelioration is often only achieved by replacing the complete hip joint in a total hip arthroplasty (<b>THA).</b> <b>Despite</b> significant orthopaedic progress related to THA, {{the success of the}} surgical process relies heavily on the judgement, experience, skills and techniques used of the surgeon. One common way of implanting the stem into the femur is press fitting uncemented stem designs into a prepared cavity. By using a range of compaction broaches, which are impacted into the femur, the cavity for the implant is formed. However, the surgeon decides whether to change the size of the broach, how hard and fast it is impacted or when to stop the excavation process, merely based on acoustic, haptic or visual cues which are subjective. It is known that non-ideal cavity preparations increase the risk of peri-prosthetic fractures especially in elderly people. This study reports on a simulated hip replacement surgery on a cadaver and the analysis of impaction forces and the microphone signals during compaction. The recorded transient signals of short durations (80 s - 2 ms) are statistically analysed for their trend, which shows increasing heteroscedasticity in the force-pressure relationship between broach sizes. By applying the TIKHONOV regularisation technique to calculate the acoustic transfer function, high-frequency content shows up for an increasing number of hammer blows and broach sizes used. The spectra indicate altered system characteristics: more resonances with relative similar magnitude. By applying nonlinear time series analysis the system dynamics increase in complexity and demand for a larger minimum embedding dimension. The growing number of resonances with similar level of the transfer function indicates a higher propensity to dissipate energy over sound; the change in embedding dimension indicates a decrease in linearity. The spectral changes as well as the altered dimension requirements indicate either an improved coupling between the bone and the broach or the onset of micro-fractures caused by growing stress levels within the bone...|$|R
