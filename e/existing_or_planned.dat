5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on {{the newly}} reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any <b>existing</b> <b>or</b> <b>planned</b> bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E

500|$|The two ends of SR 16 {{were added}} to the state highway system by the third bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1919: Route 50 from Lower Lake east to Rumsey and Route 54 from the Sacramento-Amador County line east to Drytown.

Although the exact alignment of Route 50 was not specified, the state Department of Engineering had already surveyed a 35-mile (56km) route through Cache Creek Canyon pursuant to a 1915 law, which defined the Yolo and Lake Highway [...] "following generally, the meanderings of Cache creek" [...] but did not make it a state highway. By 1924, the California Highway Commission's engineers had realized that building Route 50 through the canyon was impractical, and adopted a substitute plan for two highways connecting Lower Lake and Rumsey with the planned Route 15 (Tahoe-Ukiah Highway, now State Route 20) to the north in September 1925. The western connection, to Lower Lake, became part of Route 49 (now State Route 53 there), which continued south from Lower Lake to Calistoga.|$|E

30|$|The problem {{consists}} of determining {{a plan that}} specifies the set of elective cases that would be performed in each period over a planning horizon with considering the uncertain demand of emergency cases and also uncertain demand for C-arm as a unique equipment. In this scheduling we should consider to have no overlap in using this unique equipment for different surgeries. Overlaps cause cancellation and also make surgeries longer than usual that increase patient related costs. When this unique equipment is being used for one patient, other patients should wait for it, this will increase the waiting time if not scheduled. This waiting time increases the costs of patient as well as hospital, so {{we should try to}} omit these waiting times. But financial aspects alone are not sufficient in establishing surgical schedules. We can no longer ignore the significant place of the people involved in the medical process execution. Thus, in addition to the usual economic objective presented in the literature we undertake human dimension. The surgery plan should minimize costs related to the over-utilization of ORs and costs related to performing elective surgery. Although numerous studies show the extreme importance of accounting uncertainties such as emergency demand in <b>OR</b> <b>planning</b> and demand for this unique equipment, <b>existing</b> <b>OR</b> <b>planning</b> approaches all use deterministic optimization models and assume that the hospital uses dedicated ORs to serve emergency patients, or devotes a fixed portion of OR capacity to perform only the emergency surgeries. The main contributions of this paper include (1) a new <b>OR</b> <b>planning</b> model that explicitly takes into account elective and emergency patients under uncertainty of using a unique equipment (C-ARM), (2) model’s Np-hardness causes using Metaheuristic method for solving the problem in large size problems. Our <b>OR</b> <b>planning</b> method shows a good reduction of overall cost. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: “A programming model for scheduling OR elective operations” section presents the planning model for the problem. In section “Solution strategy: sample average approximation” sample average approximation is presented to approximate the problem with sample size N. Metaheuristic method is introduced in section“The proposed Metaheuristic method”; Numerical results of the optimization method are presented in section“Computational experiments”. “Conclusions and future research” section concludes the paper and discusses possible extensions of this work.|$|R

Plugins for violations of speeding, slow driving, and abrupt stopping were developed using Aimsun's API and SDK module.

A Fuzzy C-mean Clustering algorithm was developed to identify high risk states in different road segments over time. Results of a simulation experiment based on the G 15 Expressway in Shanghai showed that abrupt stopping had the greatest impact on increasing collision risk, and the impact of violations increased with traffic volume.
