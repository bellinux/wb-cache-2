50|$|<b>Homoplasmy</b> is a {{term used}} in {{genetics}} to describe a eukaryotic cell whose copies of mitochondrial DNA are all identical. In normal and healthy tissues, all cells are homoplasmic. Homoplasmic mitochondrial DNA copies may be normal or mutated; however, most mutations are heteroplasmic (only occurring in some copies of mitochondrial DNA). It has been discovered, though, that homoplasmic mitochondrial DNA mutations {{may be found in}} human tumors.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{theories}} why the paternal mtDNA is not {{transmitted to}} the offspring. One is simply the fact that paternal mtDNA is at such a lower concentration than the maternal mtDNA and thus it is not detectable in the offspring. A second, more complex theory, involves the digestion of the paternal mtDNA to prevent its inheritance. It is theorized that the uniparental inheritance of mtDNA, which has a high mutation rate, might be a mechanism to maintain the <b>homoplasmy</b> of cytoplasmic DNA.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{sequencing}} identifies {{common and}} rare genetic variants for association studies, but studies typically focus on variants in nuclear DNA {{and ignore the}} mitochondrial genome. In fact, analyzing variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences presents special problems, which we resolve here with a general solution {{for the analysis of}} mtDNA in next-generation sequencing studies. The new program package comprises 1) an algorithm designed to identify mtDNA variants (i. e., <b>homoplasmies</b> and heteroplasmies), incorporating sequencing error rates at each base in a likelihood calculation and allowing allele fractions at a variant site to differ across individuals; and 2) an estimation of mtDNA copy number in a cell directly from whole-genome sequencing data. We also apply the methods to DNA sequence from lymphocytes of ~ 2, 000 SardiNIA Project participants. As expected, mothers and offspring share all <b>homoplasmies</b> but a lesser proportion of heteroplasmies. Both <b>homoplasmies</b> and heteroplasmies show 5 -fold higher transition/transversion ratios than variants in nuclear DNA. Also, heteroplasmy increases with age, though on average only ~ 1 heteroplasmy reaches the 4 % level between ages 20 and 90. In addition, we find that mtDNA copy number averages ~ 110 copies/lymphocyte and is ~ 54 % heritable, implying substantial genetic regulation of the level of mtDNA. Copy numbers also decrease modestly but significantly with age, and females on average have significantly more copies than males. The mtDNA copy numbers are significantly associated with waist circumference (p-value = 0. 0031) and waist-hip ratio (p-value = 2. 4 × 10 - 5), but not with body mass index, indicating an association with central fat distribution. To our knowledge, this is the largest population analysis to date of mtDNA dynamics, revealing the age-imposed increase in heteroplasmy, the relatively high heritability of copy number, and the association of copy number with metabolic traits...|$|R
5000|$|A {{mitochondrion}} with largely CCOI-mutated chromosomes {{would need}} to have a positive selection bias in order to frequently become the main type of mitochondrion in a cell (a cell with CCOI-deficient <b>homoplasmy).</b> There are about 100 to 700 mitochondria per cell, depending on cell type. [...] Furthermore, there is fairly rapid turnover of mitochondria, so that a mitochondrion with CCOI-mutated chromosomes and a positive selection bias could shortly become the major type of mitochondrion in a cell. The average half-life of mitochondria in rats, depending on cell type, is between 9 and 24 days, and in mice is about 2 days. In humans {{it is likely that the}} half life of mitochondria is also a matter of days to weeks.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not clear}} why a {{deficiency}} of CCOI should have a positive selective bias. One suggestion is that deﬁciency of CCOI in a mitochondrion leads to lower reactive oxygen production (and less oxidative damage) and this provides a selective advantage in competition with other mitochondria within the same cell to generate <b>homoplasmy</b> for CCOI-deficiency. Another suggestion was that cells with a deﬁciency in cytochrome c oxidase are apoptosis resistant, and thus more likely to survive. The linkage of CCOI to apoptosis arises because active cytochrome c oxidase oxidizes cytochrome c, which then activates pro-caspase 9, leading to apoptosis. [...] These two factors {{may contribute to the}} frequent occurrence of CCOI-deficient colonic crypts with age or during carcinogenesis in the human colon.|$|E
50|$|Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy is {{the disease}} in humans that is most {{frequently}} associated with <b>homoplasmy.</b> This condition {{is characterized by the}} atrophy of retinal ganglion cells, which leads to central blindness and eventually total blindness. Although it is passed down maternally, it is seen more often in young men than in other ages or sexes, which leads researchers to believe that there are many other genetic or environmental factors that contribute to developing the disease. Specifically, researchers have thought that the genetic component outside of the mitochondria would be on the X chromosome; however, in multiple studies, there have been no findings that suggest this. Environmental factors, cigarette smoke in particular, have been shown to affect LHON's penetrance. In one study, cigarette smoke condensate was used to demonstrate the effects of smoking on cells with the LHON mutation. All cells were homoplasmic, but some were from individuals who were afflicted with LHON and some were from individuals who were just carriers. The researchers found that cigarette smoke condensate lowered the amount of mitochondria in the cells, but that carrier individuals were better able to compensate than those from individuals with LHON. Though there is an additive environmental effect, there is more to learn about why certain homoplasmic individuals have the disease and others do not.|$|E

40|$|Each cell has {{hundreds}} {{to thousands}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies, but all copies of mtDNA in each yeast cell and individual mammals are maintained to have an identical sequence (<b>homoplasmy).</b> We isolated the first mtDNA-recombination-deficient nuclear mutant, mhr 1 - 1, from budding yeast. The mutant exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes including mtDNA repair deficiency. The most interesting phenotype is a delay {{in the establishment of}} <b>homoplasmy.</b> Considering examples of recombinationdependent DNA replication in prokaryotes from which mitochondria evolved, the characterization of mhr 1 - 1 will give us a clue to the mechanisms of the establishment of <b>homoplasmy,</b> a basic phenomenon of non-Mendelian heredity. F. Ling Mitochondria contain 50 ∼ 10 3 copies of their genomic DNA, which encodes the components essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiration functions.

40|$|Review of the articleMitochondria are the organelles {{responsible}} for producing {{the majority of}} a cell's ATP and also play {{an essential role in}} gamete maturation and embryo development. ATP production within the mitochondria is dependent on proteins encoded by both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes, therefore co-ordination between the two genomes is vital for cell survival. To assist with this co-ordination, cells normally contain only one type of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) termed <b>homoplasmy.</b> Occasionally, however, two or more types of mtDNA are present termed heteroplasmy. This can result from a combination of mutant and wild-type mtDNA molecules or from a combination of wild-type mtDNA variants. As heteroplasmy can result in mitochondrial disease, various mechanisms exist in the natural fertilization process to ensure the maternal-only transmission of mtDNA and the maintenance of <b>homoplasmy</b> in future generations. However, there is now an increasing use of invasive oocyte reconstruction protocols, which tend to bypass mechanisms for the maintenance of <b>homoplasmy,</b> potentially resulting in the transmission of either form of mtDNA heteroplasmy. Indeed, heteroplasmy caused by combinations of wild-type variants has been reported following cytoplasmic transfer (CT) in the human and following nuclear transfer (NT) in various animal species. Other techniques, such as germinal vesicle transfer and pronuclei transfer, have been proposed as methods of preventing transmission of mitochondrial diseases to future generations. However, resulting embryos and offspring may contain mtDNA heteroplasmy, which itself could result in mitochondrial disease. It is therefore essential that uniparental transmission of mtDNA is ensured before these techniques are used therapeutically...|$|E

This apparently rapid rate of mitochondrial DNA segregation in mammals contrasts to the much slower rates observed previously in insects and suggest fundamental differences between taxa regarding the mechanisms of mitochondrial gene transmission...|$|E
40|$|High-sensitivity and {{high-throughput}} mutation detection {{techniques are}} useful for screening the <b>homoplasmy</b> or heteroplasmy status of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but might be susceptible to interference from nuclear mitochondrial DNA sequences (NUMTs) co-amplified during polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, we first evaluated the platform of SURVEYOR Nuclease digestion of heteroduplexed DNA followed by the detection of cleaved DNA by using the WAVE HS System (SN/WAVE-HS) for detecting human mtDNA variants and found that its performance was slightly better than that of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). The potential interference from co-amplified NUMTs on screening mtDNA heteroplasmy when using these 2 highly sensitive techniques was further examined by using 2 published primer sets containing a total of 65 primer pairs, which were originally designed {{to be used with}} one of the 2 techniques. We confirmed that 24 primer pairs could amplify NUMTs by conducting bioinformatic analysis and PCR with the DNA from 143 B-r 0 cells. Using mtDNA extracted from the mitochondria of human 143 B cells and a cybrid line with the nuclear background of 143 B-r 0 cells, we demonstrated that NUMTs could affect the patterns of chromatograms for cell DNA during SN-WAVE/HS analysis of mtDNA, leading to incorrect judgment of mtDNA <b>homoplasmy</b> or heteroplasmy status. However, we observed such interference only in 2 of 24 primer pairs selected, and did not observe such effects during DHPLC analysis.

By utilizing transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids), we induced the shift to <b>homoplasmy</b> of a truncating mutation in the mitochondria-coded MTND 1 gene.

40|$|Mitochondrial biogenesis and {{function}} is under dual genetic control and requires extensive interaction between biparentally inherited nuclear genes and maternally inherited mitochondrial genes. Standard SCNT procedures deprive an oocytes' mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the corresponding maternal nuclear DNA and require it {{to interact with}} an entirely foreign nucleus that is again interacting with foreign somatic mitochondria. As a result, most SCNT embryos, -fetuses, and -offspring carry somatic cell mtDNA in addition to recipient oocyte mtDNA, a condition termed heteroplasmy. It is thus evident that somatic cell mtDNA can escape the selective mechanism that targets and eliminates intraspecific sperm mitochondria in the fertilized oocyte to maintain <b>homoplasmy.</b> However, the factors responsible for the large intra- and interindividual differences in heteroplasmy level remain elusive.

The introduction of foreign mtDNA into reconstructed recipient eggs has also been demonstrated in mice through pronuclear injection and in humans through cytoplasmic transfer.

40|$|As human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) undergo differentiation, they express genes characteristic of the lineage {{for which they are}} destined. However, fully differentiated individual cell types can be characterized by the number of mitochondria they possess and the copies of the mitochondrial genome per mitochondrion.

Consequently, failure for an ESC to possess the full complement of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) could limit its final commitment to a particular fate. We describe a series of protocols that analyze the process of cellular mitochondrial and mtDNA differentiation during hESC differentiation. In addition, mtDNA transcription and replication are key events in cellular differentiation that require interaction between the nucleus and the mitochondrion. To this extent, we describe a series of protocols that analyze the initiation of these key events as hESCs progress from their undifferentiated state to the fully committed cell.

These tRNA mutations are the primary factors underlying the development of hearing loss. However, other tRNA mutations such as tRNAThr 15927 G>A and tRNASer(UCN) 7444 G>A are insufficient to produce a deafness phenotype, but always act in synergy with the primary mitochondrial DNA mutations, and can modulate their phenotypic manifestation. These tRNA mutations may alter the structure and function of the corresponding mitochondrial tRNAs and cause failures in tRNAs metabolism. Thereby, the impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis and subsequent defects in respiration caused by these tRNA mutations, results in mitochondrial dysfunctions and eventually leads to the development of hearing loss.

Significant qualitative differences observed between the spectra of clonally expanded mutations in proliferating epithelial cells and postmitotic cardiomyocytes suggest, however, that either the processes generating these mutations or mechanisms driving them to <b>homoplasmy</b> are likely to be fundamentally different between the two tissues. Furthermore, the ability of somatic mtDNA mutations to expand (required for their phenotypic expression), as well as their apparently high incidence, reinforces the possibility that these mutations may be involved actively in various physiological processes such as aging and degenerative disease.

The presence of a recently reported disease-associated mutation at nucleotide 11778 of the mtDNA was established in one clinically affected family member by the sequencing of an appropriate 1. 6 kb PCR-amplified fragment of the mtDNA; this mutation leads to an Arg 240 → His amino acid replacement in the ND 4 subunit of respiratory complex.

Explanation of the representative members for this site revealed that while only mtDNA carrying this substitution could be detected in the leukocytes of 4 family members of the sixth generation, the mutated mtDNA was found to co-exist with the normal mtDNA population (heteroplasmy) in a clinically unaffected member from the fifth generation. This observation suggests that the nt 11778 mutation observed in this LHON family is relatively new; the observation of both heteroplasmy and apparent <b>homoplasmy</b> of the mtDNA in different family members might reflect the normal progression in the establishment of a mitochondrially inherited mutation...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{essentially}} maternal inheritance and a bottleneck effect during early oogenesis, newly arising mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations segregate rapidly in metazoan female germlines. Consequently, heteroplasmy (i. e. {{the mixture of}} mtDNA genotypes within an organism) is generally resolved to <b>homoplasmy</b> within a few generations. Here, we report an exceptional transpecific heteroplasmy (predicting an alanine/valine alloacceptor tRNA change) that has been stably inherited in oniscid crustaceans for at least thirty million years. Our results suggest that this heteroplasmy is stably transmitted across generations because it occurs within mitochondria and therefore escapes the mtDNA bottleneck that usually erases heteroplasmy. Consistently, at least two oniscid species possess an atypical trimeric mitochondrial genome, which provides an adequate substrate {{for the emergence of}} a constitutive intra-mitochondrial heteroplasmy. Persistence of a mitochondrial polymorphism on such a deep evolutionary timescale suggests that balancing selection may be shaping mitochondrial sequence evolution in oniscid crustaceans.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and maintenance of}} mitochondrial heteroplasmy has important consequences for both health and heredity. Previous studies using pathogenic mutations have shown considerable variability between maternally related individuals and studies of several D-loop polymorphisms have suggested a relationship between heteroplasmy and somatic aging. To broadly explore the variation of human heteroplasmy and to clarify the dynamics of somatic heteroplasmy {{over the course of}} lifespan, we analyzed mitochondrial sequence variation across a range of ages. We utilized array-generated single-nucleotide polymorphism data that were well correlated with independent measures of heteroplasmy. Significant levels of heteroplasmy were identified at 0. 24 % of sites evaluated. By examining mother–child pairs, we found that heteroplasmy was inherited (30 %) but could occur de novo in offspring or, conversely, be present in mothers but eliminated in their children (70 %). Cumulatively, mitochondrial heteroplasmy across the genome increased significantly with advanced age (r = 0. 224, P = 8 × 10 − 30). Surprisingly, changes in heteroplasmy were not uniform with some sites demonstrating a loss of variation (increased <b>homoplasmy)</b> with aging. These data suggest that both mutation and selective pressure affect blood mitochondrial DNA sequence {{over the course of the}} human lifespan and reveal the unexpectedly dynamic nature of human heteroplasmy...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial genome {{mutations}} {{are described}} in many kinds of human malignancies, including lung cancer. These mutations can be base substitutions, insertion or deletions, and the 1. 1 kb d-loop region has been recently identified as a mutational "hot spot" in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of neoplastic tissue. Cancer cells harbour homoplasmic rather than heteroplasmic mutations; therefore, somatic mutant mtDNA appears as a single copy among a majority of wild-type mtDNA molecules and becomes dominant in the cancer cell {{probably due to the}} growth/survival advantages that such mutation confers to the cell. The authors will present a case of forensic identification in which a widow claimed for medical malpractice the physicians that had taken care of her husband, who was affected by a malignant lung disease, as she thought that he had been wrongly diagnosed with cancer and therefore he had undergone massive and inappropriate therapies that finally led him to death. Therefore the Prosecutor ordered the seizure of the neoplastic histological samples attributed to the deceased and the comparison of the genetic profile obtained from these samples with those of the relatives, in order to establish {{the presence or absence of}} genetic compatibility among the neoplastic tissue and the relatives of the deceased. To this end, autosomal markers were analyzed and compared with those of the two daughters of the deceased, while Y-chromosome markers and mtDNA were analyzed and compared with those of his brother. While both autosomal and Y-chromosome markers confirmed the correspondence of the histological samples to the deceased, in the case of mtDNA a difference at nucleotide 16093 of HVRI region has been highlighted: in fact the brother had a C while the lung tissue examined showed a transition from C to T. In order to ascertain the full genetic compatibility it was therefore necessary to study the nature of this nucleotide difference by cloning of PCR products. Sequencing of PCR cloning products thus allowed to highlight an heteroplasmic site (tending to <b>homoplasmy)</b> at nt. 16093 in tumor cells with respectively 75 % of mutated mtDNA and only 25 % of germ-line mtDNA compatible with the brother reference sequence. After attending this presentation, attendees will understand how to manage a forensic identification case in a cancer patient, when only neoplastic tissue is available for the genetic analyses. This presentation will impact the forensic community by demonstrating that, because frequency of mutations in mtDNA is higher than in nuclear DNA in a variety of human cancers (as suggested from several studies), the mtDNA profiling should not be applied as the unique analysis in cases of forensic identification of cancer patients when only neoplastic tissue is available. Moreover, direct automated sequencing lacks adequate resolution to detect mtDNA heteroplasmy when, as in cancer cells, the somatic mutation tend to <b>homoplasmy...</b>|$|E
