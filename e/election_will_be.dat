25|$|The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress vote in December 2007 {{to allow}} {{universal}} suffrage by 2017, and full Legislative Council elections by 2020, tempered {{the debate on}} universal suffrage.

The election was therefore fought over issues regarding the minimum wage, health care reform, Old Age Allowance, and the future of RTHK. Also, the case surrounding former Housing Director Leung Chin-man served to highlight the issue of systematic checks and balances, and the lack of political scrutiny of government actions.|$|E
