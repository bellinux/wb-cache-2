50|$|This {{overhang}} of unsold homes lowered house prices. As prices declined, more homeowners {{were at risk}} of <b>default</b> <b>or</b> <b>foreclosure.</b> House {{prices are}} expected to continue declining until this inventory of unsold homes (an instance of excess supply) declines to normal levels. A report in January 2011 stated that U.S. home values dropped by 26 percent from their peak in June 2006 to November 2010, more than the 25.9% drop between 1928 to 1933 when the Great Depression occurred.|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Substantial growth in the mortgage market {{in recent years has}} helped many Americans become homeowners. However, as of the latest quarterly data available, June 2007, more than 1 million mortgages were in <b>default</b> <b>or</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> an increase of 50 percent compared with June 2005. Defaults and foreclosures on home mortgages can impose significant costs on borrowers, lenders, mortgage investors, and neighborhoods. Additionally, recent increases in defaults and foreclosures have contributed to concern and increased volatility in certain U. S. and global financial markets. These developments have raised questions about the extent and causes of problems in the mortgage market. To provide some insights on these issues, Congress asked GAO to analyze (1) the scope and magnitude of recent default and foreclosure trends, and how these trends compare with historical values, and (2) developments in economic conditions and the primary and secondary mortgage markets associated with these trends. ...|$|E

40|$|The global {{economic}} crisis started in United States of America mainly due to ‘sub-prime mortgages’ where interest rate was slower down {{and there was}} a great demand for housing loans. Later, American banks repackaged this debt to worldwide financial instruments called ‘Collateralized debt obligations’ and sold them worldwide, which resulted in unaffordable mortgage payments and many people <b>defaulted</b> <b>or</b> undertook <b>foreclosure.</b> Then this mortgages crisis affected worldwide. Different views on the reasons of the crisis include sub-prime mortgage, securitization and repackaging of loans, excessive leverage, mismatch between financial innovation and regulation, fair value accounting rules, typical characteristics of US financial system, failure of global corporate governance & complex interplay of multiple factors. Developed countries have so far been the most affected, with a decline in FDI inflows in 2008, mainly due to sluggish market prospects. Flows into developing economies continued to grow in 2008, but at a much lower rate than the year before. Indian economy and agriculture cannot be completely insulated from the global and domestic economic recessions. The impact of economic crisis on Indian agriculture and fisheries were transmitted through three distinct channels, viz., financial sector, exports and exchange rates, and the impact manifests itself in several direct and indirect ways. Some of the impacts were decreased GDP growth rate, high inflation, FDI inflows and international trade...|$|R

5000|$|This {{resulted}} {{in millions of}} people to be unqualified to refinance out of their risky subprime, adjustable rate and negative amortization loans. Many people suffered dramatic payment increases. At the same time, housing prices plummeted due to the [...] "housing correction" [...] That was fueled by record foreclosures. Based on RealtyTrac data, since December 2007 and through June 2010 {{there have been a}} total of 2.36 million U.S. properties repossessed by lenders through foreclosure (REO). In addition there have been 3.48 million default notices and 3.46 million scheduled foreclosure auctions. This major increase of properties on the market decreased home values creating a market with fewer qualified borrowers than homes for sale. When there is less demand the prices drop. Home values were at highly inflated levels prior to this due to historically low interest rates and the steady decline of credit requirements for the homeowner to qualify for a mortgage. Many homeowners found themselves with negative equity meaning the mortgage balance was considerably higher than the market value of the home also known as being [...] "underwater". Many homeowners elected to default voluntarily on their mortgage. Being [...] "underwater" [...] means their home is no longer an asset to them. With all this stacked against them and very few options, the result for many was <b>default</b> and <b>foreclosure</b> <b>or</b> loss mitigation.|$|R
