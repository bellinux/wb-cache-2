5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} caught by a <b>fishing</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charlton married Pat Kemp on 6 January 1958, and {{his brother}} Bobby acted as his best man. They have three children: John (born in January 1959), Deborah (born 1961) and Peter, who was born just after Charlton senior played in the 1966 World Cup final. During the 1960s he ran two clothes shops in Leeds, and he also later {{operated}} the souvenir shop at Elland Road. Charlton is a keen amateur fisherman and also takes part in field sports. He appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1972 and 1996, and chose to take with him The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, the Encyclopaedia of How to Survive, a spyglass, and a <b>fishing</b> <b>rod.</b> Charlton {{was the subject of}} This Is Your Life in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.|$|E

40|$|There {{are very}} few {{scientific}} studies about <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> {{in the field of}} the so-called sports-leisure. This study deals with large deformation of <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> that would be useful {{in the development of the}} characteristic design of <b>fishing</b> <b>rods.</b> In this report, based on the nonlinear large deformation theory, new fundamental equations are introduced for thin, straight tapered <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> with a circular cross-section under concentrated loads at the free end. As a result, it is found that the large deformations of <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> can be described by non-dimensional load parameters, ratios of rod diameters and supporting angles. Furthermore, the experimental verification of this analysis is carried out using a flexible rod model. The theoretically predicted results are in fairly good agreement with the experimental data. Consequently, the new deformation theory is proved to be of practical use...|$|R
25|$|Traditionally rods {{are made}} from bamboo, while {{contemporary}} rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre. In contrast with nets, which are usually used in subsistence and commercial <b>fishing,</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are more often used in recreational fishing and competitive casting. <b>Fishing</b> <b>rods</b> come in many sizes, actions, lengths and configurations depending on whether {{they are to be}} used for small, medium or large fish or in different fresh or salt water situations. Various types of <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are designed for specific types of <b>fishing.</b> Fly <b>rods</b> are used to cast artificial flies, spinning rods and bait casting rods are designed to cast baits or lures. Ice <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling rods are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|R

25|$|Telescopic rods {{are popular}} among surf fishermen. Carrying around a 12 or 14ft surf <b>fishing</b> <b>rod,</b> even in two pieces, is cumbersome. The shorter the {{sections}} the shorter they close, the more eyes they have, {{and the better}} the power curve is in them. More eyes means better weight and stress distribution throughout the parabolic arc. This translates to further casting, stronger fish fighting abilities, and less breaking of the rod.|$|E

He intended for the three dancers to be a metaphor for fishing lures, and for the single dancer to be {{a metaphor for the}} reel. The single dancer's actions were intended to imitate the action of casting a <b>fishing</b> <b>rod.</b> The reel used in the video is a Shimano Calcutta Conquest reel.|$|E
25|$|At Paramount, Arzner {{directed}} Clara Bow's first talkie, The Wild Party (1929). To allow Bow to {{move freely}} on the set, Arzner had technicians rig a microphone onto a <b>fishing</b> <b>rod,</b> essentially creating the first boom mike. She did not, however, take out a patent. One year later one was filed for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the Fox Film Corporation.

25|$|Sørvágur {{has always}} been a place where fishery has been very dominant. In older times it was said, that the only thing {{necessary}} for survival in Sørvágur was that you had a <b>fishing</b> <b>rod</b> and a pot to cook the fish. The fishing industry also plays a vital role in the industrial environment in Sørvágur today (2005). Today there is a modern fish factory producing mainly salt fish; a fish farm raising salmon; one fish market; one major fish factory ship, which produces fish directly to the British market; 6 smaller fishing trawlers and 50+ small fishing boats.|$|E
25|$|Care for {{telescopic}} {{fishing rods}} {{is much the}} same as other rods. The only difference being that one should not open the telescopic rod in manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly. Whipping or flinging a telescopic <b>fishing</b> <b>rod</b> open may and likely will cause it to be difficult to close. When closing the rods make a slight twisting motion while pushing the sections together. Often the rods come with tip covers to protect the tip and guides. Additionally, extra care must be taken not to get dirt or sand in the joints; due to their design this can easily damage this style of rod.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} under the player's control {{throughout}} the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting which percentage of a given resource is transported to a given building. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a fishery, and the building is still empty {{despite the presence of}} idle settlers, a <b>fishing</b> <b>rod</b> will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith. The game also uses a notification system that alerts the player if a building cannot be occupied either {{due to a lack of}} the right tool or the absence of available settlers.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the mid-1800s}} rods were {{generally}} made in England. This changed in 1846 when American Samuel Phillippe introduced an imported <b>fishing</b> <b>rod</b> {{the first six}} strips of Calcutta cane made in Bavaria where Phillippe was importing Violins that he passed off as his own hand work. Split-cane rods were later independently produced after Phillippe started to sell the imported rods to a New York retailer and then copied by Americans Charles Orvis, Hiram Leonard and Englishman William Hardy in the 1870s and mass production methods made these rods accessible to the public. Horton Manufacturing Company first introduced an all steel rod in 1913. These rods were heavy and flexible and did not satisfy many customers. The next big occurrence in fishing rods was {{the introduction of the}} fiberglass rod in the 1940s and was developed by Robert Gayle and a Mr. Mcguire.|$|E

Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and <b>fishing</b> <b>rod</b> for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition. Walt Disney said about Donald Duck: [...] "He's got a big mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal subject." [...] Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical features.|$|E

500|$|Many of Brusch's couplets, part of {{contemporary}} common usage, {{give the impression}} of weighty wisdom, but in his hands become only apparent truths, hypocrisy or platitudes.

Busch uses names he gives characters to describe their personality. [...] "Studiosus Döppe" [...] (Young Bumbel) has little mental ability; [...] "Sauerbrots" [...] (Sourdough) would not be of a cheerful disposition; and [...] "Förster Knarrtje" [...] (Forester Knarrtje) could hardly be a socialite.|$|E
500|$|A radiolanthanum sample, precipitated in a {{tip of a}} small cone, {{followed}} by a plug, was lowered {{into the center of}} the metal sphere of the experimental assembly with a device resembling a <b>fishing</b> <b>rod.</b> The cone and the plug were mated to the metal center of the assembly, together forming a metal sphere. A section of the explosive lensing was then returned to its place above the sphere. Several, typically four, ionization chambers were located around the experimental setup. Immediately after the detonation they generated signals that were displayed on oscilloscopes in a blast-proof shelter or a mobile laboratory in a tank, [...] away, and the oscilloscope traces recorded on cameras. A calibration measurement was performed before and after each test. The ionization chambers and their preamplifiers were destroyed during the explosion, but their simple design allowed their production in sufficient quantities.|$|E
