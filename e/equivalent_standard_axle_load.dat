40|$|Reliability {{of a road}} is {{mandatory}} since damaged will impede the traffic. Destruction is caused by various factors; {{one of the most}} important factors is excess load. Overload may give the load of each axle of a vehicle exceeds the determined standard. This condition occurs in trucks exceeding the load limit. In designing the structure of a road based on the method of Directorate General of Highways Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Indonesia, axle load calculated in equivalent-number, or known as equivalent axle load (EAL), of 8. 16 tons of standard axle. Total equivalent-number over the service life is defined as cumulative <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> (CESA). Due to traffic volume exceeding the volume forecast or, in other words there is an excessive load of traffic, it will make CESA achieved faster than planned. This excessive load in Indonesia, however, has been considered as a factor of environmental condition, so there is a need to introduce a correction factor for EAL as high as 20 - 25 % in the process of designing flexible and rigid pavement so as to reduce early damage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA low volume road (LVR) {{structural}} design has two phases: {{first one is}} selection of appropriate construction materials and second is the determination of layer thicknesses under the certain traffic and environmental conditions with considering the subgrade bearing capacity. Pavements are prompted to serve the traffic without reaching the terminal serviceability index over its design life. Rut accumulation (plastic deformation) {{is the most common}} pavement deterioration type of flexible pavements. Therefore the main goal of the design is prevent rutting. Many low volume road design manual assume that plastic deformation occurs only in subgrade. Construction of overlying layers by selective high performance materials according to the related material and construction specifications is the reason of this assumption. In fact, the assumption is not much reasonable especially for with no, or thinly overlaid low volume road pavements, where the major structural strength is comprised of unbound granular pavement materials and where the principal distress mechanism is rutting in the aggregate layers. Subgrade bearing capacity and the traffic are the main input parameters in the design stage of low volume roads. Subgrade bearing capacity is expressed with California Bearing Ratio (CBR) or Resilient Modulus (Mr). The “traffic” term is determined by <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Axle</b> <b>Load</b> (ESAL) repetitions which is often admitted as 80 kN single axle load. Although it is not too difficult to determine an axle load for an individual vehicle, it becomes quite complicated to determine the number and types of axle loads that a particular pavement will be subjected over its design life. For calculation of Load Damage Factors of different vehicle types, which have various axle load and configurations, a generalized fourth-power law has been used for more than a half century. The objective {{of this study is to}} indicate the limitations and difficulties faced on reliably applying a power law relationship in design of LVRs with no, or only thin seals. If a power law relationship to be used due to its simplicity, several parameters must be considered in selection of the power value. Such as stress dependent behavior of unbound granular materials and the selected distress type...|$|E

The approach estimates the quantity of timber that may be hauled through without critically damag-ing the flexible pavements. Seventy-two roads were classified on the basis of their surface conditions, subgradej material, and surface deflection as the strength parameter, for 40 and 60 t Gross Vehicle Weight. Using non-parametric statistical techniques, it was found that the surface quality of pavements was largely dependent on drainage conditions (co-efficient of determination rM 0. 841, and that a strong relationship (r = 0. 90) also existed between drain-age and the number of potholes. Pavements with peat subgrades were found to exhibit significantly higher critical deflections (5. 6 mm) than pavements with mineral subgrades (1 mm), coupled with their inherent variability, it is arguable that visual classi-fication may not be suitable for such pavements.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of overloaded truck traffic on the pavement damage and its rehabilitation cost of Benghazi Street in Misurata city, Libya. Evaluation of allocated rehabilitation cost also becomes concern of this study to determine the sufficiency of the cost. The objectives of this study are to know the influence of overloaded truck traffic towards the pavement damage; to know the overloaded truck traffic towards rehabilitation cost; and to evaluate sufficiency of the allocated rehabilitation cost based on the actual condition of the pavement rehabilitation needs. Pavement Condition Index (PCI), <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Axle</b> <b>Loads</b> (ESAL) factors calculation were carried out in this study. PCI determined to rate the pavement damage condition based on damage that found at Benghazi Street. ESAL of the traffic determined by AASHTO 1993 standard to get the damage factor due to <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> Further the evaluation of allocated rehabilitation cost was conducted based on the ESAL of the traffic by comparing the standard normal ESAL with the ESAL of overloaded truck traffic. The PCI result determined the highest rate of the pavement condition was 71. 0 and the lowest one was 6. 0. It was retrieved from 21 segments along 2100 meters of Benghazi Street, 17 segments attained under 50 and it was only 3 segments attained above 50 value of PCI. The PCI of total area resumed the value of 31. 5 which means a very poor pavement condition rate. In other result, ESAL of truck traffic attained up to 953, 230 where the ESAL of normal load determined only 327, 964. Ratio of both was 2. 90 which mean overload ESAL 290 % higher than normal one. The maintenance cost of normal ESAL determined 2. 39 dinar Libya/ ESAL and it reached up to 2, 276, 030. 28 dinar. The maintenance cost needs to be adjusted 65 % more than allocated maintenance cost. It can be concluded that the maintenance cost for the next periods should be planned well based on the actual ESAL investigation {{so that it can be}} managed to suitable cost and sufficient service for safety and comfort of the user...|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{result of}} the AASHO-Road-Test is {{the rule of the}} fourth power. This research project attempts to determine a theoretical way that road damage progression is caused by a given traffic load impact by heavy vehicles. This requires data on the cumulative traffic load impact and the time variant strengh of bituminous and cement concrete, as well as the calculation of the roadway covering use which is relevant for the long term serviceability and the calculation of the damage progression. Axle load measurements were made at 124 locations by the Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen and were classified into seven load classes. First, these measurements have been analyzed based on records of axle and tyre configurations and are then valued by the rule of the 1. to the 6. power. Beside the method that is based on the Gaussian normal distribution for the determination of the cumulative axle load distribution, two further proceedings were used. Furthermore, for a selected number of locations and pavement constructions the time dependent damage progressions caused by the actual existing heavy load traffic is calculated by two different methods. To do this one must determine the transverse stress {{at the bottom of the}} bituminous layers or cement pavements that is critical for the long term performance. This transverse stress is taken as a basis for further probabilistic studies. To take into account the mean variation of the transverse stress caused by the variation of slab thickness and of subbase stiffness, and by the dynamic axle-loading and the effects of axle and tyre configuration, a variation coefficient of 20 % for asphalt bitumen layers and a variation coefficient of 30 % to 35 % for concrete pavements, which were the result of former research projects, are used. For determining the resistance the known time variant strength of bituminous and cement concrete and a variation coefficient of 10 % form the basis of the calculation of the damage progressions. For the first method, the design axle load of 10 tons and the affiliated load cycles calculated with the 1. to the 6. power are used for the calculation of the time variant probability of failure. Within the second method, the real number of axles and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> determinated with the 1. to the 6. power are appropriated for the calculation. By equating the results, a statement concerning the power, which is relevant for the damage progression, can be made. The data collected at a wealth of selected and heavy used road segments shows that the axle loads have to be valuated by the 3. to the 4. power in case of bituminous layers and by the 3. to the 5. power in case of cement pavements. This confirms the results of the AASHO-Road-Test. (orig.)

Although there are legal <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> limit and gross vehicle weight limit of the vehicles plying on roads, they are violated wickedly by the transporters.

It is a responsibility of the road design Engineer to ensure that he has come up with an effective design, so that it will last for the design life. This effectiveness or the optimization is very important as otherwise it could lead to financial implications. The method adopted for the design of flexible pavements is the TRL, Road Note 31.

40|$|The {{thickness}} of the base {{plays a crucial role}} in the stability of pavements and the lack of availability of good quality aggregates is a major concern in India and other countries. Loading on top of the base plays {{a crucial role in the}} design of pavements. Usually, the design of the pavement is done for <b>standard</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load,</b> however, in the field, in some of the cases, the vehicles are overloaded which results in a higher wheel load on the pavements. The current paper examines the performance of geogrid reinforced un-paved sections at higher stresses with the primary objective of reducing the {{thickness of}} base layer required in the field. Experimental studies were carried out using repeated plate load tests to obtain the optimum depth of placing the geogrid in granular base layer to achieve maximum reduction in rutting of pavement. Resilient deformation behavior of both reinforced and unreinforced sections are obtained and these values are utilized to predict the resilient modulus of the base sections. The paper also discusses the reduction in permanent deformation by the introduction of geogrid. Rut depth reduction studies were carried out in order to compare the performance of reinforced and unreinforced sections. The role played by the reinforcement in reducing the strains on top of the subgrade is studied in detail. A comparison is also carried out to understand the pressure distribution along the base layer and role played by the geogrids in reducing the pressure on the subgrade. Further, values of stress distribution angles were obtained for reinforced and unreinforced sections. It is evident from the studies that geogrids contributed to improved performance as well as reduction in {{thickness of the}} aggregate layer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Recent developments in mechanistic approaches have proven more reliable in the design and analysis of pavement, making it possible to more effectively document the characteristics of HCTCRB. The aim {{of this study was to}} carry out laboratory testing to assess the mechanical characteristics of HCTCRB. Conventional triaxial tests and repeated load triaxial tests (RLT tests) were performed. Factors affecting the performance of HCTCRB, namely hydration periods and the amount of added water were also investigated. It was found that the shear strength parameters of HCTCRB were 177 kPa for cohesion (c) and 42 ° for the internal friction angle (f). The hydration period, and the water added in this investigation affected the performance of HCTCRB. However, the related trends associated with such factors could not be assessed. All HCTCRB samples showed stress-dependency behaviour. Based on the stress stages of this experiment, the resilient modulus values of HCTCRB ranged from 300 MPa to 1100 MPa. CIRCLY, a computer program based on the multi-layer elastic theory was used in the mechanistic approach to pavement design and analysis, to determine the performance of a typical pavement model using HCTCRB as a base course layer. The mechanistic pavement design parameters for HCTCRB as a base course material were then introduced. The analysis suggests that the suitable depth for HCTCRB as a base layer for WA roads is at least 185 mm for the design <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> <b>axle</b> (ESA) of 10 million...|$|R
40|$|Foam bitumen {{stabilization}} is {{a viable}} alternative for reducing aggregate consumption in New Zealand. An accelerated full-scale experiment on foam bitumen pavements was conducted in the Canterbury Accelerated Pavement Testing Indoor Facility {{as part of a}} Transit New Zealand research project to study the effects of foam bitumen on unbound granular materials. Six pavement sections were tested. Three were constructed with foam bitumen contents of 1. 2 %, 1. 4 %, and 2. 8 % and with a common active filler content of 1. 0 % cement. Two more pavements were constructed with adding cement only (1. 0 %) and foam bitumen only (2. 2 %). In addition, one control section with the untreated unbound material was tested. Strains were collected with a three-dimension Emu soil strain system installed in each pavement section. Results showed that surface deflections decreased at sections with higher bitumen contents. After the application of 5, 710, 000 <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> <b>axles,</b> the control section and all sections that had been stabilized with cement only and bitumen only showed large amounts of rutting. Conversely, little rutting was observed in the three sections stabilized with 2. 2 % foam bitumen and 1. 0 % cement. Water was introduced into these three pavements with additional accelerated loading; this caused the section with the lowest foam bitumen content to fail. These results showed that foam bitumen and cement had a significant effect on improving the performance of the materials studied. Material samples taken for indirect tensile strength (ITS) and repeat load triaxial (RLT) for laboratory tests showed that the ITS test was a good predictor of the pavement performance and produced a clear trend, although RLT results were not conclusive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Australia has {{approximately}} 300, 000 km of sealed {{roads and}} maintenance of these roads imposes a significant financial burden on road agencies. Premature pavement failure exacerbates this burden. Longitudinal pavement cracking often occurs independent of traffic loading and may be attributed in many instances to moisture changes in expansive subgrade soils. This project investigates a possible relationship between the Atterberg limits of low strength subgrade materials (CBR < 3) and the incidence of longitudinal cracking in unbound granular (flexible) pavements supported by them. Unbound granular pavements {{are the most common}} form of pavement construction in Australia. Design of these pavements is undertaken in accordance with individual authorities’ empirical design charts. These design charts are usually presented as a series of curves whereby the depth of pavement is set by the relationship between subgrade strength, expressed in terms of a four day soaked California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and traffic loading over the pavement’s design life, expressed in <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Axles</b> (ESAs). These charts typically provide pavement depths for subgrade CBR values of 3 and above. Where the subgrade CBR is less than 3, the guidelines recommend an additional depth of pavement gravel depending on the CBR. The primary objective of this research is to determine if any of the Atterberg limits can be used as a predictor of longitudinal cracking in unbound granular pavements designed in accordance with authority guidelines. This would enable consultants and authorities to determine if alternate methods of pavement construction should be considered (using tensile reinforcement for example) in lieu of unbound granular construction. Analysis of results indicated that a relationship exists between two of the Atterberg limits of a subgrade material and longitudinal cracking in unbound granular pavements designed in accordance with existing authority empirical design charts. Due to the small sample size, recommendation on specific values of these limits to determine when alternate pavement designs should be considered would be premature...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{increasing}} cost of designing and building new highway pavements, reliability analysis has become vital {{to ensure that}} a given pavement performs as expected in the field. Recognizing the importance of failure analysis to safety, reliability, performance, and economy, back analysis has been employed in various engineering applications to evaluate the inherent uncertainties of the design and analysis. The probabilistic back analysis method formulated on Bayes' theorem and solved using the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm has proved to be highly efficient to address this issue. It is also quite flexible and is applicable to any type of prior information. In this paper, this method has been used to back-analyze the parameters that influence the pavement life and to consider the uncertainty of the mechanistic-empirical pavement design model. The load-induced pavement structural responses (e. g., stresses, strains, and deflections) used to predict the pavement life are estimated using the response surface methodology model developed {{based on the results of}} linear elastic analysis. The failure criteria adopted for the analysis were based on the factor of safety (FOS), and the study was carried out for different sample sizes and jumping distributions to estimate the most robust posterior statistics. From the posterior statistics of the case considered, it was observed that after approximately 150 million <b>standard</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> repetitions, the mean values of the pavement properties decrease as expected, with a significant decrease in the values of the elastic moduli of the expected layers. An analysis of the posterior statistics indicated that the parameters that contribute significantly to the pavement failure were the moduli of the base and surface layer, which is consistent with the findings from other studies. After the back analysis, the base modulus parameters show a significant decrease of 15. 8 % and the surface layer modulus a decrease of 3. 12 % in the mean value. The usefulness of the back analysis methodology is further highlighted by estimating the design parameters for specified values of the factor of safety. The analysis revealed that for the pavement section considered, a reliability of 89 % and 94 % can be achieved by adopting FOS values of 1. 5 and 2, respectively. The methodology proposed can therefore be effectively used to identify the parameters that are critical to pavement failure in the design of pavements for specified levels of reliability.

40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} the observed performance of pavement materials subjected to multiple-axle loading {{can be used to}} improve the way flexible pavement design procedures consider the damage caused by different <b>axle</b> group and <b>load</b> combinations. Australian flexible pavement design procedures are used as the basis for considering this improvement. Fundamental to the Australian design procedures are established equal damage loads for each type of multiple-axle group. This study determined that the derivation of these equal damage loads was more heavily influenced by numerical calculations based upon assumed behaviour than on experimental data. It was also found that international design methods are similarly based upon assumed response-to-load behaviour of modelled pavement structures. In contrast, this thesis utilises performance data {{in order to determine the}} relative damage caused by different <b>axle</b> group-types and <b>loads.</b> In new work, the effects of multiple-axle loads on three pavement material types were examined. Accelerated pavement testing was used to assess the deformation of unbound granular pavements with a thin bituminous surfacing. It was determined that a 180 kN triaxle group caused 0. 8 to 1. 0 times the damage caused by a 80 kN single axle. Assuming a load-damage exponent of 4, the results confirmed that interaction between the axles of a multiple-axle group did not affect the deformation damage caused to the pavements. New consideration of an existing laboratory-based asphalt fatigue damage model - developed by others - demonstrated that there was no damaging or ameliorating effect of grouping strain pulses used to simulate multiple-axle groups. A similar laboratory-based study was undertaken to examine the effects of grouping load pulses on the flexural fatigue performance of a cemented material. Analysis of the resultant data demonstrated that damage was not affected by grouping pulses of equal load. Parametric three-dimensional finite element method and layer linear-elastic analyses indicted that the pavement structure plays a significant role in determining loads for multiple-axle groups that cause the same asphalt and cemented material fatigue damage as a <b>Standard</b> <b>Axle</b> <b>load.</b> Consequently, the summed-peaks pavement design model for determining the damage to a bound material resulting from an axle group with specific load was proposed. An improved design procedure based upon this model was proposed. The procedure specifically calculates the pavement damage resulting from each axle grouping type and each load within a traffic load distribution. An examination of the implications of design outcomes in using this improved procedure determined that reductions in both asphalt and cemented material thicknesses of up to 50 mm would result. These differences are significant, and represent improved material and construction cost savings - potentially of the order of A$ 50 million a year. A determination of the overall reliability of pavements that are constructed in accordance with the improved procedure is needed to fully implement the improved procedure. Future work should also consider the use of the summed-peaks model with the subgrade compressive strains used in current mechanistic design...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} factors on life cost analysis and serviceability of roads and bridges are the vehicle loads and traffic volume. The traffic effect {{is related to the}} vehicle types and the load carrying capacity. In general, many countries and cities have a <b>standard</b> legal <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> limit. In Colombia, the Minister of Transport is responsible for establishing the maximum load in highways. The country´s economic growth has improved during the last years. Therefore, most on-road vehicles have a total weight that exceeds the legal load limit. This additional load damages the pavement structure and reduces exponentially its life span. In order to establish maintenance strategies for the city´s road network, the local government is interested in determining the actual vehicle loading. Bogota´s road network represents 35 % of the total roads built in Colombia. Taking into consideration the length of paved roads in the city (around 16. 000 km), the first step towards a life cost analysis is to select an important and representative section of the city´s road network. This study aims to evaluate the reduction in flexible pavement life of an urban highway (Boyacá Avenue) in Bogotá, due to an increase of loads. Boyacá Avenue is a high-capacity urban road that crosses from north to south {{the west side of the}} city. This road is 35 km in length and was built entirely in flexible pavement. Damages on the pavement structure will determine the maintenance criteria and rehabilitation program to be implemented by the local government.

40|$|Thermal {{cracking}} {{of concrete}} {{is a common}} cause of deterioration and it is due to temperature difference constraining concrete contraction. With the addition of repetitive loading, micro-cracks are expected to propagate through the slab due to both external loadings and erosion in the cracks. This research aims to develop a three-dimensional finite element model of a jointed plain concrete pavement system and evaluate stress characteristics under high severity climate change temperature scenarios for 2007, 2030, 2050 and 2070 in South East Queensland. A series of static analyses are performed to replicate a <b>standard</b> vehicle <b>axle</b> wheel <b>loads</b> approaching and leaving the concrete joint. The tensile stress is measured {{on the top of}} the concrete slab at critical locations in both the longitudinal and transverse direction. Results for thermal-expansive stresses show that the likelihood of cracking in concrete increases significantly with changes in temperature gradients due to hotter climate causing downward curling of slab. Further, for temperature loading alone the tensile stress increases by a maximum of 1. 37 MPa from 2007 to 2070. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
