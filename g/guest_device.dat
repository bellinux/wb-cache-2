30|$|CR-based HAN {{devices are}} the devices that carry out various HAN {{applications}} including smart grid, security and safety, and home automation. These devices will connect {{to one of}} the clusters to get access and communicate with or through the HAN network. Besides performing the communication for its application, CR-based HAN devices also need to execute the spectrum sensing task. We consider two types of CR-based HAN devices: home and guest devices. Home devices are devices which belong to the HAN-owner, while guest devices do not belong to the HAN-owner. An example of a <b>guest</b> <b>device</b> is a neighbor’s device which needs to off-load its traffic, e.g., due to congestion in its own HAN network. Another example is a device that passes through the house and wants to connect to the internet through the HAN network. For the home CR-based HAN devices, the communication topology within the cluster is in a mesh. However, the guest devices are only allowed to connect to the CH.|$|E
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{shape of}} a dental implant {{plays an important role}} on the osteo-integration process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the biomechanical behavior of different commercial dental implants and to analyse how thread profile may affect the stress concentration and distribution. Three different commercially-available dental implants were considered and acquired by means of a no-contact reverse engineering system. Stresses at bone–implant interface, in presence of perfect and not-perfect osteo-integration, were numerically evaluated by means of finite element (FEM) analyses applying occlusal and lateral loads. The results show more dangerous stresses at implant–bone interface in the case of not-perfect osteo-integration and stresses gradient enough uniform around the threads in the case of osteo-integration. In particular, the implant with the lowest thread-pitch exhibits the lowest bone damage. This confirms the crucial role of the geometric shape of the implant to reduce bone induced stresses and bone damage. The structural and functional connection between living bone and implant is a key issue in implantology field. When a <b>guest</b> <b>device</b> is installed in the living bone, many clinical responses may arise, such as inflammatory processes or osteo-integration failure. The results of this study can give useful information to understand the influence of the implant features and to appropriately apply it in the science of dental implants with the aim to reduce the potential implant failure. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{commodity}} I/O device has {{no support}} for virtualization. A VMM can assign such {{a device to}} a single guest with direct, fast, but insecure access by the <b>guest’s</b> native <b>device</b> driver. Alternatively, the VMM can build virtual devices {{on top of the}} physical device, allowing it to be multiplexed across VMs, but with lower performance. We propose a technique that provides an intermediate option. In virtual passthrough I/O (VPIO), the guest interacts directly with the physical device most of the time, achieving high performance, as in passthrough I/O. Additionally, the guest/device interactions drive a model that in turn identifies (1) when the physical device can be handed off to another VM, and (2) if the <b>guest</b> programs the <b>device</b> to behave illegitimately. In this paper, we describe the VPIO model, and present preliminary results in using it to support a commodity network card within the Palacios VMM we are building. We believe that an appropriate model for an I/O device could be produced by the hardware vendor as part of the design, implementation, and testing process. ...|$|R

40|$|We find {{ourselves}} today often carrying numerous portable electronic devices, such as notebook computers, mobile phones, PDAs, digital cameras and mp 3 /MD/DVD players, {{used to help}} and entertain us in our professional {{life as well as}} in our private life. For the most part, these devices are used separately and their applications do not interact. Imagine, however, if they could interact directly and thus create a network where information may flow seamlessly between the devices such a network of personal devices {{is often referred to as}} a personal area network (PAN). Moreover, access to the Internet via a (public) wireless LAN access point and/or via a 3 G UMTS mobile phone would enable the PAN to be constantly on-line. The strongest candidate to provide with the cheap, short-range radio links necessary to enable such networks is the Bluetooth wireless technology. Seen from a networking perspective, a PAN will be expected to have participants, both of its own <b>devices</b> and <b>guest</b> <b>devices</b> from other PANs, continuously moving in and out of its coverage. To cope with this volatile nature of the network, the concept of adhoc networking may be applied to create a robust and flexible connectivity. A major technical step is taken when the Bluetooth piconet network architecture, a strict star topology, is extended into a scatternet architecture, where piconets are interconnected. A consequence of creating scatternet based PANs is that some nodes will form gateways between piconets and these gateways must be capable of time sharing their presence in each piconet they are members of. While the Bluetooth standard defines the gateway nodes, the actual mechanisms and algorithms that accomplish the inter-piconet scheduling (IPS) is left rather open.

40|$|Paravirtualization is an {{important}} I/O virtualization technol-ogy since it uniquely provides all of the following benefits: the ability to share the device between multiple VMs, sup-port for legacy devices without virtualization hardware, and high performance. However, existing paravirtualization so-lutions have one main limitation: they only support one I/O device class, and would require significant engineering ef-fort to support new device classes and features. In this paper, we present Paradice, a solution that vastly simplifies I/O par-avirtualization by using a common paravirtualization bound-ary for various I/O device classes: Unix device files. Using this boundary, the paravirtual drivers simply act as a class-agnostic indirection layer between the application and the actual device driver. We address two fundamental challenges: supporting cross-VM driver memory operations without changes to ap-plications or device drivers and providing fault and device data isolation between <b>guest</b> VMs despite <b>device</b> driver bugs. We implement Paradice for x 86, the Xen hypervisor, and the Linux and FreeBSD OSes. Our implementation paravirtual-izes various GPUs, input devices, cameras, an audio device, and an Ethernet card for the netmap framework with ~ 7700 LoC, of which only ~ 900 are device class-specific. Our mea-surements show that Paradice achieves performance close to native for different devices and applications including netmap, 3 D HD games, and OpenCL applications...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} our recent {{experimental}} work on coherent and blue phase liquid crystal lasers. We will present results on thin-film photonic band edge lasing devices using dye-doped low molar mass liquid crystals in self-organised chiral nematic and blue phases. We show that high Q-factor lasers {{can be achieved}} in these materials and demonstrate that a single mode output with a very narrow line width can be readily achievable in well-aligned mono-domain samples. Further, {{we have found that}} the performance of the laser, i. e. the slope efficiency and the excitation threshold, are dependent upon the physical parameters of the low molar mass chiral nematic liquid crystals. Specifically, slope efficiencies greater than 60 % could be achieved depending upon the materials used and the device geometry employed. We will discuss the important parameters of the liquid crystal host/dye <b>guest</b> materials and <b>device</b> configuration that are needed to achieve such high slope efficiencies. Further we demonstrate how the wavelength of the laser can be tuned using an in-plane electric field in a direction perpendicular to the helix axis via a flexoelectric mechanism as well as thermally using thermochromic effects. We will then briefly outline data on room temperature blue phase lasers and further show how liquid crystal/lenslet arrays have been used to demonstrate 2 D laser emission of any desired wavelength. Finally, we present preliminary data on LED/incoherent pumping of RG liquid crystal lasers leading to a continuous wave output. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{a new series of}} organosiloxane liquid crystals and the effects of dye addition by mixing and synthetic addition. The organosiloxane compounds are the result of a building block process that seeks to combine the high tilt and wide phase range properties of laterally substituted biphenyl benzoate mesogens with the polymer ruggedness of siloxane head groups. Initially the biphenyl benzoate mesogenic precursors are investigated with bromine, chlorine and fluorine substituents. The materials yield 20 - 45 deg tilt angles with 70 - 130 nCcm"-" 2 spontaneous polarisation. When combined with a siloxane head group, the only liquid crystal phase seen is a 50 deg C wide SmC* phase {{in each of the three}} compounds. The siloxane moieties micro-segregate and form a virtual backbone. As a consequence of the new molecular arrangement, temperature independent, near 45 deg or 45 deg tilt angles are measured for all three compounds. Switching time measurements reveal sub-millisecond switching down to 40 deg C below the I#->#SmC* transition. The attachment of a biphenyl benzoate molecule at either end of the siloxane core results in a series of bi-mesogenic compounds. These compounds yield 60 deg C wide antiferroelectric SmC*_A phases. The antiferroelectric nature is proposed to arise due to a bent conformation of the bi-mesogenic molecules. The spontaneous polarisation is further enhanced to 100 - 140 nCcm"-" 2 whilst the other electro-optic properties broadly follow similar trends to the mono-siloxane compounds. The synthesis of 45 deg tilt ferroelectric compounds opens up the possibility of many new device applications. The feasibility of transferring the benefits offered by ferroelectrics to the field of dyed and single polariser devices is investigated. Three commercial dyes are mixed with the laterally halogen substituted mono-mesogenic organosiloxanes. The phase sequence of the host is maintained along with the near 45 deg tilt angles of the host material. The magnitude of the spontaneous polarisation is reduced in line with the dilution effect of the non-liquid crystalline dye compounds. The switching times, although marginally increased with dye addition, still remained in the hundred microsecond regime demonstrated by the hosts. With the addition of one of the commercial dyes to an antiferroelectric host, three optically distinct states can be observed in a suitably oriented cell. This single polariser tri-state dye <b>guest</b> host <b>device</b> is only made possible by the near 45 deg tilt angle of the bi-mesogenic organosiloxane compounds. In order to introduce more dye into the organosiloxane hosts, a nitrostilbene dye molecule is grafted onto a siloxane core via an eleven carbon length alkyl chain. Following the pattern of the host organosiloxanes, monomeric and dimeric nitrostilbene compounds are studied, and the effect that grafting has on the dye's absorption properties is examined. This attempt to mimic the host structure proved highly successful, with the resultant organosiloxane dyes exhibiting liquid crystalline phases and showing complete miscibility with the organosiloxane hosts over the entire concentration range. Of particular note is the presence of antiferroelectricity in a mono-mesogenic ferroelectric host on addition of a dimeric non-ferroelectric dye. The results of this work show that the virtual backbone effect in low molar mass organosiloxane liquid crystals can be used to increase the solubility of a dye guest moiety and influence the stability and form of the mesophases. The ferroelectric / antiferroelectric characteristics of the liquid-crystal host can be retained and room temperature ferroelectric phases are created with broad temperature invariant properties. In this thesis, as well as the study of the physical and chemical properties of these new materials, some of the potential devices that now become possible are considered.
