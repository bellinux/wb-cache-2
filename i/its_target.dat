5|$|In 1905, {{members of}} the Armenian Revolutionary Federation {{organized}} the failed Yıldız Attempt, an assassination plot on Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{in the capital of}} the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople (modern day Istanbul); the explosion missed <b>its</b> <b>target</b> by a few minutes. The Dashnaksutiun founder Kristapor Mikaelian was lost by an accidental explosion during the planning of the operation.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015 in the U.S., the PancakeBot pancake machine {{received}} over $141,000 on Kickstarter. <b>Its</b> <b>target</b> donation request on {{the website}} was $50,000. PancakeBot can produce custom pancakes in various designs, which is performed {{by the use of}} pancake batter in a bottle that is moved by a programmable machine arm atop the griddle. The machine utilizes custom software to accomplish this.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 1919, a {{month after}} the Committee's {{hearings}} ended, a bomb was mailed to Overman's home, {{one of a series of}} letter bombs sent to prominent Americans in the 1919 United States anarchist bombings. It was intercepted before it reached <b>its</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to <b>its</b> <b>target</b> {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, {{it was not}} possible to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to <b>its</b> <b>target</b> is extraordinarily high.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to <b>its</b> <b>target,</b> the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate {{cell signalling}} events. In these cases, a serpin that {{has formed a}} complex with <b>its</b> <b>target</b> protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells {{to the presence of}} protease activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune {{are often}} {{presented}} as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune {{are thought to}} employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray {{in the manner of}} a will o' the wisp. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse <b>its</b> <b>target</b> with illusions or visions. Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.|$|E

5|$|Mass {{production}} {{began at}} the company's Mizushima plant in Kurashiki, Okayama, in December 2005, before it was released for sale on January 24, 2006. Priced from ¥1,281,000 to ¥1,617,000, Mitsubishi initially aimed for 5,000 cars per month within the domestic market, and managed to exceed <b>its</b> <b>target</b> in its first month by over 1,000. By the end of 2006, approximately 37,000 had been sold. The company has already exported the i to Singapore, Brunei, Hong Kong, and New Zealand, where like Japan they drive on the left, and introduced it to the United Kingdom on July 1, 2007, with a price of UK£9,000 and a target of 300 sales per year.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} bipolar. Only one bipolar arrangement is possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating <b>its</b> <b>target,</b> in the first case, termed Batesian-Wallacian mimicry after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, the model is the prey species. In the second case, the model {{is the host of}} a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control <b>its</b> <b>target</b> protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E

5|$|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight {{was adapted}} into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first {{performed}} in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised {{for maintaining the}} complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's Gwyneth and the Green Knight, first performed in 2002. This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as <b>its</b> <b>target</b> is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.|$|E
5|$|StG 77 {{was also}} in action, escorted by JG 27 Bf 109s. StG 77s 52 Ju 87s were joined by 40 Ju 88s of KG 54. Both {{formations}} were heading for No. 10 Group RAF's airfields. StG 77 was targeting RAF Warmwell. The Geschwader failed to find <b>its</b> <b>target,</b> dropping its bombs at random. The other Ju 87 units had attracted much attention and StG 77 escaped unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|The TLAM {{could be}} {{equipped}} with an inertial and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) radar guidance package to find and destroy <b>its</b> <b>target.</b> The TERCOM radar used a stored map reference to compare with the actual terrain to determine the missile's position. If necessary, a course correction was then made to place the missile on course to the target. Terminal guidance in the target area {{was provided by the}} optical Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system, which compared a stored image of target with the actual target image.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept was}} for the {{satellite}} to be launched ahead of <b>its</b> <b>target,</b> so that the target would come close to it. After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with <b>its</b> <b>target,</b> and then the SAINT would locate the target using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired the target. Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar and orientation systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) of the target. If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video of the target and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A full inspection of the target would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station. It would then stay within 200ft (60m) of the target for up to two days, taking pictures and measurements at different angles. After this it would be depleted of battery power and propellant.|$|E
5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, {{a booster}} propelled the missile {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to <b>its</b> <b>target,</b> were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E
