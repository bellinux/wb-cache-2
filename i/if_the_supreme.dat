2500|$|Referral {{of bills}} to the Supreme Court: The President may refer a bill, {{in whole or}} part, to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court finds any {{referred}} part unconstitutional, the entire bill falls.

[...] In a 1982 judgment delivered under such a referral, Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins bemoaned the crude strictures of the prescribed process; especially the fact that, if the court finds that a bill does not violate the Constitution, this judgment can never subsequently be challenged.|$|E

2500|$|Brandeis argues {{further that}} even {{independently}} of the constitutional question, the judgment should be reversed. By the law of Washington, wiretapping is a crime, and a federal court should not permit a prosecution that makes use of such crime to continue. The Eighteenth Amendment did not empower Congress to authorize anyone, federal agents or not, to violate the criminal laws of a state; nor has Congress ever purported to do so. These unlawful acts were not directed by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury; they were committed by individual officers. Thus, the government was innocent from a legal point of view, since it did not direct its agents {{to commit a crime}} on its behalf. However, when it sought to [...] "avail itself of the fruits of these acts" [...] to convict the defendants, [...] "it assumed moral responsibility for the officers' crimes." [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court were to permit the government to punish the defendants by the sole means of its officers’ transgressions, it would present all the elements of a ratification. [...] "If so, the government itself would become a lawbreaker." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{concluding}} that the Republic of Latvia de jure is a sovereign country the Declaration makes note of previously adopted documents and explains that the Supreme Soviet is acting according {{to the will of}} inhabitants of Latvia.

Secondly it notes Appeal of All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, which called for restoration of independence. Then it is stated that the Supreme Soviet is acting in accordance with the will of inhabitants of Latvia, which had been clearly expressed by electing as a majority those deputies, who had stated that they will restore independence of the Republic of Latvia in their reelection programme.|$|E

[...] When Lu heard this, he believed that he had to prevent a meeting between Emperor Dezong and Li Huaiguang at all costs, and therefore suggested to Emperor Dezong order Li Huaiguang to attack Chang'an at once. [...] Emperor Dezong agreed, and ordered Li Huaiguang to rendezvous with Li Sheng, Li Jianhui (李建徽), and Yang Huiyuan (楊惠元) to attack Chang'an. [...] Li Huaiguang, angry that he was not even able to meet the emperor, began to resent Emperor Dezong. [...] He stopped his army's movement and submitted petitions accusing Lu and the others of crimes and further accusing them of being responsible for the Jingyuan mutiny. [...] Emperor Dezong was forced to demote and exile Lu, Bai, and Zhao. [...] Li Huaiguang also submitted a petition accusing Zhai Wenxiu of crimes, and Emperor Dezong executed Zhai in response. [...] Only after these events occurred did Li Huaiguang rendezvous with Li Sheng, Li Jianhui, and Yang, in spring 784. [...] Meanwhile, when Emperor Dezong sought aid from the Tibetan Empire, the Tibetan chancellor Shang Jiezan (尚結贊) refused to launch forces unless he could get an explicit cosigning of the aid request by Li Huaiguang, citing the Tibetan Empire's own laws about how it would only launch troops in aid <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> commander of the state seeking aid also agreed with the aid request. [...] Li Huaiguang was vehemently against seeking Tibetan aid, however, citing how Tibetan troops would surely pillage the region and also seek excessive rewards, and he refused to cosign the aid request, and Shang refused to launch aid troops. [...] Emperor Dezong's trusted advisor Lu Zhi, believing Li Huaiguang {{to be on the verge}} of rebellion and fearing that Li Huaiguang would take over the troops under Li Sheng, Li Jianhui, and Yang, urged that those three armies be separated from Li Huaiguang's army and take up position elsewhere; Emperor Dezong repositioned Li Sheng, but believing that relocating Li Jianhui and Yang as well would bring further resentment from Li Huaiguang, did not move them.|$|E

60|$|If many of {{the lowest}} savages known to us {{entertain}} ideas of a Supreme Being such as we find among Fuegians, Australians, Bushmen, and Andamanese, are there examples, besides the Zulus, of tribes higher in material culture {{who seem to have}} had such notions, but to have partly forgotten or neglected them? Miss Kingsley, a lively, observant, and unprejudiced, though rambling writer, gives this very account of the Bantu races. Oblivion, or neglect, will show itself in leaving the Supreme Being alone, as he needs no propitiation, while devoting sacrifice and ritual to fetishes and ghosts. That this should be done is perfectly natural <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Being (who wants no sacrifice) were the first evolved in thought, while venal fetishes and spirits came in {{as a result of the}} ghost theory.

60|$|But as {{the supreme}} power can {{certainly}} do ten thousand things more than it ought, so there are several things which some people may think it can do, although it really cannot. For, it unfortunately happens, that edicts which cannot be executed, will not alter the nature of things. So, if a king and parliament should please to enact, that a woman who hath been a month married, is virgo intacta, would that actually restore her to her primitive state? <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> power should resolve a corporal of dragoons {{to be a doctor}} of divinity, law or physic, few, I believe, would trust their souls, fortunes, or bodies to his direction; because that power is neither fit to judge or teach those qualifications which are absolutely necessary to the several professions. Put the case that walking on the slack rope were the only talent required by act of parliament for making a man a bishop; no doubt, when a man had done his feat of activity in form, he might sit in the House of Lords, put on his robes and his rochet, go down to his palace, receive and spend his rents; but it requireth very little Christianity to believe this tumbler to be one whit more a bishop than he was before; because the law of God hath otherwise decreed; which law, although a nation may refuse to receive it, cannot alter in its own nature.|$|E
6000|$|At Galesburgh, I {{tried to}} show that by the Dred Scott decision, pushed to its {{legitimate}} consequences, slavery would be established in all the States {{as well as in}} the Territories. I did this because, upon a former occasion, I had asked Judge Douglas whether, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court should make a decision declaring that the States had not the power to exclude slavery from their limits, he would adopt and follow that decision as a rule of political action; and because he had not directly answered that question, but had merely contented himself with sneering at it, I again introduced it, and {{tried to show}} that the conclusion that I stated followed inevitably and logically from the proposition already decided by the court. Judge Douglas had the privilege of replying to me at Galesburgh, and again he gave me no direct answer as to whether he would or would not sustain such a decision if made. I give him his third chance to say yes or no. He is not obliged to do either, probably he will not do either; but I give him the third chance. I tried to show then that this result, this conclusion, inevitably followed from the point already decided by the court.
