25|$|An {{additional}} {{aspect of}} the in-office check is to examine any events that were stored since the last follow-up. These are typically stored based on specific criteria set by the physician and specific to the patient.

This is especially helpful in diagnosing the cause or origin of the event and making any necessary programming changes.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 2006, Rajkumar {{returned}} to his Sadashivanagar residence after his regular 20-minute walk and had a general medical check-up by 11:30a.m. (IST). At 1:50 pm (IST), as {{he sat on a}} sofa, he asked a member of his family to slow the fan down and immediately collapsed. His personal physician Ramana Rao was called for, who rushed within three minutes, and performed external cardiac massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Rajkumar was then taken to MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and was administered <b>intracardiac</b> injections. Efforts to revive him failed and was pronounced dead at 2:05 pm (IST).|$|E

2500|$|Some {{individuals}} with an ASD [...] have surgical correction of their ASD during childhood. [...] The development of {{signs and symptoms}} due to an ASD {{are related to the}} size of the <b>intracardiac</b> shunt.

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{clinical}} methods to measure cardiac output, ranging from direct <b>intracardiac</b> catheterization to non-invasive measurement of the arterial pulse. Each method has advantages and drawbacks. Relative comparison is limited by the absence of a widely accepted [...] "gold standard" [...] measurement. Cardiac output can also be affected significantly by the phase of respiration – intra-thoracic pressure changes influence diastolic filling and therefore cardiac output. This is especially important during mechanical ventilation, in which cardiac output can vary by up to 50% across a single respiratory cycle. Cardiac output should therefore be measured at evenly spaced points over a single cycle or averaged over several cycles.|$|E
2500|$|This system {{estimates}} Q {{using an}} existing arterial catheter with variable accuracy. These arterial monitors {{do not require}} <b>intracardiac</b> catheterisation from a pulmonary artery catheter. They require an arterial line and are therefore invasive. As with other arterial waveform systems, the short set-up and data acquisition times are benefits of this technology. Disadvantages include its inability to provide data regarding right-sided heart pressures or mixed venous oxygen saturation. [...] The measurement of Stroke Volume Variation (SVV), which predicts volume responsiveness is intrinsic to all arterial waveform technologies. It is used for managing fluid optimisation in high-risk surgical or critically ill patients. A physiologic optimization program based on haemodynamic principles that incorporates the data pairs SV and SVV has been published.|$|E
2500|$|Jorge N. Amely Vélez (born 1955) – {{a native}} of San German, is an {{inventor}} who holds various patents {{in the field of}} Medical Technology. In 1989, Amely Vélez earned his Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from California State University at Northridge. Among Amely Vélez's inventions are two which involve the methods and apparatuses for timing events within an implantable medical device capable of performing many concurrent processes. He authored a method to help prevent defibrillator output stage short circuit failures in implantable devices. Amely Vélez invented methods for a microprocessor based implantable device to have a configurable memory to assist in software development and patching [...] "Read Only Memory" [...] (ROM) based systems. He coauthored inventions in the field of rechargeable lithium silver vanadium oxide batteries for implantable devices and holds a patent for <b>intracardiac</b> lead impedance measurements using a painless waveform. It is a leakage detection system that includes a switch. He also holds another patent for an implantable defibrillator with sensing and pacing auto-capture capabilities. Amely Vélez has other patents pending. He is the coauthor of a patent which is pending for radio frequency antennas in implantable devices. The other two patents that are pending cover work related to magnetic and electric noise shielding in medical devices.|$|E
