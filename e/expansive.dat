5|$|A {{large and}} {{convective}} tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa in late August, developing into a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on August30 about 1,035mi (1,665km) {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles. Satellite imagery and data from a research aircraft indicated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fiona six hours later. Directed by an <b>expansive</b> mid-level ridge to its north, the cyclone moved west-northwest for several days, attaining peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) by 18:00UTC on September1 as it passed close to the northern Leeward Islands. Fiona's position between the mid-level ridge and the large circulation of Hurricane Earl off The Carolinas turned the storm northwest and then north as it encountered increasingly strong wind shear and began to weaken. <b>Expansive</b> outflow from Earl caused Fiona's low-level circulation to become dislocated from its convection, and the system degenerated into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on September4. The remnant low passed near Bermuda, producing light winds and about 0.78in (19.8mm) of rainfall, before dissipating the next day.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires {{requires}} the player {{to develop a}} civilization {{from a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an <b>expansive</b> Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.|$|E
5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area {{large enough for}} his <b>expansive</b> whims to have free play. And the consequence {{is that he has}} made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E
5|$|Critics have {{positively}} {{received some}} of the stories within the collection, analyzing Anarky as a unique force for political commentary and discussion within DC Comics' storytelling. However, the <b>expansive</b> growth of the character's unique abilities and characterization has also fueled criticism as having overpowered the character beyond suspension of disbelief.|$|E
5|$|Dewey's was not {{the only}} library {{classification}} available, although it was the most complete. Charles Ammi Cutter published the <b>Expansive</b> Classification in 1882, with initial encouragement from Melvil Dewey.

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any form of mass transit besides bus prior to 2008, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has {{remained}} a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958—a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings. Coupled with the explosive growth of the region and adequate funding, the result is one of the nation's most <b>expansive</b> freeway networks.|$|E

5|$|Much {{more than}} a {{renovation}} project, Domitian's building program {{was intended to be}} the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural renaissance.

The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more <b>expansive</b> building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E
5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor <b>expansive</b> ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E
