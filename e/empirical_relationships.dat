5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on <b>empirical</b> <b>relationships</b> between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E

30|$|Currently in the EEW system, epicentral {{distances}} {{are estimated}} from the <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship</b> with B values (B-Δ equation), which contains errors due to heterogeneities in the subsurface. Although the B values {{for a given}} epicentral distance fluctuate very much, the <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship</b> {{is based on the}} assumption that the B values decrease against epicentral distances monotonically. Thus, the epicentral distance estimated by the <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship</b> has a considerable error, sometimes on the order of 102  km. As a result of our study, we found that the distribution of B values shows tendencies according to the regional heterogeneities. So that, by considering local conditions of heterogeneities, the accuracy of epicentral distance estimation will be improved. In this study, we proposed that the B-Δ equation optimized by the station’s a value could improve the estimation accuracy.|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised {{over the use of}} plastic {{skylights}} as smoke vents in large single story buildings. The plastic skylights provide natural light to the building. There has been an assumption that these plastic panels will melt and provide smoke and heat venting during a fire. The plastics commonly used in New Zealand, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate, acrylic and glass fibre-reinforced polyester (GRP) have been tested in small scale experiments to further the understanding of the behaviour of the materials at elevated temperatures. The behaviour of particular interest is the effectiveness of the skylight as a vent for hot buoyant gases. Small scale experiments have been conducted to find the mass flow rate of an unobstructed vent. Experiments have then been carried out on samples of the four skylight materials for a range of exposure temperatures and times. The mass flow has been measured for the deformed sample and compared to the unobstructed flow. The results of the small scale experiments have been analysed and an <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship</b> has been developed for the PVC and polycarbonate material. The acrylic behaviour does not provide enough data to include it in the <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship.</b> The GRP failed to melt and was therefore also excluded from the <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship.</b> A model has been developed to demonstrate the use of the <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship.</b> The model compares four cases, the vents always open, the vents always closed, the vents opening at a single value and the area when calculated using the <b>empirical</b> <b>relationship...</b>|$|R
