30|$|Extra {{waiting time}} for containerships is {{something}} that is viewed critically by container carriers. In contrast to the critical attitude of cargo carriers towards waiting time in ports, the adaption of containerships’ cruising speeds (also known as slow steaming) is not seen as a problem. For container carriers, their biggest <b>costs</b> are <b>fuel.</b> These <b>costs</b> can be reduced by adapting the ship’s speed: a reduction to 80 % saves 60 % of <b>fuel</b> <b>costs,</b> and a reduction to 60 % saves 90 % of <b>fuel</b> <b>costs</b> (Weismann 2010). A market survey has shown that 75 % of the surveyed liners and carriers apply slow steaming in order to save bunker costs (Seatrade Global 2014). Because <b>fuel</b> <b>costs</b> are so high, container carriers operate more efficiently by sailing at lower speeds. In this regard, the extra travel time is compensated by fuel savings.|$|R

25|$|Currently, many HF {{units are}} {{operating}} below the design isobutene-to-olefin ratio, but {{to obtain the}} required octane, due to increasingly tight gasoline specifications, these ratios {{will need to be}} increased back to design ratios. The SAAU process employs either electric or turbine drives for the reactors and compressor to optimize refinery utilities. Horsepower input to the HF reaction zone is lower than to the H2SO4 reaction zone. In addition, the HF process does not require refrigeration. Therefore, power costs are less for HF units. Normally, the difference in fractionation costs outweighs this advantage when comparing overall utility costs. However, HF units may show a utility advantage if <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> is low relative to power cost.|$|E

25|$|Nighttime {{wind power}} is {{considered}} the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day. Typically, wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day.

Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive. However, U.S. civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power. The Navy's estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than $1 per gallon.|$|E
