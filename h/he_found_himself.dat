5|$|After Boroughbridge Pembroke {{found himself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. The opponents of Hugh Despenser and his father had lost all faith in him, {{but at the same time}} <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> marginalised at court where the Despensers' power grew more and more complete.

However <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> the third-choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey.|$|E

5|$|William Barley (1565?–1614) was an English {{bookseller}} and publisher. He {{completed an}} apprenticeship as a draper in 1587, but was soon {{working in the}} London book trade. As a freeman of the Drapers' Company, he was embroiled in a dispute {{between it and the}} Stationers' Company over the rights of drapers to function as publishers and booksellers. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> in legal tangles throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{strictly}} Protestant James I {{wished to}} end the practice, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> having to touch {{an increasing number of}} people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain the growing public demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.|$|E

5|$|In 1381 the Peasants' Revolt {{broke out}} in England, during which Gaunt was {{targeted}} by the rebels as an especially hated member of the administration. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> stranded {{in the north of}} England {{in the early part of}} the revolt but considered Dunstanburgh insufficiently secure to function as a safe haven, and was forced to turn to Alnwick Castle instead, which refused to let him in, fearing that his presence would invite a rebel attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very {{concerned}} about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E

5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an {{accident in the}} mine, where his left foot was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able to save his foot, Red lost four toes. He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> unable to run {{as fast as he}} previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E

5|$|With the Battle of Lewes, Montfort had won {{control of}} royal government, {{but after the}} {{defection}} of several close allies and the escape from captivity of Prince Edward, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> on the defensive. Forced to engage the royalists at Evesham, he faced an army {{twice the size of}} his own. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and his body mutilated. Though the battle effectively restored royal authority, scattered resistance remained until the Dictum of Kenilworth was signed in 1267.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Bute was {{determined}} to control the local government around Cardiff, considering it part of his rights and duties as a major landowner and aristocrat. On inheriting his estates, however, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> facing a difficult political situation. The Butes' grip on Glamorganshire had been weakened in the late 18th century, and the management of their political interests had been left {{for many years in}} the hands of John Wood, a local solicitor, whose family was embroiled in local politics, with their own set of interests. Glamorgan was also politically split between factions in the west and the east of the county, with most of Bute's estates in the eastern half. Bute's residence in the area, Cardiff Castle, was understaffed and regarded as unsuitable as a residence; consequently, he lacked the easy local patronage that would have come with a major, properly functioning establishment.|$|E

His writing was highly anti-communist, generally taking a confrontational tone towards the left.|$|R
