40|$|An {{analysis}} of the hydrodynamic motion of the fluid of photoinjected carriers in polar semiconductors is presented. Experiments of time-resolved photoluminescence, which provide relevant insights into the dynamical behavior of heterostructures, are analyzed. We study the propagation and recombination of carriers in semiconductor devices with a large cap layer, where carriers are photoinjected, and a quantum well where they recombine. The movement of the photoinjected, and away from <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>carriers</b> along such cap layer consists, to a good degree of approximation, in an ambipolar diffusivelike one, which decays in time {{as a result of}} recombination and the coupling, via Coulomb interaction, with the optical and acoustic plasma waves. The density of the electrons arriving at the interface with the quantum well can be determined; these electrons are transferred through the interface to recombine in the quantum well, and the resulting intensity of the time-resolved luminescence is obtained.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Double Peak (DP) {{electric}} field distribution is {{considered for the}} analysis of operational characteristics of irradiated silicon detectors. The key point of the model is trapping of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>carriers</b> to the midgap energy levels of radiation-induced defects, which leads to a non-uniform distribution of space charge concentration with positively and negatively charged regions adjacent to the p+ and n+ contacts, respectively. In our new development of the DP model we consider a non-depleted base region in between the space charge regions as a high resistivity bulk, which operates as a drift region with a non-negligible electric field. Electric field characteristics of detectors processed from n-type MCZ Si wafers using various technological procedures, and irradiated by 1 MeV neutrons and 24 GeV/c protons, have been compared. Electric field profiles have been reconstructed from DP pulse response of heavily irradiated detectors and calculated by the simulation of DP electric field distribution caused by carrier trapping. It is shown that detectors from n-type MCZ Si irradiated by 24 GeV/c protons do not show typical space charge sign inversion up to the irradiation fluence of about 2. 2 × 1015 p/cm 2 and the region with a positive charge dominates over a negatively charged region...|$|E
30|$|The {{structures}} {{with different}} In contents in the confining layers demonstrated similar dependencies at equivalent spectral ranges. So, the band-to-band excitation in GaAs (1.5  eV) shows a quadratic dependence {{at most of}} intensity values. This is typical for the band-to-band recombination of non-equilibrium charge carriers, for instance when they are highly predominant under the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>carriers</b> [53]: this is expectable in our undoped structures. The dependencies {{in the case of}} excitation in the QD and InGaAs confining layers are very similar to each other but different from those for GaAs. They are linear at low excitation intensities and become sublinear at higher intensities. This behavior obviously points out to the carrier recombination involving Shockley-Read centers: the linear dependence becomes sublinear one, as some of the centers are saturated at higher carrier generation rates [54]. These results of intensity-dependent measurements distinctly indicate an efficient generation of main charge carriers at a relatively low recombination rate in QD embedding layers and a much higher density of recombination centers in GaAs layers. For example, during the QD excitation in similar characterizations, InGaAs/GaAs QD photosensitive structures showed a dependence from intensity as PC(I)[*]~[*]I 0.25, which occurred due to a high rate of the non-radiative recombination though defect levels along with QD radiative recombination [40, 55]. However, it is worth to notice that the InGaAs/GaAs structure was multilayered having seven QD layers.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNuclear spin {{dynamics}} in semiconductors {{has been studied}} extensively by optical means for more than forty years. Yet generally the existing techniques require the injection of out of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>carriers</b> in the semiconductor in order to probe the nuclear polarization, which in turn disturbs the nuclei to be measured. This {{is the case for}} photoluminescence experiments, but also for time resolved Faraday/Kerr rotation, in which a shift in the electron Larmor frequency is induced by the nuclear field. 1 In this work, we demonstrate a non-destructive detection of nuclear magnetization in n-GaAs via cavity enhanced Faraday rotation of an off-resonant light beam. We use a two-step protocol, as proposed by Artemova and Merkulov 2, where preparation and measurement are separated in time. The nuclear spins are first cooled down by optical pumping, then the pump beam is switched off and the subsequent evolution of nuclear polarization is detected by the Faraday rotation of a below band gap probe beam. This experimental protocol applied to metallic GaAs just above the metal-insulator transition reveals a non- monotonous evolution of the nuclear induced Faraday rotation. We interpret this behavior {{as a consequence of the}} existence of two contributions in the Faraday rotation, which are related to optical transitions involving either localized or delocalized states. Therefore, this detection scheme turns out to be sensitive to nuclear spins situated within the localization radius of bound electron states, as well as to all other nuclear spins in the sample. The contributions to the Faraday rotation of different nuclear species with different localizations in the sample are identified in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Our results suggest that the nuclear relaxation in metallic n-GaAs is dominated by diffusion towards fast relaxing centers, rather than by the Korringa mechanism...|$|E

The ionization energies of donors and acceptors are estimated to be about 15. 5 and 92. 9 meV, respectively. The validity of EMA to wurtzite InGaN alloy has also been discussed. AMPS- 1 D software is used to simulate the doping levels and deep levels in In 0. 65 Ga 0. 35 N single junction solar cells with assumption that the deep level is located at the middle of In 0. 65 Ga 0. 35 N band gap where the recombination is maximum. Band structure and concentration distributions of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>carriers</b> are obtained. The influence of deep level recombination on efficiency is estimated to be about 9. 6 % while recombination center concentration is 5 x 10 (15) cm(- 3), and capture cross section is 10 (- 13) cm(2). The simulated results show that the increase of reverse saturation current and the decrease of open-circuit voltages (V-oc) and fill factor (FF) are mainly responsible for the decrease of the efficiency.
