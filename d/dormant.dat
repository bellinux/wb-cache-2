5|$|Burke, Messrs., John and John Bernard, Extinct and <b>Dormant</b> Baronetcies of England, Ireland, and Scotland, 2nd Edition, London, 1841, p.618.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go <b>dormant</b> or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long <b>dormant</b> periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
5|$|The bulb lies <b>dormant</b> {{after the}} leaves and flower stem die back and has {{contractile}} roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season. Most species are <b>dormant</b> from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.|$|E
5|$|Flowering {{phenology}} in Ficus {{has been}} characterised into five phases. In most figs, phase A is followed almost immediately by phase B. However, in F. aurea immature inflorescences can remain <b>dormant</b> {{for more than}} nine months.|$|E
5|$|Several fungal {{diseases}} infect {{and kill}} adult cicadas while another entomopathogenic fungus, Cordyceps spp., attacks nymphs. Massospora cicadina specifically attacks the adults of periodical cicadas, the spores remaining <b>dormant</b> {{in the soil}} between outbreaks.|$|E
5|$|The Order of the Bath is the fourth-most senior of the British Orders of Chivalry, after The Most Noble Order of the Garter, The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, and The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick (<b>dormant).</b>|$|E
5|$|The active Mount St. Helens was radically {{different}} from its <b>dormant</b> form, now featuring an enormous bulge and several craters. In the week preceding the eruption, cracks formed in the north sector of the volcano's summit, indicating a movement of magma.|$|E
5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains <b>dormant</b> {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains <b>dormant</b> even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
5|$|The volcano is {{currently}} considered <b>dormant.</b> Future eruptive activity may cause sector collapses, although {{they would be}} a small danger to human life, given that the area is sparsely inhabited.|$|E
5|$|Thor, {{crown prince}} of Asgard, is banished to Earth and {{stripped}} of his powers after he reignites a <b>dormant</b> war. As his brother, Loki, plots to take the throne for himself, Thor must prove himself worthy and reclaim his hammer Mjolnir.|$|E
5|$|After a {{potential}} <b>dormant</b> {{period in the}} liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, the Jubilee Rink burned down, forcing the Canadiens to build Mount Royal Arena as a replacement. The team also lost their star player Malone, {{who had been}} on loan from the <b>dormant</b> Bulldogs as Quebec rejoined the league in 1919–20. Kennedy died in 1921; he had never recovered from the 1919 flu. His widow sold the team to Leo Dandurand, former player Joseph Cattarinich and Louis A. Letourneau.|$|E
5|$|Effusive eruptions on {{the main}} island {{returned}} on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been <b>dormant</b> ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24cumi), and the island's highest point was 174metres (570ft) above sea level at that time.|$|E
5|$|Glicken {{was born}} in 1958 to Milton and Ida Glicken. He {{graduated}} from Stanford University in 1980. Later that year, while {{a graduate student at}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, he was temporarily hired by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to help monitor the volcano Mount St. Helens in Washington state. St. Helens, <b>dormant</b> since the 1840s and 1850s, resumed activity in March 1980.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian volcanoes {{follow a}} {{well-established}} {{life cycle of}} growth and erosion. After a new volcano forms, its lava output gradually increases. Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes <b>dormant,</b> and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum cultivars {{and species}} {{can be grown}} inside in pots or outside in warmer climates (Hardiness 7B-11). Many will bloom year after year {{provided}} they are given a <b>dormant</b> period in a cool, dark place for two months without water or fertilizer although some bulbs will start growing before the two-month period is up.|$|E
5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a <b>dormant</b> phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} {{grassland}} psilocybin mushroom {{species such as}} P.mexicana, P.tampanensis and Conocybe cyanopus, P.semilanceata may form sclerotia, a <b>dormant</b> form of the fungus, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing sclerotia on a malt agar surface culture.|$|E
5|$|No {{one took}} over as {{paramount}} chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied and fell into ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these <b>dormant</b> traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E
5|$|Original {{plans for}} a Water Coaster at Sea World were {{released}} by the local council in 2008; however, they were put on hold. In 2010, the Bermuda Triangle ride closed, sitting <b>dormant</b> until mid-2012 when construction for the Storm Coaster began. After demolition works were completed, track for the Storm Coaster arrived at Sea World, taking five months to erect. Storm Coaster officially {{opened to the public}} on 6 December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These <b>dormant</b> bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} <b>dormant</b> buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} the development of new cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth frequent watering, and should not be given a <b>dormant</b> period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about six years to bloom.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often <b>dormant</b> for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with herpes viruses.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often <b>dormant</b> for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with herpes viruses. Some viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus, can cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy, while others, such as papillomaviruses, are established causes of cancer.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{under the}} {{watershed}} includes {{part of the}} last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later volcanic eruptions, sediments from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt. Two <b>dormant</b> volcanoes from the Boring Lava Field are in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|The {{north-eastern}} {{boundary of}} this geologic region {{is marked by}} the Murihiku escarpment, which runs along {{the southern edge of}} the <b>dormant</b> Hillfoot fault line. The Catlins ranges are strike ridges composed of Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, mudstones and other related sedimentary rocks, often with a high incidence of feldspar. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic Warepan and Kaihikuan stages are found in the area.|$|E
5|$|This {{integrated}} viral DNA {{may then}} lie <b>dormant,</b> in the latent stage of HIV infection. To actively produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors {{need to be}} present, {{the most important of}} which is NF-κB (NF kappaB), which is upregulated when T-cells become activated. This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection.|$|E
5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie <b>dormant</b> for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|After its {{suspension}} {{with the}} December 1798 issue, the Analytical Review lay <b>dormant</b> {{until it was}} briefly revived as The Analytical Review (New Series) {{during the first six}} months of 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures. This series lasted only from January until June 1799.|$|E
5|$|After the academy's stone {{building}} ceased {{being used}} as an educational facility, it was subsequently utilized for various purposes including serving as {{the offices of the}} Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser newspaper and as a meeting place for local fraternal organizations. Romney Academy's stone building remained <b>dormant</b> and unoccupied {{for a number of years}} and was demolished by the time Maxwell and Swisher researched and authored their History of Hampshire County, West Virginia in the late 1890s.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a <b>dormant</b> volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become <b>dormant</b> while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Attempts at {{forming an}} alumni {{association}} {{had been made}} since 1896; a charter was applied for by J. B. McCrary and William H. Glenn on June 28, 1906 and was approved by Fulton County on June 20, 1908. The Georgia Tech Alumni Association published its first annual report in 1908, but the group was largely <b>dormant</b> during World War I. The organization {{played an important role}} in the 1920s Greater Georgia Tech Campaign, which consolidated all existing alumni clubs and funded a significant expansion of Georgia Tech's campus.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{in their}} adult stage can live from {{a week to}} nearly a year {{depending}} on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain <b>dormant</b> in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as a caterpillar. Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, <b>dormant</b> {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E
