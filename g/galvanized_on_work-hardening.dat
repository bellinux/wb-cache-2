40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the models appropriate for the dynamic assessment of jack-ups, concentrating particularly on the long-term response due to random ocean waves and <b>on</b> <b>work-hardening</b> plasticity models used for spud-can response. A methodology for scaling of short-term statistics, calculated using a Constrained NewWave technique, is shown in a numerical experiment for an example jack-up and central North Sea location. The difference in long-term extreme response statistics due to various footing assumptions is emphasised. Results for two environmental load conditions are described (one excluding and one including wind and current effects) and the role of sea-state severity in the variation of short-term extreme response statistics is also highlighted. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{galvanized}} piping replaced previously-used cast iron and lead in cold-water plumbing. Typically, galvanized piping rusts {{from the inside}} out, building up layers of plaque {{on the inside of}} the piping, causing both water pressure problems and eventual pipe failure. These plaques can flake off, leading to visible impurities in water and a slight metallic taste. The life expectancy of galvanized piping is about 70 years, but it may vary by region due to impurities in the water supply and the proximity of electrical grids for which interior piping acts as a pathway (the flow of electricity can accelerate chemical corrosion). Pipe longevity also depends on the thickness of zinc in the original <b>galvanizing,</b> which ranges <b>on</b> a scale from G40 to G210, and whether the pipe was <b>galvanized</b> <b>on</b> both the inside and outside, or just the outside.|$|R

As long as there is moisture, the zinc will corrode and eventually disappear.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Threaded nails {{are used}} in wood {{construction}} because of their superior performance, but relatively few tests have been conducted on nails larger than 12 d (3. 76 mm diameter). Experience has suggested that threaded nail withdrawal design values are too conservative. The Forest Products Laboratory and Washington State University have been cooperatively characterizing the strength of threaded nails over a range of wood species and nail types. This paper focuses on the immediate withdrawal strength of annularly threaded nails in Douglas Fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir, helically threaded nails in Southern Pine, and smooth nails in Southern Pine and Spruce-Pine-Fir lumber. Average withdrawal strength of threaded nails was {{greater than that of}} smooth shank nails of the same diameter. In comparison of experimental withdrawal strength to existing design proce-dures for assigning allowable withdrawal strength design values, annular shank nails showed the greatest dif-ference. Withdrawal strengths of nails from five different manufacturers were not significantly different.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microstructure}} <b>on</b> the <b>work-hardening</b> and ductile fracture {{of aluminium alloys}} was studied using an experimental–numerical approach. Four aluminium alloys with different strength and particle content were tested in uniaxial tension after the following subsequent processing steps: (1) casting and homogenisation, (2) extrusion, and (3) cold rolling followed by heat treatment. The latter processing step was carried out to obtain a recrystallized grain structure with random crystallographic texture. The alloys were two AlFe alloys with different Fe content, one AlMn alloy and one AlMgSi alloy. The grain structure, particle distribution and crystallographic texture were determined for all combinations of alloy and processing route using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Tensile tests were carried out on axisymmetric samples to obtain the true stress–strain curves to failure and the true failure strain of the materials, using a laser-based measuring system. Based on numerical simulations of the tensile tests, the equivalent stress–strain curves were determined to failure, assuming J 2 flow theory. The {{results showed that the}} microstructure had a marked effect <b>on</b> both <b>work-hardening</b> and ductility, whilst the ductile fracture mechanism remained unchanged. The plastic anisotropy, induced by the extrusion process and not entirely removed by the cold rolling and heat treatment, led {{to a wide range of}} fracture modes of the axisymmetric samples. The failure strain was markedly lower for the cast and homogenised material than for the extruded and the cold rolled and recrystallized materials of the same alloy.

40|$|The wetting {{behavior}} and interfacial microstructures of molten magnesium AZ 61 alloy {{on the surface}} of two different Q 235 and galvanized steel plates under the condition of cold metal transfer were investigated by using dynamic sessile drop method.

Al-Fe intermetallic layer was observed whether the substrate is Q 235 steel or galvanized steel, and the formation of Al-Fe intermetallic layer should satisfy the thermodynamic condition of such Mg-Al/Fe system. The wettability of molten AZ 61 magnesium alloy is improved with the increase of wire feed speed whether on Q 235 steel surface or <b>on</b> <b>galvanized</b> steel surface, good wettability on Q 235 steel surface is due to severe interface reaction when wire feed speed increases, good wettability <b>on</b> <b>galvanized</b> steel surface is attributed to the aggravating zinc volatilization.

40|$|Experiments and {{finite element}} {{simulations}} {{have been performed}} to examine error measurement of hardness and elastic modulus caused by pile-up when soft films deposited on hard substrates are tested by nanoindentation methods. Pile-up is exacerbated in soft-film/hard-substrate systems by the constraint imposed on plastic deformation in the film by the relatively non-deformable substrate. To experimentally examine pile-up effects, soft aluminum films with thicknesses of 240, 650, and 1700 nm were deposited on hard soda-lime glass substrates and tested by nanoindentation techniques. This system is attractive because the elastic modulus of the film and the substrate are approximately the same, but the substrate is harder than the film {{by a factor of}} about ten. Consequently, substrate influences on the indentation load-displacement behavior are manifested primarily by differences in the plastic flow characteristics alone. The elastic modulus of the film/substrate system, as measured by nanoindentation techniques, exhibits an increase with indenter penetration depth which peaks at a value approximately 30 % greater than the true film modulus at a penetration depth close to the film thickness. Finite element simulation shows that this unusual behavior is caused by substrate-induced enhancement of pile-up. Finite element simulation also shows that the amount of pile-up increases with increasing penetration depth, and that the pile-up geometry depends <b>on</b> the <b>work-hardening</b> characteristics of the film. Because of these effects, nanoindentation techniques overestimate the true film hardness and elastic modulus by as much as 68 % and 35 %, respectively, depending <b>on</b> the <b>work-hardening</b> behavior of the film and the indenter penetration depth. The largest errors occur in non-work-hardening materials at penetration depths close to the film thickness, for which substrate-induced enhancement of pile-up is greatest...|$|R
