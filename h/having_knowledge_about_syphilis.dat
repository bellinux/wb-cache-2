The second level of experts includes those who <b>have</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the relationships of the experts at the first level and each higher level accordingly. We show how to derive the most supported opinion among the experts at each level. This is used to order the experts into categories of their competence defined as the support they get from their colleagues. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose/Objectives: To survey nurses <b>about</b> their <b>knowledge</b> {{of cancer}} {{survivorship}} care. Design: Descriptive, cross-sectional. Setting: Midwestern comprehensive cancer center. Sample: 223 registered and advanced practice nurses. Methods: Online survey of survivorship knowledge using a 50 -item questionnaire {{derived from the}} Institute of Medicine report and related publications. Main Research Variables: Concepts of survivorship care and common long-term symptoms. Findings: Most nurses reported <b>having</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> healthy lifestyle habits; more than 50 % of nurses reported <b>having</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, as well as side effects of fatigue, depression, limitations of daily activities, and weight gain; less than 50 % of nurses reported <b>having</b> <b>knowledge</b> of impact on family, biologic agents, lymphedema, immunizations or vaccinations, and osteoporosis screening; less than 40 % of nurses reported <b>having</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> marital and partner relationships, osteoporosis prevention and care, sexuality, side effects of bone marrow transplantation, employment issues, and angiogenesis agents; and less than 25 % of nurses reported <b>having</b> <b>knowledge</b> on genetic risks, as well as fertility, financial, and insurance issues. Conclusions: Oncology nurses at an academic comprehensive cancer center reported gaps in knowledge consistent with previous studies <b>about</b> <b>knowledge</b> of survivorship care. Implications for Nursing: The Institute of Medicine has challenged oncology providers to address cancer survivorship care planning. Gaps in cancer survivorship knowledge are evident and will require focused education for this initiative to be successful...|$|R

40|$|Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) {{is one of}} the {{commonly}} used treatment modalities for patients with severe mental disorders. However, acceptance of ECT by the patient and relatives often depends on how the health-care professionals themselves present the treatment modality to the patients and their relatives. There is a lack of information <b>about</b> the <b>knowledge</b> and attitude toward ECT among health professionals. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> and attitude toward ECT among nursing students. Methodology: Knowledge of and attitudes toward ECT among nursing students were assessed using ECT knowledge and attitude questionnaires. Results: The study included 183 nursing students. Majority (n = 62; 60. 8 %) of the participants obtained information about ECT from media (movies, television, print media, etc.). None of the students <b>had</b> full <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> ECT. Although a significant proportion of students <b>had</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the ECT procedure and consent procedure, majority of them <b>had</b> poor <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the effectiveness, mechanism of action, indications, and side effects of ECT. Negative attitudes were also highly prevalent, with {{more than two-thirds of the}} participants having negative attitudes toward ECT on more than half of the attitude items of the scale. Total knowledge score positively correlated with total attitude score, suggesting that higher knowledge was associated with more positive attitude. Conclusions: Although nursing students <b>have</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> basic ECT procedure and consent, they lack <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the effectiveness, mechanism of action, indications, and side effects of ECT. Negative attitude toward ECT is also highly prevalent among nursing students. Accordingly, there is a need to improve the knowledge and address the negative attitude of nursing students, which may ultimately lead to better acceptance of the treatment...|$|R

40|$|Aim and Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{knowledge}} and attitude of medical doctors towards the emergency management of dental trauma in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey in which, 500 medical doctors were randomly included in the study and the participation was voluntary. Data regarding the emergency management of avulsed tooth was collected using a self-administered questionnaire having questions which were close ended. Statistical analysis was carried out. Chi-square test was used to analyze the data gathered. Results: It was found that frequency of occurrence of soft tissue injuries of the face was 83 %, laceration injuries was 79 %, nasal bone fracture was 66 %, intraoral soft tissue injuries of the lip was 67 %, avulsion was 77 %, and frequency of dental trauma of maxillary central incisor was 63 %. Furthermore, the frequency of respondents <b>having</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> reimplantation was 46 % and frequency of respondents <b>having</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the time of reimplantation was 60 %. Frequency of respondents <b>having</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the preservation of tooth for reimplantation was 51 %, whereas frequency of respondents <b>having</b> no <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> the preference of preservative medium was 47 %. Frequency of respondents who have not seen traumatic injuries of primary teeth was 55 % and the most frequently administered first aid was tetanus injection having 67 %. Conclusion: The results from this study suggest that knowledge of the management of dental injuries among medical professionals/doctors was inadequate.
