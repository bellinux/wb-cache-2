5|$|After {{eight years}} with the company, in March 2004, Runnels was {{released}} from WWE prior to a massive firing spree. In an April 2015 interview with Vince Russo, Runnels stated that she was flown up on April 1, 2004 to the WWE offices <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> WWE executives Kevin Dunn and John Laurinaitis where she was told that they were parting ways with her; the reason she was told that she was flown up was because the WWE respected her. After leaving the company, Runnels spent time traveling the world.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, he {{attempted}} to secure a position with the Tyler administration, claiming {{that he was a}} member of the Whig Party. He hoped to be appointed to the Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 15 May a German {{messenger}} reached The Hague, inviting Winkelman to Rijsoord <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> von Küchler {{to negotiate}} the articles of a written capitulation document. Both quickly agreed on most conditions, Winkelman declaring to have surrendered army, naval and air forces. When von Küchler demanded that pilots still fighting for the allies {{should be treated as}} francs-tireurs—seen by the Germans as guerilla fighters outside the laws of war—Winkelman's refusal made it clear to the Germans that only the armed forces in the homeland, with the exception of Zealand, would capitulate, not the country itself. On other points a swift agreement was reached and the document was signed at 10:15.|$|E
5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E
5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E

5|$|On March 13, amidst heavy {{fighting}} in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, General Ngô Quang Trưởng flew out to Saigon <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. In this meeting, President Thiệu outlined his decision to abandon most of the provinces in I Corps Tactical Zone, and ordered General Trưởng to withdraw his forces towards the coastal regions of central Vietnam instead. In addition, the Airborne Division (South Vietnam) would be redeployed to the Mekong Delta region, where it could protect the nation's capital. Unwilling to concede the northern provinces to the enemy, General Trưởng tried unsuccessfully to convince President Thiệu to reverse his decision {{in the belief that}} he could hold onto I Corps, and recapture lost territories by using the Airborne and Marine Corps Divisions. After he returned to his headquarters that afternoon, General Trưởng decided to redeploy his forces instead of carrying out President Thiệu's order straightaway, for several reasons. Firstly, he wanted to convince the President that most South Vietnamese units were still intact, and that they still had the time to recapture lost territories. And secondly, General Trưởng did not want to create confusion amongst his subordinates, when the military situation in I Corps was still under control.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{discovers that}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the mystery buyer of the pub, {{and she and}} Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in {{exchange}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 {{that was to be}} her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile.|$|E
5|$|Rodríguez Saá {{prepared}} a budget bill for 2002, which {{was sent to}} the Congress. It included an important decrease in the deficits, as requested by Anne Krueger from the International Monetary Fund. Krueger also requested a new coparticipation law, to determine the way the nation and the provinces manage tax revenues. Rodríguez Saá called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> governors in Chapadmalal, but only six governors out of twenty-three attended: Carlos Ruckauf, Juan Carlos Romero, Gildo Insfrán, Ángel Mazza, Carlos Rovira and Alicia Lemme. José Manuel de la Sota, governor of Córdoba, withdrew his support, suspecting that Rodríguez Saá had plans to cancel the elections and stay as president up to 2003. On December 30, he returned to San Luis with Daniel Scioli and resigned, alleging lack of support {{from the rest of the}} Justicialist Party. Insfrán, Maza and minister Rodolfo Gabrielli tried to convince him to stay as president; his brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá supported his decision. In announcing his resignation in a Cadena nacional, he recounted the achievements of his one-week administration and accused Justicialist governors and legislators of meanness and shortsightedness. He dispatched his resignation from San Luis to Buenos Aires, and the Congress accepted it on January 1, 2002. The Senate chairman Ramón Puerta would have been the interim president, but resigned as well, so Eduardo Camaño, president of the Chamber of Deputies, was appointed interim president instead. After new deliberations, they elected Eduardo Duhalde as president, this time with a mandate that would fill the remaining time of delaRúa's mandate.|$|E
