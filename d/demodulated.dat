500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then <b>demodulated</b> and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E

The filtered error voltage which controls the VCO and maintains lock with the input signal is <b>demodulated</b> FM output.

[...] These AVT modes differ radically from the other modes mentioned above, in that they are synchronous, that is, they have no per-line horizontal synchronization pulse but instead use the standard VIS vertical signal to identify the mode, followed by a frame-leading digital pulse train which pre-aligns the frame timing by counting first one way and then the other, allowing the pulse train to be locked in time at any single point out of 32 where it can be resolved or <b>demodulated</b> successfully, after which they send the actual image data, in a fully synchronous and typically interlaced mode.|$|E

50|$|An {{envelope}} detector {{can be used}} to <b>demodulate</b> a previously modulated signal by removing all high frequency components of the signal. The capacitor and resistor form a low-pass filter to filter out the carrier frequency. Such a device is often used to <b>demodulate</b> AM radio signals because the envelope of the modulated signal is equivalent to the baseband signal.|$|R
2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be <b>demodulated</b> by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of a Sirius {{receiver}} is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the Baseband Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, <b>demodulated,</b> error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a [...] "pause" [...] feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the head unit, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{series of}} {{approaches}} {{was designed and}} patented by Leonard R. Kahn. [...] The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed {{by the use of}} the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. [...] E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin [...] "phase"-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. [...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals. [...] Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be <b>demodulated</b> without distortion by an envelope detector such as a simple diode. [...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. [...] The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.|$|E
