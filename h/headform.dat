The objective {{of this study was}} to develop <b>headforms</b> representative of workers throughout the world for testing eye and face protective devices. MethodsThe 3 D scan data for 1169 U.

Measurements for 317 Japanese workers were also obtained from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan for comparison purposes. Fourteen existing <b>headforms</b> were compared to determine their representation of the world's working population. Included were five sizes to represent U. S. workers and five sizes for Chinese workers, two EN 168 sizes, and two Japanese <b>headforms.</b> ResultsThe largest head shape variation among the U. S. workers is between a small female head and a large male head. When comparing the average head for each dataset, the U. S. average is larger than the Chinese average except in the cheek areas. This is also true when comparing the U. S. average to the Japanese data. Comparisons revealed that the existing NIOSH small, medium and large <b>headforms</b> can cover the world population variation very well. The Chinese small, medium and large <b>headforms</b> can also represent Japanese workers. However, the ear positions for the NIOSH and Chinese <b>headforms</b> were not representative of the population data.

40|$|Evaluating {{performance}} of occupant retention countermeasures {{at the side}} windows through full-scale crash tests are typically expensive and yield inconclusive results. The results are inconclusive due to the non-repeatable nature of this testing. Another approach utilizes guided impact testing that propels an attached <b>headform</b> into a window to evaluate performances of these safety systems. This may provide some procedural value in generating repeatable results with limited objectives. The capability to limit the guided impact <b>headform</b> displacement relative to a vehicle's exterior window plane is assumed to represent reduced risk of occupant ejection. However, {{it is not known}} what ejection risk is represented for a given <b>headform</b> excursion. This study characterized <b>headform</b> excursions in guided impact testing for a given window airbag design with a range of restraint capabilities. Not surprising, disparities in the <b>headform</b> excursions were observed depending on the impact location of the impact on the airbag. System level evaluation of the airbag design in a rollover environment was conducted to determine which restraint capabilities represented a reduced risk of occupant ejection. A correlated computer model of NHTSA’s Dynamic Rollover Fixture (DRF) was used to identify the restraint characteristics for the airbags in which occupant ejection occurred as well as those where occupant retention was achieved in order to establish a relationship to <b>headform</b> excursion. However, the relationship for a given <b>headform</b> excursion to ejection risk was not apparent due to disparity in the <b>headform</b> excursion results. Review of simulations in the DRF showed that as the occupant interacted with the airbag, occupant moved from the region of the airbag where excursions were the lowest, towards the region of the airbag where <b>headform</b> excursion was greatest.

Objectives: To examine the impact energy attenuation performance of foam that could be incorporated into headgear and examine the performance of prototypes of modified headgear. Methods: Impact tests were conducted on polyethylene foams and protective headgear. Free fall drop tests with a rigid <b>headform</b> on to a flat rigid anvil were conducted. Resultant <b>headform</b> acceleration was measured. Means of the <b>headform</b> acceleration maxima for repeat tests were calculated. Results: Tests on polyethylene foam indicated that an increase in thickness from 10 mm to 16 mm would improve headgear performance. These modifications were incorporated in part into two headgear models: the Albion Headpro and the Canterbury brand Body Armour honeycomb headgear. The headgear tests show that significant reductions in <b>headform</b> acceleration were achieved by increasing the foam density and thickness. Mean <b>headform</b> acceleration maxima for the 16 mm thick modified rugby headgear was about 25 % of that of standard headgear for lateral impact 0. 3 and 0. 4 m drop heights and 27 % for the centre front 0. 3 m drop tests.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the <b>headform</b> impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the <b>headform</b> acceleration against the measured responses from <b>headform</b> impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} chest deflections. The chest contact locations on the front panel and the bonnet top were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The <b>headform</b> impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to pedestrian chest protection. In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff windshield frame. The acceleration of the <b>headform</b> was related to the rib deflections. The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the <b>headform</b> average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the bonnet top and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the bonnet top. Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the <b>headform</b> accelerations and rib deflections. In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the bonnet top at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The deflection of the ribs had an observable correlation with the <b>headform</b> accelerations measured in the <b>headform</b> impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The <b>headform</b> impactor test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the <b>headform</b> acceleration is an effective measure for pedestrian chest protection for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe current British Standard {{for head}} protectors for cricketers {{specifies}} a projectile test {{to ensure that}} a helmet can prevent the ball penetrating the peak-grille gap and deformation of the grille onto the face. For practical reasons, it is specified that the <b>headform</b> is mounted onto a grounded frame. This study aims to determine whether this “Fixed” mounting technique influences the response of the <b>headform</b> relative to a theoretically preferable “Free” suspension. A pressurised air cannon was used to project a “BOLA”TM ball at three nominal speeds (22, 25 and 28 m/s) and at three target impact locations (136 (Top), 108 (Middle) and 80 (Bottom) mm from the base). High speed video was used to identify the contact duration and accelerometer data were used to assess the peak resultant <b>headform</b> acceleration and velocity during this period. Generally, good agreement between the two scenarios was found in regard to peak resultant <b>headform</b> acceleration, particularly at the 25 and 28 m/s impact speeds. In terms of <b>headform</b> velocity, the two scenarios showed greater variation when the full contact duration was considered, with root mean square deviations ranging from 1. 77 – 5. 6 in all testing conditions. However, some portions of the impact were considerably more consistent than others. These initial results indicate that the result of the penetration test, as specified in BS 7928 : 2013, would be independent of the suspension technique particularly given the convergence of results at the specified standard velocity (28 m/s).

40|$|Pedestrian <b>headform</b> {{impact tests}} {{are used to}} assess the {{relative}} level of danger that a vehicle poses to the head of a struck pedestrian. The tests are conducted using a dummy <b>headform</b> that is launched at specific locations on the front of a stationary vehicle. The conditions of the test are specified in the relevant test protocol, and include the mass of the <b>headform,</b> the impact speed, and the impact angle. There are test protocols for vehicle design regulations and for new car assessment programs, each of which may specify different test conditions. Previous studies have not examined in detail the influence of the test conditions on the result of the test, as measured via the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). HIC is proportional to the duration and magnitude of the acceleration of the <b>headform</b> during the impact. In this thesis, a theoretical model of a linear spring is used to examine, in the simplest case, the influence that <b>headform</b> mass and impact speed have on HIC and peak dynamic displacement. These relationships were also studied empirically using real test data. The empirical effect of impact speed on HIC was found to be similar to that predicted by the linear spring model, and the influence of <b>headform</b> mass was found to be slightly weaker than what was predicted theoretically. An effect of <b>headform</b> diameter was also found in the test data. In summary: HIC was found to increase with impact speed, and was found to decrease with increasing <b>headform</b> mass and diameter. Increasing the impact speed, <b>headform</b> mass or diameter resulted in higher peak displacements, leading to a higher likelihood of contact with harder structures beneath the outer vehicle surface. These relationships were used to predict the compliance of sixty vehicles with the Global Technical Regulation on pedestrian safety, based on their results under the European New Car Assessment Program pedestrian testing protocol. The relationship between HIC and impact speed was also used to compare the performance of theoretical structures that meet different test criteria, across a published distribution of real crash speeds. An injury risk function for HIC was used to demonstrate how test performance at a single crash speed can be related to an overall real world injury risk. The results presented in this thesis show that HIC and peak displacement can be extrapolated or interpolated from a single test to apply to a wider range of test conditions. This methodology, in its simplest application, can be used to predict how a tested structure performs under different test protocols. A more complex application of this methodology might be a new method for assessing vehicle performance, based on its performance across the full range of conditions encountered in real world pedestrian crashes.

40|$|Internationally, {{there are}} two types of headforms used for impact {{attenuation}} testing of motorcycle helmets. These two types of test headforms follow specifications established by the International Standards Organization (ISO), or the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Both headforms are low resonance, rigid castings, but they differ in size, shape and weight. The headforms are supported by a rigid guide assembly that limits their motion to the vertical direction only. Different impact locations are obtained by adjustment of the <b>headform</b> on a spherical ball joint. Performance criteria are based on acceleration time history measurements from a uniaxial accelerometer located at the <b>headform</b> center of mass. A second variation on the IS 0 <b>headform</b> is found in some European helmet standards that utilize an unrestrained <b>headform</b> instrumented with a triaxial accelerometer.

Numerical integration from the saturation conditions then leads to the barotropic relation for the cavitating/fully-wetted flow, depending on the value of the pressure. Speed of sound curves for three different liquids are shown (water, LOX and LN 2), highlighting the influence of thermal effects at different temperatures.

The proposed modified bubbly isenthalpic cavitation model has been implemented in a 2 D numerical code in order to readily assess, by comparison with experimental results from the literature, its potential for the simulation of cavitating flows. Two types (hemispherical and 2 -caliber ogival) of axisymmetric <b>headforms</b> and a 2 D modified NACA 66 - 109 hydrofoil have been chosen for validation of the model against available data (Rouse & McNown, 1948; Shen & Dimotakis, 1989).

Good agreement of the model predictions with the available experimental data has been found in terms of pressure distribution, extension of the cavitation region and loads (forces and moments) on the hydrofoil. As expected, the results indicate that the stability of the numerical method is sensitive to the temperature of the flow and to the presence of recirculating regions in the flow. Convergence problems have been detected at high angles of attack and when approaching room temperature, {{as a consequence of the}} inherent unsteadiness of reverse flow regions and the extremely rapid changes of the flow density in the absence of significant thermal cavitation effects.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal, Proceedings of the IMechE Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology. The current British Standard for head protectors for cricketers has been recently revised to include a projectile-based battery of tests, the intention being {{to ensure that a}} certified helmet will also prevent contact of the ball or grille with the specified <b>headform</b> facial region. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterise the dynamic response of the <b>headform</b> to direct ballistic impacts for alternative <b>headform</b> mounting arrangements. On the one hand, and in accordance with the relevant sections of the Standard, what might be described as a “Constrained” set-up was evaluated while, on the other, an arrangement with significantly reduced stiffness, in line with that previously reported for the passive human neck, was subject to equivalent appraisal. For each mounting scenario, an air cannon was used to project a cricket training ball at three speeds toward the instrumented <b>headform</b> at three locations with five repeats per speed/location combination. High rate/resolution video and piezo-electric accelerometer data were collected and processed to determine the <b>headform</b> response. While differences between specific ball impact speed and location scenarios are set out in detail later in the article, overall observations are summarised as follows. From a ball-headform contact duration standpoint, video derived results showed ranges of 1. 30 – 1. 45 ms (Constrained) vs. 1. 26 – 1. 41 ms. Maximum ball deformations the timing of which enabling the event to be subdivided into “loading” and “unloading” phases, were found to be 82. 5 – 86. 2...|$|E
40|$|AbstractImpact {{attenuation}} {{performance of}} three different range of commercial bicycle helmet were investigated in lateral drop impact test in accordance to AS/NZS 2063 : 2008, Australian/New Zealand Standard for bicycle helmet using numerical simulation and and experimental impact test. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop a simulation model of drop impact test, which to be used in further investigations of user-centred design approach of bicycle helmet. Three commercial bicycle helmet models were used in this study. All helmets and J <b>headform</b> were scanned using Flexscan 3 D scanning equipment. Post-scan processing jobs of scanned geometry models such as helmet liner, shell and <b>headform</b> were conducted in Geomagic Studio 12. The experimental impact test is carried out using 2 -wire drop test facility in accordance to the AS/NZS 2063 : 2008, Australian Standard for bicycle helmet. A few samples were cut from the liner of each helmet to determine the density of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS). <b>Headform</b> peak linear acceleration, impact duration and impact speed of each helmet were measured and recorded from the drop test. The scanned geometry models were imported into Abaqus. A drop impact simulation was developed based on the density and impact speed data obtained from the physical test. Inner liner of bicycle helmet, made from Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), was modeled using crushable foam properties, while <b>headform</b> and anvil were modeled as rigid bodies. Peak linear accelerations and impact duration of the <b>headform</b> on each helmet at three different impact locations of helmet were recorded. A robust correlation study using peak linear acceleration score, impact duration score and Pearson correlation coefficient between the data from physical test and numerical model was conducted. Good correlation scores (> 80 %) were achieved between the numerical model and experimental impact test in terms of <b>headform</b> peak linear acceleration and impact duration score, suggesting that the simulation model is in good correlation with those from physical test...|$|E
40|$|Observations and {{measurements}} of head dimensions, helmet position, adjustment, and stability {{were made on}} 216 motorcyclists. Helmet details were recorded. Participants completed a questionnaire on helmet usability and their riding history. Helmet stability was assessed quasistatically. Results: Differences between the dimensions of ISO <b>headforms</b> and equivalent sized motorcyclists&# 039; heads were observed, especially head width. Almost all (94 %) of the helmets were labeled {{to be compliant with}} AS/NZS 1698 (2006). The majority of riders were satisfied with the comfort, fit, and usability aspects of their helmets. The majority of helmets were deemed to have been worn correctly. Using quasistatic pull tests, it was found that helmet type (open-face or full-face) and the wearing correctness were among factors that affected the loads at which helmets became displaced. The forces required to displace the helmet were low, around 25 N. Conclusions: The size of the in-use motorcycle helmets did not correspond well to the predicted size based on head dimensions, although motorcyclists were generally satisfied with comfort and fit. The in vivo stability tests appear to overpredict that helmets will come off in a crash, based on the measured forces, tangential forces measured in the oblique impact tests, and the actual rate of helmet ejection. Objectives: One of the main requirements of a protective helmet is to provide and maintain appropriate and adequate coverage to the head. A helmet that is poorly fitted or fastened may become displaced during normal use or even ejected during a crash...|$|R
40|$|Instrumented <b>headforms</b> are {{projected}} at cars {{to check that}} the vehicle is not overly injurious if a pedestrian is struck. We argue that {{there are at least}} two different aspects to performance: the impact severity in the test conditions (measured by HIC, the Head Injury Criterion), and the speed at which bottoming out occurs (this refers to the vehicle surface deforming sufficiently that the much more rigid structures underneath are contacted). It is desired to know performance over the wide range of real-life impact conditions, yet the number of tests to be conducted is limited. A procedure is proposed that estimates performance averaged over different speeds (and perhaps also averaged over effective head mass). There are three components: (a) an equation for the dependence of HIC on speed (and perhaps mass), which includes the effect of bottoming out as a sharp rise in severity beyond a certain level of impact energy, (b) an equation for how bad are different levels of HIC (the probability of some specific outcome, such as death or skull fracture, is likely to be used here), and (c) the probability distribution of impact speed (and perhaps mass). Other safety tests (such as impact testing of helmets) are plainly analogous, and similar considerations apply in the packaging and handling of manufactured items and agricultural produce: cushioning should be soft enough not to cause damage itself yet stiff enough to prevent bottoming out.

40|$|The chin bar of motorcycl e full - face helmets is {{the most}} likely region of the helmet to sustain impact s during {{accident}} s, with a large percentage of these impacts lead ing to basilar skull fracture. Currently, helmet chin bars are designed to mitigate the peak acceleration at the c entre o f g ravity of isolated <b>headforms,</b> as required by standards, but they are not designed to mitigate the neck force, which is probably the cau se of basilar skull fracture, a type of head injury that can lead to fatalities. Here we test whether it is possible to increase the protection of helmet chin bars while meeting standard requirements. Fibre - reinforced composite shells are commonly used in helmets due to their lightweight and energy absorption charac teristics. W e optimize the ply orientation of a chin bar made of fibre - reinforced composite layers for reduction of the neck force in a dummy model using a computational approach. We use the fini te element model of a human head/neck surrogate and measure the neck axial force, which {{has been shown to be}} correlated with the risk of basilar skull fracture. The results show t hat by varying the orientation of the chin bar plies, thus keeping the helmet mass constant, the neck axial force can be reduced by approximately 3 0 % while ensuring that the helmet complies with the impact attenuation requirements prescribed in helmet standards...|$|R
