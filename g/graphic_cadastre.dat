40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{graduation}} thesis is to show the positional accuracy of digital cadastral map of new land-cadastral measurement on the range part of cadastral municipality Leskovec. The <b>graphic</b> <b>cadastre</b> is still used in {{the main part of}} Slovenia and it was the basis for making the digital cadastral map in this dissertation. The graduation thesis will describe the new land- cadastral measurement, which is the basic way to renovate the land cadastre evidences. This is a planned, time determined and surveyor’s unique process and can be therefore conducted and organized as a project. The graduation thesis contains the survey of the positional accuracy of digital cadastral map before and after the new land-cadastral measurement...|$|E
40|$|Cadastral {{projects}} in Turkey have been accelerated {{in recent years}} by the involvement of the private sector. These projects aim at completing the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s cadastre, along with producing bases in standards that could be a foundation for Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (LRCIS). It is possible to produce cadastral data with todayÃ¢Â€Â™s technological means. In this context, three dimensional cadastre data can be properly produced, especially in digital cadastre projects with the required point accuracy. Nevertheless this is not enough for LRCIS. The cadastre bases that have been produced so far by different methods with different scales and bases, with or without coordinates, should also be converted into digital form based on National Basic GPS Network of Turkey (NBGN) in required point-location accuracy. As the result of evaluation of graphical cadastre bases produced without coordinates, actual land measurements, and information obtained from sheets and field book data together, it was found out that there are significant base problems in the graphical maps. These bases, comprising 20 % of TurkeyÃ¢Â€Â™s cadastre constitutes the most important bottleneck of completing the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s cadastre. In the scope of this paper, the possibilities of converting the field book measurement values of <b>graphic</b> <b>cadastre</b> bases into digital forms in national coordinate system by comparing them with actual land measurements are investigated, along with TurkeyÃ¢Â€Â™s Cadastre and its problems...|$|E
40|$|Methodology of {{measurement}} {{and content of}} <b>graphic</b> land <b>cadastre</b> in Slovenia is presented in my thesis that can significantly contribute to {{the interpretation of the}} data of location accuracy of <b>graphic</b> land <b>cadastre</b> as also content. In the thesis I present one of the first land cadastre plans in the area of today's Slovenia, blueprints of Franciscan and revised land cadastre and descriptive data of this land cadastre, including methods {{of measurement}}, accuracy of blueprints of graphic measurement and maintenance of land cadastre in specific periods. In the case of the cadastral community of Ivanjševci, results of analysis for content and changes of allotment borders and usage of land till today regarding the condition in revised cadastre in the discussed area. ...|$|R
