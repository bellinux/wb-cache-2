Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to measure the work functions of the TCO and a-Si 1 -xCx: H(p) layers and to allow direct calculations of the energy barriers at the interfaces.

To examine the possible contributions <b>of</b> <b>buffer</b> diffusion and buffer-channel proton transfer reactions to this phenomenon, the effects <b>of</b> <b>buffer</b> concentration on voltage-activated H+ currents were explored in voltage-clamped rat alveolar epithelial cells. Changes in the external buffer concentration ([B]o), evaluated using the whole-cell configuration, had only small effects on H+ currents (IH). Lowering [B]o from 100 to 1 mM did not alter the voltage-activation curve or reversal potential (Vrev) but reduced IH, typically by 10 - 30 %. Changes in internal buffer concentration ([B]i), examined in inside-out patches, usually altered IH more distinctly and subtly changed the kinetics. Overall, the effects <b>of</b> changing <b>buffer</b> concentration were small and subtle. The maximum attenuation of the single-channel H+ current at 1 mM buffer was estimated to be approximately 20 % at either mouth of the H+ channel.
