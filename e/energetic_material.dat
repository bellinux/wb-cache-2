6000|$|In {{studying}} {{that portion}} of the European movement which burst forth into flame in France between the fall of the Bastille and those fatal days of Vendémiaire, Fructidor, Floréal, Brumaire, in which the explosion came convulsively to its end, we seem to see a microcosm of the Byronic epos. The succession of moods is identical. Overthrow, rage, intense material energy, crime, profound melancholy, half-cynical dejection. The Revolution was the battle of Will against the social forces of a dozen centuries. Men thought that they had only to will the freedom and happiness of a world, and all nature and society would be plastic before their daring, as clay {{in the hands of the}} potter. They could only conceive of failure as another expression for inadequate will. Is not this one of the notes of Byron's Ode on the Fall of Bonaparte? 'L'audace, l'audace, et toujours l'audace.' If Danton could have read Byron, he would have felt as one in front of a magician's glass. Every passion and fit, from the bloody days of September down to the gloomy walks by the banks of the Aube, and the prison-cry that 'it were better to be a poor fisherman than to meddle with the governing of men,' would have found itself there. It is true that in Byron we miss the firmness of noble and generous hope. This makes him a more veritable embodiment of the Revolution than such a precursor as Rousseau, in whom were all the unclouded anticipations of a dawn, that opened to an obscured noon and a tempestuous night. Yet one knows not, in truth, how much of that violence of will and restless activity and resolute force was due less to confidence, than to the urgent necessity which every one of us has felt, at some season and under some influence, of filling up spiritual vacuity by <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> activity. Was this the secret of the mysterious charm that scenes of violent strife and bloodshed always had for Byron's imagination, as it was perhaps the secret of the black transformation of the social faith of '89 into the worship of the Conqueror of '99? Nowhere does Byron's genius show so much of its own incomparable fire and energy, nor move with such sympathetic firmness and amplitude of pinion, as in Lara, the Corsair, Harold, and other poems, where 'Red Battle stamps his foot,' and where ...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} intermolecular {{interactions}} occurs when an <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> responds to its surroundings. With a better grasp of these <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> contacts, improved performance on plastic-bonded explosives, superior swab materials for explosives detection, and novel insensitive munitions are possible. In order to further understand these interactions, the following relationships were researched: adhesion between energetic materials and polymer substrates; quantitative collection and detection of energetic materials on electrostatically charged swabs; and noncovalent derivative investigation between <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> pairs. ^ A number of explosives detectors rely on {{introduction of the}} analyte to the instrument via swabs. However, most swab materials are burdened by either poor sorption (pickup) or poor desorption (release). Therefore, finding a swab that can both easily sorb and desorb an explosive is highly desirable. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), while normally employing a sharp (~ 5 nm) tip for topographic and force measurements, {{can also be used}} to measure adhesion between a material and substrate surface. AFM force curve experiments were performed on eleven polymers with nine energetic materials, organic explosives, and energetic salts. Teflon was the least adhesive polymer to all energetic materials, while no distinct trend could be elucidated among the other polymers or energetics. ^ Rather than create a novel swab material for explosives detection, improving current commercial off the shelf (COTS) swabs would be a fast and cost-effective way to increase analyte detection on existing security instrumentation. For this reason, the viability of electrostatically charging COTS swabs was explored. COTS swabs were charged both triboelectrically and inductively, and charge degradation both in time and through changes in relative humidity was determined. For collection efficiency, transfer efficiency, and uncharged swab comparison, quantification of energetic materials on a triple quadrupole liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer was performed. Limits of quantification for trace amounts of <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> were typically in the single nanogram level. In addition to adsorption of <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> comparable to traditional uncharged swabs, electrostatically charged swabs can also adsorb material at standoff, introducing a new noncontact sampling method. ^ The synthesis of the next generation of explosives is increasingly difficult because available novel reagents and synthetic techniques are limited. <b>Energetic</b> <b>material</b> solvates have been known for nearly 65 years, but cocrystallization of an <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> and another solid has only been demonstrated in the last decade. Relying on noncovalent derivatives (NCDs), cocrystals can tailor explosive properties such as density and detonation velocity, potentially yielding a new <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> without novel molecule synthesis. The most common synthons for pharmaceutical cocrystallization involve carboxylic acid and amide functionalities, but the majority of common energetic materials are devoid of these groups. With the wealth of knowledge from pharmaceutical cocrystals, utilizing these groups could yield more effective screening for energetic cocrystal pairs.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the development of}} various printed metallic initiators. The purpose was to create an initiator that could easily be integrated with a printed <b>energetic</b> <b>material,</b> specifically, a liquid suspension of nanothermite. Printing the initiator allowed for precise control and easy manipulation of the geometry. Thus, the geometry could be custom made for various applications. ^ Bridge wire initiators were first investigated due to their presence in current initiation systems. A bridge wire is a thin wire that a high electrical current is sent through. The current causes the bridge wire to heat and can ignite an <b>energetic</b> <b>material,</b> if it reaches the material 2 ̆ 7 s critical ignition temperature. If the current heats the bridge wire faster than it can expand in response, the bridge wire will break and the resulting shock can ignite the <b>energetic</b> <b>material.</b> Bridge wires of various length were tested {{to determine how the}} length affects the breakage time. In addition, the bridge wires were tested under various voltages (between 7. 5 V and 13. 75 V). It was found that increasing the voltage decreased the break time. Finally, a nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-bismuth (III) oxide] was pipetted on to the bridge wires. Ignition of the <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> from the breaking of the wire was achieved, but it proved unreliable due to various factors including, but not limited to, print quality. ^ The bridge wires were subsequently tested {{as a part of a}} circuit with a wireless trigger. The bridge wires were able to break through the <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> at 15 V, but did not ignite the nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-copper (II) oxide]. This indicates that the bridge wire did not heat enough to ignite the nanothermite or that the shock produced from breaking the wire was not enough to ignite the material. Further investigation into the effect of the length of the bridge wire on ignition and the use of different nanothermites will be conducted in future work. ^ To explore alternative geometries, spark gap initiators of various sizes were also printed. A spark gap was created by printing two conducting electrodes close enough to each other to allow an electric spark to jump between them. The breakdown voltage for the spark gaps varied, but reliable spark over occurred under 5 kV and 50 μA. The ability to create a printed initiator integrated with printed <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> was also demonstrated. Printed nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-copper (II) oxide] was placed in the center of a spark gap, covering both electrodes. The spark gaps required a much higher voltage to achieve ignition of the <b>energetic</b> <b>material</b> than the bridge wires, but for the utilized geometry, they achieved a significantly higher reliability. For ignition, 5 kV proved sufficient but the current required was 75 μA. ^ Overall, the successful printing of metallic initiators was demonstrated.
