40|$|Increasing {{rates of}} {{infectious}} diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C, overdose deaths, and social concerns around injection drug use {{have resulted in the}} need to evaluate new initiatives for harm reduction in Canada. This study examined experts' views on the feasibility of, benefits of, and barriers to the establishment of safer <b>injection</b> <b>rooms</b> in Canada. The qualitative model involved interviews (N = 6) with a range of professionals in the area of addictions. Analysis of the data revealed that there is an urgent need for expanded and improved harm reduction strategies, that safer <b>injection</b> <b>rooms</b> could offer many benefits to Canadians, that several debates exist with regard to the policies and services related to safer <b>injection</b> <b>rooms,</b> and that safer <b>injection</b> <b>rooms,</b> as well as alternative initiatives, must be considered if Canada wishes to promote health among drug users and wider communities. The implications of the findings for social work and further research are discussed. Recommendations include expanded educational initiatives for professionals and the public, intensive research related to the specific Canadian context, and the establishment of a trial protocol...|$|R

40|$|Main {{findings}} National {{policies and}} context A temporary Act relating to <b>injection</b> <b>rooms</b> ap- plies until 16 December 2009. On 31 October 2008, a consultation proposal was distributed {{in which it}} is proposed to make the Act permanent. The proposal means that {{it will be up to}} the indi - vidual municipalities to establish <b>injection</b> <b>rooms</b> as part of their overall services. It is proposed to discontinue the state grants that were available as part-financing during the trial period. The Regu - lations that have been issued will largely be con - tinued in their present form in order to enable the measure to be defined as a health service. In October 2007, the Government presented an action plan to the Storting (Parliament) for the drugs and alcohol field. It includes goals and me - asures for prevention, treatment and rehabilita - tion and entails a gradual escalation of funding in this field in the period up until 2010. The plan includes alcohol and drugs policy as well as na - tional and international measures. The plan aims for a policy with a clear public health perspecti - ve. The aim is to raise professional standards through research and by strengthening compe - tence and quality. As regards services, the princi - ple is that the ordinary services should also be available to people with drug or alcohol pro - blems.

In 2000 the German narcotic law ("BtmG") was changed to allow for supervised drug <b>injection</b> <b>rooms.</b> In 2002, a pilot study was started in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of heroin-assisted treatment on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment.

Social workers providing counselling and referrals were also present. An <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> was not originally conceived, however, drug users began to use the facility for this purpose, and this soon became the most attractive aspect of the café.

In the summer of 2012, following the launch of private initiatives, a bill passed legalizing the drug <b>injection</b> <b>room.</b> This project examines {{the impact of the}} drug <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> and explains how it can be presented as an aid for addicts seeking recovery. In addition, the moral and political issues surrounding the drug <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> bill will be ad-dressed. Specifically, it will be discussed if drug <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> is in accordance with UN Narcotic Drug Conventions, whilst possible conflicts with regard to national narcotics legislation will be considered, in addition, the police and the health care staff assigned role will be discussed. Follow-ing this, a discussion will be held as to the justification of legislating with specific regard to a cer-tain societal group. In particular, legislating the right to posses and intake narcotics. This paper draws the conclusion – that regardless of complex grey areas – the drug injection room’s aim is to help a vulnerable group in society to obtain better conditions, and potentially move one step closer to receiving rehabilitative care...|$|E

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{urban renewal}} of Inner Vesterbro {{has resulted in}} replacement of the socioec- onomically disadvantaged segment of residents by a more socioeconomically advantaged one. The contrast between the new segment of residents and the drug addicts are big. This has created obvious conflicts, expressed in {{the debate about the}} location of the <b>injection</b> <b>room.</b> This project investigates how the new segment has placed the drug addicts in an ab- errant and stigmatized position, and how it has influenced the location of the <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> and the physical surroundings on Plads til Alle. The empirical knowledge of the project consists of observations carried out on Plads til Al- le. In addition there are two interviews with Rasmus Koberg and Henrik Gutzon Larsen. Also six letters to the editor, a summary of a public meeting and scientific research will be concluded in this project. Furthermore the project is based on five theories that can help shed light on the focus of the project. These theories includes Erving Goffman’s theory on stigmatization, Howard Becker’s theo- ry on deviation, Michael Pacione’s theory on segregation as well as Richard Sennett’s theo- ry that is dealing with the meeting of strangers in the city. Furthermore the term NIMBY is used to analyze the residents’ attitude to the location of the <b>injection</b> <b>room.</b> This study shows that the new segment of residents and the drug addicts use the urban space in different ways. The drug addicts use the public urban space {{in the same manner as}} the new segment of residents use their private homes.

40|$|National {{policies}} and context On 15 June 2009, the Norwegian parliament {{decided to make}} the temporary Act relating to injection rooms permanent. The <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> scheme will serve as a supplement in an overall chain of measures targeting those with major health problems who have difficulty quitting their drug use. Based on local needs, the individual municipalities can decide whether they wish to establish an <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> scheme. The legislative amendments with pertaining regulations enter into force on 17 December 2009. The Government’s action plan for the drugs and alcohol field was presented to the Storting in October 2007. It includes goals and measures for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation and entails a gradual escalation of funding in the period up until 2010. The Directorate of Health is responsible for implementing large parts of the drugs and alcohol policy. Moreover, it shall ensure that an overview of the drugs and alcohol situation is available at the regional and local level, and it will publish an annual status report. According to the Directorate of Health, 115 of the Action Plan’s 147 measures had been initiated at the end of 2008. Many of the measures are evaluated separately, and a comprehensive review of experience from the plan will be carried out. A total of 19 drugs and alcohol advisers have been appointed by the 18 county governor offices. They will contribute to the implementation of the Action Plan in the municipalities. A three year trial has started involving coordinating representatives in 30 selected municipalities. The aim of having such representatives is to help to ensure more coherent and individually-adapted services for people with drug or alcohol dependency, thus resulting in greater social inclusion and better life coping. In connection with the Directorate of Health’s grant schemes, great emphasis is placed on eva - luating the measures and earmarking funds for this purpose. The goal is to help to improve quality and to support knowledge-based strategies and measures by ensuring continuity and local support...|$|E
