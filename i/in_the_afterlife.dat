5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing {{the soul of the}} sovereign <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afterlife.</b> This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afterlife.</b> A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom until the end of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E

After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afterlife.</b> Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afterlife.</b> Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E

5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones.

Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afterlife.</b> Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E
5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue {{on the walls of}} the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid.

500|$|Kraemer, Cassidy, and Schwartz {{argued that}} [...] "Barge of the Dead" [...] {{mirrored}} the [...] episode [...] "Rightful Heir" [...] by not providing a clear answer whether Torres' experiences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Klingon <b>afterlife</b> were real {{or part of}} a hallucination. The Native American studies scholar Sierra S.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} resistances to debt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afterlives</b> {{of financial}} crisis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) {{in order to}} develop a novel account of democratic subjectivity for International Political Economy (IPE). The global financial crisis has transformed debt into a topic of heated public debate, giving rise to new social movements as well as individual political resistances. However, IPE scholars have yet to substantively conceptualise this new democratic politics of debt, despite considerable research on the problems of debt-based models of economic citizenship. I trace this blind spot to the pictures of agency animating the field, before developing a novel conceptual account of democratic subjectivity in finance based on an original application of Stanley Cavell’s ordinary language philosophy in IPE. I then use this account to show how ordinary democratic subjects of debt are opposing debt-based economic citizenship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK and the US. To this end, I offer a comparative examination of three prominent tactics of debt resistance: avoiding debt, auditing debt and refusing debt. My central argument is that although contemporary debt resistances are marked by conventional cultural-economic imaginaries of financial capability, transparency and liability, debt’s ‘ordinary democrats’ are reconstructing debt relations as a site of democratic selfhood, exchange and community in finance. In an era marked by an increasingly top-down, managerial politics of finance, I conclude, people’s resistances to debt represent important practices of civic freedom that improve the prospects for democratic financial governance.

Furthermore, the analytical part deals with the topics of personal attitudes towards death, the manner of dealing with it, images of <b>afterlife</b> and <b>the</b> ways of consolation. Using qualitative research methodology the thesis analyzes the research question of how particular evangelical pastors cope with the death of a youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the doctrine.

5|$|Literature {{also served}} {{religious}} purposes. Beginning with the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, {{and later on}} coffins, and papyri placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife. This included the use of magical spells, incantations, and lyrical hymns. Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afterlife</b> by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales. See also Egyptian influences in the Hebrew Bible.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the challenge that}} neo-Victorian versions of Oscar Wilde's 'voice' pose {{to the relationship between}} original and copy. I argue that the concept of voice complicates Jean Baudrillard's assessment of the loss of <b>the</b> original <b>in</b> postmodern culture, as voice can be conceptualised as always already absent; voices can be understood as continuous processes of reconstruction. Establishing the significance of voice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>afterlife</b> of Oscar Wilde, I focus on Peter Ackroyd's The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde (1983) and Will Self's Dorian: An Imitation (2002) to demonstrate that neo-Victorian copies of Wilde's original voice engage with the tension between loss and recreation which often remains unquestioned in neo-Victorian criticism's invocation of the concept of voice...|$|R
