500|$|In March 2007, Bryan Killian, a {{high school}} student in Buncombe County, North Carolina, was {{suspended}} for wearing [...] "pirate regalia" [...] which he said was part of his Pastafarian faith. Killian protested the suspension, saying it violated his First Amendment rights to religious freedom and freedom of expression. [...] "If this is what I believe in, no matter how stupid it might sound, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to express myself however I want to", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Dench {{has been}} {{critical}} of prejudice in the movie industry against older actresses. She stated in 2014, [...] "I'm tired of being told I'm too old to try something. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to decide for myself if I can't do things and not have someone tell me I'll forget my lines or I'll trip and fall on the set"; and [...] "Age is a number. It's something imposed on you ... It drives me absolutely spare when people say, 'Are you going to retire? Isn't it time you put your feet up?' Or tell me [...] age." ...|$|E
2500|$|As I chose on all {{occasions}} {{to appear as}} a Christian, I was told by some of them , that I {{was the only person}} they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe Christianity. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, I thought <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [...] of Christianity.|$|E

6000|$|... 292. But in this work, {{as in all}} other, I had my temptations {{attending}} me, {{and that}} of divers kinds; as sometimes <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> assaulted with great discouragement therein, fearing that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to speak a word at all to edification; nay, that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to speak sense unto the people; at which times <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have such a strange faintness and strengthlessness seize upon my body, that my legs have scarce <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to carry me {{to the place of}} exercise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't {{think of}} it," [...] he begged. [...] "It would {{completely}} upset me. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to do another}} stroke of work." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with MMA Junkie.com Davis confirmed he would drop to the Lightweight division for his next UFC appearance and said he made the decision after the realization that his frame is better suited for 155 pounds. Davis also confirmed that he was contemplating retirement stating [...] "I'm going to finish out my career at 155 and try to entertain some people along the way before my old ass retires," [...] Davis also stated [...] "That's where I'm normally and naturally going to be, so that's where I'm going to fight right now," [...] {{he said of the}} 155-pound lightweight division. [...] "It does make more sense that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to compete better at that weight {{for the fact that the}} weight difference isn't going to be so dramatic." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....Saadut Ali {{unexpectedly}} died. I found, however, {{that what}} had been provisionally agitated with him was perfectly understood by his successor, so that the latter came forward with a spontaneous offer of a crore of rupees, which I declined as a peishcush or tribute on his accession to the sovereignty of Oude, but accepted as a loan for the Honourable Company. Eight lacs were afterwards added to this sum, in order that {{the interest of the}} whole, at six per cent, might equal the allowances to different branches of the Nawab Vizier's family, for which guarantee of the British Government had been pledged, and the payment of which, without vexatious retardments, was secured, by the appropriation of the interest to the specific purpose. The sum thus obtained was thrown into the general treasury, whence I looked to draw such portions of it as the demands of the approaching service might require. My surprise is not to be expressed, when I was shortly after informed from Calcutta, that it had been deemed expedient to employ fifty four lacs of the sum obtained by me in discharging an eight per cent loan, that the remainder was indispensable for current purposes, and it was hoped <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to procure from the Nawab Vizier a further aid for the objects of the war. This took place early in autumn, and operations against Nepaul could not commence till the middle of November, on which account the Council did not apprehend my being subjected to any sudden inconvenience through its disposal of the first sum. Luckily I was upon such frank terms with the Nawab Vizier, as that I could explain to him fairly my circumstances. He agreed to furnish another crore; so that the Honourable Company was accommodated with above two millions and a half sterling on my simple receipt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--existence!" [...] the Prince vaguely commented. [...] "You think I {{ought to}} argue for more than mere existence?" [...] she asked. [...] "I don't see why MY existence--even reduced {{as much as you}} like to being merely mine--should be so impossible. There are things, of sorts, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to have--things <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to be. The {{position}} of a single woman to-day is very favourable, you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{they are}} good weapons, sheik, and I wish I had one of them here, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do much with your guns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{sounds very}} interesting," [...] she {{answered}} coolly. [...] "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> better <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to understand its}} significance if you would explain to me who Mr. Montague Hill is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>should.</b> Mightn't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to prove}} it to a pack of lawyers. But I'm certain I'd know. I'd feel it in my {{fingertips}} if he came near me." ...|$|R

60|$|GERALD. [Laughing.] I might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to learn}} how to tie a tie, Lord Illingworth, but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to talk as you do. I don't know how to talk.|$|R
6000|$|... "So far, madam, {{it has not}} {{disagreed}} with me," [...] he said; [...] "and even did it do so <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to leave it, as I have orders to remain here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... ‘Good heaven, man, don’t repeat {{my words}} like a parrot!’ I cried. ‘Tell {{me what the}} man was like: it is of the first {{importance}} that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to recognise him.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then set out at once, {{and bring}} {{one of the}} horses back with you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to ride four miles, or even twice that distance, since it is to save my life." ...|$|E
