40|$|CHClF 2 (CFC- 22) is a {{promising}} substitute for atmospheric ozone damaging, <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Atmospheric CFC- 22 measurements derived from ground-based solar spectra recorded between December 1980 and May 1988 are reported which {{show that the}} CFC- 22 total column increased at an average annual exponential rate of 7. 8 percent + or - 1. 0 percent (2 sigma). Compared with other atmospheric data, these measurements indicate that CFC- 22 is increasing at a more rapid rate than either CFC- 11 or CFC- 12, the two most abundant chlorofluorocarbons, but {{that the rate of}} CFC- 22 increase is likely to have declined over the past few years...|$|R
25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are <b>fully</b> <b>halogenated</b> {{paraffin}} <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{that contain}} only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivative of methane, ethane, and propane. They are also commonly {{known by the}} DuPont brand name Freon. The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs {{have been widely used}} as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.|$|R

40|$|The indoor {{environment}} has frequently been ignored {{as a significant}} source of exposure to air pollutants. To date {{there are a number of}} documented examples of levels of indoor air pollutants greatly exceeding those levels which commonly occur in the outdoor environment. Among these instances are airborne buildup of polynuclear aromatics and cadmium from cigarette smoke, lead from burning candles, and vinyl chloride from use of aerosols containing this substance as a propellant. These examples suggest that there may be additional sources of indoor air pollutants, particularly <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from aerosol products, which have heretofore not been generally recognized as important. The present paper endeavors to review those instances where <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the indoor air environment may build up to concentrations of potential public health concern. These considerations may be especially relevant in future years as increasing efforts are being made to insulate buildings more efficiently as a means to conserve energy. The available data strongly suggest that <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are an important class of air pollutants in the {{indoor environment}} and that their presence in the outdoor environment should also be carefully examined.
