CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response</b> through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1.

Cytokines, immune proteins which promote an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response,</b> are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of white blood cells in the semen.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response.</b> This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Endothelial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> {{mediated}} by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR 2 and TLR 4, {{play an important}} role in atherogenesis. While Type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) promotes the development and progression of atherosclerosis, the effect of T 1 D on TLR 2 / 4 -mediated <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> in coronary artery endothelial cells (CAECs) remains unclear. Methods We tested the hypothesis that diabetic CAECs have enhanced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to TLR 2 / 4 stimulation. Non-diabetic and diabetic CAECs were treated with TLR 2 agonist peptidoglycan and TLR 4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. The expression of ICAM- 1, IL- 6 and IL- 8 were analyzed by real-time PCR, immunoblotting and ELISA, and NF-κB activation by immunoblotting and immunostaining. In additional experiments, insulin was added before TLR stimulation to determine whether insulin deficiency alone is responsible for the alteration of TLR 2 / 4 -mediated <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses.</b> Results Stimulation of TLR 2 or TLR 4 induced NF-κB activation, and the expression of ICAM- 1, IL- 6 and IL- 8. Interestingly, the expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly enhanced in diabetic cells. The enhanced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> correlated with augmented NF-κB activation in the absence of a change in TLR 2 or TLR 4 protein levels. Further, pretreatment of diabetic cells with insulin failed to suppress the enhanced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses.</b> Conclusions Diabetic CAECs have enhanced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to stimulation of TLR 2 or TLR 4, and insulin alone is insufficient to correct the hyper-inflammatory responses. The mechanism underlying the enhanced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> appears to be augmentation of pro-inflammatory signaling, rather than up-regulation of levels of TLR 2 and TLR 4. These findings suggest that diabetic CAECs adopt a hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that this endothelial phenotypic change may predispose coronary artery to atherogenesis. </p...|$|R

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response</b> in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response</b> syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response</b> to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} with colorectal cancer (CRC), local and systemic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> have been extensively reported {{to associate with}} cancer survival. However, the specific signalling pathways responsible for <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> are not clear. The PTEN/Akt pathway is a plausible candidate as it {{may play a role}} in mediating inflammation via COX- 2, and has been associated with cancer progression. This study therefore examined the relationship between tumour PTEN/Akt/COX- 2 expression, <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> and survival in CRC patients using a tissue microarray. In 201 CRC patients, activation of tumour-specific PTEN/Akt significantly associated with poorer CSS (12. 0 yrs v 7. 3 yrs, P= 0. 032), poorer differentiation (P= 0. 032), venous invasion (P= 0. 008) and peritoneal involvement (P= 0. 004). Patients were stratified for peri-nuclear expression of COX- 2 to examine associations with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses.</b> In {{patients with}} absent peri-nuclear COX- 2 expression, activation of tumour-specific PTEN/Akt significantly associated with poorer CSS (11. 9 yrs v 5. 4 yrs, P= 0. 001), poorer differentiation (P= 0. 018), venous invasion (P= 0. 003) and peritoneal involvement (P= 0. 001). However, no associations were seen with either the local or systemic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses.</b> In CRC patients, tumour-specific PTEN/Akt pathway activation was significantly associated with poorer CSS, particularly when peri-nuclear COX- 2 expression was absent. However, activation of the PTEN/Akt pathway appears not to be responsible for the regulation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R

5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response</b> producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response</b> that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that activation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> {{in a variety}} of tissues is mediated co-operatively by the actions of more than one cell type. In particular, the monocyte has been implicated as a potentially important cell in the initiation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to Toll-like receptor (TLR) -activating signals. To determine the potential for monocyte-regulated activation of tissue cells to underpin <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> in the vasculature, we established cocultures of primary human endothelial cells and monocytes and dissected the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> of these systems following activation with TLR agonists. We observed that effective activation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> required bidirectional signalling between the monocyte and the tissue cell. Activation of cocultures was dependent on interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). Although monocyte-mediated IL- 1 β production was crucial to the activation of cocultures, TLR specificity to these responses was also provided by the endothelial cells, which served to regulate the signalling of the monocytes. TLR 4 -induced IL- 1 β production by monocytes was increased by TLR 4 -dependent endothelial activation in coculture, and was associated with increased monocyte CD 14 expression. Activation of this inflammatory network also supported the potential for downstream monocyte-dependent T helper type 17 activation. These data define co-operative networks regulating <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to TLR agonists, identify points amenable to targeting for the amelioration of vascular inflammation, and offer the potential to modify atherosclerotic plaque instability after a severe infection...|$|R

It can modulate blood flow, adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium and the activity of numerous enzymes, all of which can have an impact on <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses.</b> In recent years, NO-releasing drugs have been developed, usually as derivatives of other drugs, which exhibit very powerful anti-inflammatory effects...|$|R
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response</b> is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local <b>inflammatory</b> <b>response.</b> In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E

40|$|Marginal zone (MZ) B cells {{produce a}} {{first wave of}} {{antibodies}} for protection from blood-borne pathogens. However, the role of MZ B cells in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> has not been elucidated. Here we show that MZ B cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and exacerbate systemic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After intravenous injection of LPS or E. coli, mice deficient in MZ B cells or IL- 6 only in MZ B cells have attenuated systemic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> and prolonged survival compared with wild-type mice. LPS directly stimulates MZ B cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and MyD 88 pathways for IL- 6 production. Furthermore, TLR 4 requires physical and functional association with Fcα/μR (CD 351) for its oligomer formation, NF-κB signalling and IL- 6 production from MZ B cells; this association is responsible for systemic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> and endotoxic shock.

40|$|SummaryMicroglia and astrocytes play {{essential}} {{roles in}} the maintenance of homeostasis within the central nervous system, but mechanisms that control the magnitude and duration of responses to infection and injury remain poorly understood.
