40|$|AbstractThe 2 -terminal one-to-any problem, which {{arises in}} the design of layout systems, is the problem of {{assigning}} wach one of n terminals positioned on the upper row of a channel (called entry terminals) to one of m terminals positioned on the lower row (called <b>exit</b> <b>terminals)</b> so that the resulting channel routing problem has minimum density. An optimal solution to this problem is known [1]. In this paper we consider a natural generalization, the 2 -color one-to-any problem, in which we have two types of entry terminals, red and blue ones, and <b>exit</b> <b>terminals</b> can be assigned to either type of entry terminal. Red and blue nets created by our algorithm are allowed to run {{on top of each other}} in the routing, and the density is defined as the larger of the red density and the blue density. Its minimization is an interesting combinatorial problem. We show how to compute the best achievable density in O(n + m) time, and an assignment achieving this density in O((n + m) log(n + m)) time...|$|R

While some circuits act to reduce this noise, others appear to exploit it. A striking example is the competence circuit in Bacillus subtilis, which exhibits much larger noise in the duration of its competence events than a synthetically constructed analog that performs the same function. Here, using stochastic modeling and fluorescence microscopy, we show that this larger noise allows cells to <b>exit</b> <b>terminal</b> phenotypic states, which expands the range of stress levels to which cells are responsive and leads to phenotypic heterogeneity at the population level. This is an important example of how noise confers a functional benefit in a genetic decision-making circuit...|$|E

Problems {{that occur in the}} terminal are because there was no separation between the arrival and departure areas causing the queues of vehicles and internal circulation is not smooth. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the condition of existing terminal based on facilities and performance terminal, the terminal optimization plan, determine alternative location and layout plan of the new terminal and its internal and external circulation terminals, pavement structure inside the terminal, and the budget planning. The method used in this study is to evaluate the condition of the existing terminal, optimizing the existing terminal, and planning a new terminal if the optimization is not possible. The primary data used were technical data and data rate of arrival and departure of vehicles. Primary data are obtained by conducting direct surveys to observe the arrival and departure times at each service line. The results of the evaluation of the existing terminal indicate that the terminal is not feasible as terminal type B both in terms of facilities and the performance of the terminal. It is evident from the facility for the arrival and departure areas are not separate. Waiting place for passengers is also very limited and becomes one with the arrival and departure areas. Besides, the availability of terminal area covering 5829 m 2 is very less compared to the standard type B terminal area that has been set by the Department of Transportation, which is area of 3, 5 ha. If viewed from service lines performance, there are several lines of service that has the traffic intensity values greater than 1. From the optimization results also showed that with adding lines of service plans are obtained for the traffic intensity value of 1, 11. The possible solutions is by planning a new terminal as a replacement existing terminal.

40|$|During animal development, organ size is {{determined}} {{primarily by the}} amount of cell proliferation, which must be tightly regulated to ensure the generation of properly proportioned organs. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular pathways that direct cells to stop proliferating when an organ has attained its proper size. We have identified mutations in a novel gene, shar-pei, that is required for proper termination of cell proliferation during Drosophila imaginal disc development. Clones of shar-pei mutant cells in imaginal discs produce enlarged tissues containing more cells of normal size. We show that this phenotype is the result of both increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Hence, shar-pei restricts cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis. By contrast, shar-pei is not required for cell differentiation and pattern formation of adult tissue. Shar-pei is also not required for cell cycle <b>exit</b> during <b>terminal</b> differentiation, indicating that the mechanisms directing cell proliferation arrest during organ growth are distinct from those directing cell cycle <b>exit</b> during <b>terminal</b> differentiation. shar-pei encodes a WW-domain-containing protein that has homologs in worms, mice and humans, suggesting that mechanisms of organ growth control are evolutionarily conserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{role and}} {{molecular}} mechanisms {{of a new}} Hippo signalling pathway are not fully understood in mammals. Here, we generated mice that lack WW 45 and revealed a crucial role for WW 45 in cell-cycle <b>exit</b> and epithelial <b>terminal</b> differentiation. Many organs in the mutant mouse embryos displayed hyperplasia accompanied by defects in terminal differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells owing to impaired proliferation arrest rather than intrinsic acceleration of proliferation during differentiation. Importantly, the MST 1 signalling pathway is specifically activated in differentiating epithelial cells. Moreover, WW 45 is required for MST 1 activation and translocation to the nucleus for subsequent LATS 1 / 2 activation upon differentiation signal. LATS 1 / 2 phosphorylates YAP, which, in turn, translocates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell-cycle <b>exit</b> and <b>terminal</b> differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells. Collectively, these data provide compelling evidence that WW 45 is a key mediator of MST 1 signalling in the coordinate coupling of proliferation arrest with terminal differentiation for proper epithelial tissue development in mammals...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBased on past studies, <b>exit</b> ramp <b>terminals</b> are {{the common}} {{locations}} for drivers {{to enter a}} physically separated highway in the wrong direction. Currently, many drivers, especially nonlocal drivers, often rely on voice-guided navigation apps and Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to navigate their routes on and off freeways. A few studies have reported that GPS devices sometimes give drivers wrong information and cause wrong-way entry into a freeway, especially at some confusing interchanges, such as partial cloverleaf and compressed diamond interchanges. The access points located close to exit ramps may also cause a problem for GPS devices in sending accurate voice-guidance. It is unknown if current GPS devices are capable of properly informing drivers regarding turning movements in advance of <b>exit</b> ramp <b>terminals</b> at some common interchanges. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the most commonly used GPS devices/navigation apps to identify existing problems and their potential for reducing wrong-way driving (WWD) incidents at interchange terminals. Field experiments were conducted at 10 common freeway interchanges or interchanges with nearby access driveways in the state of Alabama. Results show that most GPS devices have difficulty in providing correct guidance when the spacing between an access point and an exit ramp is less than 300 feet. Our comparison of five different GPS devices used on the same routes reveals that navigation apps have more limitations in guiding drivers than stand-alone GPS devices. Recommendations are offered to help GPS mapping companies improve their devices or add new features to reduce the occurrence of WWD...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDefining the {{molecular}} mechanisms that coordinately regulate proliferation and differentiation {{is a central}} issue in development. Here, we describe a mechanism in which induction of the Ets repressor METS/PE 1 links terminal differentiation to cell cycle arrest. Using macrophages as a model, we provide evidence that METS/PE 1 blocks Ras-dependent proliferation without inhibiting Ras-dependent expression of cell type-specific genes by selectively replacing Ets activators on the promoters of cell cycle control genes. Antiproliferative effects of METS require its interaction with DP 103, a DEAD box-containing protein that assembles a novel corepressor complex. Functional interactions between the METS/DP 103 complex and E 2 F/ pRB family proteins are also necessary for inhibition of cellular proliferation, suggesting a combinatorial code that directs permanent cell cycle <b>exit</b> during <b>terminal</b> differentiation...|$|R

Validation with additional field data showed that the models developed in this research can be used to predict frontage road operations under the conditions in which the models were validated.

40|$|The precise {{regulation}} of numbers {{and types of}} neurons through control of cell cycle <b>exit</b> and <b>terminal</b> differentiation is an essential aspect of neurogenesis. The Hippo signaling pathway has recently been identified as playing {{a crucial role in}} promoting cell cycle <b>exit</b> and <b>terminal</b> differentiation in multiple types of stem cells, including in retinal progenitor cells. When Hippo signaling is activated, the core Mst 1 / 2 kinases activate the Lats 1 / 2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit the transcriptional cofactor Yap. During mouse retinogenesis, overexpression of Yap prolongs progenitor cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of Yap decreases this proliferation and promotes retinal cell differentiation. However, to date, it remains unknown how the Hippo pathway affects the differentiation of distinct neuronal cell types such as photoreceptor cells. In this study, we investigated whether Hippo signaling regulates retinogenesis during early zebrafish development. Knockdown of zebrafish mst 2 induced early embryonic defects, including altered retinal pigmentation and morphogenesis. Similar abnormal retinal phenotypes were observed in zebrafish embryos injected with a constitutively active form of yap [(yap (5 SA) ]. Loss of Yap's TEAD-binding domain, two WW domains, or transcription activation domain attenuated the retinal abnormalities induced by yap (5 SA), indicating that all of these domains contribute to normal retinal development. Remarkably, yap (5 SA) -expressing zebrafish embryos displayed decreased expression of transcription factors such as otx 5 and crx, which orchestrate photoreceptor cell differentiation by activating the expression of rhodopsin and other photoreceptor cell genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Rx 1 is a novel interacting partner of Yap that regulates photoreceptor cell differentiation. Our results suggest that Yap suppresses the differentiation of photoreceptor cells from retinal progenitor cells by repressing Rx 1 -mediated transactivation of photoreceptor cell genes during zebrafish retinogenesis...|$|R

In the turbulent airflow analysis the air root mean square. the air turbulence intensity, and the air velocity fluctuations,frequencies are calculated, while in the mean airflow analysis the mean air velocity and temperature, the human body skin temperature, and the thermal comfort indexes are evaluated using a multi-node thermal regulation model for two different airflow rates. In the experimental tests made in a wood chamber a manikin, a ventilated desk, and two interior climate analyzers are used. The fluctuations of air velocity and temperature are measured in the air terminal devices and in 15 human body sections around the manikin, while the mean value of air relative humidity and mean radiant temperature are evaluated inside the experimental chamber. The mean air temperature in the air terminal devices is around 28 degrees C (82. 4 degrees F), while the mean radiant temperature in the occupation area, the mean air temperature far from the occupation area, and the internal mean air relative humidity in the occupation area are around 28 degrees C (82. 4 degrees F), 28 degrees C (82. 4 degrees F), and 50 %, respectively.
