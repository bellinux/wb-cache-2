25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Edward Haltom was {{studying}} monorail systems. Haltom {{noticed that the}} time to start and stop a conventional large monorail train, {{like those of the}} Wuppertal Schwebebahn, meant that a single line could only support between 20 and 40 vehicles an hour. In order to get reasonable passenger movements on such a system, the trains had to be large enough to carry hundreds of passengers (see headway for a <b>general</b> <b>discussion).</b> This, in turn, demanded large guideways that could support the weight of these large vehicles, driving up capital costs {{to the point where he}} considered them unattractive.|$|E

500|$|Strictly speaking, both {{actinium}} and lawrencium {{have been}} labeled as group 3 elements, but both elements are often included in any <b>general</b> <b>discussion</b> of {{the chemistry of}} the actinide elements. Actinium is the more often omitted of the two, because its placement as a group 3 element is somewhat more common in texts and for semantic reasons: since [...] "actinide" [...] means [...] "like actinium", {{it has been argued}} that actinium cannot logically be an actinide, even though IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage.|$|E

[...] Eastman also rescues Hazlitt's political commentary, which, however abrasive it might be, [...] "opens such questions" [...] for <b>general</b> <b>discussion,</b> [...] "so that {{the politics of the}} plays enters into the arena of interpretation in a new and dignified way." ...|$|E
