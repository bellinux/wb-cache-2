In Norway between 1988 and 1990, the incidence was 563.3 cases per 100,000 for chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis and 5 cases per 100,000 for that induced by <b>enteric</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In 1978 in Finland, the annual incidence was found to be 5835.7 per 100,000.|$|E
25|$|A bout of food {{poisoning}} or a gastrointestinal infection may also precede the disease (the last four genera of bacteria mentioned above are <b>enteric</b> <b>bacteria).</b> Shigella {{is the most}} common organism causing reactive arthritis following diarrhea.

25|$|Bacterial {{infection}} of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, acute hepatitis, or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease. Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve <b>enteric</b> <b>bacteria</b> such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time. Acute hepatitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bartonella henselae, Borrelia burgdorferi, salmonella species, brucella species and campylobacter species. Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, Tropheryma whipplei, Treponema pallidum, Coxiella burnetii, and rickettsia species.|$|E

25|$|In a {{hydrogen}} breath test, {{the most accurate}} lactose intolerance test, after an overnight fast, 25 grams of lactose (in a solution with water) are swallowed. If the lactose cannot be digested, <b>enteric</b> <b>bacteria</b> metabolize it and produce hydrogen, which, along with methane, if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical gas chromatograph or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2.5 hours to complete. If the hydrogen levels in the patient's breath are high, they may have lactose intolerance. This test is not usually done on babies and very young children, because it can cause severe diarrhea.|$|E

30|$|Vitamin B 12 is a {{cofactor}} of the glycerol dehydratase (Martens et al., 2002), which converts glycerol to 3 -hyrdoxypropionaldehyde (3 HPA), {{a precursor}} of 3 HP-CoA (Wang et al., 2013), to produce 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 PD).

40|$|Bacteria possess {{multiple}} {{mechanisms to}} survive exposure to various chemical stresses and antimicrobial compounds. In the <b>enteric</b> <b>bacterium</b> Escherichia coli, three homologous transcription factors—MarA, SoxS, and Rob—play {{a central role}} in coor-dinating this response. Three separate systems are known to regulate the expression and activities of MarA, SoxS, and Rob. How-ever, {{a number of studies have}} shown that the three do not function in isolation but rather are coregulated through transcrip-tional cross talk. In this work, we systematically investigated the extent of transcriptional cross talk in the mar-sox-rob regulon. While the three transcription factors were found to have the potential to regulate each other’s expression when ectopically ex-pressed, the only significant interactions observed under physiological conditions were between mar and rob systems. MarA, SoxS, and Rob all activate the marRAB promoter, more so when they are induced by their respective inducers: salicylate, para-quat, and decanoate. None of the three proteins affects the soxS promoter, though unexpectedly, it was mildly repressed by de-canoate by an unknown mechanism. SoxS is the only one of the three proteins to repress the rob promoter. Surprisingly, salicy-late somewhat activates transcription of rob, while decanoate represses it a bit. Rob, in turn, activates not only its downstream promoters in response to salicylate but also the marRAB promoter. These results demonstrate that the mar and rob systems function together in response to salicylate. The <b>enteric</b> <b>bacterium</b> Escherichia coli can resist a broad spec-trum of antimicrobial compounds by altering its metabolism and physiology (2, 26, 27, 56).

40|$|The small average cell size of in situ bacterioplankton, {{relative}} to cultured cells, {{has been suggested}} {{to be at least}} partly a result of selection of larger-sized cells by bacterivorous protozoa. In this study, we determined the relative rates of uptake of fluorescence-labeled bacteria (FLB), of various cell sizes and cell types, by natural assemblages of flagellates and ciliates in estuarine water. Calculated clearance rates of bacterivorous flagellates had a highly significant, positive relationship with size of FLB, over a range of average biovolume of FLB of 0. 03 to 0. 08 microns 3. Bacterial cell type or cell shape per se did not appear to affect flagellate clearance rates. The dominant size classes of flagellates which ingested all types of FLB were 3 - to 4 -microns cells. Ciliates also showed a general preference for larger-sized bacteria. However, ciliates ingested a gram-positive <b>enteric</b> <b>bacterium</b> and a marine bacterial isolate at higher rates than they did a similarly sized, gram-negative <b>enteric</b> <b>bacterium</b> or natural bacterioplankton, respectively. From the results of an experiment designed to test whether the addition of a preferentially grazed bacterial strain stimulated clearance rates of natural bacterioplankton FLB by the ciliates, we hypothesized that measured differences in rates of FLB uptake were due instead to differences in effective retention of bacteria by the ciliates. In general, clearance rates for different FLB varied by a factor of 2 to 4. Selective grazing by protozoa of larger bacterioplankton cells, which are generally the cells actively growing or dividing, may in part explain the small average cell size, low frequency of dividing cells, and low growth rates generally observed for assemblages of suspended bacteria...|$|R

Intriguingly, comparative analyses of the GC percentage, an indicator of gene horizontal transfer, showed that FadL- 2 (48.61 %) is appreciably lower than the average value of the whole genome (46 %), implying it might be obtained by gene horizontal transfer, whereas FadL- 1 (45.43 %) and FadL- 3 (46.73 %) not (not shown).|$|R
