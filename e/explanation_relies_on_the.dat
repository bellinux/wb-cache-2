40|$|Abstract Background Young {{individuals}} are {{the age group}} with the highest risk of car accidents. One of main <b>explanations</b> <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of psychoactive substances (alcohol, illegal and medicinal drugs), which {{are known to be}} major risk factors of road accidents, and whose consumption is almost universally more common among younger drivers. Although the correlation between psychoactive substances use and decrease in driving performance has been established in controlled experimental or laboratory settings, few studies were conducted in naturalistic circumstances. The TEND by Night project has been designed to evaluate the relationship between driving performance and psychoactive substances assumption in young drivers enrolled at typical places of consumption. Methods/Design The TEND by Night project, endorsed by the European Commission, is a multidisciplinary, multi-centric, cross-sectional study conducted in six European countries (Italy, Belgium/Netherlands, Bulgaria, Spain, Poland and Latvia). The study population consists of 5000 young drivers aged 16 - 34 years, attending recreational sites during weekend nights. The intervention is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> portal survey technique and includes several steps at the entrance and exit of selected sites, including the administration of semi-structured questionnaires, breath alcohol test, several drug assumption test, and measurement of the reaction time using a driving simulator. The main outcome is the difference in reaction time between the entrance and exit of the recreation site, and its correlation with psychoactive substances use. As a secondary outcome it will be explored the relationship between reaction time difference and the amount of consumption of each substance. All analyses will be multivariate. Discussion The project methodology should provide some relevant advantages over traditional survey systems. The main strengths of the study include the large and multicentric sample, the objective measurement of substance assumption (which is typically self-reported), the application of a portal survey technique and the simultaneous evaluation of several psychoactive substances. </p...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Psychological SciencesMichael YoungWhen making decisions, the {{probability}} {{and magnitude of}} errors can {{play a major role}} in changing preferences. Electroencephalography (EEG) research examining the error-related negativity (ERN) and the associated feedback-related negativity (FRN) has indicated that the amplitude of each component may predict subsequent behavioral change. The current study used a version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) that involves outcomes that are dynamically changing over time. As the balloon grows, more points are available but {{the probability}} of the balloon popping (netting zero points) is higher; the participant decides when to stop the balloon’s expansion to maximize points. The BART was adapted to facilitate the study of the FRN in dynamic environments. The purpose of Experiment 1 was to determine the effect of error magnitude on FRN amplitude during popped (incorrect) trials, whereas Experiment 2 was aimed at determining the effect of error magnitude on FRN amplitude during cashed-in (correct) trials. It was hypothesized that larger errors (i. e., the balloon popping after waiting a long time to cash-in) would result in a larger FRN than smaller errors. In Experiment 1, error magnitude did not contribute to the amplitude of the FRN. In Experiment 2, the masked points possible condition was a replication of Experiment 1. In the unmasked points possible condition, the number of points that could have been earned for each balloon was presented before participants found out how many points were earned. It was expected that there would be a larger FRN magnitude after cashed-in trials in the unmasked points possible condition compared to the masked points possible condition based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the error. In Experiment 2, the amplitude of the FRN was affected by the magnitude of <b>the</b> error <b>on</b> cashed-in trials in the unmasked condition, but not the masked condition.
