40|$|The {{transcervical}} electrolarynx {{or external}} <b>electronic</b> <b>larynx</b> {{is used by}} persons who cannot use their natural voice production mechanism. The device is a vibrator held against the neck tissue, and the vibrations generated move up the vocal tract to produce alaryngeal speech. Presence of background noise, due to leakage of the acoustic energy from the vibrator, degrades the resulting alaryngeal speech. This paper presents a single input technique for reducing the background noise in alaryngeal speech signal, using spectral subtraction in a pitch synchronous manner. Updating of the noise magnitude spectrum is carried out using quantile based noise estimation, which does not require speech/non-speech detection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After total {{laryngectomy}} the normal voice {{can be replaced}} by an <b>electronic</b> artificial <b>larynx</b> (AL). However, {{the results of the}} surrogate voice are not overall satisfying due to a robotic clattered sound of that prosthesis. In this paper the outcome of a sound investigation for an AL is presented. This work is part of our AL research project on laryngectomee speech enhancement. As a result, an autoregressive model of the hearing process is derived that can directly be used for a novel speech-enhancement procedure. The model is derived in the framework of linear prediction theory {{based on the fact that}} speech can be modelled as the output of a linear filter excited by a periodic pulse train and random noise. Additionally, we developed an innovative training unit for novice laryngectomees measuring the relative inter-line energy of the speech.

40|$|Vocal {{synthesis}} {{has been}} the subject of investigation since the late 18 th century when von Kempelen produced his mechanical ‘speaking machine’. The advert of electronics has enabled a number of different methods of voice synthesis to be realized in practice. Recently with the advent of 3 -D printing and magnetic resonance imaging of human vocal tracts, it has been possible to create synthetic vocal sounds that combine both mechanical (3 -D printed tracts) and <b>electronic</b> (synthesized <b>larynx</b> sound source) to enable the effects of various parts of the vocal tract on the acoustic output to be investigated. Given that the 3 -D tracts look rather like organ pipes, the author (an organist) has developed a new musical instrument based on this technology, which is called the Vocal Tract Organ. This paper reviews voice synthesis techniques and describes the structure and operation of the Vocal Tract Organ...|$|R
40|$|According to the American Cancer Society, {{there will}} be {{approximately}} 7, 000 people who will need a total laryngectomy operation this year. This operation is the surgical removal of the entire larynx due to cancer. The person who has had his larynx surgically removed is called a laryngectomee. The 7, 000 laryngectomees will need some form of voice to talk with once their vocal cords have been removed. While {{there are a number}} of speech options available after the operation, this paper will deal with only one of these options: the <b>electronic</b> artificial <b>larynx</b> device. The goal of the laryngectomee's speech rehabilitation program is to find an appropriate sound source that can be used for communicative purposes (Prater, 1984). The normal sound source for speech originates from the vocal cords. The laryngectomee's vocal cords have been removed, however, so the new sound source for speech may be provided by a mechanical device known as an electrolarynx. Oliver Bloodstein (1984) states that an electrolarynx "sends sound vibrations into the oral cavity" and with the different articulatory configurations, speech sounds are produced. The electro-larynx, therefore, provides the laryngectomee with a substitute voice for means of communication. There are very few electro-larynxes available with pitch variation capability, so most exhibit monotonous and robot-like sounds. The specific question addressed in this paper will be whether or not there is a difference in the preferences shown by sophisticated versus naive listeners for speech produced by two different artificial electric larynx devices.
