50|$|A {{phagemid}} or phasmid is a plasmid {{that contains}} an f1 {{origin of replication}} from an f1 phage. It {{can be used as}} a type of cloning vector in combination with filamentous phage M13. A phagemid can be replicated as a plasmid, and also be packaged as single stranded DNA in viral particles. Phagemids contain an origin of replication (ori) for double stranded replication, as well as an f1 ori to enable single stranded replication and packaging into phage particles. Many commonly used plasmids contain an f1 ori and are thus phagemids. Similarly to a plasmid, a phagemid can be used to clone DNA fragments and be introduced into a bacterial host by a range of techniques, such as transformation and electroporation. However, infection of a bacterial host containing a phagemid with a 'helper' phage, for example VCSM13 or M13K07, provides the necessary viral components to enable single stranded DNA replication and packaging of the phagemid DNA into phage particles. The 'helper' phage infects the bacterial host by first attaching to the host cell's pilus and then, after attachment, transporting the phage genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Inside the cell, the phage genome triggers production of single stranded phagemid DNA in the cytoplasm. This phagemid DNA is then packaged into phage particles. The phage particles containing ssDNA are released from the bacterial host cell into the extracellular environment. Filamentous phages retard bacterial growth but, contrasting with the lambda phage and the T7 phage, are not generally lytic. Helper phages are usually engineered to package less efficiently (via a <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> origin of replication) than the phagemid so that the resultant phage particles contain predominantly phagemid DNA. F1 Filamentous phage infection requires the presence of a pilus so only bacterial hosts containing the F-plasmid or its derivatives can be used to generate phage particles. Prior to the development of cycle sequencing, phagemids were used to generate single stranded DNA template for sequencing purposes. Today phagemids are still useful for generating templates for site-directed mutagenesis. Detailed characterisation of the filamentous phage life cycle and structural features lead to the development of phage display technology, in which a range of peptides and proteins can be expressed as fusions to phage coat proteins and displayed on the viral surface. The displayed peptides and polypeptides are associated with the corresponding coding DNA within the phage particle and so this technique lends itself to the study of protein-protein interactions and other ligand/receptor combinations.|$|E
40|$|The phages HP 1 c 1 and S 2 and a <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> of Haemophilus influenzae {{have been}} compared. The {{morphology}} of the phages and the mol wt of their DNAs are similar, although the <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> {{appears to have}} a different tail plate region. Electron microscope observation indicates that the <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> does not attach to the cell surface, and its DNA appears to lack cohesive ends. The homology of the DNAs of the phages has been measured by hydridization. DNA from the <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> shows little or no homology with the other phage DNAs. HP 1 c 1 and S 2 DNAs show a high level of homology. Each of these phages can form plaques on lawns of the lysogen of the other phage but at reduced plating efficiencies, suggesting that the two phages have related but not identical immunity systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between transformation and prophages of HP 1 c 1, S 2, and a <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> of Haemophilus influenzae {{has been investigated}} by measurement of (i) the effect of prophage on transformation frequency and (ii) the effect of transformation on phage induction. The presence {{of any of the}} prophages does not appreciably alter transformation frequencies in various Rec+ and Rec− strains. However, exposure of competent lysogens to transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) may induce phage but only in Rec+ strains, which are able to integrate transforming DNA into their genome. Transformation of Rec+ lysogens with DNA irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light causes the production of even more phage than results from unirradiated DNA, but this indirect UV induction is not as effective as direct induction by UV irradiation of lysogens. Both types of UV induction are influenced by the repair capacity of the host. Wild-type cells contain a prophage and can be induced by transformation to produce a <b>defective</b> <b>phage,</b> which kills {{a small fraction of the}} cells. <b>Defective</b> <b>phage</b> in wild-type cells are also induced by H. parainfluenzae DNA, and a much larger fraction of the cells is killed. Strain BC 200, which is highly transformable but is not inducible for <b>defective</b> <b>phage,</b> is not killed by H. parainfluenzae DNA, suggesting that wild-type cells are killed by killed by this DNA because of phage induction. A minicell-producing mutant, LB 11, has been isolated. Some phage induction occurs in this strain when the cells are made competent, unlike the wild type. A large majority of LB 11 cells surviving the competence regime are killed by exposure to transforming DNA...|$|E
40|$|Two {{independently}} isolated specialized transducing phages, P 22 pro- 1 and P 22 pro- 3, {{have been}} studied. Lysates of P 22 pro- 1 contain {{a majority of}} transducing phages which can go through the lytic cycle only in mixed infection; these <b>defective</b> <b>phages</b> transduce by lysogenization in mixed infection and by substitution in single infection. A few of the transducing phages in P 22 pro- 1 lysates appear to be non-defective, being able to form plaques and to transduce by lysogenization in single infection. Transduction by P 22 pro- 3 lysates is effected by non-defective transducing phages, which transduce by lysogenization; these lysates also contain a majority of <b>defective</b> <b>phages</b> which do not co-operate in mixed infection...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} whether <b>defective</b> <b>phages</b> of Bacillus subtilis killed sensitive bacteria by a lysis from without mechanism, the minimal number of phages required for killing was determined. This figure was found to vary with the m. o. i., giving a value of 1 on extrapolation to an m. o. i, of 0. This excluded lysis from without as the only killing mechanism, although it might play a role at high m. o. i. s. This was confirmed by experiments on leakage of ATP and u. v. -absorbing material, the uptake of oxygen {{and the effect of}} the phages on the membrane potential. Apart from a short, initial leakage of ATP, the cell membrane was not affected at low m. o. i. s. These results lead to the conclusion that at low m. o. i. s the phages acted on a cytoplasmic component. Treatment of <b>defective</b> <b>phages</b> for 10 min at pH 2. 5 resulted in breakdown of the phages without complete abolition of the killing activity. The active component, which was shown not to be DNA, could not be isolated from the mixture, but SDS gel electrophoresis of PBS X and a non-killing mutant of this phage suggested that a protein with a mol. wt. of 85 000 was involved in killing...|$|R
40|$|In Bacillus subtilis {{the ability}} to take up deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and undergo genetic {{transformation}} may coincide with the induction of <b>defective</b> <b>phage(s)</b> and the expression of possibly related cryptic genes. A restriction-modification enzyme system appears to be expressed. Targets of the restriction activity on the DNA can be blocked my methylation catalyzed by the methyl transferase. It is shown that cellular DNA becomes progressively methylated and reaches the maxium level during the peak of competency. Deoxycytidine residues of both incoming donor and resident DNA are methylated. The possible participation of these enzymes in recombination and the general role of cryptic genes in inducible functions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Non-infectious phage-like {{particles}} form during histidine starvation in bacteria {{infected with}} the RNA bacteriophage fr. As judged by their sedimentation velocity, CsCl buoyant density and ribonuclease sensitivity, these particles resemble <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> particles produced by phage assembly amber mutants in suppressor negative host bacteria. <b>Defective</b> <b>phage</b> particles are not converted to infectious phages if the synthesis of the histidine-containing maturation protein is resumed in the host cells. Furthermore, arguments have been provided that viral messengers which are repressed for the biosynthesis of the viral RNA synthetase—presumably by specific combination with a few subunits of the main coat protein—might not be incorporated into infective particles. The results suggest that association of viral RNA molecules with histidine containing maturation protein is required as an early {{step in the process}} of phage maturation...|$|E
40|$|Aminopterin- or trimethoprin-resistant thymidine-requiring {{strains of}} Haemophilus influenzae produce minicells, and {{the ratio of}} minicells to cells {{increases}} during the stationary phase of growth. Strain LB 11, isolated after mutagenesis of a thymidine-requiring strain (Rd thd), produces more minicells than the parent strain. The mutations involved in high frequency minicell production have been transferred into the wild type (strain Rd) by transformation. The thymidine requirement in the resulting strain, MCl, is essential for minicell production, since spontaneous revertants of MCl to prototrophy do not produce minicells. The ratio of minicells to cells was increased more than 10 (3) -fold by differential centrifugation. The minicells contain little or no deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Phage HPlcl apparently cannot attach to minicells. Competent cells of LB 11 and its thymidine-requiring parent strain produce <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> {{as a result of}} exposure to transforming DNA, whereas only LB 11 produces many <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> in response to the competence regime alone. Competent HP 1 c 1 and S 2 lysogens of MC 1 and Rd thd are also superinducible by transforming DNA, but competent LB 11 lysogens produced about the same amount of HP 1 c 1 or S 2 phage with or without exposure to transforming DNA possibly because of competition between the induced <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> and Hp 1 c 1 or S 2 phage...|$|E
40|$|Mitomycin C and {{ultraviolet}} light {{were found to}} induce the formation of microcysts in Spirillum itersonii. These forms, as well as spontaneously occurring microcysts in this species, were found to contain phage tail parts, rhapidosomes, and a granular substance not seen in normal cells. It is suggested that microcysts are formed {{as the result of}} the induction of a <b>defective</b> <b>phage.</b> The production of phage lysozyme within the cell could lead to the formation of spherical forms as the cells lose their structural mucopeptide layer. Complete virus particles were not seen, nor was any biological activity demonstrated when the induced cultures were tested against two other strains of S. itersonii. The other strains of this bacterium also formed microcysts and phage tail parts when induced with mitomycin.

40|$|The phage-related {{chromosomal}} islands (PRCIs) {{were first}} identified in Staphylococcus aureus as highly mobile, superantigen-encoding genetic elements {{known as the}} S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs). These elements are characterized by {{a specific set of}} phage-related functions that enable them to use the phage reproduction cycle for their own transduction and inhibit phage reproduction in the process. SaPIs produce many phage-like infectious particles; their streptococcal counterparts have a role in gene regulation but may not be infectious. These elements therefore represent phage satellites or parasites, not <b>defective</b> <b>phages.</b> In this Review, we discuss the shared genetic content of PRCIs, their life cycle and their ability to be transferred across large phylogenetic distances...|$|R
40|$|Sequence {{comparisons}} {{show that}} the fip gene product of Escherichia coli, which is required for filamentous phage assembly, is thioredoxin. Thioredoxin serves as a cofactor for reductive processes in many cell types and is a constituent of phage T 7 DNA polymerase. The fip- 1 mutation makes filamentous phage and T 7 growth temperature sensitive in cells that carry it. The lesion lies within a highly conserved thioredoxin active site. Thioredoxin reductase (NADPH), as well as thioredoxin, is required for efficient filamentous phage production. Mutant <b>phages</b> <b>defective</b> in <b>phage</b> gene I are particularly sensitive to perturbations in the fip-thioredoxin system.

40|$|SUMMARY: Comparison of two {{defective}} h prophages {{carried by}} strains of Eschm-ichia coli, {{with respect to}} their physiological properties following induction, has revealed that one defective mutant (A i 2) can multiply normally as vegetative phage but cannot mature into normal infectious phage, whereas the other <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> (A i l) can undergo only limited multiplication since it is unstable in the vegetative state. Consideration of the properties of h i l has led to an hypothesis that radiation induction causes the prophage to produce a vegetative replica which becomes autonomous rather than conversion of the prophage into vegetative phage. Lysogenic strains of Escherichia coli containing defective forms of the bacterio-phage h have been investigated by Appleyard (1954, 1956) and by Jacob & Wollman (1956). They are distinguished by an almost total failure to liberate healthy phage following induction, and Appleyard (1956) showed that the defect may be transmitted by extracellular <b>defective</b> <b>phage.</b> The phage genes responsible for the defects resemble the recessive lethal genes of higher organisms; induction by ultraviolet irradiation of a doubly lysogenic strain...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid {{transduction}} {{mediated by}} bacteriophage T 4 {{has been used}} to study putative T 4 DNA replication origins cloned as inserts in the Escherichia coli plasmid pBR 322. Two particular inserts from the T 4 genome allow high-frequency plasmid transduction, suggesting that each insert might contain a T 4 replication origin. T 4 infection of these plasmid-containing cells produces large numbers of <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> particles that contain long linear concatamers of the plasmid DNA. During a second cycle of infection, these <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> genomes can be replicated better than normal phage chromosomes present in the same infected cell; consequently, the T 4 DNA inserts must be functioning as replication origins. Both of these origins appear to utilize a previously unrecognized mode of T 4 replication initiation. Moreover, each origin coincides with a major recombination hot spot in the phage genome, and therefore this mode of replication initiation seems to involve a local stimulation of homologous genetic recombination. From a purely practical standpoint, additional DNA fragments can be cloned in an origin-containing plasmid, allowing isolation of large amounts of any DNA sequence with the glucosylated hydroxymethylcytosine modifications of T 4 DNA...|$|E

40|$|A {{temperate}} bacteriophage, designated r 1 t, was inducible {{from the}} group N lactic streptococcus, Streptococcus cremoris R 1, by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. Induced lysates produced plaques on lawns of three closely related S. cremoris strains, AM 1, SK 11, and US 3. Strain SK 11 was readily lysogenized. S. cremoris AM 1 was the most reliable indicator strain, although {{the age of the}} culture used for seeding plates was critical. Zones of lysis but no plaque formation were observed on lawns of nine additional S. cremoris strains. Phage r 1 t could not be detected in filtrates of stationary-phase R 1 cultures and was near the limits of detection in logarithmically growing cultures. Phage levels were still very low (1 plaque-forming unit on AM 1 per 10 induced cells) in induced lysates of R 1 cultures. These low levels of detectable phage may be attributable to an inadequate indicator, lysogenization of the indicator, adsorption of induced phage to cellular debris, concurrent induction of other undetectable phages, or the production of high proportions of <b>defective</b> <b>phages.</b> Electron micrographs of induced R 1 lysates revealed a high incidence of incomplete phage particles, fragments, and ghosts...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa R-type pyocin {{particles}} {{have been}} described as bacteriocins that resemble bacte-riophage tail-like structures. Because of their unusual structure, we reexamined whether they contained nucleic acids. Our data indicated that pyocin particles isolated from P. aeruginosa C (pyocin C) contain DNA. Probes generated from this DNA by the random-primer extension method hybridized to distinct bands in restriction endonuclease-digested P. aeruginosa C genomic DNA. These probes also hybridized to genomic DNA from 6 of 18 P. aeruginosa strains that produced R-type pyocins. Asymmetric PCR, complementary oligonucleotide hybridization, and electron microscopy indicated that pyocin C particles contained closed circular single-stranded DNA, approximately 4. 0 kb in length. Examination of total intracellular DNA from mitomycin C-induced cultures revealed the presence of two extrachromosomal DNA molecules, a double-stranded mole-cule and a single-stranded molecule, which hybridized to pyocin DNA. Sequence analysis of 7, 480 nucleotides of P. aeruginosa C chromosomal DNA containing the pyocin DNA indicated the presence of pyocin open reading frames with similarities to open reading frames from filamentous phages and cryptic phage elements. We did not observe any similarities to known phage structural proteins or previously characterized pseudomonal prt genes expressing R-type pyocin structural proteins. These studies demonstrate that pyocin particles from P. aeruginosa C are <b>defective</b> <b>phages</b> that contain a novel closed circular single-stranded DNA and that this DN...|$|R
40|$|Five temperature-sensitive {{sporulation}} mutants of Bacillus cereus T {{have been}} isolated. These mutants are blocked at stage 0 of sporulation at the restrictive temperature (37 C) but {{are able to}} sporulate at nearly normal frequencies at the permissive temperature (26 C). A bacteriophage that forms a stable lysogen in the parent strain is induced at increased frequencies in the mutants. This induction is accompanied, {{in some of the}} mutants, by a reduction in immunity to the phage. Revertants, selected for their ability to sporulate normally at both temperatures, lose their ability to produce high titers of the phage. In addition to this lytic phage, an apparently <b>defective</b> <b>phage</b> has been found in lysates of the mutants. Strains cured of the plaque-forming phage still carry the <b>defective</b> <b>phage.</b> Comparisons of physical and biological properties of the plaque-forming phage with those of the two Bacillus cereus phages most similar to it have shown that this phage is not identical to either of them.

The potential use of phage-tail-like high molecular weight bacteriocins, or "tailocins", as alternative anti-bacterial agents against Bcc was investigated. A tailocin, designated Bcep 0425, produced by B. cenocepacia strain BC 0425 was determined to have broad host range activity against members of the Bcc. Targeted mutagenesis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was conducted to determine the receptor site and {{it was determined that}} L-rhamnose and alpha-glucose associated with the LPS core were the receptors. Genetic analysis and targeted mutagenesis of the tailocin encoding genes was conducted in the host strain, B. cenocepacia BC 0425, to determine the genetic organization of the tailocin Bcep 0425 gene cluster and to confirm gene functions.

The defective lysates transduce pro C at high frequency relative to other bacterial markers. The representation of phage genes is strongly polar with markers distal to pro C being rarely present.

These included the structural genes for penicillin-binding protein 2 (pbpA) and penicillin-binding protein 5 (dacA) {{as well as a}} previously unidentified cell shape gene that we have called rodA. rodA mutants were spherical and very similar to pbpA mutants but were distinguishable from them in that they had no defects in the activity of penicillin-binding protein 2. The separation into two groups of spherical mutants with mutations that mapped close to lip was confirmed by complementation analysis. The genes dacA, rodA, and pbpA lie within a 12 -kilobase region, and represent a cluster of genes involved in cell shape determination and peptidoglycan synthesis. A restriction map of the lip-leuS region was established, and restriction fragments were cloned from <b>defective</b> transducing <b>phage</b> into appropriate lambda vectors to generate plaque-forming phage that carried genes from this region. Analysis of the proteins synthesized from lambda transducing phage in ultraviolet light-irradiated cells of E. coli resulted in the identification of the leuS, pbpA, dacA, and lip gene products, but the product of the rodA gene was not identified. The nine proteins that were synthesized from the lip-leuS region accounted for 57 % of its coding capacity. Phage derivatives were constructed that allowed about 50 -fold amplification of the levels of penicillin-binding proteins 2 and 5 in the cytoplasmic membrane...|$|R
40|$|Three temperature-sensitive mutants of phage P 22 {{have been}} {{isolated}} which are <b>defective</b> in <b>phage</b> DNA metabolism. After infection at restrictive temperature, one mutant (ts 12. 1) fails to synthesize measurable quantities of phage DNA; nevertheless, parental phage DNA is recovered in a fast-sedimenting form {{similar to the}} first intermediate form observed after infection with normal phage. Another mutant (ts 5. 1) synthesizes normal amounts of phage DNA, but neither this DNA nor parental DNA is converted from the first, fast-sedimenting intermediate form into the second, more slowly sedimenting intermediate observed in normal infections. The third mutant (ts 10. 1), produces both intermediate forms in sequence, but fails to produce DNA having the sedimentation properties of mature phage DNA. None of the mutants encapsulates any DNA. The properties of these mutants are interpreted as supporting a scheme of sequential intermediates in P 22 phage DNA synthesis and maturation...|$|R
