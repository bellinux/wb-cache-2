40|$|This study compares drug use, injecting {{and sexual}} {{risk-taking}} behaviour among pregnant injecting drug users (IDUs) <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), non-pregnant women IDUs <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> treatment. There {{was no significant}} difference between pregnant IDUs <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> treatment in terms of their injecting risk-taking behaviour. Both groups reported significantly higher levels of injecting risk-taking behaviour compared to (non-pregnant) women <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT. Pregnant women <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT reported a significantly lower methadone dose compared to non-pregnant women in MMT. There was a trend for pregnant women <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT to report a higher level of heroin use compared to non-pregnant women in MMT. The lack of evidence for a difference in level of injecting risk-taking behaviour between pregnant IDUs <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> treatment suggests the need for additional strategies among pregnant IDUs to reduce IDU and injecting risk-taking behaviour. Possible strategies include maintenance on higher doses of methadone and the application of relapse prevention strategies...|$|R

5|$|Reaction to Melanie was {{primarily}} negative; critics expressed disapproval of {{her decision to}} support her boyfriend instead of <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> medical school.

5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory.

After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier General Raden Panji Nugroho Notosusanto (15 July 1930– 3 June 1985) was an Indonesian {{short story}} writer turned {{military}} historian {{who served as}} {{professor of history at}} the University of Indonesia. Born to a noble family in Central Java, he exhibited a high degree of nationalism from a young age. During the Indonesian National Revolution from 1945 to 1949 he saw active service as a member of the Student Army, working reconnaissance. Despite wanting to remain in the military, under influence by his father he continued his education, eventually <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> the faculty of literature at the University of Indonesia. During the 1950s he wrote extensively and was active in numerous political and academic groups, finally graduating with a degree in history in 1958.|$|E

Gerty was tutored at home before <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided {{she wanted to be a}} medical doctor.

5|$|Aston {{was born}} on 1 July 1946 into a working-class family in Oldbury, Worcestershire, to cabinet-maker Harold Aston and his wife Gladys. He {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology, although teachers at Oldbury Grammar School attempted to dissuade him from pursuing it. His father gave him two books on archaeology as a Christmas present, and he subsequently spent much time visiting archaeological sites, sometimes playing truant to do so. The first of his family to attend university, Aston studied geography at the University of Birmingham, albeit with a subsidiary in archaeology, graduating in 1967. He taught himself more about archaeology by <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> various excavations, and was influenced by such figures as his thesis supervisor Harry Thorpe, {{as well as the}} geographer Trevor Rowley and archaeologists Philip Rahtz and Philip Barker. His dissertation was on the development of settlement in the West Penwith peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{civil war}} {{broke out in the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when the Bar Confederation sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski. One of Kościuszko's brothers, Józef, fought {{on the side of the}} insurgents. Faced with a {{difficult}} choice between the rebels and his sponsors—the King and the Czartoryski family, who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination—Kościuszko chose to leave Poland. In late 1769, he and a colleague, the noted artist Aleksander Orłowski, were granted royal scholarships, and on October 5 they set off for Paris. They wanted to further their military education, but as foreigners they were barred from <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> French military academies, and so they enrolled instead in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. There Kościuszko pursued his interest in drawing and painting and took private lessons in architecture from the noted French architect Jean-Rodolphe Perronet.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Khrushchev again {{sought to}} further his education, {{following}} Kaganovich (now in the Kremlin as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> the Stalin Industrial Academy. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but {{his career in}} the Party flourished. When the school's Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in Pravda. Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and afterward purging the cell of the rightists. Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the Moscow city Party organization, and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city {{and a member of the}} Party's Central Committee. Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E
