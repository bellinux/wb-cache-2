5|$|The Baltimore County Planning Commission first {{conceived}} the Baltimore Beltway as a county-level roadway project in 1949; by 1953 {{the project was}} taken over by the state due to slow progress at the county level.

5|$|In 1976 Tippett {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. The {{following}} few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where he was much attracted by the sounds of gamelan ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> {{from the sale of}} some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in Texan government resulted from the creation of a state oil production tax in 1905. The revenue generated by the tax made <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> for development in the state without the need for income taxes and similar revenue mechanisms adopted in other states. In 1919, tax revenue from oil production surpassed $1 million ($ in today's terms) and in 1929 it reached $6 million ($ in today's terms). By 1940, {{the oil and gas industry}} accounted for approximately half of all taxes paid in the state.|$|E

There are several primary schools in Keynsham, including St Johns primary school, Castle Primary school, Chandag infants and junior school and new school St Keyna primary school (a merge of Keynsham primary school and 150 yr old Temple Primary school). There are also two secondary schools, Wellsway School and Broadlands School.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} a family’s monthly benefit payment depends on that family's {{specific}} characteristics and financial circumstances, {{as well as}} the overall amount of program <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> for distribution. The latest statistics show that benefits average $103 each month (2003, see table below right). It is the Puerto Rico government's responsibility to establish the eligibility requirements and benefit levels for participation in the program. The benefits are revised annually every October 1 to consider the nutritional needs of Puerto Rico's impoverished population, analyze the impact of inflation in Puerto Rico, and plan the distribution of available funds accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk. However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management. The {{extent to which a}} risk parity portfolio is managed, is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of risk parity <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> today.|$|E

5|$|With the <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> {{from the}} UERL and the route decided, the CCE started site demolitions and preparatory works in July 1902. On 21 November 1902, the CCE {{published}} another bill which sought compulsory purchase powers for additional buildings for its station sites, planned the take-over of the E and abandoned the permitted but redundant {{section of the}} line from Kentish Town to the proposed depot site near Highgate Road. This bill was approved as the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1903 on 21 July 1903.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> {{from the}} UERL, {{construction}} began in July 1902 at Knightsbridge, before the formal {{approval of the}} merger of the B and GN Work proceeded quickly, enabling the UERL to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the tunnels had been completed and that track laying was about to begin. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Except for Finsbury Park, where the platforms were {{close enough to the}} surface to be accessed by stairs, and Gillespie Road where a long ramp was used, each of the stations with platforms in tube tunnels was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E

5|$|Citi Bike's massive, {{unexpected}} popularity caused {{problems within}} a year. In January 2014, the designer of Citi Bike's bicycles and docking stations {{filed for bankruptcy}} protection. Officials with Montreal, Quebec-based Public Bike System Company (also known as Bixi) said they were $46 million in debt, partly because the operators of Citi Bike and Chicago's Divvy bikeshare had withheld a combined $5 million in payments because of software glitches in the docking stations. Alta officials, who operate Citi Bike, Divvy, and Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., said they anticipated no interruptions of service, though they did want $20 million to expand the system to 10,000 bikes and 600 stations. However, due to Citi Bike's various problems, expansions to the Upper East and Upper West Sides were delayed {{for at least a}} year. Its general manager resigned in March. The new mayor, Bill de Blasio, stated that he wanted to expand Citi Bike's reach, but that he could not make city <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> for such an expansion at that time.|$|E
5|$|Lacking that guidance, discussions {{began on}} how the bequest money should be spent. The City Lands Committee {{suggested}} in a report that the bequest should be spent on educating {{a larger number of}} boys and this approach was adopted in 1826. A number of people including Richard Taylor, a printer and an assistant to the founding of University College London, urged the Corporation of London to spend the bequest on creating a day school for the largest possible number of boys. In 1830, they proposed that the City of London Corporation School be founded with Taylor as a governor, and that the school to be established {{on the site of the}} disused London Workhouse. In the mean time, a small number of boys, who became known as Carpenter's scholars, were sent to Tonbridge School. In 1829, an Act of Parliament was passed to transform the workhouse into a school and governors were appointed. Conditions at the workhouse site had deteriorated and much money was needed for its maintenance. The only <b>funds</b> <b>available,</b> though, were the same £300 (about £22,000 in 2008) a year budget the workhouse had received.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{and raising}} {{of the ship}} in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding {{and part of the}} bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the high costs of conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no <b>funds</b> <b>available</b> for diving. In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to build two new aircraft carriers. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed {{to make sure that they}} could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the Mary Rose wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten-metre (32feet) stem, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.|$|E
