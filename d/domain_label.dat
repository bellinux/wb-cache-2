40|$|To improve {{robustness}} {{to significant}} mismatches between source domain and target domain- arising from {{changes such as}} illumination, pose and image quality- domain adaptation is increasingly popular in computer vision. But most of meth-ods assume that the source data is from single domain, or that multi-domain datasets provide the <b>domain</b> <b>label</b> for training instances. In practice, most datasets are mixtures of multiple latent domains, and difficult to manually provide the <b>domain</b> <b>label</b> of each data point. In this paper, we propose a model that automatically discovers latent domains in visual datasets. We first assume the visual images are sampled from mul-tiple manifolds, each of which represents different domain, and which are represented by different subspaces. Using the neighborhood structure estimated from images belonging to the same category, we approximate the local linear invariant subspace for each image based on its local structure, elim-inating the category-specific elements of the feature. Based {{on the effectiveness of}} this representation, we then propose a squared-loss mutual information based clustering model with category distribution prior in each domain to infer the do-main assignment for images. In experiment, we test our ap-proach on two common image datasets, the results show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, and also show the superiority of multiple latent domain dis-covery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{existence}} of trusted subjects {{is a major}} complication in implementing multilevel secure (MLS) systems. In MLS, trusted subjects are granted with privileges to perform operations possibly violating mandatory access control policies. It is difficult {{to prevent them from}} data leakage with out too strict confinement. This paper reconsiders the privilege from the view of sensitive data and presents a dynamic trusted domain (DTD) mechanism for trusted subjects. In DTD, a domain is associated with a special label structure (LabelVector) distinguishing security policies and builds an isolated environment based on virtualization for a certain trusted subject. The channel for the trusted subject to communicate with outsider is controlled by a trusted request decision maker (TRDM). Only the request satisfies the rules on <b>domain</b> <b>label</b> and security levels can be passed through...|$|E

Our system takes a supervised approach that builds on techniques from in-formation retrieval. The algorithm populates an inverted index with pseudo-documents that encode dependency parse relationships ex-tracted from the sentences in the training set. Each record stored in the index is annotated with the polarity and domain of the sentence it represents. When the polarity or domain of a new sentence has to be computed, the new sentence is converted to a query {{that is used to}} retrieve the most similar sentences from the training set. The retrieved instances are scored for relevance to the query. The most rele-vant training instant is used to assign a polarity and <b>domain</b> <b>label</b> to the new sentence. While the results on well-formed sentences are en-couraging, the performance obtained on short texts like tweets demonstrate that more work is needed in this area. ...|$|E

The dynamics of each site of attachment {{on the individual}} proteins and in the tight DNase-Im 9 complex have been analysed by computer simulations of the spectra using a model of Brownian dynamics trajectories for the spin label and protein.

Bi-modal dynamics of the spin label have been observed for several sites. We show that W-band spectra are particularly useful for detection of anisotropy of spin label motion.

40|$|Several {{techniques}} for domain adaptation {{have been proposed}} to account for differences {{in the distribution of}} the data used for training and testing. The majority of this work focuses on a binary <b>domain</b> <b>label.</b> Similar problems occur in a scientific context where there may be a continuous family of plausible data generation processes associated to the presence of systematic uncertainties. Robust inference is possible if it is based on a pivot [...] a quantity whose distribution does not depend on the unknown values of the nuisance parameters that parametrize this family of data generation processes. In this work, we introduce and derive theoretical results for a training procedure based on adversarial networks for enforcing the pivotal property (or, equivalently, fairness with respect to continuous attributes) on a predictive model. The method includes a hyperparameter to control the trade-off between accuracy and robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with a toy example and examples from particle physics.

With the increasing size of social networks in real world, community detection approaches should be fast and accurate.

In this paper, we extend the update rule and propagation criterion of LPA in the framework of belief functions. A new community detection approach, called Evidential Label Propagation (ELP), is proposed as an enhanced version of conventional LPA. The node influence is first defined to guide the propagation process. The plausibility is used to determine the <b>domain</b> <b>label</b> of each node. The update order of nodes is discussed to improve the robustness of the method. ELP algorithm will converge after the domain labels of all the nodes become unchanged. The mass assignments are calculated finally as memberships of nodes. The overlapping nodes and outliers can be detected simultaneously through the proposed method.

When an IDL is registered, an IDL package is created that contains its variant IDLs generated according to the zone-specific Lan-guage Variant Tables (LVTs). In addition to the registered IDL, the name holder can request the domain registry to activate some of the variant IDLs, free or by an extra fee.

Information seeking applications such as information extraction, question answering and summarization normally assume all text they deal with is content-dense. Here we empirically test this assumption on news articles from the business, U. S. international relations, sports and science journalism domains. Our findings clearly indicate {{that about half of}} the news texts in our study are in fact not content-dense and motivate the development of a supervised content-density detector. We heuristically label a large training corpus for the task and train a two-layer classifying model based on lexical and unlexicalized syntactic features. On manually annotated data, we compare the performance of domain-specific classifiers, trained on data only from a given news domain and a general classifier in which data from all four domains is pooled together. Our annotation and prediction experiments demonstrate that the concept of content density varies depending on the domain and that naive annotators provide judgement biased toward the stereotypical <b>domain</b> <b>label.</b> Domain-specific classifiers are more accurate for domains in which content-dense texts are typically fewer. Domain independent classifiers reproduce better naive crowdsourced judgements. Classification prediction is high across all conditions, around 80 %. Comment: In submission to JAI...|$|E

However, an issue of scalability arises when the number of the activated variant IDLs is large. In this paper, we present a mechanism to resolve the variant IDLs in an IDL package into the registered IDL. Specifically, we target Han character variants. Two Han characters are said to be variants of each other if they have the same meaning and are pronounced the same. Furthermore, Han character variants usually have similar appearances. We introduce a new resource record (RR) type, denoted as VarIdx, to associate the variant IDLs with the registered IDL. Experiment results show that a small number of VarIdx RRs are sufficient for enumerating all variant IDLs in an IDL package. We then present a redirection service that uses VarIdx RRs to redirect user requests with variant IDLs to the URLs with the corresponding registered IDLs...|$|E
