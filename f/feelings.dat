5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment <b>feelings</b> and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their <b>feelings,</b> dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed <b>feelings</b> about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their <b>feelings.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} {{with the concept of}} A. Adler (1933 / 1986) - the community <b>feeling</b> is an individual characteristic which is relatively stable throughout life. It refers to an inner relationship of one person with other people: a <b>feeling</b> of unity with others or separation from others. People with high community <b>feeling</b> are motivated in their actions by striving towards the common good, whereas people with low community <b>feeling</b> intend to exhibit their superiority over others in their actions, which would allow them to compensate for their inner <b>feeling</b> of inferiority. On the basis of the Adler concept the following hypotheses were formulated: There is a negative connection between the community <b>feeling</b> and anxiety. The community <b>feeling</b> is positively connected with self-esteem and psychological well-being. A slight increase in the community <b>feeling</b> can be observed with age. The community <b>feeling</b> increases in the age of middle adulthood. 585 people between 20 to 65 years of age were examined. Methods: Community Feeling Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-Being. The hypotheses assumed were verified...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{evaluate}} the notion of collective guilt <b>feeling</b> both {{in the light of}} research in affectivity and in collective intentionality. The paper is divided into an introduction and three main sections. Section 1) highlights relevant features of guilt-family emotions such as the relation between <b>feeling</b> guilt and objective guilt, the relation between <b>feeling</b> guilt and its content, and the relation between <b>feeling</b> guilt and the ‘self’. Moreover, the distinction between <b>feeling</b> guilt and <b>feeling</b> regret is given due attention. Section 2) examines Margaret Gilbert’s arguments in favor of a collectivist view of collective guilt <b>feeling</b> (displayed as ‘We feel guilt for p’), according to which groups do genuinely feel guilt. Against the collectivist position I argue for an individualist ‘membership account’ of collective guilt <b>feeling</b> in terms of individual members’ we-feeling of guilt. The membership account of collective guilt <b>feeling</b> is vindicated on grounds of a naturalist and non-judgmentalist understanding of emotions, {{as well as on the}} logic of personal pronouns. It combines individualism regarding the subject of the <b>feeling</b> with collectivism regarding the irreducibility of we-feelings and provides, as I further argue, the required moral force attributed to collective guilt <b>feeling.</b> The concern of section 3) is the question of the appropriate emotional response to collective wrongdoing. I argue against the view that group members are categorically ‘committed to feel guilt as a body’ for wrongdoings committed by the group. Given that individual members often do not participate in their groups’ wrongdoings, it seems unjust to impose a requirement for <b>feeling</b> guilt upon them. I suggest that in a general account of the appropriate assessment of collective wrongdoing, <b>feeling</b> regret is the better candidate than <b>feeling</b> guilt for the role of the minimally required emotional response...|$|R
