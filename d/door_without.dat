25|$|The {{concept of}} having rail lines which could bring people from door to <b>door</b> <b>without</b> {{requiring}} {{the use of}} road-based buses was much favoured by the government transport planners, especially with the increased emphasis on a rail-based public transport network. For intra town travel, LRTs were favoured over buses because trains run on dedicated elevated guideways, bypassing any traffic congestion and traffic lights on the roads, and do not add to road traffic. Train arrival and departure times are also almost guaranteed this way. It is also cleaner as the trains are electrically powered, and therefore lessens the effects of air pollution.|$|E

ATO Records quickly made the unanimous decision to offer her a recording contract.

In anticipation of the album release, Jem also relocated to Los Angeles, where she felt there was more opportunity for her to promote her work and explore her musical potential.|$|E

[...] In order to fit into the role, Armitage had to [...] "bulk up for the role," [...] and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to Johannesburg the day after filming the eighth series of Spooks wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training. He was trained from [...] "how to hold a gun to how you can run through a <b>door</b> <b>without</b> getting your head blown off." [...] Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating [...] "filming Spooks is demanding, but nowhere near as physical as this." [...] Armitage performed most of his own stunts.|$|E

Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After most of the attention from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn got up {{and walked out of the}} <b>door</b> <b>without</b> explanation. Shamrock took Severn's action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock. During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.|$|E
