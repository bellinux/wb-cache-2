In practice, the terms nullification and interposition often have been used indistinguishably. John C.

[...] During the fight over desegregation of the schools in the south in the 1950s, a number of southern states tried to preserve their segregated schools by passing so-called [...] "Acts of Interposition" [...] that actually would have had the effect of nullification, if they had been valid.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} results of a multicenter {{experience}} of split liver transplantation (SLT) with pediatric donors. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There are no reports in the literature regarding pediatric liver splitting; further; the use of donors weighing 3 days and the use <b>of</b> an <b>interposition</b> arterial graft were associated with an increased risk of graft loss and arterial complications, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Splitting of pediatric liver grafts is an effective strategy to increase organ availability, but a cautious evaluation of the use of donors < or = 40 kg is necessary. Prolonged donor ICU stay is associated with poorer outcomes. The maintenance of the celiac trunk with LLS does not seem detrimental for right-sided grafts, whereas the use <b>of</b> <b>interposition</b> grafts for arterial reconstruction should be avoided...|$|R
