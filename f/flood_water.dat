5|$|The 1930s {{improvements}} {{included the}} construction of the Prescott Channel, designed to allow <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> to bypass the Three Mills tide mills. The channel included sluices to regulate water levels above it, but these became redundant once the tide mills ceased to operate, and eventually seized up. They were removed soon after parts of the Channelsea River were culverted.|$|E

5|$|Damage from Diane was {{heaviest}} in Connecticut, where rainfall {{peaked at}} 16.86in (428mm) near Torrington. The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30stream gauges reported their highest levels on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6ft (9.3m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, {{much of which}} was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> levels surpassed those during the 1938 Long Island hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184people and destroyed 813houses, with another 14,000homes heavily damaged. Monetary losses totaled $754.7million, although the inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1billion. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired.|$|E
5|$|The works {{had its own}} {{internal}} standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E
5|$|On 19January Rewa {{started to}} affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However {{it did not}} make its {{predicted}} landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100km (60mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain, leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore {{the brunt of the}} wind, while on Heron Island, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over 144mm (5.7in) in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> and got trapped in a storm drain. Within Brisbane, 100homes and 20cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after the Gabba resembled a small lake.|$|E

5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire hydrants was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up off the ground, and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the <b>flood</b> <b>water.</b> The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E

50|$|During the Missoula <b>Floods</b> <b>water</b> {{backed up}} in the Pasco Basin because of the narrow opening of the Wallula Gap. The floods were so large in volume {{that they could not}} rapidly {{discharge}} through the gap, even though it is 2 km wide. Maximum <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> reached elevations of about 380 meters. The hydraulic head required to drive the <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> through the gap, combined with the elevated levels downstream of the constriction resulted in a head of about 250 meters.

25|$|Artificial {{groundwater}} recharge is practiced extensively in Israel from <b>flood</b> <b>water,</b> potable {{water from the}} National Water Carrier and treated wastewater. Artificial recharge has increased groundwater levels in the Coastal Aquifer and counteracted further seawater intrusion. Groundwater recharge from <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> is done by collecting runoff from winter rains in a drainage basin and directing it into recharge ponds. The groundwater is then pumped back up during summer through wells around the recharge ponds. The cost of the recharge process is limited to maintenance, with pumping costs amounting to only $0.02–0.03 per cubic meter. About 40–50% more water than the average recharge is pumped from the aquifer {{in order to create}} a temporary hydrological depression that creates space for artificial recharge the following winter.|$|E
