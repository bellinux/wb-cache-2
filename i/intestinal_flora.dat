Manipulation {{was done by}} disinfecting rotifer eggs to reduce viable bacterial counts and then by inoculating hatched rotifers with non-sucrose fermenting Vibrio splendidus strain V- 15 to make the bacterium dominant in the rotifers. Flounder larvae were fed the manipulated rotifers and <b>intestinal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> of the fish was monitored. The dominant <b>intestinal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> of the flounder became Vibrio spp. These results indicate that <b>intestinal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> of flounder can be artificially controlled by manipulating bacterial flora in diets. 消毒前のワムシ卵および未処理区の孵化ワムシの細菌叢は，共にFlavobacterium属が主体を成していたことから，孵化前後でワムシの菌叢は変化しないことが示された。また，消毒して孵化させた後にV. splendidus V- 15 株を添加した区のワムシの細菌叢はVibrio属が主体を成していた。これらの結果から，ワムシの細菌叢は制御可能であることが示唆された。次いで，ショ糖分解能のない抗ウイルス活性を有するV. splendidus V- 15 株優勢ワムシをヒラメに給餌した。ヒラメ腸管内におけるVibrio属細菌のうち，ショ梼非分解薗の割合は未処理区で 62 %，消毒区で 59 %，菌添加区で 100 %となり，ヒラメの腸内細菌叢も制御可能であることが示唆された...|$|R
5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's <b>intestinal</b> <b>flora.</b> Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{ecological}} impact of roxithromycin given orally at 300 mg/day on the <b>intestinal</b> <b>floras</b> in six human volunteers was studied.

Consecutive modifications in the composition of the fecal floras were limited to a decrease in counts of total members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The rest of the <b>intestinal</b> <b>floras,</b> including the predominant anaerobic floras, changed little. No overgrowth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci, fungi, or highly erythromycin-resistant strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed. The strains of Enterobacteriaceae and of anaerobes isolated during treatment were not markedly more resistant to roxithromycin than those isolated before treatment started. Changes in intestinal resistance to colonization by exogenous microorganisms in gnotobiotic mice inoculated with human fecal flora were studied and were also found to be minimal. The impact of oral roxithromycin on the intestinal microbiota appears to be weaker than that previously observed with oral erythromycin, perhaps because the concentrations of roxithromycin in the feces were lower than those previously found for erythromycin...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) on <b>intestinal</b> bacterial <b>flora,</b> 24 Kunming mice (KM mice) were randomly placed into four groups, which were labeled as control, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups. They were fed intragastrically with 0. 4 mL of 0 mg/L, 2. 5 mg/L, 4 mg/L, or 10 mg/L of AFB 1 solutions, twice a day for 2 months. The hypervariable region V 3 + V 4 on 16 S rDNA of <b>intestinal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> was sequenced {{by the use of}} a high-flux sequencing system on a Miseq Illumina platform; then, the obtained sequences were analyzed. The results showed that, when compared with the control group, both genera and phyla of intestinal bacteria in the three treatment groups decreased. About one third of the total genera and one half of the total phyla remained in the high-dose group. The dominant flora were Lactobacillus and Bacteroides in all groups. There were significant differences in the relative abundance of <b>intestinal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> among groups. Most bacteria decreased as a whole from the control to the high-dose groups, but several beneficial and pathogenic bacterial species increased significantly with increasing dose of AFB 1. Thus, the conclusion was that intragastric feeding with 2. 5 ~ 10 mg/mL AFB 1 for 2 months could decrease the majority of <b>intestinal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> and induce the proliferation of some <b>intestinal</b> bacteria <b>flora...</b>|$|R
25|$|Kellogg {{believed}} that most disease is alleviated by {{a change in}} intestinal flora; that bacteria in the intestines can either help or hinder the body; that pathogenic bacteria produce toxins during the digestion of protein that poison the blood; that a poor diet favors harmful bacteria that can then infect other tissues in the body; that the <b>intestinal</b> <b>flora</b> is changed by diet and is generally {{changed for the better}} by a well-balanced vegetarian diet favoring low-protein, laxative, and high-fiber foods; and that this natural change in flora could be sped by enemas seeded with favorable bacteria, or by various regimens of specific foods designed to heal specific ailments.|$|E
25|$|In {{their native}} arid and {{semi-arid}} climates, donkeys {{spend more than}} half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub. The donkey has a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation, microbial action in the caecum and large intestine. While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight, approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter, compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse. Donkeys are also less prone to colic. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different <b>intestinal</b> <b>flora</b> to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.|$|E

40|$|In {{a survey}} of 640 human subjects, a {{subgroup}} of 356 persons without recent exposure to antibiotics demonstrated that those with a high prevalence of Hg resistance in their <b>intestinal</b> <b>floras</b> {{were significantly more likely}} to also have resistance to two or more antibiotics. This observation led us to consider the possibility that mercury released from amalgam ("silver") dental restorations might be a selective agent for both mercury- and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the oral and <b>intestinal</b> <b>floras</b> of primates. Resistances to mercury and to several antibiotics were examined in the oral and <b>intestinal</b> <b>floras</b> of six adult monkeys prior to the installation of amalgam fillings, during the time they were in place, and after replacement of the amalgam fillings with glass ionomer fillings (in four of the monkeys). The monkeys were fed an antibiotic-free diet, and fecal mercury concentrations were monitored. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of mercury-resistant bacteria during the 5 weeks following installation of the amalgam fillings and during the 5 weeks immediately following their replacement with glass ionomer fillings. These peaks in incidence of mercury-resistant bacteria correlated with peaks of Hg elimination (as high as 1 mM in the feces) immediately following amalgam placement and immediately after replacement of the amalgam fillings. Representative mercury-resistant isolates of three selected bacterial families (oral streptococci, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and enterococci) were also resistant to one or more antibiotics, including ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol. While such mercury- and antibiotic-resistant isolates among the staphylococci, the enterococci, and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae have been described, this is the first report of mercury resistance in the oral streptococci. Many of the enterobacterial strains were able to transfer mercury and antibiotic resistances together to laboratory bacterial recipients, suggesting that the loci for these resistances are genetically linked. Our findings indicate that mercury released from amalgam fillings can cause an enrichment of mercury resistance plasmids in the normal bacterial floras of primates. Many of these plasmids also carry antibiotic resistance, implicating the exposure to mercury from dental amalgams in an increased incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance plasmids in the normal floras of nonmedicated subjects...|$|R
