5|$|When the two {{opposing}} forces reached {{the place of}} the ambush, Bardas ordered the trumpets blown and the two concealed Byzantine divisions attacked the Pechenegs from the flanks and the rear. Cut off from aid and surrounded, the Pechenegs began to panic and flee. One of their leaders tried to rally his men, but he was attacked by Bardas Skleros himself, who killed him with a single sword-blow that reportedly cut him in two from his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the waist, through the Pecheneg's helmet and cuirass. The loss of the Pecheneg commander turned the battle into a complete rout, and panic spread to the Bulgarian contingent following behind the Pechenegs, which also suffered heavy casualties in the general chaos. The Byzantine casualties in the battle were low (Skylitzes speaks of 25 dead and Leo of 55) although they lost many horses to the Pecheneg arrows, while the losses of the Rus' force, although certainly lower than Leo's claimed 20,000, were still significant, probably running into several thousands.|$|E

500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{have small}} undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally. Unlike most fishes, American paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination. Electroreception {{appears to have}} largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality, which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey. [...] However, the rostrum is not their only means of food detection. [...] Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health, but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise. [...] As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum, American paddlefish have sensory pores covering {{nearly half of the}} skin surface extending from the rostrum {{to the top of the}} <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the tips of the operculum flaps. Studies have indicated that American paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health.|$|E

Singing and playing guitar, he opened with [...] "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: [...] "I wasn't popular in school... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the scene}} of the crime, the pair deduce Krusty could not have been the robber because the robber used the {{microwave}} not suitable for those with a pacemaker, and read at the magazine rack. They go to Sideshow Bob with the intention of finding if Krusty had any enemies, but are given tickets to his show. At the live broadcast, Bart is invited up on stage with Sideshow Bob, where he points out the facts regarding the microwave and magazine, which Sideshow Bob dismisses. When Sideshow Bob says he has [...] "a lot of big shoes to fill", Bart remembers how Homer stepped on the robber's foot, causing him to scream in pain. Bart realizes that despite wearing clown shoes all the time, Krusty never would have felt Homer stepping on them due to his small feet. Bart then deduces that Sideshow Bob is the real robber, since he had the most to gain through Krusty's downfall and has large feet. To prove his theory, he hits the end of Sideshow Bob's shoe with a mallet, causing Sideshow Bob to scream in pain and exposing him as the robber to the public. The police, having watched the show, realize they wrongfully put Krusty in jail for a crime he did not commit and <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the studio to arrest Sideshow Bob.|$|E

2500|$|Outlying pickets of the British cavalry were {{stationed}} {{along the western}} bank of the River Esla, which was swollen with rain. The bridge at Castrogonzalo had been demolished by British engineers early on the 29th, {{and it was not}} until about 9:00 in the morning that Lefebvre-Desnouettes, a noted favourite of Napoleon, was able to ford the river with three strong squadrons of his chasseurs and a small detachment of Mamelukes. The French forced the outlying pickets of the British cavalry back onto the inlying picket commanded by Loftus Otway (18th Hussars). Otway charged, despite heavy odds, but was driven back for 2 miles towards the town of Benavente. In an area where their flanks were covered by walls the British, now reinforced by a troop or squadron of the 3rd Hussars KGL and commanded by Brigadier-General Stewart, counter-attacked and a confused melee ensued. The French, though temporarily driven back, had superior numbers and forced the British hussars to retreat once more, almost back to Benavente. Stewart knew he was drawing the French towards Paget and substantial numbers of British reserves. The French had gained the upper hand in the fight and were preparing to deliver a final charge when Lord Paget made a decisive intervention. He led the 10th Hussars, with squadrons of the 18th in support, around the southern outskirts of Benavente. Paget managed to conceal his squadrons from French view until he could fall on their left flank. The British swords, often dulled by their iron scabbards, were very sharp on this occasion. An eyewitness stated that he saw the arms of French troopers cut off cleanly [...] "like Berlin sausages." [...] Other French soldiers were killed by blows to the head, blows which divided the <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the chin.|$|E
