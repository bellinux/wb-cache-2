5|$|Due to {{cutbacks in}} federal, {{state and local}} budgets, UCF has had over $140 million in funds cut from its {{operating}} budget since 2008. This included a $53 million cut to UCF's 2012–13 fiscal year budget by the Florida legislature. So far UCF {{has been able to}} endure the budget cuts by implementing a hiring freeze, putting an end to some faculty perks, such as free seminars, cutting <b>executive</b> <b>pay,</b> and through wise management of funds. To help counter the budget decreases, the university received $18 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. UCF's operating budget for the 2014–15 fiscal year is $1.5 billion, a 13.9% increase from the previous year. UCF's financial endowment, administered by the University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc., was valued at $155.5 million in 2015, a 14.7% increase from 2014.|$|E

5000|$|Concerns exist {{around the}} amount of {{influence}} Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.

25|$|Further, income {{inequality}} {{can be measured}} both before-tax and after-tax, so the Bush tax cuts primarily impacted the latter measurements. President Bush did not take deliberate steps to address pre-tax inequality, which involves policies such as raising the minimum wage, strengthening collective bargaining power (unions), limiting <b>executive</b> <b>pay,</b> and protectionism. CBO reported that the top 1% paid an average total federal tax rate of 32.5% in 2000, 30.1% in 2004, and 28.2% in 2008. The top 1% paid an average federal income tax rate of 24.5% in 2000 and 20.4% in 2008.|$|E

40|$|Building on information-processing {{perspectives}} and the Japanese contextual factors, this study investigates {{the relationships between}} firm strategy and <b>executive</b> bonus <b>pay</b> {{as well as the}} moderating role of foreign ownership on the strategy–compensation relationship in Japanese firms.

The results, based on a sample of the 148 largest industrial firms in Japan for the 1990 – 1997 period, show that both R 2 ̆ 6 D investment and product diversification are positively related to <b>executive</b> bonus <b>pay.</b> Our findings also indicate that foreign ownership negatively moderates the relationships between the strategy variables and executive compensation, suggesting that foreign investors play an active monitoring role, reducing cash bonus payments when their invested firms choose to increase R 2 ̆ 6 D or pursue diversification strategy...|$|R
25|$|Federal {{tax policy}} was highly {{contentious}} during the war, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt battling a conservative Congress. However, both sides {{agreed on the}} need for high taxes (along with heavy borrowing) to pay for the war: top marginal tax rates ranged from 81%-94% {{for the duration of the}} war, and the income level subject to the highest rate was lowered from $5,000,000 to $200,000. Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully, by executive order 9250, to impose a 100% surtax on after-tax incomes over $25,000 (equal to roughly $ today). However, Roosevelt did manage to impose this cap on <b>executive</b> <b>pay</b> in corporations with government contracts. Congress also enlarged the tax base by lowering the minimum income to pay taxes, and by reducing personal exemptions and deductions. By 1944 nearly every employed person was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in 1940).|$|E
25|$|Over the 20th century, {{companies}} in the UK became the dominant organisational form of economic activity, which raised concerns about how accountable those who controlled companies were to those who invested in them. The first reforms following the Great Depression, in the Companies Act 1948, ensured that directors could be removed by shareholders with a simple majority vote. In 1977, the government's Bullock Report proposed reform to allow employees to participate in selecting the board of directors, as was happening across Europe, exemplified by the German Codetermination Act 1976. However the UK never implemented the reforms, and from 1979 the debate shifted. Although making directors more accountable to employees was delayed, the Cork Report led to stiffer sanctions in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 against directors who negligently ran companies at a loss. Through the 1990s the focus in corporate governance turned toward internal control mechanisms, such as auditing, separation of the chief executive position from the chair, and remuneration committees {{as an attempt to}} place some check on excessive <b>executive</b> <b>pay.</b> These rules applicable to listed companies, now found in the UK Corporate Governance Code, have been complemented by principles based regulation of institutional investors' activity in company affairs. At the same time, the UK's integration in the European Union meant a steadily growing body of EU Company Law Directives and case law to harmonise company law within the internal market.|$|E
500|$|Kilroy {{helped shape}} the Congressional Bill on <b>executive</b> <b>pay</b> that {{eventually}} became law by proposing an amendment requiring large institutional investors to reveal how they vote the shares that they own on pay proposals affecting companies that issued those shares.

2500|$|Increasing {{attention}} and regulation (as under the Swiss referendum [...] "against corporate Rip-offs" [...] of 2013) {{has been brought}} to <b>executive</b> <b>pay</b> levels since the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Research {{on the relationship between}} firm performance and executive compensation does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives' remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others. Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm's shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the crucial question}} of whether corporate governance (CG) can moderate the pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) using a sample of 169 South African listed companies from 2002 to 2007. Examining direct links between <b>executive</b> director <b>pay</b> and performance, we find a positive but weak PPS, which provides support for the managerial power hypothesis (MPH). However, and consistent with the predictions of the optimal contracting theory (OCT), we also find that the PPS improves in firms with strong governance. Specifically, the PPS appears to be stronger in firms with greater block ownership, higher institutional ownership and more independent remuneration and nomination committees, but weaker in firms with larger boards and CEO duality. Our evidence implies that CG has a significant moderating effect on the PPS. This sheds new insights on the predictions of the OCT and MPH. The findings are generally robust across a raft of econometric models that address different types of endogeneities, <b>executive</b> director <b>pay,</b> and performance proxies.

2500|$|While {{contracts}} often determine {{wages and}} terms of employment, the law refuses to enforce contracts {{that do not}} observe basic standards of fairness for employees. Today, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 aims to create a national minimum wage, and a voice at work, especially through collective bargaining should achieve fair wages. A growing body of law also regulates <b>executive</b> <b>pay,</b> although a system of [...] "maximum wage" [...] regulation, for instance by the former Stabilization Act of 1942, is not currently in force. Historically, the law actually suppressed wages, not of the highly paid, by ordinary workers. For example, in 1641 the Massachusetts Bay Colony legislature (dominated by property owners and the official church) required wage reductions, and said rising wages [...] "tende to the ruin of the Churches and the Commonwealth". In the early 20th century, democratic opinion demanded everyone had a minimum wage, and could bargain for fair wages beyond the minimum. But when states tried to introduce new laws, the US Supreme Court held them unconstitutional. A right to [...] "freedom of contract", argued a majority, could be construed from the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment's protection against being deprived [...] "of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". Dissenting judges argued that [...] "due process" [...] {{did not affect the}} legislative power to create social or economic rights, because employees [...] "are not upon a full level of equality of choice with their employer".|$|E
