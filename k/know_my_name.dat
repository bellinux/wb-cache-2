500|$|In January 1996, {{the song}} was issued as the B-side to [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] on a blue-vinyl jukebox single, {{as part of a}} series of Beatles {{releases}} by Capitol Records' CEMA Special Markets division. By 1999, [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] remained one of only two post-1963 Beatles songs not to have been made available in true stereo (the other being [...] "You <b>Know</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> (Look Up the Number)"). That year, a stereo version became available when the track was remixed for inclusion on the album Yellow Submarine Songtrack, which accompanied the re-release of the animated film. Harrison said that the 1999 reissue was timely, given that the Blue Meanies [...] "have got a bigger stranglehold on the planet right now than they ever had back in 1967!", adding that [...] "even the music industry has turned grey and is dominated by Blue Meanies." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Up", {{the opening}} track, is a mid-tempo number backed by dance, pop and {{electronic}} beats, and has [...] "a more mature pop-techno sound" [...] than Duff's previous work. Its instrumentation includes a guitar, bass and drums. Kelefa Anneth of The New York Times {{noted that the}} song contains musical influences of The Go-Go's. The lyrics of the song speak about having fun. Duff initially sings {{about the consequences of}} her fame and how people think they know [...] "everything about [...] " [...] ("There's people talking / They talk about me / They <b>know</b> <b>my</b> <b>name</b> / They think they know everything / But they don't know anything about me"). As the chorus draws near, the song takes on a [...] "party anthem" [...] approach, where Duff discusses the [...] "struggle" [...] for joy and self-confidence: [...] "I know I make mistakes / I'm living life day to day / It's never really easy but it's OK..." [...] According to Duff, the song [...] "makes you want to forget about all the pressure of dealing with your boss, or your teacher, or your mom, or ," [...] and lyrically discusses [...] "getting out and not forgetting to have some fun." [...] Duff has also said the song also [...] "talks about being in all [...] favorite places in the world, which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York." [...] "Beat of My Heart", the third track on the album, is inspired by the new wave genre. The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres. It carries a [...] "soft electronic pop" [...] sound and has the heart beat sound as its base. According to Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine, the word 'beat of my heart' is repeated forty-four times in the song.|$|E

On 26 November 1969, four months after contributor Brian Jones drowned in his swimming pool, Lennon edited [...] "You <b>Know</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> (Look Up the Number)", reducing the length from 6:08 to 4:19, a more suitable length for a single.

2500|$|The single {{used the}} same cover {{photographs}} as the Let It Be album, and was originally released on 6 March 1970, backed by [...] "You <b>Know</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> (Look Up the Number)", with a production credit for George Martin. This version includes orchestration and backing vocals overdubbed on 4 January 1970, {{under the supervision of}} Martin and McCartney, with backing vocals that included the only known contribution by Linda McCartney to a Beatles song. It was during this same session that Harrison recorded the second overdubbed guitar solo. The intention at one point was to have the two overdub solos playing together. This idea was dropped for the final mix of the single, and only the 30 April solo was used, although the 4 January overdub can be heard faintly during the final verse. Martin mixed the orchestration very low in this version.|$|E
