5|$|Kessiakoff {{moved into}} his highest overall {{position}} after stage 12, occupying third overall just nine seconds behind the race leader. Kessiakoff at last cracked on stage 14, finishing 21st two minutes off the pace on La Farrapona. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> time in {{hand over the}} bulk of the field, however, that he slipped only to sixth overall. Kessiakoff badly cracked in the next stage, losing almost 22 minutes and falling to 26th overall. Kiserlovski then became the team's top overall rider. He took ninth on stage 18 into Noja, part of a breakaway that took over seven minutes against the race's top riders. The result installed him into 16th place overall. He ended the Vuelta in 18th, as Astana's best-placed rider. Kessiakoff's final position was 34th, and Kashechkin was 89th.|$|E
25|$|Frank's {{style was}} very innovative, {{which was why}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> {{difficulty}} with early acceptance. He would bend notes and sing about the chordal context of a note rather than to sing the note directly, and he stressed each rhythmic downbeat, which {{was different from the}} smooth balladeer of his time.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{after taking}} part in Andrew Denton's Better Off Dead podcast, Hawke added his voice to calls for {{voluntary}} euthanasia to be legalised. Hawke labelled as 'absurd' the lack of political will to fix the problem. He revealed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> an arrangement with his wife Blanche should such a devastating medical situation occur.|$|E

25|$|His highest score, coincidentally, was 30 in both {{forms of}} the game. By {{the end of his}} career, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a {{reputation}} for poor batting that the crowd would cheer every ball he faced. Whether this was in appreciation of his batting or an attempt to wind up the bowling side is open to interpretation. Walsh is a much loved and respected cricketer and the West Indies have arguably yet to find a fast bowler with anything approaching his talents.|$|E
25|$|Russert {{does not}} recall stating to Libby, in this conversation, {{anything}} about the wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson. Although he could not completely {{rule out the possibility}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> an exchange, Russert was at a loss to remember it, and moreover, he believes that this would be the type of conversation that he would or should remember. Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis and it is difficult to reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
25|$|Bodine's racing career {{seemed to}} be on track right from the start as his father and grandfather, Eli Bodine Jr. and Sr. built Chemung Speedrome just a year after he was born. He began {{learning}} his racing skills at this track in the micro-midget division when he was only five years old. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> an itch to race that he disguised himself as a lady and entered a Powderpuff Division Race when he was 15. In 2011, he drove for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, alternating between the Nos. 35 and 36 teams, with sponsorship from Luke & Associates.|$|E

25|$|Born in 1882 {{and brought}} up at Hurlditch Court, near Tavistock near the Devon–Cornwall border, Henry Morshead was the eldest son of Reginald Morshead, a banker, and Ella Mary Morshead, née Sperling. He was educated at Winchester College where he did {{reasonably}} well and at a second attempt passed the exams to enter the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, to become {{an officer in the}} Royal Engineers in 1901. At the Chatham Royal School of Military Engineering <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a distinguished record that in 1904 he was posted to the Indian Army in the Royal Engineers' Military Works Services at Agra.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> poor {{support that}} Northamptonshire only twice reached 300 in an innings {{and in one}} game against Worcestershire he scored 141 out of 199 before being ninth out, Bakewell {{improved}} considerably upon his 1934 form and played with considerable success in two Tests against South Africa. Northamptonshire's dependence upon him was starkly seen in that he averaged 42 an innings and nobody else did better than 23. The following year he was not as consistent, {{but in the last}} match he played a magnificent unbeaten innings of 241 against the strong bowling of Derbyshire - who had sealed their only ever County Championship title - to almost give Northamptonshire an elusive victory.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} in May 1914, he became the stablemaster of Dewanoumi stable. It had been a minor heya when he had first joined it, but even while still an active wrestler Hitachiyama had trained many wrestlers, such as later yokozuna Tachiyama Mineemon, {{even though they were}} not members of his stable. He was a masterful recruiter and coach. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> charisma and personality {{that he was able to}} tempt many wrestlers away from the less successful Osaka and Kyoto based sumo associations, which caused friction between the rival organisations. As head coach he produced many top division wrestlers, including no fewer than three yokozuna: Ōnishiki Uichirō, Tochigiyama Moriya and Tsunenohana Kan'ichi. At the stable's peak he was in charge of two hundred wrestlers. To feed them, he devised the chankonabe style of food preparation which still prevails in sumo today.|$|E

500|$|In another {{interview}} he added, [...] "It was exciting {{to work for}} him [...] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people. One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you'd never heard before... <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a great understanding... he loved actors so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Boswell and Johnson {{discussed}} the subject during their 1773 {{tour of the}} Hebrides. Boswell wrote: [...] "After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange’s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M’Leod would {{let it be known}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{biography}} Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness, written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early {{attachment to the}} story of E.T. After a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an animatronic robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged Jackson, the singer stated with wonderment, [...] "He was so real that I was talking to him. I kissed him before I left. The next day, I missed him." [...] Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of Ebony magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a strong connection to the character: ...|$|E

500|$|Balotelli {{has been}} the subject of {{numerous}} newspaper stories since joining Manchester City; some have been confirmed as true while others have turned out to be erroneous. Within days of joining Manchester City, Balotelli was involved in a car crash. It was reported that Balotelli was carrying £5,000 cash at the time – and that when a police officer asked why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a large sum of cash Balotelli replied: [...] "Because I am rich". Off-field activities involving Balotelli have included driving into a women's prison in Italy to [...] "have a look round", and throwing darts at a youth team player during a training ground 'prank' – all of which have been confirmed to be true. Balotelli has also been subjected to tabloid rumours about him confronting a bully in a school after querying why a young Manchester City fan was not attending classes, and giving £1,000 to a homeless man on the streets of Manchester. Both of these reports turned out to be false.|$|E
500|$|On August 7, 2005, {{just after}} 11:30p.m. EDT, Charles Gibson broke into local {{news in the}} eastern U.S. and regular {{programming}} on ABC's western affiliates to announce Jennings's death from lung cancer. He read a short statement from the family, and disclosed that Jennings had died in his New York apartment with his fourth wife, two children by his marriage to Kati Marton, and sister at his side. The anchor's ABC colleagues, including Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Ted Koppel, shared their thoughts on Jennings's death. The next morning, Brokaw and Rather fondly remembered their former rival on the morning news shows. [...] "Peter, {{of the three of}} us, was our prince," [...] said Brokaw on Today. [...] "He seemed so timeless. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> élan and style." [...] Canada's television networks led off their morning news shows with the news of Jennings' death and had remembrances from their [...] "big three" [...] anchors, Peter Mansbridge at the CBC, Lloyd Robertson at CTV, and Kevin Newman (himself a former colleague of Jennings at ABC) at Global.|$|E
500|$|Being very {{handsome}} in his person, {{and of a}} tall stature, his lordship one day attended King William's court, and being admitted into the presence-chamber, asserted the privilege of being covered before his majesty, by walking to and fro with his hat on his head. The king observing him, sent one of his attendants to inquire the reason of his appearance before him with his head covered; to whom he replied, he knew very well in whose presence he stood, {{and the reason why}} he wore his hat that day was, because he stood before the king of England. This answer being told the king, and his lordship approaching nearer the throne, was required by his majesty to explain himself, which he did to this effect: [...] "May it please your majesty, my name is Courcy, and I am Lord of Kingsale in your kingdom of Ireland: the reason of my appearing covered in your majesty's presence is, to assert the ancient privilege of my family, granted to sir John de Courcy, earl of Ulster, and his heirs, by John, king of England, for him and his successors for ever." [...] The king replied, he remembered <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a nobleman, and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right, and giving him his hand to kiss, his lordship paid his obeisance, and remained covered.|$|E

500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a [...] "clean record {{they have got to}} try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E
