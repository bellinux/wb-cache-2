2500|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{a series}} of {{controversial}} military campaigns were launched, known as the War on Terror. In November 2001, shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan, the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Frankfurt, where Gorillaz won awards for Best Song and Best Dance. As Albarn and Jamie Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech after receiving the latter award, Albarn wore a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. In his speech, he said [...] "So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [...] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

2500|$|Nkrumah {{read books}} about {{politics}} and divinity, and tutored students in philosophy. In 1943 Nkrumah met Trinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, Russian expatriate Raya Dunayevskaya, and Chinese-American Grace Lee Boggs, {{all of whom were}} members of an American-based Trotskyist intellectual cohort. Nkrumah later credited James with teaching him [...] "how an underground movement worked." [...] Federal Bureau of Investigation files on Nkrumah, kept from January to May 1945, identify him as a possible communist. Nkrumah was determined to go to London, wanting to continue his education there now that the Second World War had ended. James, in a 1945 letter introducing Nkrumah to Trinidad-born George Padmore in London, wrote: [...] "This young man is coming to you. He is not very bright, but nevertheless <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> for him because he's determined to throw Europeans out of Africa." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smerage's mother {{learned of}} her son's {{expulsion}} {{when she opened}} Greenough's letter {{and the next day}} initiated a yearlong series of letters on his behalf. She spoke of her [...] "stricken home" [...] and her son's history of illness. Ultimately, she questioned the Court's entire approach: [...] "I feel now that you men could have done much good had you perhaps had a little less sense of justice and a little more of the spirit of Jesus in your hearts." [...] Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: [...] "I am taking the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{while he}} was {{traveling}} to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> with the rest of your life. You are still a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity. Your mother, your lawyer, people said some nice things about you, but what you did, not only to yourself, but to perhaps thousands, hundreds of victims, heroin users in this country is a terrible thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelmâ€™s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to you to help me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war.
