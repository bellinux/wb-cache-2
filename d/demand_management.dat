40|$|With an {{increasing}} share of electric energy produced from non-dispatchable renewable sources both energy storage and <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> might gain tremendously in importance. While {{there has been}} significant progress in general properties and technologies of energy storage, the systematic characterization of features particular to <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> such as its intermittent, time-dependent potential seems to be lagging behind. As a consequence, the development of efficient and sustainable strategies for <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> and its integration into large-scale energy system models are impeded. This work introduces a novel framework for a systematic time-resolved characterization {{of the potential for}} <b>demand</b> side <b>management.</b> It is based on the specification of individual devices both with respect to their scheduled demand and their potential of load shifting. On larger scales sector-specific profiles can straightforwardly be taken into account. The potential for <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> is then specified in terms of size and capacity of an equivalent storage device. This intermediate layer of abstraction isolates the gross effects and opportunities of <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> from questions concerning the operation of individual devices, which eases the integration of the results in existing schemes for the commitment of production units and system models. The novel framework is applicable for conceptual or predictive approaches and for real-time optimization and operation of energy systems involving <b>demand</b> side <b>management.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|On {{behalf of}} Halmstads Energi och Miljö (HEM) this paper investigates the {{possibilities}} to reduce power peaks in their district heating production through <b>demand</b> side <b>management.</b> The purpose with {{this paper is to}} reduce the power peaks with 10 MW and investigate which customers or areas HEM should focus on. In addition, two bottlenecks in the district heating network are analyzed by the effects of <b>demand</b> side <b>management.</b> A theoretical model of <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> was constructed. The model uses hourly data from production and endeavor to daily average values. The model also included parameters such as storage capacity and manipulated outdoor temperature. The results from <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> relates to the total daily variations of the district heating system. The <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> has been applied to a selection of 214 substations and three independent <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> schemes for the year of 2016, one for each bottleneck and one for the total 214 substations. The choice of substations for <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> is based on which buildings are connected to them. Criteria for the selection are buildings with high thermal mass, which give high thermal inertia and buildings with high heat demand (large apartment buildings). It is of great interest to investigate how <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> affects the indoor temperature in selected buildings because limit values cannot be exceeded. The result shows that the power peaks can be reduced by 11. 7 MW (mean value) for the whole year excluding the months of spring and summer and for the winter months 13. 1 MW (mean value). The reasons why the power peaks can be reduced to a greater extent during the winter months was due to a larger heat demand and heat load variations. Two bottleneck areas applied one theoretic <b>demand</b> side <b>management</b> scheme each where power peaks can be reduced by 0. 63 MW(mean value) and 0. 7 MW(mean value) excluding spring and summer months and 0. 71 and 0. 72 only including winter months. The profit from reducing the power peaks for HEM is shorter operating time for the peak heating boilers. The power peaks is later compensated and balanced with renewable bio energy. The simulation from 2016 brings a cost saving to 2. 7 million SEK. The profit comprises the cost difference between fossil fuels, natural gas and renewable fuels such as wooden chips.
