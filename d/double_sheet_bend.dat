50|$|The {{structure}} of the bowline is identical {{to that of the}} <b>sheet</b> <b>bend,</b> except the bowline forms a loop in one rope and the <b>sheet</b> <b>bend</b> joins two ropes.

50|$|One type of weaver's knot is topologically {{equivalent}} to a <b>sheet</b> <b>bend,</b> but is tied (usually in smaller stuff) with a different approach. <b>Sheet</b> <b>bends</b> are also used for netting.Notice that, to have any strength, the two free ends should {{end up on the}} same side of the knot (see below). Under even moderate load, a left-hand <b>sheet</b> <b>bend</b> will quickly slip and release completely.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study of}} 8 {{different}} bends using climbing rope of equal diameter said the sheet bend was weak. In one test, it pulled apart {{with less than}} half the pressure that other knots withstood. The authors recommend [...] "2 half hitches on the bend back line and overhand knot on turn thru line." [...] Even with these, it was always a bottom performer and the <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>bend</b> did little better. The butterfly bend did best, but the double fisherman's knot was recommended for being easier to untie.|$|E
40|$|Knot {{strength}} {{is very important}} in processing ropes than other textile products. Thus double sheet bends are usually used in rope mills, because their knots are small and strong in order to tie two threads of yarn. These knots have been made by manual operation. These mills, therefore, are demanding {{to be able to make}} these knots automatically in order to improve process efficiency. In this study, we have developed a knotter which is able to form a <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>bend</b> by using a set of molds. First, we designed a path to carve tracks on the surface of the mold by using the Dowker notation. But this path was too complicated to thread yarn through the path easily. Furthermore, it is desired that the knotter can be carried by a worker in rope mills. We, therefore, have moved and/or composed paths in order to obtain the simpler path for double sheet bends. Finally, we have integrated these molds and instruments such as air cylinders and linear guide ways in order to make a <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>bend</b> knot automatically. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|E

40|$|Control of {{groundwater}} moving using sheet pile {{is very important}} for minimizing the potential {{of groundwater}} contamination. Present study aims to control the contaminant transport through soil by using equal <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles. Physical sand box model was implemented symmetrically in order to examine the effect of depths of <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles, distance between them and distance of contaminant upstream the sheet piles. The regional contaminated porous field is studied numerically using simulation software MODEFLOW and M 3 DMS. Average absolute difference time between experimental and numerical results that contamination moved from upstream to point under the second sheet pile and arrives the surface of soil at downstream, equals 9. 31 % and 6. 11 % respectively. Design charts are presented for quantifying the effects of equal <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles on the hydraulic control of the groundwater flow field. From the charts, the <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles depth can be selected according to the needed condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{allusion to}} <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles(DSP) global optimal solution, the {{response}} surface(RS) technique based on Uniform Design- Support Vector Machine(UD-SVM) {{was introduced to}} build the RS by nonparametric regression, thus to avoid the complex non-linear RS form between the <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles parameters and indexes under the current standard. Use the Monte Carlo simulation as generator to produce samples, the RS can do considerable and non-repetitive efficiency prediction and get global optimal value satisfying to the target value with high accuracy and stability, also without figuring out the explicit formulations. This article applied the method to a <b>double</b> <b>sheet</b> piles optimal design, and took minimum engineering quantity as criterion to screen for the optimal parameters aiming at illustrating the feasibility...|$|R

40|$|The {{hardness}} is {{a resistance}} {{for the local}} plastic deformation producing the stress field itself. The hardness number, therefore, is affected by applied or residual stresses. In order to clarify the influences of residual stresses on the hardness numbers quantitatively, shot peening and <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> were performed for a medium carbon steel (C: 0. 45 %). Hardness and residual stress measurements were made using a micro-Vickers hardness tester and a X-ray diffractometer respectively. The following results are obtained; (1) Hardness numbers increase in the compressive stress field induced by shot peening. (2) The maximum hardness increment was 13 HV in the compressive stress field. (3) The influences of compressive residual stresses induced by shot peening on the hardness number {{are similar to the}} case of <b>sheet</b> <b>bending.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} carry out design of a small scale {{electrically}} powered bending machine for a developing nation, case for Zimbabwe. The bending of metal is of great importance {{in the manufacture of}} products such as nut shelling machines and maize shelling machines. Currently being used at Company X engineering is a manual bending machine with a single operation hence this design will help {{to increase the number of}} metals being bent, an increase in the efficiency and production. The paper deals with manufacturing or <b>bending</b> of <b>sheet</b> metal by using power operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine. Especially discussion made the productivity analysis of manually or power operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine. Considering manual operation is replaced by power operated devices. It also gives information about limitation of manually operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine and power operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine. The existing machines are limited to a single operation. The aim of the research is to increase the number of bent parts and to place an adjustable table to suit the height of the user thereby reducing back pain internal injuries in the long run. The researchers visited the Company X to gather information concerning the problems faced by the employees. Material tests which are of great value were carried out and the use of software. A Plate Rolling Machine is a machine that will roll different kinds of metal sheet into a round or conical shape and a rod bending machine will roll or bend different kinds of metal sheet into right angles or circular shapes. The research aims at making it possible to do the operations on a single machine. We recommend the machine to be automated and the use of a servo motor to reduce human injuries at the workshop. Use of oils and maintenance is of great value to increase the life span of the machine...|$|R
