25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{approach}} to study the alteration of D/H ratios of kerogen during catagenesis: 1)laboratory incubation of organic matter that enables mechanistic study with controlled experiments. 2)natural sample measurement that provides information of combined effects over geological timescales. The complex composition and chemistry of kerogen complicates the results. Nevertheless, most research on hydrogen isotopes of kerogen show D enrichment with increasing maturity. Type II kerogen(marine derived) from New Albany Shale is reported to have δD rise from -120‰ to -70‰ as vitrinite reflectance increase from 0.3% to 1.5%. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for enrichment. One of them is kinetic fractionation during hydrocarbon generation while the other is <b>isotopic</b> <b>exchange</b> with surrounding water. Anhydrous incubation experiments have shown that the products are generally more depleted in D than their precursors, causing enrichment in residual kerogen. Schimmelmann et al. studied the relationship between terrestrially-derived oil and their source rock kerogens from four Australian Basins. They found that on average the oil is depleted to corresponding kerogen by 23‰. Hydrous incubation experiments suggest that 36-79% of bulk organic hydrogen may come from water at moderate maturity. While still under debate, it appears likely that incorporation of water hydrogen isotopes is the more dominant process for kerogen D- enrichment during catagenesis.|$|E

The first precondition for understanding biological effects is to evaluate the chemical structure as well as the conformation of the studied compounds correctly. For this purpose, solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with mass spectrometry is the most frequently used method. Not only the structure, but also physico- chemical properties can be investigated using NMR spectroscopy, for instance, conformational changes, tautomeric forms, protonation sites, acido-basic properties, non-covalent interactions, <b>isotopic</b> <b>exchanges</b> or interactions with biomolecules.

25|$|Almost all of {{the organic}} {{hydrogen}} is exchangeable to some extent. <b>Isotopic</b> <b>exchange</b> of organic hydrogen will reorder the distribution of deuterium and often incorporate external hydrogen. Generally, more mature materials are more substantially exchanged. With effective exchange, aliphatic hydrogen can finally reach isotopic equilibrium at the final stage. Equilibrium fractionation factor varies among different hydrogen sites. For example, aliphatic hydrogen isotope fractionation depends on the carbon atom that the hydrogen atom bonds with. To the first order, alkyl hydrogen isotope composition follows this trend: δDPrimary carbon < δDSecondary carbon < δDTertiary carbon. The fractionation factors between carbon sites also decrease with increasing temperature. This can be potentially used as a thermo-history indicator. The fractionation between whole molecule and water can be estimated by averaging all hydrogen-positions, and {{this leads to a}} relatively small variation of equilibrium fractionation between different groups of hydrocarbons and water. A theoretical prediction estimated this to be -80‰ to -95‰ for steranes, -90‰ to -95‰ for hopanes, and -70‰ to -95‰ for typical cycloparaffins between 0°C to 100°C. At the temperature of the oil window and gas window, the equilibrium fractionation between different group of organic molecules is relatively small, as compared with large primary signals.|$|E

2500|$|Oil is {{generally}} {{a product of}} thermal breakdown of type I and type II kerogen during catagenesis. The deuterium content should reflect the source kerogen signal, generation fractionation, <b>isotopic</b> <b>exchange</b> and other maturation effects. The thermal maturation at the oil window can erase much of the primary signals of hydrogen isotopes. The formation of oil involves breaking C-C and C-H bonds, resulting in depletion of 13C and D in the products and enrichment in the residual reactants due to kinetic isotope effects. Yongchun Tang and his colleagues modeled this process based on laboratory-calibrated kinetics data {{and found that the}} frequency factor ratio for D/H is 1.07. Moreover, oil is also affected by the isotope fractionation from phase-change. However, the behavior of oil gas-liquid fractionation differs from water as the vapor phase of oil is enriched in D. This will deplete residual oil as it gets evaporated. Biological degradation of oil is also expected to fractionate hydrogen isotopes, as enzymatic breaking of C-H bond have a normal kinetic isotope effect. Several degradation experiments show that this fractionation {{is generally}} mild, ranging from -11‰ to -79‰. This process should also enrich partially degraded oil. Finally, oil stored in a reservoir often had migrated through subsurface (also known as [...] "geochromatography") from another source region, interacting with water. No data has been published to confirm the fractionation associated with migration, yet theoretical prediction shows that this is likely to be very small.|$|E

The roots behaved as a K+/H+ exchange system. By comparing the results in normal or hypoxic conditions, or in the presence of vanadate, it was possible to distinguish the active components of {{membrane potential}} and transports from the passive ones. The magnitude of the electrogenic potential was not related to the active H+ extrusion rate. At pH 6, the variations of the electrogenic potential resulted from variations of the stoichiometry of the active H+/K+ exchange. The same relationship between this stoichiometry and the K+ concentration was observed in conditions ensuring different membrane polarizations (pH 6, pH 4, or pH 6 with fusicoccin). Both metabolic and Mg-ATPase specific inhibitors stopped the active H+ transport and the net K+ influx. Nevertheless, the tracer influx in the presence of vanadate remained higher than the passive influx calculated from the permeability coefficient determined in hypoxia.

40|$|Changes {{in marine}} primary {{production}} over geological time have influenced {{a network of}} global biogeochemical cycles with corresponding feedbacks on climate. However, these changes continue to remain largely unquantified because of uncertainties in calculating global estimates from sedimentary palaeoproductivity indicators.

Such a requirement would be compatible with accelerated rates of continental weathering under the greenhouse conditions of the Mesozoic and early Tertiary.

2500|$|Deuterium {{abundance}} can {{be useful}} in tracking migration of various animals. Animals with metabolically inert tissue (e.g. feathers or hair) will have synthesized that tissue using hydrogen from source water and food but ideally not incorporate subsequent water {{over the course of the}} migration. Because δD tends to vary geographically, the difference between animal tissue δD and post-migration water δD, after accounting for the biological fractionation of assimilation, can provide information regarding animal movement. In monarch butterflies, for example, wing chitin is metabolically inert after it has been built, so it can reflect the isotopic composition of the environmental water at the time and location of wing growth. This then creates a record of butterfly origin and can be used to determine migration distance. This approach can also be used in bats and birds, using hair and feathers, respectively. Since rainwater becomes depleted as elevation is increased, this method can also track altitudinal migration. However, this is technically difficult to do, and the resolution appears to be too poor to track small altitudinal changes. [...] Deuterium is most useful in tracking movement of species between areas with large continental water variation, because species movement can be complicated by the similarity of local water δD values between different geographic regions. For example, source water from Baja California may have the same δD as water from Maine. Further, a proportion of the hydrogen isotope composition within the tissue can exchange with water and complicate the interpretation of measurements. In order to determine this percentage of <b>isotopic</b> <b>exchange,</b> which varies according to local humidity levels, standards of metabolically inert tissue from the species of interest can be constructed and equilibrated to local conditions. This allows measured δD from different geographic regions to be compared against each other.|$|E

The simulation {{results show that the}} 18 O compositions of leaf water and the ABL CO 2 are moderately sensitive to wind speed. The variations in the 18 O composition of water vapour are an order of magnitude greater than those in the 13 C and 18 O compositions of CO 2 both at turbulent eddy scales and across the capping inversion. In a fully-developed convective ABL, these isotopic compositions are well mixed as with other conserved atmospheric quantities. The Keeling intercepts determined with the simulated high-frequency turbulence time series do not give a reliable estimate of the 18 O composition of the surface water vapour flux and may be a reasonable approximation to the 13 C and 18 O compositions of the surface CO 2 flux in the late afternoon only after a deep convective ABL has developed.

We studied the effects of two supporting solutions, 0. 01 M CaCl 2 and deionized water, on Et values in 27 calcareous agricultural soils. For three soils, Et was also measured after adding increasing phosphate quantities as KH 2 PO 4, and equilibrating for 24 h, to assess changes in Et with phosphate concentration in solution (Cp). In unamended and phosphate-enriched soils, Cp(CaCl 2) was smaller than and related to Cp(H 2 O). The initial rapidly and the subsequent slowly isotopically exchangeable phosphate were both affected by the use of CaCl 2 solution. Since both the rapid and slow isotopically exchangeable phosphate are Cp dependent, the overall effect of CaCl 2 solution was analyzed considering two components: (i) a nonspecific effect attributed to the decrease in Cp and (ii) a specific effect attributed to phosphate reactions (i. e., adsorption or precipitation) in calcareous soils. Modifications in Et are the result of both nonspecific and specific effects. The change in Et due to the use of 0. 01 M CaCl 2 instead of deionized water varies with the soil sample, and can be positive, negative or nil depending on the time of exchange. For instance, after 24 h of exchange, the ratio {[E 24 h(CaCl 2) − E 24 h(H 2 O) ] 100 /E 24 h(H 2 O) } ranged from − 30 to 340 % for the 27 soils.
