500|$|Although {{officials}} {{downplayed the}} level of threat the trio presented to Obama, they said they planned further investigations into how a gang of supposedly small-time criminals collected such a massive arsenal. Authorities believed the men had at least some white supremacist involvement, although experts at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the radical right, said no evidence existed linking any of them to a white supremacist group. Nevertheless, the possible connections prompted FBI officials, who originally considered the threat [...] "relatively minor", to develop stronger concerns about whether the motives from the three plotters could have been connected to a larger organization. The FBI stated that with an African American candidate for president, [...] "you are certainly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the general threat picture against any candidate and factor in the threats posed by those who preach hate and racism." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening in 2,362 theaters on March 2, 2007, {{the film}} grossed US$13.3 {{million in its}} opening weekend, placing second and posting a per-theater average of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by fellow opener Wild Hogs and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking 300. It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million {{in the rest of}} the world, {{bringing}} its current total to $84 million, above its estimated $65 million production budget. In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day {{was far too}} many. [...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. I sure wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the USA Today. [...] "But I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as a negative. This is a tribute for what the man has done, a day to celebrate." [...] Garret Anderson, Los Angeles Angels left fielder, told the USA Today that he won't wear number 42 because [...] "I just don't feel I'm worthy of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Derrickson and Marvel had {{originally}} discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel {{felt that they}} would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer, with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead. Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started [...] "pestering" [...] Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked [...] "all afternoon, and the fit was right", but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not [...] "take that answer. Call them back, tell them there’s a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room", and after talking with Marvel for [...] "another three or four hours" [...] he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film. Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a [...] "fully-formed" [...] sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that [...] "the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it." [...] Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as [...] "little things" [...] from Spaihts, [...] "like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple." [...] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of [...] "nightmares themselves as being a dimension", but Feige felt [...] "getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension" [...] would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, [...] "the most present villain in the comics", became the film's main villain.|$|E

2500|$|Zeman {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} visit Moscow for the 2015 Victory Day celebrations and the 70th anniversary of the liberation from Nazi Germany. He said that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> military equipment, but rather to honour the soldiers who had sacrificed their lives. He described his visit to Moscow as an [...] "expression of thankfulness that we in this country don't have to speak German, if we would have become submissive collaborators of Aryan origin", and that [...] "we don't have to say Heil Hitler, Heil Himmler, Heil Göring, and eventually Heil Heydrich, that would have been particularly interesting". Most other EU leaders declared that they would not attend the events due to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro criticized the decision, saying that it would [...] "be awkward" [...] if Zeman was the only politician from the EU at the ceremony. Zeman responded by banning him from the Prague Castle.|$|E
2500|$|Eyvind Earle joined Walt Disney Productions in 1951 first {{employed}} {{as an assistant}} background painter for Peter Pan before being promoted as a full-fledged background painter in the Goofy cartoon, [...] "For Whom the Bulls Toil" [...] and the color stylist of the Academy Award-winning short, Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom. For Sleeping Beauty, Earle said he [...] "felt totally free to put my own style" [...] into the paintings he based on Hench's drawings stating [...] "Where his trees might have curved, I straightened them out…. I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style." [...] Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in Italian Renaissance utilizing works from Albrecht Dürer, Pieter Bruegel, Nicolaas van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, as well as Persian art and Japanese prints. When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative divisions. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings [...] "lacked the mood {{in a lot of}} things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's all well and good, but who the hell's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that? [...] The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like Christmas cards." [...] Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before Sleeping Beauty was completed, to take a job at the John Sutherland studio. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.|$|E

2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E
