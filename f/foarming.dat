40|$|Summary. Was {{studied the}} {{technology}} of producing aerated candies "Souffle" with replacement of sugar to molasses with increased shelf life, molded by "jetting" with a vacuum syringe with continuous action, which {{is used in the}} meat industry, into metallized film type "flow-pack ". Studied the process of foaming disperse systems. Studied the process of gelation and gelation affected by various factors. To establish a relationship between the effective viscosity and jelly mass of gelation ability of agar were achieved the dependence according to the effective viscosity of the jelly mass shear rate and a shear rate on the shear stress at temperature of 65 ˚C and a mass fraction of solids of 78 %. Viscosity reduction has a positive effect on the process of molding molasses candies by the "extrusion". Were definede values of the plastic strength of jelly masses and found that replacing sugar to molasses reduces the plastic strength, but it does not affect a good form-stable ability. Cinnamon was added into the prescription whipped composition to improve the nutritional value of products. Were defined organoleptic, physical and chemical qualities, calculated energy value of the products. High hygroscopic souffle on molasses requires hermetic packaging. Proposed a new progressive method of forming a souffle with a vacuum syringe with continuous action, which is used in the meat industry to form sausages. Curing and structure <b>foarming</b> implemented directly in the shell for 2 h, which is an important advantage of this method. Whipped products on molasses are functional...|$|E
5000|$|Auke, pron. ˈaukə, is a {{quite common}} West Frisian {{masculine}} given name. It {{seems to have}} been a diminutive <b>foarm</b> originally (-ke is one of the most common diminutive suffices in West Frisian), which developed from the historic form Auwe or Auwen. According to onomatologist Rienk de Haan, Auwe was a very reduced form of certain Germanic names, possibly starting with Alf- (meaning [...] "supernatural" [...] of [...] "nature spirit").|$|R
40|$|The {{surface-active}} {{and optical}} properties of surfactant specimen Comperlan KD have been recearched using various methods of analysis. The surface activity, adsorption, micelle formation and solubilization quantitative characteristics have been determined, hydrophilic-lipophilic balance has been calculated. It is shown that specimen Comperlan KD {{can be used}} with anionic surfactant specimens as a component of hygienic detergent. It was confirmed that this surfactant specimen performs the functions of stabilizer of <b>foarm</b> and solubilizer of essential oil...|$|R
