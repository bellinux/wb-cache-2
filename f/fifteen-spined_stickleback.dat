50|$|The {{maximum size}} of the best-known species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), is about 4 inches, but few of them are more than 3 inches long. They mature sexually at a length of about 2 inches. Most other stickleback species are roughly similar in size or {{somewhat}} smaller. The only exception is the far larger <b>fifteen-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Spinachia spinachia), which can reach 22 cm (approx. 8.7 inches).|$|E
50|$|Spinachia spinachia, the sea stickleback, {{also known}} as <b>fifteen-spined</b> or fifteenspine <b>stickleback,</b> is a species of stickleback which lives in benthopelagic and in {{brackish}} environments of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. This species, {{the largest of the}} sticklebacks, grows to a length of 22 cm SL. This species is the only known member of its genus Spinachia. It is of no interest as a commercial fish.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fifteen-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> is {{a solitary}} fish and a {{predator}} that lurks among concealing vegetation ready {{to pounce on}} plankton and fish fry which drift too close. Breeding takes place in May and June among bladderwrack, the male building a nest out of bits of seaweed. He then guards the eggs and fans them with his fins until they hatch. He continues {{to care for the}} fry until they have absorbed the contents of their egg yolks and can feed for themselves. It is thought that the adult females die after spawning.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fifteen-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> is an {{elongated}} fish {{with a long}} slender snout, {{an elongated}} caudal peduncle about {{one third of the}} total length, and a fan-like rounded caudal fin. The anterior dorsal fin consists of a series of fourteen to fifteen small, widely separated spines. The posterior dorsal fin and the anal fin are aligned and are similar in size and shape and located immediately anterior to the caudal peduncle. The pelvic fins consist of spines. This fish is brownish-yellow with indistinct dark markings and a silvery belly. It grows to a maximum size of 22 cm, but the usual size range is 8 to 15 cm.|$|E
50|$|In 1845 {{he settled}} in Penzance {{as a medical}} practitioner, {{and in a few}} years became {{recognised}} as an able zoological observer. Within a few weeks of his arrival at Penzance he was elected one of the secretaries and curators of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, and he was for many years its president. His interesting annual addresses and many other papers on zoology by him are published in the Transactions of that society, vols. i. and ii. He contributed the third part (on the zoophytes) to the Cornish Fauna, written by his father; and an account of the natural history of West Cornwall to J.S. Courtney's Guide to Penzance, 1845. Other interesting papers on zoophytes, crustacea, and fishes were contributed by him to the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, the Reports of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, The Zoologist, Annals of Natural History, &c., all of which are recorded in Boase and Courtney's Bibliotheca Cornubiensis, i. 924, iii. 1138. Among these may be mentioned observations on the zoophytes of Cornwall, {{on the development of the}} frog, on the metamorphosis of the decapod crustaceans, and the natural history of the mackerel in the Polytechnic Reports for 1842 and 1844; and on the nest of the <b>fifteen-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> in the Penzance Natural History Transactions, ii. 7983. He contributed to John Ralfs's British Desmidieæ, 1848, and to Thomas Bell's British Stalk-eyed Crustacea, 1853.|$|E
40|$|In the <b>fifteen-spined</b> <b>stickleback,</b> Spinachia spinachia, males provide {{females with}} direct {{benefits}} by fanning, cleaning and guarding the offspring. Males announce their parental skills through intense body shakes during courtship. Females preferred {{to mate with}} more intensely shaking males. As a result, females got better fathers for their offspring, as such males achieved a higher hatching success. Not only did male behavioural cues attract females, but males also used their nests as extrabodily ornaments. The nest is held together with shiny secretional threads consisting of a glycoprotein. Females chose to spawn in nests with more secretional threads. A likely {{reason for this is}} that the threads are metabolically costly for the male to produce and the amount of secretion indicates a male's nutritional status, which is of great importance as parental duties are energetically costly. Moreover, females preferred nests built high up in the vegetation, as such nests were safer from egg predators. Competition with other males for females favoured males building higher nests than did their neighbours, probably because females preferred high nests. Male-male interactions, such as sneaking and egg stealing, caused decreased paternity among males in nature as assessed by a microsatellite analysis. Males adjusted their paternal effort according to their previous investment in the brood, but not according to paternity. Thus, female choice is based on multiple cues and results in better paternal care. Males invest in courtship, male-male competition, nest construction and paternal care, the outcome determining their success in mate attraction...|$|E
40|$|In {{externally}} fertilising fishes, {{various factors}} in the surrounding environment may influence {{the viability of the}} sperm and eggs, thus determining the success of reproduction. In this thesis, the influence of salinity and ovarian fluid on sperm motility has been investigated in three Gasterosteiform fishes. The three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, has successfully invaded fresh water and differs from most other fishes in its ability to spawn in waters of all salinities. Our results show that sperm of the three-spined is strongly stimulated by the ovarian fluid surrounding the eggs. In fresh water, where the period of motility is only about a minute, ovarian fluid prolongs motility to last several hours. We show that this effect is due to fluid’s ionic content and that the fluid remains in the nest, surrounding the eggs, for a prolonged time due to the proteins and/or other macromolecules in the fluid. Our results explain how successful spawning can occur in fresh water despite that it takes several minutes for all three-spined stickleback eggs to be fertilised. The stimulating effect of ovarian fluid {{may be one of the}} factors that have enabled the originally marine three-spined stickleback to colonise fresh water. The <b>fifteen-spined</b> <b>stickleback,</b> Spinachia spinachia, is exclusively marine. We found their sperm motility to be good in seawater, reduced in brackish water, and non-existent in freshwater. The presence of ovarian fluid made no difference in any salinity, a factor that might have contributed to their inability to colonise fresh water. Being regarded as a primitive member of the stickleback family, the lack of response to ovarian fluid suggests that this is not a primitive trait among the sticklebacks. The male straight-nose pipefish, Nerophis ophidion carries the eggs attached to its ventral surface. Fertilisation has previously been suggested to be external, but our results show that their sperm are not motile in seawater alone, but in a mixture of seawater and ovarian fluid. This result, together with the finding of some sperm in the female genital area, and that the sperm head is elongated, suggests that the fertilisation in the straight-nose pipefish occurs in close proximity with the eggs and ovarian fluid. This could then explain why the straight-nose pipefish has minute testes and complete confidence of paternity...|$|E
