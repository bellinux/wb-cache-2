The implementation of law enforcement againts criminal offense <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>using</b> of pukat harimau is done by both preventive and repressive acts. But in reality, the law enforcement in the field of fisheries has not yet received a bright spot in revealing any criminal offense <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>using</b> of pukat harimau. The writer suggests that, first, in conducting law enforcement againts criminal offense <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>using</b> of trawl <b>the</b> Police must increase the number of Police personnel because of the breadth of the territorial waters of which covers ine district, second, in facing any crime that occures the Police needs to add more facilities and infrastuctures required to carry out law enforcement, third, the law enforcement againts criminal offenses in Bengkalis is a common responsibillity, then law enforcement must go hand in hand with coastal communities and coordinate well so that a criminal offense <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>using</b> of trawl can be minimized...|$|R
