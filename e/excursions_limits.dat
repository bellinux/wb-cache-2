5000|$|A PEL {{is usually}} given as a time-weighted average (TWA), {{although}} some are short-term exposure limits (STEL) or ceiling limits. A TWA {{is the average}} exposure over a specified period, usually a nominal eight hours. This means that, for limited periods, a worker may be exposed to concentration excursions higher than the PEL, {{so long as the}} TWA is not exceeded and any applicable <b>excursion</b> <b>limit</b> is not exceeded. An <b>excursion</b> <b>limit</b> typically means that [...] "...worker exposure levels may exceed 3 times the PEL-TWA for no more than a total of 30 minutes during a workday, and under no circumstances should they exceed 5 times the PEL-TWA, provided thatthe PEL-TWA is not exceeded."

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} determinants of workplace exposures to ethylene oxide to assess {{the effect of the}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) 1984 ethylene oxide standard. METHODS: An in-depth survey of all hospitals in Massachusetts that used ethylene oxide from 1990 through 1992 (96 % participation, N = 90) was conducted. Three types of exposure events were modeled with logistic regression: exceeding the 8 -hour action level, exceeding the 15 -minute <b>excursion</b> <b>limit,</b> and worker exposures during unmeasured accidental releases. Covariates were drawn from data representing an ecologic framework including direct and indirect potential exposure determinants. RESULTS: After adjustment for frequencies of ethylene oxide use and exposure monitoring, a significant inverse relation was observed between exceeding the action level and the use of combined sterilizer-aerators, an engineering control technology developed after the passage of the OSHA standard. Conversely, the use of positive-pressure sterilizers that employ ethylene oxide gas mixtures was strongly related to both exceeding the <b>excursion</b> <b>limit</b> and the occurrence of accidental releases. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence of a positive effect of OSHA's ethylene oxide standard and specific targets for future prevention and control efforts...|$|R

The updated available standard is prescribed for asbestos whereby the permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 0.1 fiber per cubic centimetre of air over an 8 -h time-weighted average (TWA) with <b>excursion</b> <b>limit</b> (EL) of 1.0 asbestos fibers per cubic centimetre over 30 -min period. The employer must ensure {{that no one is}} exposed above this limit.

50|$|In loudspeakers, thermal {{capacities}} {{of the voice}} coils and magnet structures largely determine continuous power handling ratings. However, {{at the lower end}} of a loudspeaker's usable frequency range, its power handling might necessarily be derated because of mechanical <b>excursion</b> <b>limits.</b> For example, a subwoofer rated at 100 watts may be able to handle 100 watts of power at 80 hertz, but at 25 hertz it might not be able to handle nearly as much power since such frequencies would, for some drivers in some enclosures, force the driver beyond its mechanical limits much before reaching 100 watts from the amplifier.|$|R

Many of the buildings date from the 1940 `s to 1980 `s and contain asbestos-containing materials (ACM). Maintenance and Operation activities, as well as full scale asbestos abatement and repair, has been conducted for many years. One result of all this activity is that a substantial database of personal monitoring data has been collected. This database is a collection of reported (Fed OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) information, including 8 -hour Time Weighted Averages (TWA) and 30 -minute <b>Excursion</b> <b>Limit</b> (EL) samples.

5000|$|Ethylene oxide is toxic by inhalation, with an US OSHA {{permissible}} {{exposure limit}} calculated as a TWA (time weighted average) over 8 hours of 1 ppm, and a short term exposure <b>limit</b> (<b>excursion</b> <b>limit)</b> calculated as a TWA over 15 minutes of 5 ppm. [...] At concentrations in the air about 200 parts per million, ethylene oxide irritates mucous membranes of the nose and throat; higher contents cause damage to the trachea and bronchi, progressing into the partial collapse of the lungs. High concentrations can cause pulmonary edema and damage the cardiovascular system; the damaging effect of ethylene oxide may occur only after 72 hours after exposure. The maximum content of ethylene oxide in the air according to the US standards (ACGIH) is 1.8 mg/m3. NIOSH has determined that the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health level (IDLH) is 800 ppm.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} the health hazard of those exposed to methylene chloride by assessing its atmospheric concentration when a tear gas mixture was aerially dispersed. The concentration of methylene chloride ranged from 311. 1 – 980. 3  ppm (geometric mean 555. 8  ppm), 30 {{seconds after the}} dispersion started. However, the concentration fell rapidly to below 10  ppm after dispersion was completed.

Since methylene chloride is highly volatile (vapor pressure, 349  mmHg at 20  °C), the post-dispersion atmospheric concentration can rise instantaneously. Moreover, the o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitril e formulation of tear gas (CS gas) is an acute upper respiratory tract irritant. Therefore, tear gas mixtures should be handled with delicate care...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} long-term {{trends in}} ethylene oxide (EtO) worker exposures {{for the purposes}} of exposure surveillance and evaluation of the impacts of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1984 and 1988 EtO standards. We obtained exposure data from a large commercial vendor and processor of EtO passive dosimeters. Personal samples (87 582 workshift [8 -hr] and 46 097 short-term [15 -min] samples) from 2265 US hospitals were analyzed for time trends from 1984 through 2001 and compared with OSHA enforcement data. Exposures declined steadily for the first several years after the OSHA standards were set. Workshift exposures continued to taper off and have remained low and constant through 2001. However, since 1996, the probability of exceeding the short-term <b>excursion</b> <b>limit</b> has increased. This trend coincides with a decline in enforcement of the EtO standard. Results indicate the need for renewed intervention efforts to preserve gains made following the passage and implementation of the 1984 and 1988 EtO standards...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{characterized}} exposure-monitoring {{activities and}} findings under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) 1984 ethylene oxide (EtO) standard. METHODS: In-depth mail and telephone surveys {{were followed by}} on-site interviews at all EtO-using hospitals in Massachusetts (n = 92, 96 % participation rate). RESULTS: By 1993, most hospitals had performed personal exposure monitoring for OSHA's 8 -hour action level (95 %) and the <b>excursion</b> <b>limit</b> (87 %), although most {{did not meet the}} 1985 implementation deadline. In 1993, 66 % of hospitals reported the installation of EtO alarms to fulfill the standard's "alert" requirement. Alarm installation also lagged behind the 1985 deadline and peaked following a series of EtO citations by OSHA. From 1990 through 1992, 23 % of hospitals reported having exceeded the action level once or more; 24 % reported having exceeded the excursion limit; and 33 % reported that workers were accidentally exposed to EtO in the absence of personal monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Almost a decade after passage of the EtO standard, exposure-monitoring requirements were widely, but not completely, implemented. Work-shift exposures had markedly decreased since the mid- 1980 s, but overexposures continued to occur widely. OSHA enforcement appears to have stimulated implementation...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves xii, 66). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This project was requested by the Air Force Institute of Environment Safety and Health Risk Analysis to evaluate personal exposure to turbine engine exhaust. Quantifiable indicators of exhaust exposure were identified based on selected components of turboprop exhaust-soot-borne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), elemental carbon particulate matter and carbon dioxide. Since there were no U. S. occupational exposure limits (OELs) for the first two components, working OELs were chosen by analogy to assess exposure potential. Airborne concentrations of soot-borne PAH were compared with a working OEL of 0. 2 mg/m?, elemental carbon particulate matter with 0. 05 mg/m? and carbon dioxide with 5, 000 parts per million (volumetric) all on an 8 -hour time weighted average (TWA) basis. Breathing zone levels were less than 10 percent of working OELs. Estimated transient elemental carbon particulate concentrations periodically exceeded <b>excursion</b> <b>limits</b> for the working OEL (0. 15 mg/m? for 30 -min excursions and 0. 25 mg/m? for 5 -minute excursions). The primary health hazard associated with elemental carbon particles is that they serve as a vehicle for adsorbed PAH. Since PAH are relatively harmless compounds until metabolized by the body to their potent polar derivatives and <b>excursion</b> <b>limits</b> are "rules of thumb", bodily repair mechanisms are believed to keep pace with damaging mechanisms from short-term PAH exposures. The photoelectric aerosol sensor (PAS) is a quantitative instrument known to respond to particle-bound PAH. The PAS shows something is particle bound, but does not confirm that the photoactive species are exclusively PAH. Knowledge of the source being sampled reduces this uncertainty. The NIOSH Analytical Method 5506 for PAH did not detect any. I conclude that the PAS is useful for identifying turbine engine exhaust concentration gradients throughout the workplace. Its short averaging time permits correlation of work activities with exposure events and allows documenting process conditions in a near real-time and time history fashion. This instrument needs more developmental work before its response can be stated in terms of an OEL for turbine engine exhaust. TWA elemental carbon concentrations were highly correlated with computed averages of PAS output. Real-time carbon dioxide measurements with an electrochemical cell correlated poorly with PAS response...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of a permanent human scientific presence at the Martian poles requires the identification of a strategy for growth, from localized field parties to a permanent polar infrastructure. Using terrestrial polar stations as a template and experiences from the terrestrial High Arctic, four phases of Martian polar exploration are suggested. The first phase provides for six people to operate {{at the edge of}} the north polar cap for a Martian summer period (350 sol), with <b>excursions</b> <b>limited</b> to the immediate area < 5 km distant from the station. With intermediate phases, this limited access phase expands to a final fourth phase that allows for the presence of 6 over-winterers and 20 summer personnel at a permanent polar station. This station will provide opportunities for scientists to investigate the geology, chemistry and organic chemical/exobiological potential of the Martian polar caps. The station will ultimately provide the means for unsupported overland assaults on the Martian geographical poles to be accomplished. The equipment and logistics required to support field parties from a permanent Martian polar station are considered. Preliminary concepts are provided for techniques of station maintenance (Martian polar regions engineering) in the light of data on the extent of seasonal snow and ice deposition at the Martian poles.

Of the 181 Mt of asbestos produced worldwide, over 31 Mt was consumed in the U. S. The production and consumption of this mineral eventually was found to cause asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. While the brunt of the human exposure to asbestos occurred in insulation work, many more workers in other jobs were expose to asbestos fibers. Very {{little is known about the}} potential exposure to asbestos in research labs. Goal: In order to investigate potential research lab work exposures, we simulated lab work with various asbestos-containing items commonly found in research laboratories: 6 wire gauze pads, 3 gloves, 3 beaker tongs, and 3 Transite boards. All samples were analyzed by Phase Contrast Microscopy and, when appropriate, by Transmission Electron Microscopy and Polarized Light Microscopy. Results: All tested items were confirmed by bulk sampling to have asbestos fibers in their composition. Exposures from the 7 wire gauze pads were significantly lower than the PEL and the <b>excursion</b> <b>limit,</b> the highest exposure concentration measuring 0. 029 f/cc. For the 3 beaker tongs with asbestos sleeves, exposure was below the PEL for 2 of the 3, with one resulting in an exposure of 0. 160 f/cc (8 -h TWA = 0. 01 f/cc). For the Transite boards had the highest exposures of all tested items, with a maximum concentration of 0. 320 f/cc (8 -h TWA = 0. 02 f/cc).
