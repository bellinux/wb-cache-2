5|$|In September 1938, Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXD Horatius of Imperial Airways {{suffered}} damage to its port undercarriage and lower port wing in a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> at Lympne. The aircraft was repaired {{and returned to}} service.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1921, a Handley Page O/400 {{suffered}} {{engine failure}} shortly after passing Lympne {{on a flight}} from Paris to Croydon, resulting {{in the loss of}} a propeller. The aircraft made a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> at Lympne, damaging the undercarriage in the process.|$|E
5|$|Rudel's gunner from October 1941 was Erwin Hentschel, {{who served}} with Rudel {{for the next}} two and a half years, earning the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross during that period. He {{completed}} 1400 sorties with Rudel and drowned on 21 March 1944 when they were making their way to the German lines following a <b>forced</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E

5|$|A single Pe-3 was {{captured}} by the Finns when it {{had to make a}} <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> in marshy ground near Lake Inari on 28 November 1942. It was relatively undamaged and was recovered, repaired and placed into service as 'PE-301'. It served with PLeLv 48 and was converted into a photo-reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing raid on the airfield at Lappeenranta on 2 July 1944. By then, it had flown over 222 hours in Finnish service.|$|E
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's Luftflotte 1 was not {{involved}} in the preparations for the campaigns in the west. Instead it remained in the east on garrison duty, establishing new airbases and an Air Raid Precautions network in occupied Poland. However, after the Mechelen Incident, in which an aircraft made a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> in Belgium with copies of the German invasion plan, Göring relieved the commander of Luftflotte 2, General der Flieger Hellmuth Felmy, of his command, and appointed Kesselring in his place. Kesselring flew to his new headquarters at Münster the very next day, 13 January 1940. As Felmy's chief of staff, Generalmajor Josef Kammhuber, had also been relieved, Kesselring brought his own chief of staff, Generalmajor Wilhelm Speidel, with him.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air mail service the average <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight {{at the time of its}} destruction.|$|E
5|$|Müncheberg {{took over}} command of Jagdgeschwader 77 on 1 October 1942. Jagdgeschwader 77 {{at the time}} was {{deployed}} on the southern sector of the Eastern Front and was scheduled to relocate to North Africa where I. Gruppe under the command of Heinz Bär arrived in Ain el Gazala on 27 October. Under the leadership of Müncheberg, the Geschwaderstab (headquarters unit) which was equipped with new Bf109G-2s, arrived on 29 October. He scored over a No. 92 Squadron Spitfire piloted by Flight Sergeant Blades on 9 November, his 117th overall. Promoted to Major on 30 November 1942, he claimed his 119th victory on 10 December and made a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> in his Bf109G-2 (Werknummer 10 725—factory number; 35% damage) following combat with a P-40 of the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 57th Fighter Group, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). On 13 March 1943 Müncheberg became the second German fighter pilot after Hans-Joachim Marseille to achieve 100 aerial victories over Anglo-American adversaries.|$|E

5|$|No. 103 Squadron and No. 150 Squadron RAF of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) flew 10 sorties {{against the}} {{targets in the}} early morning. In the process they {{suffered}} only one loss in a <b>forced</b> <b>landing.</b> Between 15:00–16:00, 71 RAF bombers took off escorted by Allied fighters. The impressive escort was offset {{by the presence of}} German fighter units that outnumbered the Allied escort fighters by 3:1. No. 71 Wing RAF lost 10 Fairey Battles and five Bristol Blenheims. No. 75 Wing RAF lost 14–18 Battles and No. 76 Wing RAF lost 11 Battles. Out of 71 bombers dispatched, 40–44 bombers were lost, meaning a loss rate of 56–62 percent. The AASF lost a further five Hawker Hurricanes. The AASF flew 81 sorties and lost 52 percent of its strength. No 2 Group RAF also contributed with 28 sorties. The bombing results were poor, with three bridges damaged and one possibly destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{purpose-built}} {{military aircraft}} in the Swiss air force was a Fokker D.II seized after a German pilot made a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> in foul weather near Bettlach on 13 October 1916. In June 1917, five Nieuport 23 C.1 fighter planes were acquired from France. Swiss industry manufactured more than 100 Häfeli DH-3 observation aircraft, but efforts to build a Swiss fighter (the Häfeli DH-4) were halted in 1918 because of the prototypes' poor performance. By {{the end of the}} war, the Swiss air force had only 62 pilots and 68 aircraft of nine different makes, almost all of which were suitable only for observation missions. Its wartime budget of CHF 15 million amounted to just 1.25% of Swiss military expenditures.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} of the {{campaign}} the Bf110s switched from bomber escort to ground-attack since the Polish Air Force was all but defeated. In this capacity Lent and Kubisch destroyed a twin-engined monoplane on the ground on 5 September and another aircraft, a PZL P.24, on 9 September. On 12 September 1939 he was attacked by a Polish aircraft which shot out his starboard engine. Lent made a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> behind German lines. He flew five more missions during the Polish campaign, destroying one anti-aircraft battery. For his actions in the Polish campaign Lent was awarded {{one of the first}} Iron Cross 2nd Class of World WarII on 21 September 1939. I./ZG76 relocated to the Stuttgart area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had been at war with Germany since 3 September 1939. From early October to middle December I./ZG76 operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr areas before relocating north to Jever on 16 December 1939.|$|E

5|$|No. 77 Wing {{conducted}} further {{combat operations}} during early March. On {{the second of}} the month, 24 Vengeances attacked Japanese positions on Karkar Island, encountering only light anti-aircraft gunfire. Over the next two days the wing targeted Japanese positions on the Rai coast in preparation for a US Army landing scheduled for 5 March. On 3 March, Nos. 23 and 24 Squadrons attacked Mindiri village and a nearby camp site. Aircraft from all three of the wing's squadrons attacked a camp at Pommern Bay on two occasions the next day. One Vengeance was damaged in a <b>forced</b> <b>landing.</b> The US Army unit's landing at Mindiri on 5 March did not encounter any opposition. On 8 March a force of 36 Vengeances from all three of No. 77 Wing's squadrons was dispatched to strike Rempi village near Alexishafen. Due to bad weather, No. 23 Squadron aborted its attack, and bombed a target {{to the north of the}} village. The other two squadrons successfully approached Rempi by making shallow dives through the clouds, and bombed the target area. Four Vengeances were lightly damaged by anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|On 22November 1941, during Operation Crusader, Rawlinson led No.3 Squadron on a bomber escort mission near Bir el Gubi in the morning, and {{a fighter}} sweep {{south-east}} of El Adem in the afternoon. German Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters shot down three Tomahawks {{for the loss}} of two of their own in the first action, Rawlinson claiming a 109 damaged. In the second action, a drawn-out battle for air superiority, the squadron lost six Tomahawks against two 109s destroyed, one of which was claimed by Rawlinson along with one probable and one damaged. He had also taken a shot at a distant 109 and, believing he had missed it, did not claim. After the war it was established that Rawlinson's bullets had damaged the 109 and wounded its pilot, Ernst Düllberg, who made a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> back at base. Rawlinson was credited with his final victory on 30November, when he downed an Italian Macchi C.200 in an engagement that saw No.3 Squadron's tally of claims rise to 106 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Boston's navigator, Sergeant Basil Eastwood, {{was killed}} in the <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> but Newton and his {{wireless}} operator, Flight Sergeant John Lyon, survived and managed to swim ashore. Several of the other aircraft in the flight circled the area; one returned to base straight away to inform Hampshire, and the remainder were later forced to depart through lack of fuel. Newton and Lyon originally made their way inland with the help of natives, aiming to contact an Australian Coastwatcher, but subsequently returned to the coast. There they were captured by a Japanese patrol of No.5 Special Naval Landing Force. The two airmen were taken to Salamaua and interrogated until 20March, before being moved to Lae where Lyon was bayoneted to death on the orders of Rear Admiral Ruitaro Fujita, the senior Japanese commander in the area. Newton was brought back to Salamaua where, on 29March 1943, he was ceremonially beheaded with a Samurai sword by Sub-Lieutenant Uichi Komai, the naval officer who had captured him. Komai {{was killed in}} the Philippines soon after, and Fujita committed suicide {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{throughout}} the front did not cease entirely {{for the rest}} of the day, most of it taking part around the besieged Israeli defences and strongpoints that still resisted. Meanwhile, the Sa'iqa units airdropped into Sinai the previous day began engaging Israeli reserves heading for the front. The main areas of operation were the central mountain passes, the northern coastal routes, and near the Gulf of Suez. One battalion, transported in 18 helicopters, captured the Ras Sidr Pass south of Port Tawfiq, near the Gulf of Suez. En route four helicopters were shot down, but the survivors, including 9 crewmen, managed to regroup with the rest of the battalion. It held its position for the remainder of the war under extremely difficult conditions, preventing Israeli reserves from using the pass to reach the front. Two companies attempted to establish themselves in central Sinai, between Tasa and Bir Gifgafa. Israeli air interdiction resulted in six helicopter making a <b>forced</b> <b>landing</b> after being hit, while two helicopters turned and withdrew. The forced landings incurred many casualties, particularly due to burns, and the survivors trekked their way back to friendly lines. Only four helicopters reached the designated landing zone, and they could not be flown once more, indicating the suicidal nature of these operations. Albeit a third of their original force, the Sa'iqa managed to block Israeli reserves for over eight hours. Both companies were almost completely destroyed, suffering around 150 dead, including 15 officers. Israeli estimates claim to have downed between ten and twenty helicopters on the first day of the war.|$|E
