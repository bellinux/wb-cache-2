40|$|One {{option for}} <b>ground</b> <b>drive</b> systems with large {{harvesting}} equipment {{is to use}} rubber-belted tracks; however, {{little is known about}} the performance of these systems relative to appropriately sized pneumatic tyres. The effect of self-propelled wheels and a track with high axle loads (9 – 24 t) on soil compaction were studied. Soil displacement and soil density changes were assessed by embedding talcum powder lines as tracer into the soil during preparation. In addition, soil dry bulk density and penetrometer resistance were measured. The track with loads of both 10. 5 and 12 t compacts the soil less than wheels at a 10. 5 t load in both weak uniform and stratified soil. Towed implement wheels with a 4. 5 t load caused similar soil displacement to the track with a load of 12 t. Tyre inflation pressure had a significant influence on soil parameters. To reduce compaction a larger overall diameter was found to be more beneficial than a wider tyre. This emphasised the importance of contact pressure and its distribution with respect to soil density changes. Total axle loads are less important than how these loads are distributed on the ground...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the feasibility of automatic controls to automate feed distribution in feedlots. The control approach was restricted to compatibility with conventional feeding equipment. Input control signals were taken to originate from commonly available mechanical and electronic sensors. The control system was implemented with standard digital logic components;The proposed digital control system {{is based on a}} railguided, self-propelled automatic vehicle capable of delivering feed sequentially to 255 pens located on both sides of a single feeding path. A manual, closed-loop control system consisting of the following functions was developed: (1) pen identification, (2) initialization control, (3) feeding mode, (4) exit from feeding mode, (5) re-entry into feeding mode, (6) end of feeding cycle, (7) <b>ground</b> <b>drive</b> and conveyor control, (8) interface and auto/manual mode, (9) monitoring of automated system and (10) data and failure display and alarm. The control system allows either automatic or manual operation of the feeding vehicle. Digital electronic circuits capable of implementing the desired control functions were designed;The feeding cycle is manually initiated and automatically terminated when feed has been delivered to all pens requiring feed. It can be partially programmed to enable feed delivery to sections of the feedlot. Two feed rations can be delivered. The feeding status of each pen is recorded. The pen feed rations are stored in reprogrammable memories;The operation of the automated feeding system is based on the automatic identification of the feedlot pens. The number assigned to a pen is coded, using binary pulse-code modulation. Frequency-shift keying is used to transmit the coded number. The received coded number is recovered by specialized communication circuits and then validated;The control system monitors the vehicle components and the major electronic circuits to detect failures, prevent damage and produce a safe operation. Furthermore, it incorporates safety sensors and logic circuitry to meet the basic safety requirements pertaining to automated vehicles;The proposed automated feed distribution system for feedlots is expected to: (1) reduce management requirements through automatic distribution of feed to cattle raised in pens, (2) increase efficiency of feeding operation by eliminating time losses associated with secondary feed transfer, (3) eliminate damage to feedbunks through positive guidance of the vehicle by rails, and (4) save energy by eliminating secondary feed transfer...|$|E
40|$|Existing date {{harvesting}} machines are {{vehicles equipped with}} a long arm to lift {{a man on a}} platform to harvest the fruits. The arm and the vehicle are heavy (4 to 8 tonnes), expensive (from £ 16 000) and are not sufficiently manoeuvrable in constricted date groves. Most dates in the main producing countries, including Iran, are therefore harvested manually. The manual method is unsafe, slow, expensive (£ 0. 63 per tree) and the fruit quality is often damaged. A light, weight 4 wheel drive, remotely controlled tree climbing machine is, therefore, a potential solution to the problems of harvesting and servicing (such as pollinating and pruning). A prototype of such a device was designed, developed and evaluated under laboratory conditions. To determine the operating characteristics and feasibility the machine was designed to climb the tree using pneumatic tyres as traction wheels. The machine can be transformed to <b>ground</b> <b>drive</b> and move between trees under its own power. This approach reduces the machine weight, cost and size because the tree trunk is used as a support for the machine to climb to the fruits. It is operated and controlled from the ground which improves the operator safety. A vertical traction theory for this type of machine has been developed based on the tree size and surface characteristics and machine size and weight which can be used to design date harvesting and climbing machines with different capacities. The test results showed that the experimental machine could achieve a tractive efficiency of 90 % and that the optimum wheel slippage was between 10 - 15 %. The machine consumes a maximum of 1. 4 kW power which is only 3 % of the power requirement of existing systems. The machine weight is 150 kg which is 2 - 4 % of the existing systems' weight. It is capable of climbing the tree at a maximum speed of 0. 27 m/s although the optimum speed is 0. 17 m/s for best control. The prototype can carry a payload of 100 kg of dates and, considering a field efficiency of 75 %, it can potentially harvest a tree in 22 minutes which is 18 % faster than the manual system in Iran and 6 % faster than one of the mechanised systems used in Saudi Arabia. The harvester can work on tree diameter ranges from 300 to 850 mm and can pass over the tree leaf bases of 41 mm high. The machine should not damage the tree because the tree resists the machine stresses with a minimum safety factor of 7. An economic analysis showed that it can be manufactured in Iran at 20 % of the cost of existing systems. The machine cost per tree is equal to the hand harvesting method (£O. 63 per tree) for Iranian farmers if it harvests 978 trees per year...|$|E

This communication is primarily through the release and detection of infochemicals, which must traverse the soil matrix to be effective.

5000|$|There are {{different}} types of planters available with the main difference being mechanical driven vs hydraulic/electrical driven. In a mechanical drive system the unit works by a small suspended tire being driven by another which is {{in contact with the}} <b>ground</b> (<b>driven)</b> tire. As the operator lowers the planter the two tires make contact and the planter is engaged. When the driven wheel begins to turn it then turns a series of gears that determine the population of the seed produced. The gears can be changed by the operator in order to change the planting population. A hydraulic driven system came about to correct the shortfalls of the <b>ground</b> <b>driven</b> system. Hydraulic driven systems allow the operator to change population on the go, as well as allowing the computer controller to follow a prepared prescription for an individual field. The system also allowed for plant populations to be infinite in that mechanical gears systems are limited to set number of population settings and gears available from manufactures. In 2014 John Deere introduced the ExactEmerge row unit which introduced high-speed planting. [...] Precision Planting followed suit and released the vDrive system. These system were unique, not that they were electrical, but that they allowed an operator to double their speed when planting. Other manufactures had already developed an electrical planter, but lacked these additional improvements. Traditionally, an operator would plant at about 4.5-5.5 mph for optimal performance, however, with the advent of these systems electrical motors match the speed of the tractor and [...] "dead-drop" [...] the seed in the trench using either a belt or brush-belt which cause the forward momentum of the planter to be offset by the rearward momentum of the seed. Older systems would instead drop the seed through a tube after the meter rather than place is in the seed trench directly.|$|R
