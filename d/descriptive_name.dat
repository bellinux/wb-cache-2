However, one of the variants of western Nunavut is called Inuinnaqtun to distinguish itself from the dialects of eastern Canada, while the variants of the Northwest Territories are sometimes called Inuvialuktun and have in the past sometimes been called Inuktun. In those dialects, the name is sometimes rendered as Inuktitun to reflect dialectal differences in pronunciation. The Inuit language of Quebec is called Inuttitut by its speakers, and often by other people, but this is a minor variation in pronunciation. In Labrador, the language is called Inuttut or, often in official documents, by the more <b>descriptive</b> <b>name</b> Labradorimiutut. Furthermore, Canadians – both Inuit and non-Inuit – sometimes use the word Inuktitut to refer to all Inuit language variants, including those of Alaska and Greenland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{laying out}} of the {{military}} garden was begun in July 1789, and an area of 800 by slightly less than 200 metres was quickly made ready for cultivation, but soon the idea was extended {{to the creation of a}} public park, of which the military garden should be only a small part. On August 13, 1789, Charles Theodore published a decree, devoting the Hirschanger to the amusement of the people of Munich. To advise on the project, the Royal Gardener Friedrich Ludwig Sckell (ennobled in 1808) who had studied landscape gardening in England and had previously worked for Charles Theodore at Schwetzingen, had been summoned to Munich earlier in August. Various associated projects were made part of the park development, among them the Elevengarten ("Pupils' Garden", a garden for the students at the recently formed military academy), a [...] "Schweizerey" [...] (cattle farm), [...] "Schäfery" [...] (sheep farm) and [...] "Ackerbauschule" [...] (arable farming school) to improve farming techniques, and a [...] "Vihearzneyschule" [...] (veterinary school) for the treatment of cattle diseases. Most of these projects did not long survive the creation of the park, but the veterinary school went on to become what is now the Tierärztliche Fakultät (Veterinary Faculty) of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The gateway from 1790 can be seen at the Veterinärstraße entrance to the garden. [...] The park was initially named [...] "Theodors Park", but it very quickly became known by the <b>descriptive</b> <b>name</b> of [...] "the English Garden". By May, 1790 sufficient progress had been made to allow Charles Theodore to make an inspection tour; but it was first in the spring of 1792 that the park was officially opened to the approximately 40,000 citizens of Munich.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a <b>descriptive</b> <b>naming</b> system for an internet environment. <b>Descriptive</b> <b>naming</b> systems allow clients to identify a set objects by description. In a world where information is perfect, this amounts to a simple database query. However, <b>descriptive</b> <b>naming</b> systems operate in an imperfect world: clients may provide inaccurate descriptions, the database may contain out-of-date or incomplete information, the database may be highly distributed, and so on. Traditional strategies for handling imperfect information approach the problem from the database's perspective; i. e., queries are resolved according to a method determined by the database designer. This thesis presents a model, called a preference hierarchy, that allows the client to define the meaning of a preferred answer. A preferred answer is computed using knowledge about the quality of information in the database and in the query. Specifically, clients provide the naming system with a description of an object and some meta-information that {{describes the}} client's beliefs about the query and the naming system. This meta-information is an ordering on a set of perfect-world approximations and it describes the preferred methods for accommodating imperfect information. The description is then resolved in a way that respects the preferred approximations. The preference hierarchy may be used to solve problems associated with some forms of imperfect information that exist in <b>descriptive</b> <b>naming</b> systems. It also provides a foundation for designing and comparing various naming systems. For example, the preference hierarchy allows us to compare naming systems based on how discriminating they are, and to identify the class of names for which a given naming system is sound and complete. A study of several example naming systems demonstrates how the preference hierarchy {{can be used as a}} formal tool for designing naming systems. Univers is a generic attribute-based name server that implements the preference hierarchy model. It provides a foundation upon which a variety of high-level naming services can be built. It is a platform for constructing an internet-wide <b>descriptive</b> <b>naming</b> system. This thesis describes several aspects of its implementation and demonstrates how various <b>descriptive</b> <b>naming</b> services [...] including a global white-pages service, a local yellow-pages services, and a conventional name-to-address mapper [...] can be built on top of Univers...|$|R
