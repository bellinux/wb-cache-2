5|$|Aaliyah is an R and neo soul {{record with}} music drawing from funk, hip hop, {{alternative}} rock, and electronica, among other styles. The producers incorporated synthesizer melodies, fragmented beats, distorted guitar, and <b>eccentrically</b> manipulated vocals and song structures. Much of Aaliyah {{dealt with the}} complexities of romantic love and different stages in a relationship. Most of the songs were written by lyricist Static Major, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah. She viewed the album {{as a reflection of}} herself as both a young adult and a matured vocalist.|$|E
5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving <b>eccentrically</b> and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

25|$|Often, one of {{the scrolls}} is fixed, while the other orbits <b>eccentrically</b> without rotating, thereby {{trapping}} and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.|$|E
25|$|Something of {{a parody}} of The Maltese Falcon, Beat the Devil (1953), was Bogart's last film with his close friend and {{favorite}} director John Huston. Co-written by Truman Capote, the <b>eccentrically</b> filmed tale follows an amoral group of rogues chasing an unattainable treasure.|$|E
25|$|Over {{a period}} of forty years, he {{periodically}} addressed {{the determination of the}} constants in Carl Friedrich Gauss's theory of terrestrial magnetism. Again, the calculations involved great labour, and were not published during his lifetime. They were edited by his brother, William Grylls Adams, and appear in the second volume of the collected Scientific Papers. Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime. He calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant, perhaps somewhat <b>eccentrically,</b> to 236 decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd.|$|E
25|$|A {{cone crusher}} {{is similar in}} {{operation}} to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber {{and more of a}} parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an <b>eccentrically</b> gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening {{at the bottom of the}} crusher.|$|E
25|$|Through Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane Brympton d'Evercy {{became a}} meeting place of cricket lovers. It had its own cricket pitch where large house parties played against local and visiting teams. A houseparty devoted to cricket took place each year, a {{tradition}} which survived long after Sir Spencer's death and into the 1950s. As treasurer of the MCC Sir Spencer laid the foundation stone for the pavilion at Lord's. He founded the Old Stagers club of Canterbury, and most <b>eccentrically</b> the team known as I Zingari, a wandering cricket club of assorted aristocrats and Victorian and Edwardian notables. Throughout Sir Spencer's ownership of Brympton the house and estate were maintained, but survived only through {{the good fortune of}} low taxation and agricultural rents. This branch of the Fane family had never been wealthy, and World War I was to bring sweeping changes to not just Brympton d'Evercy but country houses all over Britain.|$|E
25|$|Thomas' {{plan for}} Christchurch (laid {{out by the}} {{surveyor}} Edward Jollie by March 1850) was the 'standard' rectangular grid of colonial settlement (adopted for ease of survey and to facilitate land sales). Thomas did not allow Jollie to include crescents to provide variety, but the Avon River ran <b>eccentrically</b> across the site. Two diagonal streets (High Street/Ferry Road leading to Ferrymead, Heathcote and Sumner and Victoria Street/Papanui Road leading to the Papanui Bush) also broke the regularity of the grid. At the very centre {{of the city was}} a 'Square' (which is actually cross-shaped) intended as a grand centre for the city and the site of the proposed cathedral and grammar school. East and north-west of the Square were two more 'squares' (Latimer and Cranmer Squares, which are actually rectangles) which were placed more or less regularly in relation to the diagonal line of the Avon running in a north-easterly direction across the city to the west and north of the central square.|$|E
25|$|Expressionism and Symbolism are broad rubrics {{encompassing}} {{several important}} and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated {{much of the}} avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern, and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat <b>eccentrically</b> personal. Fauvism, Die Brücke, and Der Blaue Reiter are three {{of the best known}} groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as Marc Chagall, whose painting I and the Village, (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Chaim Soutine, James Ensor, Oskar Kokoschka, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, Franz Marc, Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz, Georges Rouault, Amedeo Modigliani and some of the Americans abroad like Marsden Hartley, and Stuart Davis, were considered influential expressionist painters. Although Alberto Giacometti is primarily thought of as an intense Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.|$|E
500|$|An R and neo soul album, Aaliyah {{featured}} midtempo funk songs, hip hop-textured uptempo tracks, {{and slow}} jams that drew on older soul influences. Along with contemporary urban sounds, its music incorporated Middle-Eastern influences, muted alternative rock, and--particularly on Timbaland's songs for the album--Latin timbres. [...] "Never No More" [...] mixed both older soul and modern hip hop sounds with string arrangements by producer Bud'da, while [...] "Read Between the Lines" [...] was recorded as a rhythmic digital samba with Latin percussion. Aaliyahs production featured synthesizer melodies, vintage syndrums, distorted guitar, staccato arrangements, and layered, <b>eccentrically</b> manipulated vocals. John Mulvey of NME found its sound subtle and lacking [...] "bombast and histrionics", while the magazine's Alex Needham likened its [...] "otherworldly", high frequency production to dub reggae and the dark, spacious dance music of Dr. Dre and Massive Attack. In Stephen Thomas Erlewine's opinion, {{the album was}} distinct from the older soul leanings of Macy Gray and Jill Scott, as its music sounded unconventional yet modern, [...] "turning out a pan-cultural array of sounds, styles, and emotions".|$|E
500|$|Laura Fries of Variety {{commented on}} the {{difference}} between this series and Law & Order and : [...] "By scrutinizing motive and intent, Criminal Intent utilizes a more personal style that sets it apart from its brethren. Wolf's characters are notoriously devoid of detailed personal lives, but debut [...] hints at a little more introspection {{on the part of}} the characters". In Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker wrote that Law & Order: Criminal Intent was the best series of the year from the Law & Order franchise and that while Law & Order suffered from tired, wooden performances from actors with poor chemistry, the acting on Law & Order: Criminal Intent was at [...] "the other end of the spectrum." [...] Both writers {{commented on the}} overpowering screen presence that D'Onofrio commands in the first episode: [...] "Criminal Intent so far is a one-man show with Vincent D'Onofrio at its center. [...] commands the most attention, tending to overshadow Erbe, who is reduced in the pilot to following Goren with an awe-struck look," [...] wrote Fries, while Tucker also stated, [...] "D'Onofrio is so <b>eccentrically</b> entertaining, even his costar Kathryn Erbe seems fascinated", but complained that Erbe's role was smaller than D'Onofrio's, which [...] "jibes with the subtle range she showed on [...] Oz and proves her professional generosity." [...] He also said Sheridan [...] "is similarly nonplussed and under-utilized," [...] but [...] "Vance is terrific , who makes defendants wither in the face of his elegantly reasoned cross-examinations." ...|$|E
500|$|Steuart {{soon became}} {{lieutenant}} colonel {{of the newly}} formed 1st Maryland Infantry, serving under Colonel Arnold Elzey, and fought with distinction at the First Battle of Bull Run, {{taking part in the}} charge that routed the Union army. Very soon after he was promoted to colonel, and assumed command of the regiment, succeeding Elzey, who was promoted to brigadier general. He soon began to acquire a reputation as a strict disciplinarian and gained the admiration of his men, though he was initially unpopular as a result. Steuart was said to have ordered his men to sweep the bare dirt inside their bivouacs and, rather more <b>eccentrically,</b> was prone to sneaking through the lines past unwitting sentries, in order to test their vigilance. On one occasion this plan backfired, as Steuart was pummeled and beaten by a sentry who later claimed not to have recognized the general. Eventually however, Steuart's [...] "rigid system of discipline quietly and quickly conduced to the health and morale of this splendid command." [...] According to Major W W Goldsborough, who served in Steuart's Maryland Infantry at Gettysburg: [...] "...it was not only his love for a clean camp, but a desire to promote the health and comfort of his men that made him unyielding in the enforcement of sanitary rules. You might influence him in some things, but never in this". George Wilson Booth, a young officer in Steuart's command at Harper's Ferry in 1861, recalled in his memoirs: ...|$|E
2500|$|Kothari's grandfather, Hormusji Sohrabji Kothari (d. 1876), {{accompanied}} General Sir Charles James Napier as a commissariat agent {{during the}} conquest of Sindh Province in 1842-3 and subsequently emigrated from Surat to Karachi, Gujarat [...] in 1846 where he was <b>eccentrically</b> philanthropic.|$|E
2500|$|The station's <b>eccentrically</b> audacious {{scale and}} damp setting earned it {{references}} as [...] "the world's largest submarine". With {{the other two}} deep single-vaulted stations on the RER Line A it has been retrospectively criticised on cost grounds, and in 2007 {{was in need of}} modernisation. However, Auber seems a good example of a planning policy attached to grand public spaces that was particularly current in the 1960s and in France.|$|E
2500|$|Belbo's {{writings}} are {{a recurrent}} theme throughout the book. The entire book is narrated in first person by Casaubon, with brief interludes from the files on Abulafia. These passages are often <b>eccentrically</b> written, and deal in most part with Belbo's childhood, his constant sense of failure, and his obsession with Lorenza. The interludes {{from his childhood}} serve as {{stark contrast to the}} mythical world of cults and conspiracies. Belbo is extremely careful to not try to create (literature), because he deems himself unworthy, although it becomes somewhat obvious that writing is his passion. This attitude of constant subconscious self-abasement fits in with the overall irony focused on in the book, considering that Belbo is eventually consumed by (re)creation of the Plan; one excerpt meant for the unattainable Lorenza reads, [...] "I could not possess you, but I can blow up history." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under Steuart's {{command the}} {{regiment}} was drilled relentlessly.

2500|$|Miller also {{researched}} how troublesome {{children were}} treated at the Tavistock Clinic, where imitation {{is often used}} during therapy; [...] "there are ways in which a skilful therapist will gently mock a child out of a tantrum by giving an amusing imitation of the tantrum immediately after it's happened. The child then has a mirror held up to it and is capable of seeing {{what it looks like}} to others." [...] In his review of the adaptation for the Financial Times, Chris Dunkley referred to this issue, calling Cleese's Petruchio [...] "an <b>eccentrically</b> pragmatic social worker using the wayward client's own doubtful habits to calm her down." [...] Actress Sarah Badel had a similar conception of the psychology behind the production. She constructed an [...] "imaginary biography" [...] for Katherina, arguing [...] "She's a woman of such passion [...] a woman of such enormous capacity for love that the only way she could be happy is to find a man of equal capacity. Therefore she's mad for lack of love [...] he feigns madness, she is teetering on the edge of it. Petruchio is the only man who shows her what she's like." [...] In this reading of the play, the production was at least partially based on Miller's own 1972 Chichester Festival stage production starring Joan Plowright and Anthony Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|George Lucas tried [...] "to get a {{cohesive}} reality" [...] for his feature. However, since {{the film is}} a fairy tale, as he had described, [...] "I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an alien look." [...] He designed the film to have an [...] "extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with strange over-exposed colors, a lot of shadows, a lot of hot areas." [...] Lucas wanted Star Wars to embrace the combination of [...] "strange graphics of fantasy" [...] and [...] "the feel of a documentary" [...] to impress a distinct look. To achieve this, he hired the British cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. Originally, Lucas's first choice for the position was Geoffrey Unsworth, who also provided the cinematography for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unsworth was interested in working with the director, and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz. However, he eventually withdrew {{to work on the}} Vincente Minnelli-directed A Matter of Time (1976) instead, which [...] "really annoy" [...] Kurtz. Lucas called up for other cinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing his choice on Taylor's cinematography for Dr. Strangelove and A Hard Day's Night (both 1964). On his decision, Lucas said: [...] "I thought they were good, <b>eccentrically</b> photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor".|$|E
2500|$|The {{remainder}} of Tryon's time on Royal Albert was largely uneventful. In November 1857 {{he had an}} attack of rheumatic fever, requiring him {{to spend time in}} hospital in Malta, before being granted leave in Italy to recover. He visited Naples, Rome, Florence and Pompeii, where the volcano was unusually active. When the ship went to Gibraltar he visited Cadiz and Seville. His considerations turned to his career, which risked faltering because he was older than other officers and lacked a patron. However, his good reports meant that his name was submitted to Queen Victoria for consideration for appointment to the royal yacht HMY Victoria and Albert II. This carried with it automatic promotion to commander after two years' service. Royal Albert [...] returned to England where in July 1858 she acted as part of the escort for Queen Victoria's visit to Cherbourg to meet the Emperor and Empress of France. The queen's yacht entered and departed the harbour between lines of British warships stationed at the approach. Ashore, Tryon came within ten yards of the royal party: the event was celebrated with much firing of guns in salute, fireworks and the lighting up of the ships by lights spread through the rigging and shown at all portholes. Tryon commented that some of the noisiest and most <b>eccentrically</b> dressed attendees were those on the steamer bringing members of the House of Commons.|$|E

"Ah, sir, permit me--when I behold {{you on this}} mild summer's eve, thus <b>eccentrically</b> {{clothed in}} the skins of wild beasts, I cannot but {{conclude}} that the equally grim and unsuitable habit of your mind is likewise but an eccentric assumption, having no basis in your genuine soul, no more than in nature herself." ...|$|E

[...] Furiously he snatched up his tube of shaving-cream, furiously he lathered, with a belligerent slapping of the unctuous brush, furiously he raked his plump cheeks with a safety-razor. It pulled. The blade was dull. He said, [...] "Damn--oh--oh--damn it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Admired as a {{thing of}} beauty for its own sake, it is also used merely as a {{material}} for artistic effects; for among the quaintest of such conceits are the Japanese Jarley chrysanthemum works. Every November in the florists' gardens that share the temple grounds at Asakusa may be seen groups of historical and mythological figures composed entirely of chrysanthemum flowers. These effigies are quite worthy of comparison with their London cousins, being sufficiently life-like to terrify children and startle anybody. To come suddenly, on turning a corner, upon a colossal warrior, deterrently uncouth and frightfully battle-clad, in the act of dispatching a fallen foe, is a sensation not instantly dispelled {{by the fact that he}} is made of flowers. The practice, at least, bears witness to an artistic ingenuity of no mean merit, and to a horticulture ably carried on, if somewhat <b>eccentrically</b> applied.|$|E
60|$|The Bergwerke {{consist of}} four tunnels {{driven into the}} lower part of the western hill-side, further down than the bottom of the {{abandoned}} native workings. They are <b>eccentrically</b> disposed in curves and other queer figures. All abut upon galleries running in sections along the lode-line, and intended ultimately to connect. The total length may be a thousand feet. Being cut in the gneiss, they require no timbering; but the floors are little raised above the level of the rivulet, and water percolates through roofs and walls. The latest tunnel has been driven past the new gallery, and has struck a second lode; this has never been worked by the natives, and stoping to above the springs may be found advisable. Ventilation is managed by means of the old abandoned native shafts. A very large quantity of ore is brought to bank. I found it hard to form an estimate, because it was in scattered heaps overgrown with vegetation; but I should not be surprised if it amounted to 5,000 tons. This means that want of proper machinery has resulted in a dead capital of from 20,000l. to 30,000l.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jaggers's {{room was}} lighted by a {{skylight}} only, {{and was a}} most dismal place; the skylight, <b>eccentrically</b> pitched like a broken head, and the distorted adjoining houses looking {{as if they had}} twisted themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that I should not have expected to see,--such as an old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out.|$|E
6000|$|Fakarava {{was chosen}} to be the seat of Government from {{nautical}} considerations only. It is <b>eccentrically</b> situate; the productions, even for a low island, poor; the population neither many nor--for Low Islanders--industrious. But the lagoon has two good passages, one to leeward, one to windward, so that in all states of the wind it can be left and entered, and this advantage, for a government of scattered islands, was decisive. A pier of coral, landing-stairs, a harbour light upon a staff and pillar, and two spacious Government bungalows in a handsome fence, give to {{the northern end of}} Rotoava a great air of consequence. This is confirmed on the one hand by an empty prison, on the other by a gendarmerie pasted over with handbills in Tahitian, land-law notices from Papeete, and republican sentiments from Paris, signed (a little after date) [...] "Jules Grévy, Perihidente." [...] Quite at the far end a belfried Catholic chapel concludes the town; and between, on a smooth floor of white coral sand and under the breezy canopy of coco-palms, the houses of the natives stand irregularly scattered, now close on the lagoon {{for the sake of the}} breeze, now back under the palms for love of shadow.|$|E
60|$|Tess {{knew that}} it was {{impossible}} to go on with the swedes; and by the time she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp, Marian arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at reed-drawing in the barn till the weather changed. As soon, therefore, as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered medley of grays, they blew out the lamp, wrapped themselves up in their thickest pinners, tied their woollen cravats round their necks and across their chests, and started for the barn. The snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a cloud, and individual flakes could not be seen. The blast smelt of icebergs, arctic seas, whales, and white bears, carrying the snow so that it licked the land but did not deepen on it. They trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy fields, keeping as well as they could in the shelter of hedges, which, however, acted as strainers rather than screens. The air, afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it, twisted and spun them <b>eccentrically,</b> suggesting an achromatic chaos of things. But both the young women were fairly cheerful; such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting.|$|E
60|$|The most {{extraordinary}} attic I ever came across was one {{a friend and}} I once shared many years ago. Of all <b>eccentrically</b> planned things, from Bradshaw to the maze at Hampton Court, that room was the most eccentric. The architect who designed {{it must have been}} a genius, though I cannot help thinking that his talents would have been better employed in contriving puzzles than in shaping human habitations. No figure in Euclid could give any idea of that apartment. It contained seven corners, two of the walls sloped to a point, and the window was just over the fireplace. The only possible position for the bedstead was between the door and the cupboard. To get anything out of the cupboard we had to scramble over the bed, and a large percentage of the various commodities thus obtained was absorbed by the bedclothes. Indeed, so many things were spilled and dropped upon the bed that toward night-time it had become a sort of small cooperative store. Coal was what it always had most in stock. We used to keep our coal in the bottom part of the cupboard, and when any was wanted we had to climb over the bed, fill a shovelful, and then crawl back. It was an exciting moment when we reached the middle of the bed. We would hold our breath, fix our eyes upon the shovel, and poise ourselves for the last move. The next instant we, and the coals, and the shovel, and the bed would be all mixed up together.|$|E
6000|$|We {{start off}} again from quite special cases, {{which we have}} {{frequently}} used before. Let us consider a space time domain in which no gravitational field exists relative to a reference-body K whose state of motion has been suitably chosen. K is then a Galileian reference-body as regards the domain considered, {{and the results of}} the special theory of relativity hold relative to K. Let us supposse the same domain referred to a second body of reference K1, which is rotating uniformly with respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we shall imagine K1 to be {{in the form of a}} plane circular disc, which rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who is sitting <b>eccentrically</b> on the disc K1 is sensible of a force which acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as an effect of inertia (centrifugal force) by an observer who was at rest with respect to the original reference-body K. But the observer on the disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is [...] " [...] at rest [...] " [...] on the basis of the general principle of relativity he is justified in doing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on all other bodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as the effect of a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the space-distribution of this gravitational field is of a kind that would not be possible on Newton's theory of gravitation.* But since the observer believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not disturb him; he is quite in the right when he believes that a general law of gravitation can be formulated- a law which not only explains the motion of the stars correctly, but also the field of force experienced by himself.|$|E
6000|$|Katharine {{was still}} out when she arrived at Cheyne Walk. After {{greeting}} her uncle and aunt and receiving, as usual, a present of two sovereigns for [...] "cab fares and dissipation" [...] from Uncle Trevor, whose favorite niece she was, she changed her dress and wandered into Katharine's room to await her. What a great looking-glass Katharine had, she thought, and how mature all the arrangements upon the dressing-table were compared to what {{she was used to}} at home. Glancing round, she thought that the bills stuck upon a skewer and stood for ornament upon the mantelpiece were astonishingly like Katharine, There wasn't a photograph of William anywhere to be seen. The room, with its combination of luxury and bareness, its silk dressing-gowns and crimson slippers, its shabby carpet and bare walls, had a powerful air of Katharine herself; she {{stood in the middle of}} the room and enjoyed the sensation; and then, with a desire to finger what her cousin was in the habit of fingering, Cassandra began to take down the books which stood in a row upon the shelf above the bed. In most houses this shelf is the ledge upon which the last relics of religious belief lodge themselves as if, late at night, in the heart of privacy, people, skeptical by day, find solace in sipping one draught of the old charm for such sorrows or perplexities as may steal from their hiding-places in the dark. But there was no hymn-book here. By their battered covers and enigmatical contents, Cassandra judged them to be old school-books belonging to Uncle Trevor, and piously, though <b>eccentrically,</b> preserved by his daughter. There was no end, she thought, to the unexpectedness of Katharine. She had once had a passion for geometry herself, and, curled upon Katharine's quilt, she became absorbed in trying to remember how far she had forgotten what she once knew. Katharine, coming in a little later, found her deep in this characteristic pursuit.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few years}} ago, too, Dr. Tripe was {{watching}} a very severe thunderstorm, {{when he saw a}} fire-ball come quietly gliding up to him, apparently rising from the earth rather than falling towards it. Instead of running away, like a practical man, the intrepid doctor held his ground quietly and observed the fiery monster with scientific nonchalance. After continuing its course for some time in a peaceful and regular fashion, however, without attempting to assault him, it finally darted off at a tangent in another direction, and turned apparently into forked lightning. A fire-ball, noticed among the Glendowan Mountains in Donegal, behaved even more <b>eccentrically,</b> as might be expected from its Irish antecedents. It first skirted the earth in a leisurely way for several hundred yards like a cannon-ball; then it struck the ground, ricochetted, and once more bounded along for another short spell; after which it disappeared in the boggy soil, as if it were completely finished and done for. But in another moment it rose again, nothing daunted, with Celtic irrepressibility, several yards away, pursued its ghostly course across a running stream (which shows, at least, there could have been no witchcraft in it), and finally ran to earth for good in the opposite bank, leaving a round hole in the sloping peat at the spot where it buried itself. Where it first struck, it cut up the peat as if with a knife, and made a broad deep trench which remained afterwards as a witness of its eccentric conduct. If the person who observed it had been of a superstitious turn of mind we should have had here one of the finest and most terrifying ghost stories on the entire record, which would have made an exceptionally splendid show in the 'Transactions of the Society for Psychical Research.' Unfortunately, however, he was only a man of science, ungifted with the precious dower of poetical imagination; so he stupidly called it a remarkable fire-ball, measured the ground carefully like a common engineer, and sent an account of the phenomenon to that far more prosaic periodical, the 'Quarterly Journal of the Meteorological Society.' Another splendid apparition thrown away recklessly, for ever! ...|$|E
60|$|I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The {{heart had}} ceased to beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were unusually active, {{although}} <b>eccentrically</b> so--assuming often each other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers, far more lovely {{than any of the}} old Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. The eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance, the balls could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as sound--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular in outline. The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had undergone a modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at first only recognised through vision, at length, long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. All my perceptions were purely sensual. The materials furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding. Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone. And this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud cries.|$|E

The senses were [...] unusually active, {{although}} <b>eccentrically</b> so--assuming often each [...] other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably [...] confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The [...] rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the [...] last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers, [...] far more lovely {{than any of the}} old Earth, but whose prototypes we [...] have here blooming around us. The eye-lids, transparent and bloodless, [...] offered no complete impediment to vision.

6000|$|The Keeper of the Green Flag of Islam is well served, and {{as though}} [...] the Turk is an infidel and a dog, he is {{sometimes}} brave and strong. [...] Indeed, {{except when he}} passes {{the confines of the}} Blue Mountains, he [...] has been known to do stirring deeds. But as none who have dared to [...] wander in amongst our hills ever return to their own land, we may not [...] know of how they speak at home of their battles here. Still, these [...] men were evidently not to be despised; and our Gospodar, who is a [...] wise man as well as a valiant, warned us to be prudent, and not to [...] despise our foes over much. We did as he counselled, and in proof we [...] only took ten men, as we had only twenty against us. But then there [...] was at stake much beyond life, and we took no risks. So, as the [...] great clock at Vissarion clanged of noon, the eight fastest runners [...] of the Blue Mountains, together with the Gospodar Rupert and myself, [...] swept out on our journey. It had been signalled to us that the [...] course which the marauders had as yet taken in their flight was a [...] zigzag one, running <b>eccentrically</b> at all sorts of angles in all sorts [...] of directions. But our leader had marked out a course where we might [...] intercept our foes across the main line of their flight; and till we [...] had reached that region we paused not a second, but went as fast as [...] we could all night long. Indeed, it was amongst us a race as was the [...] Olympic race of old Greece, each one vying with his fellows, though [...] not in jealous emulation, but in high spirit, to best serve his [...] country and the Voivodin Teuta. Foremost amongst us went the [...] Gospodar, bearing himself as a Paladin of old, his mighty form [...] pausing for no obstacle. Perpetually did he urge us on. He would [...] not stop or pause for a moment, but often as he and I ran [...] together--for, lady, in my youth I was the fleetest of all in the [...] race, and even that now can head a battalion when duty calls--he [...] would ask me certain questions as to the Lady Teuta and of the [...] strange manner of her reputed death, as it was gradually unfolded in [...] my answers to his questioning. And as each new phase of knowledge [...] came to him, he would rush on as one possessed of fiends: whereat our [...] mountaineers, who seem to respect even fiends for their thoroughness, [...] would strive to keep pace with him till they too seemed worked into [...] diabolic possession. And I myself, left alone in the calmness of [...] sacerdotal office, forgot even that. With surging ears and eyes that [...] saw blood, I rushed along with best of them.|$|E
