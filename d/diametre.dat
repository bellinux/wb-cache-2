40|$|We analyse the {{population}} of near-Earth Long-Period Comets (LPCs) (perihelion distances q 10 ^ 3 yr). We have considered the sample of LPCs discovered during the period 1900 - 2009 and their estimated absolute total visual magnitudes H. For the period 1900 - 1970 we have relied upon historical estimates of absolute total magnitudes, while for the more recent period 1970 - 2009 we have made our own estimates of H based on Green's photometric data base and IAU Circulars. We have also used historical records for the sample of brightest comets (H < 4. 5) covering the period: 1500 - 1899, based mainly on Vsekhsvyatskii, Hasegawa and Kronk catalogues. We find that the cumulative distribution of H can be represented by a three-modal law of the form log_ 10 N_<H = C + alpha times H, where the C's are constants for the different legs, and alpha ≃ 0. 28 +/- 0. 10 for H < 4. 0, alpha ≃ 0. 56 +/- 0. 10 for 4. 0 <= H < 5. 8, and alpha ≃ 0. 20 +/- 0. 02 for 5. 8 <= H < 8. 6.

40|$|L'application du modèle de Muskingum pour simuler l'écoulement à surface libre dans les canaux d'irrigation a été largement utilisée et validée. Par extension, ce modèle est également employé pour simuler les écoulements en réseau d'assainissement. Or, nous avons pu montrer des erreurs allant jusqu'à 80 % du débit de pointe entre le modèle de Muskingum à paramètres fixes et le modèle de référence de Barré de Saint-Venant. Nous proposons une {{nouvelle}} paramétrisation du modèle de Muskingum pour l'écoulement en collecteur circulaire en réseau d'assainissement et ceci pour un large domaine de longueurs, pentes et <b>diamètres</b> de collecteurs. Ce nouveau modèle non-linéaire a été calé par minimisation d'une fonction objectif traduisant la proximité du modèle proposé avec les résultats de la résolution des équations de Barré de Saint-Venant pour des hydrogrammes rectangulaires. Un réseau de neurones a été utilisé pour paramétrer le modèle. Cette nouvelle application des équations de Muskingum permet l'obtention d'erreurs relatives moyennes inférieures à 6 % sur la valeur et l'instant du débit de pointe, ceci dans le cas de collecteurs ayant jusqu'à 6500 m de longueur, des pentes variant entre 0. 5 % et 1 % et des <b>diamètres</b> entre 150 et 2500 mm et des hydrogrammes de débit de pointe proche de la capacité du collecteur. Le modèle a également été validé sur un hydrogramme de forme quelconque. Certain {{towns and}} cities frequently suffer from failures of their sewer networks, especially in rainy weather. Pollution of the host environment, as the direct consequence of occasionally untimely spills, is not appreciated by the natural environment or the human population. Improving {{the quality of the}} natural environment therefore involves an increasingly sophisticated control of the hydraulics and the pollutant load in drainage systems, and especially in sewer networks. Real-time management of sewer networks can provide a solution {{for the protection of the}} natural environment. In this case, control strategies are provided for the sluices and pumps of the sewer network during a rainy event to minimize the urban effluent. Moreover, a better understanding and modeling of the transport of pollution in the mains is required. To that end, not only must the hydraulic operation of the mains be correctly modeled (shape of the hydrograph, value and temporal position of the peak flow), but this numerical model must also be stable and converge towards the solution, irrespective of the initial conditions for modeling of the pollution, and the computer time must be compatible with the requirements of real-time management. The most representative model of unidimensional flows is that of Barré de Saint-Venant (1871). The non-linearity of the model, resulting in difficulties in solving these equations, together with the computer time required, are such that not all the criteria for a real-time application can be met. The conceptual equations model of Muskingum is another model that can be used. In the case of round sewerage mains with a slope ranging from practically nil to a few per-thousandths and a few kilometers long, the K and α coefficients traditionally used do not yield correct results with respect to the benchmark model of Barré de Saint-Venant. To keep the advantages of the simplification of the Muskingum equations, and to avoid having to solve the Barré de Saint Venant system, we propose new parameters for the Muskingum equations and we use optimization and correlation calculation techniques using neural networks. In modeling the mains of a sewer network, the discretization of their length, within the usual limits [50 m; 1000 m] is chosen empirically. This discretization plays an essential part in the propagation of the wave in a main. To take this effect into account, the round main of length L is discretized into N sections, and K is expressed on the basis of the maximum speed of the flow Vmax. The model setting parameters are now N and α, and will be calibrated for a wide range of slopes, lengths and flow rates for round mains with a constant roughness. The calculation procedure is as follows: - Setting of the optimal values of N and alpha giving results close to those calculated by Barré de Saint Venant; - Determination of correlations of the parameters N and alpha according to the slope, length and diameter; - Validation of the Muskingum model in relation to that of Barré de Saint-Venant. The parameters alpha and N are set by minimizing an objective function giving the agreement between the results of the hydraulic simulations by Barré de Saint-Venant and the simulations of the proposed model. The objective function is defined by the sum of the relative quadratic deviations of the values and times of maximum flow rates. The maximum errors are in fact reduced from 90 % to 10 % on peak flows and from 30 % to 10 % at a given point in time during the peak flow. The mean error is reduced forty-fold for peak flow, and five-fold in the temporal position, with a reduction of the same order for the standard deviations. Correlations of alpha and N are sought according to the slope, length and diameter of the mains modeled. As linear type relations failed to provide satisfactory results, the multi-layer Perceptron type (artificial) neural network model was used. The model includes 3 inputs and 2 outputs. The first, essential stage consists of finding the optimal number of neurons in the masked layer. It is important to mention that despite maximum errors of 40 % and 20 % on the prediction of time and peak flow rate, mean errors of only 3 % and 4 % are observed. Given this result, 4 neurons were chosen in the masked layer. This model therefore includes 3 inputs, 4 neurons in the masked layer, and 2 outputs. Following the learning phase with the results of the optimization phase, the so-called prediction phase was then performed. This consists of using the neural network with data with intermediary values with respect to those used in the learning phase. The neural network is used solely to predict values within the minimum and maximum limits of the learning phase. The prediction (or validation) phase revealed that the mean errors are in the order of 2. 7 % for the peak flow value and 5. 5 % for the instant of the same flow. The choice of 4 neurons in the masked layer during the prediction phase gives results with the same order of magnitude as in the learning phase, thus validating the structure of the neural network chosen. Subsequently, the proximity of the value and of the time position of the maximum flow rate for the propagation of rectangular hydrograms was studied. The performance of the model proposed is now verified by studying the propagation of a hydrogram of any given shape. Use of this model, validated on a hydrogram of any given shape and presenting several peaks of different intensities, yields a satisfactory reproduction of the output hydrogram and is a distinct improvement on the classic Muskingum model...|$|R

40|$|The French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra) {{began in}} 2000 the {{construction}} of an Underground Research Laboratory (URL) with the main goal of demonstrating the feasibility of a geological repository in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. Several research programs have taken place to improve the knowledge of the rock properties and its response to the excavation progress. A network of experimental drifts has been constructed with variations on: excavation method, structure geometry, supports system and orientations with respect to principal stresses’ directions. In each drift different sections have been instrumented to monitor the hydro-mechanical behavior of the rock mass formation. Continuous monitoring of the excavated zone around the drifts in the main level (- 490 m) revealed the development of a fractured zone (extensional and shear fractures) induced by the excavation. The extent of this fractured zone depends on the drift orientation regarding the in-situ stress field. Accordingly, the convergence measurements showed an anisotropic closure which depends also on the drifts’ orientations. Moreover, marked overpressures and an anisotropic pore pressure field around the drifts have been also observed. The approach proposed in this work is mainly based on a direct analysis of the convergence measurements, for studying the anisotropic response of the rock formation during and after excavation. The convergence evolution is analyzed {{on the basis of the}} semi-empirical law proposed by Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. The monitoring and analysis of convergence data can provide a reliable approach of the interaction between rock mass and support. Therefore, the anisotropy and the variability of the closure are analyzed taking into account different field cases: drifts excavated in two different orientations (i. e. influence of the initial stress state), different methods, sizes and rates of excavation and different supports systems with different conditions of installation. This broad range of cases permits to refine the analysis for reliable predictions of the convergence evolution in the long term. This approach can thus be used for the design of various types of support and the evaluation of its performance in the long term. On the other hand, the pore pressure evolution induced by excavation of drifts as recorded in situ has been analyzed. The anisotropic response observed in-situ suggests that the intrinsic anisotropy of the material plays a key role in the response of the rock formation. To understand these phenomena, an anisotropic poroelastic analysis of the pore pressure evolution induced by the drift excavation is performed. The main goal is to simulate the main trends of the pore pressure evolution with a simple model taking into account the inherent anisotropy of the material. Finally, an analysis of the onset of failure shows the key role of the hydro-mechanical coupling on the extension of the failed zone around the driftsL'Agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs (Andra) a commencé en 2000 la construction du Laboratoire Souterrain de Meuse / Haute-Marne (LS-M/HM) avec l'objectif principal de démontrer la faisabilité d’un stockage géologique dans l’argilite du Callovo-Oxfordien. Un réseau de galeries expérimentales a été excavé, principalement en suivant les directions des contraintes horizontales (majeure et mineure), avec des variations sur : la méthode d'excavation, la géométrie de la structure et le soutènement. Chaque galerie a été instrumentée en différentes sections pour suivre le comportement hydromécanique de la roche face à l’excavation. Le suivi de la zone autour des galeries excavées au niveau principal (- 490 m) a révélé le développement d'une zone fracturée (fractures en extension et en cisaillement) induite par l'excavation. La distribution de la zone fracturée dépend à la fois de l'orientation de la galerie et du champ de contraintes in-situ et a une influence importante sur la déformation des galeries. En effet, les mesures de convergence ont montré une fermeture anisotrope de la section de la galerie. De plus, il a été observé un champ de distribution anisotrope de la pression de pores ainsi que des surpressions autour des galeries. Afin d’analyser la réponse anisotrope du massif pendant l’excavation et après celle-ci, les travaux effectués dans le cadre de la thèse sont axés principalement sur une étude directe des mesures de convergence in-situ. Cette analyse s’effectue à l’aide de la loi semi-empirique proposée par Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. A cet égard, différentes galeries excavées dans le LS-M/HM ont été étudiées. Ces galeries présentent certaines différences dans leurs orientations et l’état initial des contraintes, dans la méthode et la vitesse d’excavation ainsi que dans les <b>diamètres</b> de la section et les types de soutènements installées. Cette analyse permet d’obtenir des prédictions fiables de la convergence à long-terme, ce qui peut servir pour le dimensionnement et la prévision de la performance du soutènement à long-terme. En outre, nous avons étudié la réponse anisotrope du champ de pression interstitielle observée in-situ. Cette analyse est basée sur une approche poroélastique anisotrope. L’objectif principal est de reproduire qualitativement l’évolution de la pression des pores autour des galeries avec une approche simple qui prend en compte l’anisotropie intrinsèque du matériau. Enfin, une analyse de l’apparition de la rupture montre le rôle clé que joue le couplage hydromécanique dans l’extension de la zone fracturé...|$|R

Une étude comparative du développement de la biomasse couplé aux mécanismes généraux de transferts gazeux à travers deux réacteurs biologiques est menée. Des lits d’infiltration percolation sont simulés par des colonnes garnies de sables d’origine et de structures différentes. Ils sont alimentés périodiquement via un automate de commande avec un influent d’une charge de 525 mgDCO/l et de 54 mgNK/l. Les résultats obtenus établissent le fait qu’un développement équilibré de la biomasse incluant les phases de croissance et de régression est intrinsèquement lié à {{la nature}} physique du matériau support. A l’aide des carottes prélevées sur les massifs filtrants et des sondes d’oxymétrie introduites à différentes hauteurs des lits d’infiltration, nous montrons que la répartition verticale du biofilm dans les colonnes ainsi que l’oxygénation des milieux poreux lors des périodes de repos sont également corrélées à la structure des supports pourtant de <b>diamètres</b> moyens similaires. L’efficacité de traitement biologique du carbone est supérieure pour un sable d’origine alluvionnaire comparativement à un sable concassé; la tendance s’inversant significativement lorsqu’il s’agit de la diminution de l’azote. In this article, we present work highlighting {{the capacity of}} variously textured porous media to biologically process urban waste water. A comparative study was undertaken that coupled biomass development with general gas transfer mechanisms through two biological engines. Infiltration/percolation beds are biological systems that treat water using a purifying bacterial culture that develops on a mineral support. Used in domestic wastewater treatment, they are regarded as being well suited to rural areas. These infiltration/percolation beds are {{easy to use and}} attain a high quality in their output, two factors that constitute assets for small communities. Infiltration/percolation beds were simulated in the present work by columns lined with sands of varying origin and structure. They were fed automatically, at set intervals, with waste water containing 525 mg/L of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 54 mg/L of Kjeldahl nitrogen. A balanced development of the biomass, including the phases of growth and regression, was intrinsically related to the physical nature of the material used as a support. First, during the supply period, balanced growth of the biomass was quickly reached within the crushed sand. Secondly, within round sand, the regression of the biofilm was less significant and more regular over several weeks. In both supports, the regression was well correlated with an exponential decay. Lastly, the frequency of the supply periods, the organic loads involved, and the rest periods imposed are all factors that contribute to a lack of accumulation of living and/or inert organic matter in the columns. After obtaining a balanced development of the biomass, the abilities of the columns to reduce the concentrations of carbon, Kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia were evaluated. Samples of effluent were taken downstream, both before the beginning of the supply period and as it came out of the column approximately thirty minutes after beginning the drainage period. The percentage of suspended matter coming out of the columns gave rather precise information on the scrubbing of the solid mass caused by various shearing speeds or by the structure of the base. Generally, it appeared that :- The reduction of the overall DOC was higher than 70 %, regardless of which type of sand base was used. - In the water coming out of the column made up of round sand, the overall DOC content was without exception lower than 125 mg/L, as would be expected for an infiltration-percolation process. - The treatment of carbon in the columns based on stream sand was in general more effective than that obtained in columns with crushed sand. Concerning the treatment of nitrogen, crushed sand yielded outputs with a reduction in ammonia that was a lot higher than 80 % (mean ± SD: 92 ± 4 %) and was systematically higher than those obtained with stream sand (mean ± SD: 72 ± 7 %). The suspended matter content was extremely low in the effluent; since no suspended matter was introduced into the effluent, the concentration coming out of the column was the direct result of the biofilm becoming detached and/or, to a lesser extent, of the transport of the biomass in the liquid phase. As could be expected, because of the roughness causing more shearing, more particles became detached when the interior solid mass was made up of crushed sand. Using core samples taken from the filter's solid mass, as well as oxygen probes inserted at various levels into the biological engines, we showed that the vertical distribution of the biofilm in the columns, as well as the oxygenation of the porous media during the rest periods, were all correlated with the structure of the solid supports (note that all sands had similar average diameters). Gaseous exchanges within the filter's solid mass were dependent on both the type of coating and the depth at which they took place. The oxygen probes were inserted at depths of 14 cm and 18 cm respectively, to determine the percentage of oxygen saturation in the liquid phase within the filter during one week while the columns were operating. Two phases were characteristic of the exchanges observed in {{the upper part of the}} filter's solid mass. First we noted an instantaneous reduction in the oxygen content of the liquid phase, linked to the arrival of a batch, followed by a reoxygenation of this portion. Next there was a long phase, lasting approximately 94 % of the time between batches, during which time the oxygen content in the residual moisture remained constant. In the lower part of the solid mass, variation in oxygen content was different. Partial deoxygenation in the liquid phase of the porous media here was primarily due to the biochemical oxidation of the organic matter (i. e., consumption by the biomass). It was also due, to a lesser extent, to the augmentation in moisture content that occurs after each batch, and leads to a reduction in porosity and a decrease in oxygen transfer. During the final phase of drainage, a balance was created between the open porous space with air, and the space containing stagnant moisture. The diffusion of oxygen in the former and its transfer towards the latter thus compensated for this consumption, and it therefore remained constant. If the medium was left to dry out longer, the diffusion and transfer phenomena increased, and we observed an increase in oxygen content. With respect to the vertical distribution of biomass in the columns, we found that it was almost homogeneous inside the stream sand, up to a depth of 28 cm (total depth = 40 cm). Generally, the organic matter content at each point of measurement in the column was higher in the stream sand than in the crushed sand. The variation was greater around 28 cm, where there was a more significant quantity of moisture inside the sand...|$|R
