5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. <b>Fields</b> <b>were</b> being used for crop cultivation {{for a while and}} then as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E
5|$|Three {{people were}} killed, many more were injured, and 600 Martiniquans were left homeless. The banana <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> {{completely}} destroyed. Officials estimated the {{damage on the}} island at about €250million (US$337million).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} twenty-three awards were conferred in 1954 {{followed}} by twelve in 1955; thirteen in 1956; sixteen in 1957; sixteen again in 1958, and fourteen in 1959, giving {{a total of}} 94 recipients {{in the first six}} years—including one foreign recipient awarded in 1955. Till 1959, individuals from nine different <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> awarded which includes twenty-six from literature and education, seventeen from civil service, twelve artists, ten from science and engineering, ten from social work, eight from public affairs, six from medicine, four sports-persons, and one from trade and industry.|$|E
50|$|Volatile <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> linearizable. Reading a {{volatile}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> like acquiring a lock: the working memory is invalidated and the volatile <b>field's</b> current value <b>is</b> reread from memory. Writing {{a volatile}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> like releasing a lock: the volatile <b>field</b> <b>is</b> immediately written back to memory.|$|R
50|$|Reads—writes to <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> linearizable {{if either}} the <b>field</b> <b>is</b> volatile, or the <b>field</b> <b>is</b> {{protected}} by a unique lock which is acquired by all readers and writers.|$|R
50|$|The SRP header is 16 bits (2 bytes) total. It {{contains}} 5 <b>fields.</b> These <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> as follows: Time to Live (TTL), Ring Identifier (R), Priority (PRI), Mode, and Parity (P). The TTL <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 8 bits, {{its only}} metric is hop count. The R <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 1 bit (either 0 or 1 designating the inner or outer ring). The PRI <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 3 bits designating the packet priority. The Mode <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 3 bits designating {{what type of}} data is contained in the payload. The P <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 1 bit.|$|R
5|$|After the Philippines fell to Japanese {{forces in}} 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued to farmers. Without {{any change in}} the Marihuana Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports of addiction, madness, and overt sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> largely arable, providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
50|$|Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>is</b> a {{neighborhood}} of St. Matthews, Kentucky. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> a Sixth Class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> incorporated on May 24, 1957. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> dissolved on July 1, 2000 and annexed by St. Matthews on January 8, 2001. The population was 250 at the 2000 census.|$|R
50|$|A new {{football}}/soccer/baseball <b>field</b> <b>was</b> inaugurated in {{the spring}} of 2006. The football <b>field</b> <b>is</b> officially known as Jackie Jensen Field, while the baseball/softball <b>field</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to Mike Marcoulis, Sr., longtime coach and teacher.|$|R
40|$|When an {{electric}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> applied on a topological insulator, {{not only the}} electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, but also the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, vice versa. I designed topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer magnetic cloak, derived the electric field and magnetic field {{inside and outside the}} topological insulator and superconductor sphere. Simulation and calculation results show that the applied magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> screened by the topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer, and the electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated in the cloaked region...|$|R
5|$|Ashburton Playing Fields {{are just}} off Shirley Road, behind the school. The <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> first {{dedicated}} {{as a public}} horse racing course by James I in the early 17th century. Following {{the opening of the}} nearby Woodside railway station in 1871 large numbers of Londoners began travelling to the racecourse. Following pressure from the Mayor of Croydon, concerned about the large crowds, the racecourse was closed in 1890 and replaced with a golf course; this was bought by the council in 1942 and given to public use as playing fields.|$|E
5|$|Before Miri was founded, Marudi was the {{administrative}} {{centre of the}} northern region of Sarawak. Miri was founded in 1910 when the first oil well was drilled by Royal Dutch Shell. The discovery of an oil field in Miri has led to rapid development of Miri town. Miri became {{the administrative}} centre of the northern region of Sarawak by 1929. During World War II, the Miri oil <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> destroyed by the Brooke government to sabotage Japanese operations in Southeast Asia but to no avail; Miri town was the first landing point of Japanese troops in Borneo. The subsequent Japanese occupation led Miri to become a target of Allied air raids which caused the destruction of oil refinery facilities in Miri. The petroleum industry {{continued to be a}} major player in the city's economy after the war. Oil exploration has moved offshore since the 1950s, but subsequently new inland oil <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> found in 1989 and 2011. In 1974, the formation of Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas led to co-operation between Petronas and Shell on oil exploration in the Miri region. In 2005, Miri became the 10th city in Malaysia to be granted official city status, the first non-state capital city to be bestowed such status.|$|E
5|$|During British rule, Secunderabad {{became a}} {{well-known}} sporting centre and many race courses, parade grounds and polo <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> built. Many elite clubs {{formed by the}} Nizams and the British such as the Secunderabad Club, the Nizam Club and the Hyderabad Race Club, which {{is known for its}} horse racing especially the annual Deccan derby, still exist. In more recent times, motorsports has become popular with the Andhra Pradesh Motor Sports Club organising popular events such as the Deccan ¼ Mile Drag, TSD Rallies and 4x4 off-road rallying.|$|E
50|$|The NFL-caliber Cliff Moore Practice Facility {{is located}} between Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium and Clark-LeClair Stadium on Charles Boulevard. The {{facility}} is {{a hallmark of}} the ECU athletic complex and consists of three fields, two natural and one FieldTurf. The natural <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> based on Dowdy-Ficklen <b>field.</b> The <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> Bermuda Tift grass with gravel and sand-based drainage. The <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> parallel to one another and run north to south. The FieldTurf <b>field</b> <b>is</b> perpendicular to the natural grass <b>fields.</b> The <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 78120 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|The Halibut <b>Field,</b> <b>is</b> an oil <b>field,</b> {{within the}} Gippsland Basin. The oil <b>field</b> <b>is</b> located {{approximately}} 64 km offshore of southeastern Australia. The total area of this <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 26.9 km2 and {{is composed of}} 10 mappable units.|$|R
50|$|Saltpond Oil <b>Field</b> <b>is</b> an oil <b>field</b> off {{the coast}} of Ghana. The <b>field</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 1970 by Signal-Amoco Consortium.

5|$|Early on March 15, {{hours after}} the NCAA and NIT <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> announced, Duquesne {{accepted}} a bid into the CBI. This would be Duquesne's 23rd postseason appearance and first in the CBI, which started in 2008. This also {{marked the first time}} since 1981 that the Dukes made two consecutive postseason appearances. It was announced that the Dukes would face off against the Princeton Tigers at Jadwin Gymnasium on March 17.|$|E
5|$|From about 4000 BC, Neolithic {{settlers}} arrived introducing cereal cultivars, domesticated animals such {{cattle and}} sheep, large timber building, and stone monuments. Field systems {{were developed in}} different parts of Ireland, including at the Céide Fields, that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day Tyrawley. An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains for {{the outer}} bands of Hurricane Beta, amounting up to 3in (76mm), caused {{flooding}} and landslides in Panama. At least 256 people {{were affected by}} the storm and 52 homes were damaged; however, {{the cost of the}} damages is unknown. At least 50hectares (124acres) of rice <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> flooded across the country. One person, a young girl, was killed after the boat she was on sank amid rough seas. Both her parents escaped the sinking ship. Two other people drowned after being swept away by the swollen Chagres River and two others were reported missing.|$|E

50|$|A newer {{track and}} {{football}} <b>field</b> <b>were</b> created {{with the new}} school. This <b>field</b> <b>is</b> actually {{on the opposite side}} of Highway 285. Access to the <b>field</b> <b>is</b> gained by way of an old railroad bridge spanning the highway. A new baseball <b>field</b> <b>was</b> also planned, but lack of funds and a decreasing enrollment rate had placed those plans on hold. As of late 2010 a softball <b>field</b> had <b>been</b> completed, but not the baseball field.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{rules of}} the {{distribution}} of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>were</b> carried out by numerical simulation. The distribution of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>was</b> got, and the effects of current intensity and frequency on the distribution of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by constructing three-dimensional finite element model and using ANSYS software which is a kind of commercial FEM analysis software. The results show that the intensity of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> proportional to current intensity, magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> mainly localized in the surface region of liquid melt and there is a notable edge effect in the corner...|$|R
5|$|In 1863, two sail-driven tankers {{were built}} on England's River Tyne. These were {{followed}} in 1873 {{by the first}} oil-tank steamer, Vaderland, which was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company for Belgian owners. The vessel's use was curtailed by U.S. and Belgian authorities citing safety concerns. By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> making limited use of oil tank barges and cylindrical railroad tank-cars {{similar to those in}} use today.|$|E
5|$|In March 1898, the {{baseball}} <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> finally completed. On April 16, 1898, the first baseball game between Georgia and Georgia Tech, {{then known as}} the Georgia School of Technology, was played. From 1902 until 1904, the Atlanta Crackers, the city's original professional baseball team played ball on the fields of Piedmont Park before moving to a stadium on Ponce de Leon Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Leftover {{heat from}} this hot spot was later liberated by Basin and Range-associated rifting {{and created the}} many {{overlapping}} lava flows {{that make up the}} Lava Beds of Idaho. The largest rift zone is the Great Rift; it is from this 'Great Rift fissure system' that Craters of the Moon, Kings Bowl, and Wapi lava <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> created. The Great Rift is a National Natural Landmark.|$|E
50|$|Classical {{fields as}} above, {{such as the}} {{electromagnetic}} <b>field,</b> <b>are</b> usually infinitely differentiable functions, but they are in any case almost always twice differentiable. In contrast, generalized functions are not continuous. When dealing carefully with classical fields at finite temperature, the mathematical methods of continuous random <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> used, because thermally fluctuating classical <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> nowhere differentiable. Random <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> indexed sets of random variables; a continuous random <b>field</b> <b>is</b> a random <b>field</b> that has a set of functions as its index set. In particular, it is often mathematically convenient to take a continuous random field to have a Schwartz space of functions as its index set, {{in which case the}} continuous random <b>field</b> <b>is</b> a tempered distribution.|$|R
50|$|Although {{baseball}} was unofficially played in Pullen Park {{for many years}} - perhaps even before the land became a park - the officially sanctioned <b>field</b> <b>was</b> not created until the unofficial <b>field</b> <b>was</b> renovated in 1920. A second <b>field</b> <b>was</b> added later.|$|R
2500|$|Track and <b>field</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1929, but disappeared quickly. Later, in 1975, track and <b>field</b> <b>was</b> reestablished.|$|R
5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, {{the threat}} of Glenda {{prompted}} officials to close oil, representing a lack of production of 154,000barrels of oil. Additionally, natural gas <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> closed, and several ports along the coastline were shut down during {{the passage of the}} storm. Prior to the storm's landfall, officials issued a Red Alert for several communities. Storm shelters were opened in Karratha and Onslow, while a few hundred people evacuated along the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Only 13days after Eline {{struck the}} country, Cyclone Gloria also hit northeastern Madagascar, {{bringing}} additional damage and flooding. The two storms collectively {{killed at least}} 140people, although there was initial uncertainty in the toll due to disrupted communications. Floods from the two storm inundated 70% of homes and wrecked 70% of the crops in the districts of Andapa, Sambava, Antalaha, and Vohemar. About 12,000people in 114villages were isolated. Rice <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> flooded for over a week, and coffee and banana crops had severe losses. Collectively, 12,230people were left without access to clean water.|$|E
