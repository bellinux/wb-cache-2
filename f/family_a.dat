5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} the Electorate of Cologne. In his later years, a nuncio at Cologne took {{responsibilities}} for the financial administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach <b>family</b> <b>a</b> foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E
5|$|An {{assortment}} of unusual sculptures are {{scattered around the}} park, including: Still Water, a massive horse head lapping up water; Jelly Baby <b>Family,</b> <b>a</b> family of giant Jelly Babies standing {{on top of a}} large black cube; and Vroom Vroom, which resembles a giant human hand pushing a toy car along the ground. The sculptor Jacob Epstein constructed several works in Hyde Park. His memorial to the author William Henry Hudson, featuring his character Rima caused public outrage when it was unveiled in 1925.|$|E

5|$|Carroll was {{the second}} of four sons born to Daniel Carroll of Aghagurty and Littermurna (c. 1642–1688), a Catholic Irishman whose family lost much of their land and wealth in the English Civil War. The exact place of his birth is unclear, though it likely {{occurred}} near {{the small town of}} Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name. Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the head tenant. This action gave the <b>family</b> <b>a</b> livelihood, but the family continued to have limited means compared to their former status. It is likely that Charles Carroll was fostered by the wealthier Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.|$|E
5|$|Chase {{had been}} fascinated by {{organized}} crime and the mafia from an early age, witnessing such people growing up. He also was raised on classic gangster films, such as The Public Enemy, and the crime series The Untouchables. The series is partly inspired by the Boiardo <b>family,</b> <b>a</b> prominent New Jersey organized crime family when Chase was growing up, and partly on New Jersey's DeCavalcante family. He has mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show's writing, and Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show's cinematic style.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>family</b> wage is <b>a</b> wage that is {{sufficient}} to raise <b>a</b> <b>family.</b> This contrasts with a living wage, which is generally taken to mean a wage sufficient for a single individual to live on, but not necessarily sufficient to also support <b>a</b> <b>family.</b> <b>As</b> a stronger form of living wage, <b>a</b> <b>family</b> wage is likewise advocated by proponents of social justice. Family wage campaign was aiming to maintain the traditional <b>family</b> structure, as <b>a</b> concept connecting economics and family structure {{it is one of}} the examples of how economic structure of <b>family,</b> which is <b>a</b> subject of the field family economics, affects overall economy beyond the family.|$|R

5|$|Col. Thomas Lee (c. 1690November 14, 1750) was {{a leading}} {{political}} figure of colonial Virginia. He {{was a member of}} the Lee <b>family,</b> <b>a</b> political dynasty which included many figures from the pre-American Revolutionary War era until the late 20th century. Lee became involved in politics in 1710 and he became the resident manager of the Northern Neck Proprietary for Lady Catherine Fairfax. After his father died, he inherited land in Northumberland and Charles County. Lee later acquired vast holdings in what are now Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Prince William, and Loudoun Counties. These properties were developed as tobacco plantations.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his <b>family,</b> <b>a</b> family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|Gefjon appears {{prominently}} as the allegorical {{mother of}} Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in the forty-page Swedish Romantic poem Gefion, a Poem in Four Cantos by Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll (1770–1835). A fountain depicting Gefjun driving her oxen sons {{to pull her}} plough (The Gefion Fountain, 1908) by Anders Bundgaard stands in Copenhagen, Denmark, {{on the island of}} Zealand, as in the myth. The Gefion <b>family,</b> <b>a</b> family of asteroids, and asteroid 1272 Gefion (discovered in 1931 by Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth) both derive their names from that of the goddess.|$|E

One evening when Sandy is a young adult, his uncles Bart and Bernie visit Eclipse. The uncles feed the <b>family</b> <b>a</b> poisoned birthday cake {{in an attempt to}} inherit the family fortune, sending everyone but Sandy and Bentley into a coma.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, McCreery {{suggested}} {{reforms to}} the Order of Canada that would avert the awkwardness around appointing those in Canada's royal family as full {{members of the}} order: He theorized that the Queen, as the order's Sovereign, could simply appoint, on ministerial advice, anyone as an extra member, or the monarch could issue an ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved. Similarly, McCreery proposed that a new division of the order could be established specifically for governors general, their spouses, {{and members of the}} Royal <b>Family,</b> <b>a</b> version of which was adopted in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} {{the results of}} an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's <b>family.</b> <b>A</b> second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.|$|E

5|$|Marriage most {{commonly}} involved a betrothal (engue), before the bride was {{given over to}} her new husband and kyrios (ekdosis). A less common form of marriage, practised {{in the case of}} epikleroi, required a court judgement (epidikasia). Athenian women married with a dowry, which was intended to provide their livelihood. Depending on the <b>family,</b> <b>a</b> dowry might have been as much as 25 percent of the family's wealth. Daughters of even the poorest families apparently had dowries worth ten minae. Rich families could provide much larger dowries; Demosthenes' sister, for instance, had a dowry of two talents (120 minae). Dowries usually consisted of movable goods and cash, although land was occasionally included.|$|E

5|$|Olga's murder {{following}} the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. In later years, when {{dozens of people}} made claims to be surviving members of the imperial <b>family,</b> <b>a</b> woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga, but her claim was not taken seriously.
