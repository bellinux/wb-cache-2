40|$|This paper scrutinizes the {{determinants}} of <b>Import</b> Revenue generated in Ghana. An econometric model in Ordinary Least Square is employed on time series data for the period 1997 to 2014. This is aimed at measuring the effect of gross domestic product, effective duty rate, <b>import</b> exemption, <b>import</b> value and relative price on <b>import</b> revenue generated in Ghana. The paper also examines the reforms in <b>import</b> revenue administration, reforms in <b>import</b> revenue generation, effect of automation on <b>import</b> revenue mobilization, the performance of <b>import</b> revenue, sources of <b>import</b> revenue leakages and measures to improve the collection of <b>import</b> revenue. <b>Import</b> revenue is collected by the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority. The results reveal a strong relationship between GDP, <b>Import</b> Exemption, <b>Import</b> Value and <b>Import</b> Revenue. A moderate relationship exists between Effective Duty Rate and <b>Import</b> Revenue. A negative or weak relationship exists between Relative Price and <b>Import</b> Revenue.

A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's <b>imports</b> in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food <b>imports</b> to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat <b>imports</b> from Australia and also <b>imports</b> 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E
