2500|$|Perhaps {{the strongest}} {{criticism}} {{lies in its}} disregard for the physical limits of the Earth and its <b>ecosphere</b> which are the physical container of all human economies. [...] This disregard becomes hot denial by Neoclassical economists when limits are asserted, since to accept such limits creates fundamental contradictions with the foundational presumptions that growth in scale of the human economy forever is both possible and desirable. [...] The disregard/denial of limits includes both resources and 'waste sinks,' the capacity to absorb human waste products and man-made toxins.|$|E

(The main function of the snails was aesthetic, as they cleaned scum from the glass.) The Gorgonia coral in <b>EcoSpheres</b> is dead and plays no active biological role in the system, however it does increase the surface area for beneficial bacteria and algae, and the calcium carbonate in the coral acts as a pH buffering agent.|$|R

50|$|The <b>EcoSphere's</b> main visual {{appeal is}} {{provided}} by tiny red-pink shrimp, Halocaridina rubra, between 1/4 and 3/8 inch (or approximately a centimeter) in length. The shrimp swim energetically around the aquarium, eat the brown bacterial and algal scum on the glass, consume the filamentous green algae which sometimes forms a globular pillow in the water, and perch on a fragment of soft coral.|$|R
50|$|An <b>ecosphere</b> is a {{planetary}} closed ecological system. In this global ecosystem, {{the various forms}} of energy and matter that constitute a given planet interact on a continual basis. The forces of the four Fundamental interactions cause {{the various forms of}} matter to settle into identifiable layers. These layers are referred to as component spheres with the type and extent of each component sphere varying significantly from one particular <b>ecosphere</b> to another. Component spheres that represent a significant portion of an <b>ecosphere</b> are referred to as a primary component spheres. For instance, Earth's <b>ecosphere</b> consists of five primary component spheres which are the Geosphere, Hydrosphere, Biosphere, Atmosphere, and Magnetosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Animal-rights {{advocates have}} raised many {{objections}} to the <b>Ecosphere.</b> The core of the issue is that the <b>Ecosphere</b> is not a truly self-sustaining system, {{which is why the}} shrimp in the <b>Ecosphere</b> generally live two to three years (as the vendor’s website states), while in properly sized and cared-for aquariums these shrimp can survive for up to twenty years, and even reproduce, as they do in the wild. In the <b>Ecosphere,</b> they slowly starve to death due to lack of food, suffocate from inadequate oxygen, and are poisoned by their own waste—all {{as a result of the}} intrinsic imbalance in a small, sealed ecosystem, where tiny changes (such as the ammonia given off by the decomposing body of a dead shrimp) cannot be self-corrected. According to at least one shrimp-raising hobbyist site that addresses these factors, the shrimp only last in the <b>Ecosphere</b> as long as they do because their inherent hardiness makes them “supershrimp.” ...|$|E

40|$|A broad {{program of}} {{freezing}} species in threatened <b>ecospheres</b> could preserve biodiversity for eventual use by future generations. Sampling without studying can lower costs dramatically. Local labor can {{do most of}} the gathering. Plausible costs of collecting and cryogenically suspending the tropical rain forest species, at a sampling fraction of 10 (- 6), are about 2 billion dollars for a full century. Much more information than species DNA will be saved, allowing future biotechnology to derive high information content and perhaps even resurrect then-extinct species. Parallel programs of in situ and other ex situ preservation are essential to allow later expression of frozen genomes in members of the same genus. This is a broad proposal that should be debated throughout the entire scientific community...|$|R

5000|$|Robinson {{writes about}} the {{infinite}} possibilities for terraria ecosystems, e.g. savannas, water worlds, genetically engineered <b>ecospheres</b> or habitats with new species, called 'Ascensions', resulting from the hybridization of common ones. Terraria are not only created for residential purposes; in 2312 they also function as farming worlds (producing food for Earth) and transportation vessels. Propelled through the solar system, they follow regular routes, non-stop, like unclaimed asteroids do. Ferries wishing to board them need to match their speeds. Terraria make travel from Earth to the outer planets a matter of weeks, like did transatlantic voyages before the steam engine. In the novel, the Alfred Wegener (presumably named after a German geophysicist) is one such terrarium, in an excavated cylinder twenty kilometers long and five across: ...|$|R

The new Nebraska Center for Sustainable Construction (NCSC) is embarking upon a long-term research program for Designing for Deconstruction with the intent of accelerating such change. The NCSC and various partners will apply the <b>Ecospheres</b> concept of five domains of sustainable principles (Environment, Socio-cultural, Technologies, Economics, and Public Policies) as an organizing strategy for the research. The first step of this program includes three phases of national work: a) survey of the design communities, b) systems studies, and c) education and national discourse, for the assessment, dissemination, and future of the research agenda. This proposal suggests the ideal of mainstreaming Design for Deconstruction within the design professions to facilitate a sustainable balance...|$|R
40|$|Vibrio is {{a diverse}} genus of marine-associated {{bacteria}} {{with at least}} 74 species and more expected as additional marine <b>ecospheres</b> are interrogated. This report describes a phylogenetic reconstruction of Vibrio isolates derived from one such unique ecosystem, marine sponges (Phylum Porifera) collected from depths of 150 to 1242 feet. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing along with molecular typing of 16 S– 23 S rRNA intergenic spacer regions clustered many sponge-associated Vibrio (spp) with current known species. That is, several benthic Vibrio species commensal with Porifera sponges seemed genetically linked to vibrios associated with coastal or shallow-water communities, signalling a panmictic population structure among seemingly ecologically disparate strains. Conversely, phylogenetic analysis provided evidence {{for at least two}} novel Vibrio speciation events within this specific sponge microcosm. Collectively, these findings earmark this still relatively unknown environment as a bastion of taxonomic and phylogenetic variability for the genus and probably other bacterial taxa...|$|R

40|$|The Marshall Convergent Coating- 1 (MCC- 1) {{formulation}} {{was produced}} in the 1990 s, and uses a standard bisphenol A epoxy resin system with a triamine accelerator. With the increasing heat rates forecast {{for the next generation}} of vehicles, higher-temperature sprayable coatings are needed. This work substitutes the low-temperature epoxy resins used in the MCC- 1 coating with epoxy phenolic, epoxy novalac, or resorcinolinic resins (higher carbon content), which will produce a higher char yield upon exposure to high heat and increased glass transition temperature. High-temperature filler materials, such as granular cork and glass <b>ecospheres,</b> are also incorporated as part of the convergent spray process, but other sacrificial (ablative) materials are possible. In addition, the use of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) nanoparticle hybrids will increase both reinforcement aspects and contribute to creating a tougher silacious char, which will reduce recession at higher heat rates. Use of expanding epoxy resin (lightweight MCC) systems are also useful in that they reduce system weight, have greater insulative properties, and a decrease in application times can be realized...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the Circumstellar Habitable Zone has served the {{scientific}} community well for some decades. It slips easily off the tongue, {{and it would be}} hard to replace. Recently, however, several workers have postulated types of habitable bodies which might exist outside the classic circumstellar habitable zone (HZ). These include not only bodies which orbit at substantial distances from their parent stars, but also snowball worlds with geothermally-maintained internal oceans and even densely-atmosphered worlds with geothermally-maintained surface oceans, which have been ejected from unstable planetary systems into interstellar space. If habitability is not a unique and diagnostic property of the HZ, then the value of the term has been compromised in a fundamental way. At the same time, it has become evident that multiple environmental states, differing in important ways in their habitability, are possible even for geophysically similar planets subject to similar levels of insolation, within the classic HZ. We discuss an approach to investigations of planetary habitability which focuses on planetary-scale ecosystems, which are here termed - <b>ecospheres.</b> This is following a usage popular amongst ecologists, such as Huggett (1999), rather than that of authors such as Strughold (1953) and Dole (1964), who used it as a term for the HZ. This approach emphasizes ecodynamic perspectives, which explore the dynamic interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors which together comprise ecosystems. Comment: 26 pages, no figure...|$|R
