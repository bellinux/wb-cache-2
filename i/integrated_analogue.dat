40|$|International audienceKarst {{networks}} are complex structures {{that are difficult}} to observe or survey. However, they {{have a major impact on}} fluid flows and water resources as well as on petroleum reservoir behaviour. In such applications, geostatistical approaches are generally used to simulate several 3 D models of geological structures, on which risk assessment analyses are performed in terms of reserve assessment or flow behaviour. In this paper, such an approach is proposed to simulate karst networks. The approach is based on the classical method Sequential Indicator Simulation (SIS). It relies on the decomposition of the karst network into conduit families, depending on their orientation and dimensions. Conduit shapes are characterized by variograms and are simulated sequentially from the first to the last family. Conditioning points are randomly simulated to assert the connectivity between each conduit family. Moreover, special attention is paid to the integration of geological and hydrogeological knowledge into the karst network simulation.

Effects on source-rock maturation zones were calculated through 1 D-thermal modeling for different graben types. Combined analogue-numerical modeling appears to be a useful method to simulate natural examples, as shown in this study of the southern Viking Graben in the northern North Sea.

40|$|Abstract — The {{number of}} {{wireless}} communication links is witnessing tremendous growth and new standards are being introduced at high pace. However, circuit development is costly and time consuming due to mask costs and design iterations. Moreover, with ever-increasing radio standard complexity, these costs are increasing. This pleads for a Software Defined Radio approach, {{in which one}} piece of flexible radio hardware is re-used for different applications and standards, downloadable and under software control. A software defined radio receiver can-at different timesreceive signals of a multitude of standards, obliviating the need to design, manufacture, stock and carry around separate receivers for all contemporary radio standards.

A CMOS <b>integrated</b> <b>analogue</b> downconverter containing a low-noise amplifier, downconversion mixers and filters performs all analogue processing required between RF pre-filters and the analogue-to-digital converter.

A novel methodology for structural testing of <b>analogue</b> <b>integrated</b> filters has been investigated and developed.

Comparing outputs from the filter and equalising network derives a negligibly small signal if the filter is fault free. However, the filter characteristics will change if it becomes faulty, so the compare output will increase. Processing circuitry derives a pass/fail signal from this change.

40|$|Advances {{in modern}} {{electronic}} technologies have {{given rise to}} portable devices that require better power management, system miniaturisation and wider functional capabilities. Power efficient, smaller and cost efficient circuits are vital in ensuring the development of sustainable technological solutions for the future by minimising the use of both material and energy resources. Reconfigurable electronics such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSPs) can be reprogrammed and configured to implement custom hardware functionality. These reconfigurable integrated circuits (ICs) are common, but they have mostly been digital, focusing on computation and signal processing. This dissertation extends the design paradigm to include <b>integrated</b> <b>analogue</b> electronics, specifically power supplies, and presents novel system architectures and control techniques to improve performance and power delivery to multiple, distributed loads, providing solutions towards the development of fully reconfigurable systems-on-chip (SOCs). The first approach towards the development of such a power-supply was the design of a new reconfigurable switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter. It uses a control scheme that combines the advantages of adaptive gain (AG) control and discrete frequency scaling (DFS) control to regulate the voltage for a single load. The proposed active control circuitry is predominately digital, therefore easy to implement and scalable for future technologies. The entire system is small, has comparable efficiency to other designs, and has been proven in a real-world biomedical application. This design was then extended to further improve its efficiency and suitability for a reconfigurable system. The use of a shared AG controller enables the converter to service multiple loads. Also, the performance of the SC converter is enhanced by the use of interleaving power stages and a better control algorithm in regulating its output voltages at the target reference voltages required by the loads. Adaptive switching techniques and switch size optimisation further boost the performance, especially its efficiency. Finally, a switched-inductor type synchronous buck-boost converter using Silicon-on-Sapphire (SOS) technology was designed. It provides very high efficiency and drives larger load currents using smaller devices, whilst switching at a lower frequency. This body of work provides the foundations for a fully-reconfigurable integrated power supply system...|$|E

The objective of this work is the fabrication of the world’s softest hollow cantilever with a beam stiffness, k, less than 100 pN/nm that is two orders of magnitude smaller than previously published. In pursuit of this objective, the intellectual contributions of this work include: 1) formation of the first high resolution (1. 87 pN noise floor), low stiffness (k = 53. 54 pN/nm) nano-channel cantilever made from thermally decomposable sacrificial polymer; 2) a parametric analysis of the hollow cantilever that highlights critical design features to minimize beam stiffness; 3) two new methods of interfacing a bulk microfluidic channel to a surface nanofluidic channel via a thermally decomposable polymer; and 4) a microfluidic side entry glass capillary interconnect to a bulk microfluidic channel. The technology incorporates the ability to manipulate the internal fluid pressure at the cantilever terminus to enable controlled aspiration of single cells. This work could enable the simultaneous measurement of cell mechanical properties, including mass, compressive modulus, viscoelasticity, tensile modulus, and adhesion in a single experiment. Further, an <b>integrated</b> <b>analogue</b> pressure control system is developed, using an original side-entry interconnect structure for direct-to-chip connection of glass capillary for fluidic probes {{as well as other}} lab on chip applications.

40|$|Abstract Background The KEGG Pathway {{database}} is {{a valuable}} collection of metabolic pathway maps. Nevertheless, the production of simulation capable metabolic networks from KEGG Pathway data is a challenging complicated work, regardless the already developed tools for this scope. Originally used for illustration purposes, KEGG Pathways through KGML (KEGG Markup Language) files, can provide complete reaction sets and introduce species versioning, which offers advantages for the scope of cellular metabolism simulation modelling. In this project, KEGGconverter is described, implemented also as a web-based application, which uses as source KGML files, in order to construct integrated pathway SBML models fully functional for simulation purposes. Results A case study of the integration of six human metabolic pathways from KEGG depicts the ability of KEGGconverter to automatically produce merged and converted to SBML fully functional pathway models, enhanced with default kinetics. The suitability of the developed tool is demonstrated through a comparison with other state-of-the art relevant software tools for the same data fusion and conversion tasks, thus illustrating the problems and the relevant workflows. Moreover, KEGGconverter permits the inclusion of additional reactions in the resulting model which represent flux cross-talk with neighbouring pathways, providing in this way improved simulative accuracy.
