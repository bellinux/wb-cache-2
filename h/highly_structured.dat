5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, {{including}} mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, {{and other}} non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow {{parts of the}} RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are <b>highly</b> <b>structured.</b> Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.|$|E

Atkins stated that Hope wrote <b>highly</b> <b>structured,</b> complex compositions that {{he played with}} improvisational flexibility. Mathieson pointed out that, despite the originality of Hope's compositions, they have been taken up by other musicians only rarely, as they are tied to Hope's idiosyncratic form of expression and remain difficult to play.|$|E

5|$|Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, also {{published}} as Mrs Beeton's Cookery Book, is an extensive guide to running a household in Victorian Britain, edited by Isabella Beeton and first published {{as a book}} in 1861. It had previously been published in parts. It was originally entitled Beeton's Book of Household Management, {{as one of the}} series of guide-books published by her husband, Samuel Beeton. The recipes were <b>highly</b> <b>structured,</b> in contrast to earlier cookbooks. It was illustrated with many monochrome and colour plates.|$|E
5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the viral particle {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and <b>highly</b> <b>structured.</b> This region of the viral genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E

Art students receive individualized instruction, participate in art exhibits and competitions, undertake commissioned work, and work at in-house galleries and off-site exhibits.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} isoform of PrP, {{known as}} PrPSc, {{is able to}} convert normal PrPC proteins into the infectious isoform by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes prion disease. Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has {{a higher proportion of}} β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process. The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious PrPSc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} four uniformed groups in HCI: National Cadet Corps (Land), National Police Cadet Corps, St. John Ambulance Brigade, and Scouts (and Ventures & Rovers). These CCAs provide a <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> organisation and a well-defined hierarchy. The HCI National Cadet Corps unit (HCINCC) {{has been awarded}} Gold for 15 consecutive years, winning the Best Unit Competition (BUC) in 2000. Also, HCINCC is the only Centre of Excellence in Precision Drill department amongst all NCC units in Singapore. The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) is currently the largest uniformed group in Singapore, and in HCI, in terms of membership. HCINPCC {{is also one of}} the only 2 units in Singapore to have achieved 20 gold awards in the annual Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA). They have received The NPCC Golden Cane, in honour of their achievement. The St. John Ambulance Brigade is one of two School Corps awarded Gold in the Corp Achievement Award for 16 consecutive years. In the Inter-Zone First Aid and Home Nursing Competition 2016, the Ambulance Cadet team finished as 1st runners up, while the Ambulance Adult team finished as National Champions. The Scouts uniformed group hosts the Lion Dance troupe, which performs at special and commemorative events. All four uniformed groups achieved Gold in the annual national assessment. Apart from regular planned training, other activities include inter-unit competitions in bowling and captain's ball.|$|E
25|$|Encoder–decoder {{frameworks}} {{are based}} on neural networks that map <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> input to <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> output. The approach arose {{in the context of}} machine translation, where the input and output are written sentences in two natural languages. In that work, an LSTM RNN or CNN was used as an encoder to summarize a source sentence, and the summary was decoded using a conditional RNN language model to produce the translation. These systems share building blocks: gated RNNs and CNNs and trained attention mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|XML and its {{extensions}} have regularly {{been criticized}} for verbosity and complexity. Mapping the basic tree model of XML to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult, especially when XML is used for exchanging <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> data between applications, which was not its primary design goal. However, XML data binding systems allow applications to access XML data directly from objects representing a data structure of the data in the programming language used, which ensures type safety, rather than using the DOM or SAX to retrieve data from a direct representation of the XML itself. This is accomplished by automatically creating a mapping between elements of the XML schema XSD of the document and members of a class to be represented in memory. Other criticisms attempt to refute the claim that XML is a self-describing language (though the XML specification itself makes no such claim). JSON, YAML, and S-Expressions are frequently proposed as simpler alternatives (see Comparison of data serialization formats); that focus on representing <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> data rather than documents, which may contain both <b>highly</b> <b>structured</b> and relatively unstructured content. However, W3C standardized XML schema specifications offer {{a broader range of}} structured XSD data types compared to simpler serialization formats and offer modularity and reuse through XML namespace.|$|E
