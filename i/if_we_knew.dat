2500|$|Thomas Nagel first {{characterized}} {{the problem of}} qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, [...] "What {{is it like to}} be a bat?". Nagel argued that even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> everything there was to know from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat's sonar system, we still wouldn't know {{what it is like to}} be a bat. However, others argue that qualia are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat's mind, and will be fully understood as the science develops.|$|E

"Many are {{attracted}} to Neo-Tantrism because it promises sexual excitement or fulfillment while clothing purely genital impulses or neurotic emotional needs in an aura of spirituality. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> more {{about the history of}} Tantra in India, we would no doubt find a comparable situation for every generation." [...] He goes on to say, [...] "Today translations of several major Tantras are readily available in book form... This gives would-be Tantrics the opportunity to concoct their own idiosyncratic ceremonies and philosophies, which they can then promote as Tantra." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{even if one}} {{did find}} {{a better way to}} {{calculate}} S(n), the values of the busy beaver function (and max shift function) get very large, very fast. [...] S(6) > 10 already requires special pattern-based acceleration to be able to simulate to completion. Likewise, we know that S(10) > Σ(10) > 3 ↑↑↑ 3 is a gigantic number. [...] Thus, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew,</b> say, S(30), it is completely unreasonable to run any machine that number of steps. There is not enough computational capacity in the known universe to have performed even S(6) operations directly.|$|E

30|$|According to the rules, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> M, N and {{the pattern}} number, <b>we</b> can <b>know</b> the {{corresponding}} code. For example, if M = 1, N = 4, {{the maximum number}} of codes is 2, the two pattern numbers are 0 and 1, and the two codes are 1000 and 0100. Vice versa, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> a code, <b>we</b> can <b>know</b> M, N and the pattern number.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first problem}} is more general because <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> the {{coefficients}} of [...] we could evaluate it {{at any point}} in polynomial time because the degree is n. The difficulty of the second type of problem depends strongly on the value of k and has been intensively studied in computational complexity. When k is a natural number, this problem is normally viewed as computing the number of k-colorings of a given graph. For example, this includes the problem #3-coloring of counting the number of 3-colorings, a canonical problem in the study of complexity of counting, complete for the counting class [...] #P.|$|E

High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said, [...] "This was {{a complex}} {{operation}} {{and it would}} be helpful <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> the precise facts surrounding his killing. The United Nations has consistently emphasized that all counter-terrorism acts must respect international law." [...] Pillay did point out that the U.S. intended to arrest him if possible, and pointed out that taking bin Laden alive was likely to be difficult. Had he been taken to court, Pillay said that, [...] "I have no doubt he would have been charged with the most serious crimes, including the mass murder of civilians that took place on 9/11, which were planned and systematic and in my view amounted to crime against humanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another. He rejects {{the notion that}} any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of {{some sense of the}} power of the will. He reasons that, 1. <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere occasions of the will of some god(s), a view associated with the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche.
