5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him she wants to make sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E
5|$|While {{sharing a}} bottle of wine with Gail, Lewis tries to kiss her. He later {{introduces}} her to his friend, Patrick (Simon Rouse), and pretends to turn down a job opportunity in Italy because he loves her. Lewis pays Patrick for his help and tells him that Gail ruined his life, so he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same to her. Lewis and Gail grow closer and begin dating in secret, although Lewis resists taking things further because of his feelings for Audrey. Lewis attempts to drive a wedge between Gail and her family, before telling her that he has been offered a new life in Italy, running a small hotel. Lewis asks Gail to come with him and she agrees. Audrey is devastated when she learns about their relationship, after catching them together. Gail takes out a £40,000 loan against her house to fund her trip to Italy, which Lewis plans on taking. He overhears Kylie speaking about a one-night stand she had with Nick and blackmails her into getting Gail's bank account password for him. Gail gathers her family together to tell them about Italy, but Lewis does not turn up. He instructs them by text message to watch a DVD he has made detailing his revenge plan. He reveals that he has taken Gail's money and that he deeply loved Audrey. The police later inform Gail that Lewis fled to Belize.|$|E

500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song that}} heavily {{incorporates}} synthesizers, {{and has a}} running duration of four minutes and 15 seconds. It contains elements of hip hop music, and its production was compared {{to the one in}} Kelly Rowland's [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Usher is contemplating on what he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when he [...] "gets a certain female clubgoer into his bedroom", in the line: Hey girl, I’m debating if I should take you home. During the pre-chorus, he comes to the conclusion: I decided to take my shirt off / and show my chest.|$|E

To Fishburne, Cheever was a [...] "smart", [...] "competent" [...] physician who often epitomized a [...] "voice of reason". Once he conferred with W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist {{and professor at}} Columbia University, the character's complexities were nonexistent for the actor. Fishburne stated, [...] "The personal stuff that I have as Ellis Cheever was telling my fiancée, soon-to-be wife, Sanaa Lathan, {{to get out of}} town, to leave, to pack up, to not talk.

500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Usher, released through RCA Records, as the third single from his seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself (2012). The track features vocals from rapper Rick Ross. It was written by Usher, Eric Bellinger, Jim Jonsin, Danny Morris, Nickolas Marzouca and Lundon Knighten with its production helmed by Jonsin and Morris. It was digitally released on May 4, 2012 and sent to urban radio on May 8, 2012. [...] "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R song that makes heavy use of synthesizers.

500|$|Barbree's {{most recent}} book, [...] "Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today", was {{released}} on August 28, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as he looked back over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that he told himself, [...] "You're {{the only one who has}} covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it?" [...] It received generally poor reviews from space historians.|$|E
500|$|Bug! was conceptualised as one {{of three}} {{candidates}} for [...] "would-be" [...] mascots for Sega's upcoming Sega Saturn console in 1994, {{due to the lack}} of a Sonic the Hedgehog game upon the console's launch. The other potential candidates were 2.5D platformers Clockwork Knight (which came out shortly before Bug!, at the Saturn's North American launch) and Astal, which was released later in 1995. The titular character Bug was thought to have imitated Sonic the Hedgehog's appearance and attitude in order to make it an effective mascot. At the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in 1995, Steven Spielberg declared that Bug was the character [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it" [...] for the Saturn. Realtime Associates developed the game using Silicon Graphics workstations, which were then used to pre-render the game's characters and then convert them into sprites – in similar vein to the process used in Donkey Kong Country.|$|E

Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E

Although his torment has driven him insane, {{he explains that}} taking on Sam's pain has helped relieve some of his past burdens. He then explains what the Word of God is, but is unable to read it. Two angels from his former garrison arrive in pursuit of Kevin, a prophet who was awakened by the Word of God and drawn to it. The angel Hester tries to kill Castiel out of anger for his past actions, but she is instead killed by Meg. The other angel offers Castiel the chance to return to Heaven with him, but Castiel declines, explaining that he feels he no longer belongs there. The other angel then leaves, taking Kevin away to safety.

500|$|November {{began with}} a home match against Manchester United. Going into the match, both clubs were level on points and goal difference, {{at the top of}} the league. In the 45th minute, Gallas {{inadvertently}} scored an own goal to give United the lead, before Fábregas equalised early in the second half. Cristiano Ronaldo scored what was thought to be the winning goal, eight minutes from the end, but Arsenal equalised for the second time in the match via Gallas. The draw pleased Wenger, who after the game noted his team were [...] "...still charge of the title race because we are top with a game in hand". A win against Reading at the Madjeski Stadium on 12 November 2007 brought about Arsenal's 1,000th Premier League goal, scored by Adebayor. Reading striker Dave Kitson afterwards praised Arsenal's performance and asserted they were [...] "the best team on the planet": [...] "The thing that amazes you most is they are not just passing to each other – they are passing so that person can run on to the ball and then his mind is already made up what he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next.

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the {{occasional}} [...] "novelty" [...] such as Aliens vs. Predator (2004), {{the idea of a}} shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood. Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters. In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning [...] "megafranchises" [...] for years to come, opposed to working one blockbuster at a time. Amobi added, [...] "A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust. Disney has proved that this [...] can be a gold mine." [...] However, with additional studios now [...] "playing the megafranchise game", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: [...] "If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox [...] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario?

500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was so anxious about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E
