50|$|Amphetamine is {{a potent}} central nervous system (CNS) {{stimulant}} of the phenethylamine class that is approved {{for the treatment of}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine refers to equal parts of the enantiomers, i.e., 50% levoamphetamine and 50% dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine is also used as a performance and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. Although it is a prescription medication in many countries, unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine is often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with uncontrolled or heavy use. As a consequence, amphetamine is illegally synthesized by clandestine chemists, trafficked, and sold. Based upon drug and <b>drug</b> <b>precursor</b> seizures worldwide, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine.|$|E
50|$|Between 2005 and 2007 {{the author}} {{traveled}} through small-town America {{to study the}} impact and cause of methamphetamine abuse. His focus is Oelwein, a once thriving small town that started to suffer economically {{by the end of}} the century. He analyzes the causes of the rural economic decline: in the context of deregulation and globalization agricultural conglomerates have taken over local businesses. As a result jobs have disappeared, towns became depopulated, and tax revenue shrunk. Use of meth proliferated in response in the depressed areas. In Iowa, in 2004 it was mostly produced locally using cold medicine as the <b>drug</b> <b>precursor.</b> That year Iowa law enforcement closed 1,370 meth labs (page 29). When, after a long delay, cold medicine became more restricted as a precursor material, Mexican operatives moved in. With superlabs in Mexico, drug lords used illegal immigrants hired as cheap labor by agricultural conglomerates as distributors for their networks. Reding notes that the 2006 Combat Meth Act had been watered down by pharmaceutical lobbyists so that local meth labs were also able to recover from their decline and evolve.|$|E

40|$|Dapsone (DDS) (4, 4 ` diaminodiphenylsulfone), {{the drug}} of choice for the {{treatment}} of leprosy, frequently induces hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. N-hydroxylation, one of the major pathways of biotransformation, has been constantly related to the methemeglobinemia after the use of the drug. In order to prevent the dapsone-induced hemotoxicity, N-acetylcysteine, a <b>drug</b> <b>precursor</b> of glutathione, was administered in combination with DDS to male Wistar rats, weighting 220 - 240 g. The animals were then anaesthetized and blood was collected from the aorta for determination of plasma DDS concentration by HPLC, determination of methemoglobinemia and glutathione by spectrophotometry, and for biochemical and hematological parameters. Our results showed that N-acetylcysteine enhanced dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia due to increased dapasone plasmatic concentration and consequent increased N-hydroxylamine formation. We concluded that drug interactions with dapsone require individually studies in order to avoid undesirable effects of dapsone...|$|E

40|$|Beyond the {{expected}} DBP exposure from drinking water, dermal from bathing, and inhalation, occurrence {{in food and}} beverage items can provide an additional occurrence pathway. Synthetic dyes are often added to beverages for aesthetic purposes and many are {{in the form of}} a reactive azo (-N=N-) dye or triarylmethane dye, both with a characteristic aromatic ring. The presence of dyes in beverages that are reconstituted with disinfected tap water pose the risk of reactions with the residual chlorine in the drinking water resulting in decolorization, and of greater concern, disinfection byproduct formation. Additionally, oral over-the-counter (OTC) medications contain chemical constituents that when reconstituted with tap water present a risk of DBP formation. Several studies were performed to evaluate the kinetic decay rates of the dyes and drugs in disinfectants, and the effects of water quality conditions on DBP formation. Commercial beverage products and OTC medications were evaluated for the DBPs that were detected in the free chlorine-treated precursor samples. The dye and <b>drugs</b> <b>precursors</b> followed second order kinetics, with the fastest rates for brilliant blue and phenylephrine in chlorinated water. The effects of water properties on precursor degradation and DBP formation was complex due to the influence of characteristics of precursor molecules. The cytotoxic and anti-estrogenic responses were measured in the dye and <b>drug</b> <b>precursors</b> and their respective beverages and OTC medications, to determine potential links. Mio Energy showed estrogenic character and Alka Seltzer induced an anti-estrogenic and cytotoxic response, however there were no clear linkages between the beverage/ medication and their respective dye and <b>drug</b> <b>precursors...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{efficiently}} detect four <b>drug</b> <b>precursor</b> molecules in presence of interfering species and background air, using a EC-QCLPAS sensor {{operating in the}} mid-infrared region, a complex strategy of spectral response simulation has been developed. In this context, spectra of gases from literature databases have been collected, denoised {{by means of the}} Wavelet Transform and mixed together according to a concentration matrix, which was specifically designed to represent a comprehensive combination of possible realistic cases. To scale database spectra to the appropriate concentration levels, an ad-hoc algorithm based on a sigmoidal transfer function has been used. In this way the baseline shape and intensity is preserved. Afterwards, a preliminary wavelength selection has been carried out to exclude noisy regions. The optimal range has finally been defined by maximizing the classification efficiency for all the target gases by means of Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis...|$|E
40|$|Burkholderia cepacia lipase was {{immobilized on}} superparamagnetic {{nanoparticles}} using three different methodologies (adsorption, chemisorption with carboxibenzaldehyde and chemisorption with glutaraldehyde) and {{employed in the}} kinetic resolution of a chiral <b>drug</b> <b>precursor,</b> (RS) - 2 -bromo- 1 -(phenyl) ethanol, via enantioselective acetylation reaction. An excellent improvement of lipase catalytical performance was observed. Free B. cepacia lipase gave the ester (S) - 2 with poor E-value 200. The effect of several reaction parameters in the kinetic resolution was studied. The best results for kinetic resolution were obtained using vinyl acetate as acetyl donor and toluene as solvent, typically yielding the ester in high enantiomeric excess (> 99 %) and E-value (E > 200). Of the three tested immobilization methods, chemisorption with glutaraldehyde was the best one in terms of temperature stability and yield product. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|An organocatalytic process {{mediated}} {{by a single}} small-molecule catalyst involving the highly enantioselective desymmetrisation of an achiral electrophile while it simultaneously kinetically resolves a racemic nucleophile has been developed which allows the efficient direct acylative kinetic resolution of sec-thiol substrates for the first time. The levels of enantioselectivity associated with both processes (which exhibit verifiable synergy) are excellent using a readily accessible cinchona alkaloid-derived organocatalyst at low loadings. The inexpensive achiral glutaric anhydride electrophiles are desymmetrised as the resolution progresses with excellent levels of stereocontrol and can be later cleaved to afford highly enantioenriched products (up to 97 % ee). The potential synthetic utility of the methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of a <b>drug</b> <b>precursor</b> antipode in excellent yield and enantioselectivity as a by-product of a process which also resolved a sec-thiol substrate with a selectivity of S= 226 (i. e. both thiol antipodes produced in > 95 % ee at 51 % conversion) ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{drugs and}} drug {{precursors}} found in natural organisms are rather difficult to synthesize chemically and to extract in large amounts. Metabolic engineering is playing {{an increasingly important}} role in the production of these drugs and drug precursors. This is typically achieved by establishing newmetabolic pathways leading to the product formation, and enforcing or removing the existingmetabolic pathways toward enhanced product formation. Recent advances in system biology and synthetic biology are allowing us to performmetabolic engineering at the whole cell level, thus enabling optimal design of a microorganism for the efficient production of drugs and drug precursors. In this review, we describe the general strategies for themetabolic engineering ofmicroorganisms for the production of drugs and drug precursors. As successful examples of metabolic engineering, the approaches taken toward strain development for the production of artemisinin, an antimalarial drug, and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, a family of antibacterial and anticancer drugs, are described in detail. Also, systems metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of L-valine, an important <b>drug</b> <b>precursor,</b> is showcased as an important strategy of future metabolic engineering effort. drug productionMetabolic engineerin microorganisms: genIntroduction Since the advent of recombinant DNA technology, genetic engi...|$|E
40|$|Chemotherapeutic prodrugs have {{demonstrated}} success in killing cancer cells; however they also pose harm to healthy cells. The {{objective of this}} project was to synthesize an improved prodrug that is selectively activated only in the cancer microenvironment, thus minimally affecting healthy tissue. A photolabile linker was hypothesized to achieve said objective. The Yin group discovered that the MARCKS-ED peptide can localize to the exosome via curvature sensing and electrostatic interactions. In addition, the Koch group determined that Doxazolidine (Doxaz) is more cytotoxic than its clinical <b>drug</b> <b>precursor.</b> Also, no cancer cell lines have shown resistance to this anthracycline. Based on these studies, we decided to synthesize a prodrug containing a photolabile linker, MARCKS-ED peptide, and the Doxaz anthracycline. We hypothesized that a specific sequence of synthesis and purification steps would generate the prodrug. I carried out steps and characterized the products using NMR, HPLC and ESI-MS+. The results confirmed that the desired product was produced. Preliminary in-vitro experiments also showed that the prodrug was endocytosed by cells. It was then predicted that application of UV light will activate the prodrug and cause cell death...|$|E
40|$|The phylum Dictyoglomi {{consists}} {{a single}} genus, Dictyoglomus, with two type strains and several related pure culture isolates. All isolates are thermophilic anaerobic Gram-type negative rods. A major distinguishing phenotypic {{feature is the}} formation of spherical bodies in late stationary phase of growth, the function of which is not understood. Most isolates are fermentative using a range of simple carbohydrates, but some isolates are able to grow on crystalline cellulose and chemolithotrophy using carbon monoxide as energy source has been reported for one pure culture. There have been relatively few applications for Dictyoglomus enzymes {{as a result of}} a number of factors. Although many of their kinetic properties are exceptional, they have had to be cloned and expressed in standard fermentation strains as hosts, and their low G:C content has required significant genetic manipulation to provide expression. Some of the main applications have required inexpensive enzymes in bulk (e. g., pulp bleaching in paper manufacture), and they have had to be regarded as a replacement for well-established enzymes currently used in the industry.
