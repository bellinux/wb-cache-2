5|$|The castle had {{no formal}} garden, {{but at the}} bottom of the drive were <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> which {{included}} vegetable gardens, an orchard, extensive glass houses and a large orangery. At one time, 17gardeners were employed.|$|E
5|$|The {{grounds of}} the palace in the 13th century {{included}} a medieval deer park. The right to form the park was granted by King John to Bishop Jocelin in 1207. The Palace Camery was planted with orchards, a herbarium and <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> to provide food for the Bishop and staff.|$|E
5|$|The house {{sits on a}} south facing slope giving views {{across the}} {{extensive}} deer park and the Weald beyond. <b>Kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> {{to the north of}} the house remain as remnants of 16th-century formal garden planting. The house is a Grade I listed building and its barn is listed Grade II. The parks and gardens are listed Grade II.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} {{surrounded by a}} medieval deer park and in the 17th century a formal garden was constructed. This had largely disappeared until a new garden was laid out by garden designer Gertrude Jekyll (1843—1932) in an Arts and Crafts-style. It now contains walled <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens,</b> fruit orchards and ornamental gardens.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. <b>Kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef soaked in cod liver oil. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens.</b>|$|E
50|$|Caritas Pakistan {{is doing}} its bit to fight the Global Financial Crisis with its Livelihood Program. St. Jude’s Parish was {{selected}} to promote the <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening</b> program at the household level ensuring the availability of fresh vegetables to families. <b>Kitchen</b> <b>gardening</b> awareness seminars and post cultivation methods of <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardening</b> were organized at Nasrat Nagar area of the parish in April, 2010.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Garden</b> is a {{productive}} {{fruit and vegetable}} garden with decorative features. It was created behind the stables in the early 1990s. Chatsworth's original <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> covered 11.5 acres and was by the river in the park.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, {{the garden}} was listed with English Heritage. In the same year, the maze was replanted and the <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> cleared. Between 2002-2006 {{the garden was}} {{restored}} back to the 1870 plan.The <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> reopened between 2009 and 2011.|$|R
5|$|The castle is {{approached}} {{through the}} castle meadow, {{an area of}} open parkland, lined with Holm oaks planted in the 1860s, and is surrounded by the dry moat, now a garden dating from at least the 1850s and planted with trees and shrubs. Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's Garden and the kitchen garden and glasshouses. The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens,</b> before being turned into a tennis court in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion. The two glasshouses have been restored, functioning as cold greenhouses, while {{the remainder of the}} kitchen garden is planted with a mixture of vegetables, fruit trees and flowers.|$|E
25|$|Also in {{the grounds}} is a {{limestone}} underpass beneath the B5278 road that gave access from the formal gardens to the <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Mahafaly are {{primarily}} zebu cattle herders and pastoralists. Cotton has been cultivated by the Mahafaly since the 16th century. They also gather wild honey, sell charcoal, weave baskets and mats, practice woodworking, cultivate <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> and raise small livestock.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was walking}} {{the other day}} in a <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden,</b> which I find has somehow got {{attached}} to my premises, and I was wondering why I liked it. After a prolonged spiritual self-analysis I {{came to the conclusion that}} I like a <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> because it contains things to eat. I do not mean that a <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> is ugly; a <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> is often very beautiful. The mixture of green and purple on some monstrous cabbage is much subtler and grander than the mere freakish and theatrical splashing of yellow and violet on a pansy. Few of the flowers merely meant for ornament are so ethereal as a potato. A <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> is as beautiful as an orchard; but why is it that the word [...] "orchard" [...] sounds as beautiful as the word [...] "flower-garden," [...] and yet also sounds more satisfactory? I suggest again my extraordinarily dark and delicate discovery: that it contains things to eat.|$|R
50|$|An {{order for}} the <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Garden</b> lists five {{espalier}} pear, six apple, one plum and two cherry varieties for the five foot high walls and twelve standard fruit trees for planting internally. In addition the <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Garden</b> contained gooseberries, blackcurrants, whitecurrants, redcurrants and raspberries.|$|R
5000|$|The Gallery {{building}} {{is situated in}} courtyard gardens, adjacent to the 5th Duke's extensive <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden.</b> This garden was modelled after [...] "the seventeen acre royal walled gardens in Windsor Great Park. Not to be outdone, the Duke of Portland enclosed twenty two acres". The <b>kitchen</b> <b>garden</b> walls are still present, and Dukeries Garden Centre is situated within the walls. Some of the original Victorian glasshouses {{can be seen in}} the garden centre. The car park for The Harley Gallery is located in the area of the <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Garden</b> that was known as [...] "California" [...] - being the warmest, sunniest area.|$|R
25|$|The area of {{the gardens}} closest to the palace is {{reserved}} for the Royal Family, but is usually {{open to the public}} in July. Here are the <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens,</b> which supply fresh vegetables for the household, and a modern orangery, which was opened in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden of}} Catherine de' Medici was an {{enclosed}} space five hundred metres long and three hundred metres wide, {{separated from the}} new chateau by a lane. It was divided into rectangular compartments by six alleys, and the sections were planted with lawns, flower beds, and small clusters of five trees, called Quinconces; and, more practically, with <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> and vineyards.|$|E
25|$|Vinalia Rustica (August 19), {{originally}} a rustic Latin festival of wine, vegetable growth and fertility. This {{was almost certainly}} Venus' oldest festival and was associated with her earliest known form, Venus Obsequens. <b>Kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> and market-gardens, and presumably vineyards were dedicated to her. Roman opinions differed on whose festival it was. Varro insists that the day was sacred to Jupiter, whose control of the weather governed the ripening of the grapes; but the sacrificial victim, a female lamb (agna), may be evidence that it once belonged to Venus alone.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1870s, these estates often {{encompassed}} {{several thousand}} acres, generally {{consisting of a}} home farm, <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> (utilised to supply the mansion with meat, milk, fruit and vegetables), and several farms let to tenants. While such estates were sufficiently profitable to maintain the mansion and provide a partial—if not complete—income, the agricultural depression of the 1870s changed the viability of estates in general. Previously, such holdings yielded at least enough to fund loans on the large debts and mortgages usually undertaken to fund a lavish lifestyle, often spent both in the country estate and in large houses in London.|$|E
25|$|The {{gardens are}} laid out in an {{informal}} English style with large Victorian walled and <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens,</b> lawns, an arboretum and carp pond believed to be older than the main hall. There are 50 types of apple tree, 21 of pear and over 50 types of rose in the gardens. There is also a 17th-century dove cote, a grass tennis court, croquet pitch, cottage, apple store and studio. The Garden {{is one of only}} a handful of notable RHS gardens in Lincolnshire and is under consideration by the RHS to be raised to recommended status making it one of only two in the county with this designation.|$|E
25|$|In mediaeval times, Homerton, {{like much}} of Hackney, was {{predominantly}} rural and arable crops were grown, together with fruit and vegetables for the City of London markets. The majority of land was given over to pasture for sheep and cattle, and milk and cheese was also supplied to the City. Small <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> ran {{at the back of}} the houses along the road, with large fields behind. Domestic brewing was common (there are records of brewing performed at Sutton House and the Tan House). Many unsavoury activities (banned in the City) were also undertaken, such as tanning and fulling - the cleaning of felt cloth using urine.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of {{dereliction}} much of the garden (including <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens</b> and greenhouses to the north) became severely overgrown, and the parkland was used as grazing land (with the Library employed as a grain store). Much of the ornamental garden {{to the south and}} east has been restored and replanted, with work done by volunteers from the National Trust Activities Group (NTAG) and the London Wildlife Trust (and, in the replanting of trees, by the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, the Men of the Trees, the Countryside Commission and the South East Electricity Board after the Great Storm of 1987). Forming part of the High Weald AONB since October 1983, the parkland and gardens were given Grade II listed status in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The Family {{residence}} {{which he}} inherited {{after his father}} in 1742 occupied the whole block from Tverskaya Street to Bolshaya Dmitrovka Street and from Glinishchevsky Lane to Kozitsky. Two churches standing {{at the corners of}} two lanes and the Bolshaya Dmitrovka flanked the estate. On one side it adjoined the Church of St. Alexius Metropolitan of Moscow, erected in 1601 by Deacon Ivan Alferov. On the other side, at the corner of Kozitsky Lane and B. Dmitrovka Street, was a church of St. Sergius of Radonezh. The facades of the estate buildings faced the Tverskaya and B. Dmitrovka Street. The thoroughfare through the estate led from one street to another - and the inner part of the grounds was occupied with stables, barns, kitchens with <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens,</b> greenhouses and dwelling houses.|$|E
25|$|The formal gardens {{comprise}} 10hectares, and {{the surrounding}} parkland, deer park and woodland, comprise 80hectares. The formal gardens are on {{the south and west}} sides of the house, and to the north and west are pleasure gardens with a winding path leading to and through the arboretum. The formal garden to the south of the west wing is known as the Elliptical Garden, and to the left of this is the Summer Garden. To the northwest of the hall is the Rose Garden containing a pair of summer houses. The pleasure gardens include a cedar planted by Lord George Cavendish in the late 18thcentury, and an Auracaria planted in 1844. There are also two areas of <b>kitchen</b> <b>gardens,</b> one to the northwest of the hall, and the other {{to the north of the}} B5278 road. In 1901 Thomas Hayton Mawson worked on the gardens.|$|E
