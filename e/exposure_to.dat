5|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.

40|$|Music-induced brain {{activity}} modulations in areas involved in emotion regulation {{may be useful}} in achieving therapeutic outcomes. Clinical applications of music may involve pro-longed or repeated <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> music.

In this study, the temporal and spatial variability of cerebral pre-frontal hemodynamic response was investigated across multiple <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> self-selected musical excerpts in 10 healthy adults. The hemodynamic changes were measured using prefrontal cortex near infrared spectroscopy and represented by instantaneous phase val-ues. Based on spatial and temporal characteristics of these observed hemodynamic changes, we defined a consistency index to represent variability across these domains.

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
