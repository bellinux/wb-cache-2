30|$|In conclusion, Luke’s {{technique}} is {{to a large}} extent successful in obtaining inequalities for the confluent hypergeometric function. The theorems developed herein seem sufficient to indicate the <b>general</b> nature of <b>expected</b> <b>results</b> and we do not further pursue the subject. Here, we have obtained inequalities for simple Laguerre, Laguerre, pseudo-Laguerre, Shively’s pseudo-Laguerre, and Hermite functions from a well-known result for confluent hypergeometric functions and their confluent cases. In a future work, we intend to investigate this aspect of the subject and to apply our techniques to develop inequalities for hypergeometric functions of several variables.|$|R

Technical work that proceeded during the eleventh quarter of the contract included the following: Testing at up to {approx} 15 percent cofiring on a mass basis ({approx} 7 percent cofiring on a Btu basis) at the Seward Generating Station No. 12 boiler, focusing upon the operability of the separate injection system and the combustion/emission formation characteristics of the cofiring process; and Testing at up to {approx} 10 percent cofiring of waste wood on a mass basis ({approx} 5 percent cofiring on a Btu basis) at the Bailly Generating Station No. 7 boiler, focusing upon the impacts of urban wood waste blended {{with a mixture of}} eastern high sulfur coal and western low sulfur coal Both tests demonstrated the following <b>general,</b> and <b>expected,</b> <b>results</b> from cofiring at these locations: (1) Cofiring did not impact boiler capacity; (2) Cofiring did cause a modest reduction in boiler efficiency; (3) Cofiring did reduce NOx emissions; (4) Cofiring did reduce fossil CO 2 emissions; and (5) Other impacts of cofiring were modest...|$|R

In general, for recall values above 0. 93, this algorithm had the first or second best precision values. At the highest recall level, Running detected 88 % of the gradual transitions.

40|$|The {{research}} goal of {{this text}} is the historical flow of the finances and their misbalances. The goal is directed towards the comparison {{of the financial crisis}} through history, for the reason that the past should serve as a lesson for future actions. On the other side, in the area where the globalization has a primary impact (as is the financial area) the effects from certain flows should be anticipated and a proper reaction should be prepared on time, according the lesson from above. The used research methods are statistically analyzed data and their comparison, tending to summarize one <b>general</b> <b>result.</b> The <b>expected</b> <b>results</b> from the research are reviews of how the history repeats, how the crisis from the past are overlapping with the crisis from the 2007 in the GDP domain, prices level, public debt level, unemployment, real estate prices etc. The signification of the paper is directed towards the financial sector and its more coordinated control, supporting the main reason that the prediction of some financial flows can mean a salvation for the economy as a whole. Key words: financial crisis, financial regulation, financial flows. ...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970 s, the Commission set up the “Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units” (NUTS) as a single, coherent system for dividing up the European Union's territory in order to produce regional statistics for the Community. Since in Italy the LAU level 1 has not yet been defined, a committee established by National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) is studying a possible delimitation. This work is set in this background, reporting only one of several diverse hypothesis developed within the committee. A set of common principles for LAU 1 have been defined, deriving them from the NUTS Regulation. Consequently, likewise to NUTS, territorial units specific to certain fields of activity have been excluded, while this branch of still running experiments aims to define units of a full <b>general</b> nature. The <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> is the identification of a number of “settlements systems”, where the underlying law is some kind of general relationship existing between communes. So, it has been adopted a very general model of aggregation, applied to municipalities. The model considers two kinds of constraints for the aggregation: i) a hierarchical ranking of settlements, and ii) the relations between settlements, in the geographical space domain. With these constraints, an aggregative algorithm is defined, whose meaning will result by the specific variables that are used: i) to establish the settlements hierarchy, and ii) to evaluate the spatial distribution of settlements...|$|R
30|$|Further {{research}} is needed to fully explore the potential applications of the proposed method and validate it. First of all, our work is limited {{by the fact that the}} dataset is restricted to one city. Thus, an extension of our analysis to different cities, both in developed and developing countries, is needed. Even if strong regularities are observed across cities [5], each city has its own peculiar structure, such as being monocentric or polycentric [67], and we may expect such features to affect the spatial distribution of the entropy function. Also, the attractiveness for foreigners may significantly vary across cities in the same country, leading to a more or less important contribution of foreign country codes to the mobile phone activity. In <b>general,</b> we <b>expect</b> our <b>results</b> to hold for large and diverse metropolitan areas, as in the case of Milan. Finally, our work is affected by the limited period over which data has been collected, because a two-month record is not sufficient to uncover long-term trends in the activity of users. In particular, a longer time frame is necessary to better define the presence of outliers in the entropy distribution and possibly link them with the recognition of unusual events.|$|R

40|$|Functional {{testing of}} a query {{language}} is a challenging task in practice. In order to reveal errors in the query processing functionality, {{it is necessary to}} verify the actual result of a test query with the <b>expected</b> correct <b>result.</b> However, automatically computing the <b>expected</b> query <b>result</b> of an arbitrary test query is not trivial. One solution is to first generate a set of test database instances as well as test queries and then to compute the <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> for each test query over the individual test database instances just like in forward query processing. The problem of this solution is, that many test queries might return an empty query result which is not interesting for the functional testing of a query language. In this paper, we present a new approach which provides a different solution to the verification of the actual result of a test query. Instead of first generating the database instance and then computing the <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> for each test query, we first create one or more interesting <b>expected</b> <b>results</b> for a given test query and then generate a test database instance for each combination of a test query and an <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> individually which returns the <b>expected</b> <b>result</b> if the test query is executed correctly. In this way, we enable the verification of the actual result and allow an explicit definition of interesting test cases for the functional testing of a query language. As a concrete result, this paper discusses the implementation of this approach for the query language Entity SQL of the new ADO. Net Entity Framework. 1...|$|R

Based on two inquiries conducted in selected NIF firms in 1996 and 1998, it simultaneously offers a comparative analysis {{of the changes in}} employee perceptions of major effects of NIFs 2 ̆ 019 activities. Except for some minor differences, the format of the two inquiries was identical which allows to directly compare the results of the 2 ̆ 01996 and 2 ̆ 01998 editions. Each inquiry consisted of three parts. Questions included in the first part were aimed to explore respondents 2 ̆ 019 perceptions of the NIF programme in <b>general</b> including <b>expected</b> macroeconomic <b>results</b> of its implementation and the desired size of the block of shares to be given away to the employees of privatised firms. Part two comprised questions concerning the situation in portfolio companies, i. e. direct employers of respondents to the inquiry.

To be launched on April 2016, the CNES microsatellite embarks the instrument that should {{test for the}} first time in space the foundation of <b>General</b> Relativity. The <b>expected</b> <b>results</b> whether they confirm or not the Equivalence Principle will bring a major constraint on Physics Models trying to unify Gravity and Quantum Physics. The payload developed by ONERA is composed of two double accelerometers giving full 6 -axis measurements to be processed with on-board GPS and star-trackers collected data. The on-ground process of the data takes into account the fine time stamping of the measurement pick up and the position of the satellite along its orbit to correct the Earth’s gravity gradient effect in the difference of the acceleration of two bodies in free-fall. The data once corrected is exploited to extract a potential signal of violation which is along to the Earth’s gravity field. During 2015, the payload flight model has been intensively tested during the qualification campaign of the satellite: environmental tests, EMC tests, electrical tests…. Major results will be presented. They were computed with the Science Mission Center softwares also under development in ONERA. These data complement the simulated data provided by CNES in order to validate the mission ground segment. After a general presentation of the instrument and its performance, the paper will emphasize some return on the particular experience of implementing a high accurate instrument in a small satellite such as MICROSCOPE.
