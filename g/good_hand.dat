25|$|Shooting {{the moon}} can rapidly change the {{direction}} of a game in a player's favor; however, it is also very risky. A <b>good</b> <b>hand</b> for shooting the moon should contain significant high cards, in addition to a long run of a single suit {{that can be used to}} keep the lead once the other players have run out of that suit.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the right}} and left corner back who, respectively, wear the number 2 and number 4 jerseys, is to defend against {{opposing}} attackers – in particular the left and right corner forwards. They will play most around the 20-metre line. The positions require the players having decent speed over short bursts and <b>good</b> <b>hand</b> eye co-ordination. Endurance and strength are unnecessary, although agility is required.|$|E

Following his death a memorial fund was established at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens. The Mulford B.

25|$|The role of full back {{who wears}} the number 3 jersey {{is one of}} the most {{important}} in Gaelic football or hurling. As well as defending against attackers, the full back is responsible for organising the defence and is the key defender in front of goals, and is usually one of the tallest and strongest players on the team. The full back plays most often around the 20-metre line. The position of the full back requires that the player have decent speed over short bursts, strength, and <b>good</b> <b>hand</b> eye co-ordination. In playing either cornerback or full back positions a well-developed aerobic system is required although, unlike the corner backs, the full back is needed to make short burst sprints both away from and into the goal area.|$|E

500|$|Flight Lieutenant Geoffrey Page {{had just}} arrived at the ADFU. He had been a fighter pilot but was shot down and badly burned on 12 August 1940 during the Battle of Britain. Page was also keen on vengeance and {{approached}} MacLachlan in the Mess and proposed a two-fighter patrol. He said that he wanted one German fighter {{for each of the}} 15 operations he had endured since 1940. The two pilots began to practice together in two Mustangs. The operation required little wind, so it would not interfere with navigation and a low cloud base to allow the two to spot enemy aircraft silhouette against it at even great distances. Hawker Typhoons from MacLachlann's former 1 Squadron to carry out diversion attacks against shipping off Boulogne. The operation was flown on 29 June 1943. At 08:55 they took off from RAF Lympne.

2500|$|In 1986, Matsumoto {{suffered}} {{the last of}} a series of strokes, and was hospitalized, never to fully regain consciousness again. The stylish Matsumoto had been famously fastidious throughout his life, and his daughter, Meiko, has written that she was startled to notice that on his hospital bed, where Matsumoto lay unconscious and barely responsive, he had been using his remaining <b>good</b> <b>hand</b> to remove the pills that had formed on the old hospital blanket. Furthermore, although doctors said he had lost his sight, Matsumoto would open his eyes, and, as if looking in a mirror, would straighten the hairs of his mustache with his fingers as he had habitually done for years. [...] Matsumoto {{died at the age of}} 81. His cremated remains are interred in the Fuji Cemetery in Gotemba, Shizuoka, at the foot of Mount Fuji.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Davis free soloed the North Face (5.11b) of the Castleton Tower, {{making her}} {{perhaps the first}} woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11+ grade. The route is rated 5.11a and is [...] of climbing. It is a famous {{formation}} in Castle Valley, Utah. After Davis climbed it, she BASE jumped from the top. In describing this climb, she referred to her climb and jump as [...] "the cleanest possible style". Davis prepared by climbing the route multiple times in April and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. BASE jumping requires specific conditions, especially around Moab, where the cliffs are so short. On 4 May, the weather and Davis' mental state coincided and she was ready to free solo the route. Although she woke up with a cold, for her the mental state was more important than the physical. However, while climbing she accidentally stepped on the cuff of her pants, which she unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because she had such <b>good</b> <b>hand</b> and arm placement, however, she did not fall. The climb was filmed by a close friend, Jim Hurst. Davis has {{said in an interview that}} while she had always refused to have her free solos filmed in the past because she has known him so long and because he knows how she climbs, having him film was not an imposition. There was no communication between them during the filming.|$|E
