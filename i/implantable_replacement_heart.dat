Dowling, performed the world's first implantation of the AbioCor <b>Implantable</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Heart</b> on July 2, in a seven-hour procedure at Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. University of Louisville cardiothoracic surgeons have performed many other novel procedures, including Kentucky's first heart transplant, the world's first heart transplant following {{the use of}} a Thoratec left ventricular assist device, the world's first endoscopic saphenous vein harvest and the first ventricular remodeling in the region.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of the first available totally <b>implantable</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>heart</b> (AbioCor <b>Implantable</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Heart</b> System) {{in the treatment of}} severe, irreversible biventricular heart failure in human patients. MethodsSeven male adult patients with severe, irreversible biventricular failure (> 70 % thirty-day predicted mortality) who were not candidates for transplantation met all institutional review board study criteria and had placement of the AbioCor <b>Implantable</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Heart.</b> All were in cardiogenic shock despite maximal medical therapy, including inotropes and intra-aortic balloon pumps. Mean age was 66. 7 ± 10. 4 years (range, 51 - 79 years). Four of 7 patients had prior operations. Six had ischemic and one had idiopathic cardiomyopathy. All had 3 -dimensional computer-simulated implantation of the thoracic unit that predicted adequate fit. At the time of the operation, the internal transcutaneous energy transfer coil, battery, and controller were placed. Biventriculectomy was then performed, and the thoracic unit was placed in an orthotopic position and attached to the atrial cuffs and outflow conduits with quick-connects. The flow was adjusted to 4 to 8 L/min. Central venous and left atrial pressures were maintained at 5 to 15 mm Hg. The device is powered through transcutaneous energy transfer. An atrial flow-balancing chamber is used to adjust left/right balance. The balance chamber and transcutaneous energy transfer eliminate the need for percutaneous lines. ResultsThere was one intraoperative death caused by coagulopathic bleeding and one early death caused by an aprotinin reaction. There have been multiple morbidities primarily related to preexisting illness severity: 5 patients had prolonged intubation, 2 had hepatic failure (resolved in 1), 4 had renal failure (resolved in 3), and 1 each had recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, acute cholecystitis requiring laparotomy, respiratory failure that resolved after 3 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and malignant hyperthermia (resolved). There were 3 late deaths: one caused by multiple systems organ failure (postoperative day 56), one caused by a cerebrovascular accident (postoperative day 142), and one caused by retroperitoneal bleeding and resultant multiple systems organ failure (postoperative day 151). This latter patient was not able to tolerate anticoagulation (no anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy alone for 80 % of the first 60 days) and had a transient ischemic attack on postoperative day 61 and a cerebrovascular accident on postoperative day 130. At autopsy, blood pumps were clean. The 2 patients who had large cerebrovascular accidents had thrombus on the atrial cage struts. These struts have been removed for future implants. There has been no significant hemolysis or device-related infections. The balance chamber has allowed for left/right balance in all patients (left atrial pressure within 5 mm Hg of right atrial pressure). Three patients have taken multiple (> 50) trips out of the hospital, and 2 have been discharged from the hospital. Total days on support with the AbioCor are 759. ConclusionThe initial clinical experience suggests that the AbioCor might be effective therapy in patients with advanced biventricular failure. There have been no significant device malfunctions. Two of these patients have been discharged from the hospital...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveCongenital {{heart valve}} disease {{is one of}} the most common {{abnormalities}} in children. There are limited technological solutions available for treating children with congenital heart valve diseases. The aim of this study is to provide the details of the consensus reached in terms of pediatric definitions, design approach, in vitro testing, and clinical trials, which may be used as guidance for developing prosthetic heart valves for the pediatric indication. MethodsIn stark contrast to the various designs of adult-sized replacement valves available in the market, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –approved prosthetic heart valves available for use in the pediatric population. There is a pressing need for FDA-approved pediatric valve devices in the United States. The pediatric patient population has been typically excluded from <b>replacement</b> <b>heart</b> valve trials for several reasons. In January 2010, heart valve manufacturers and pediatric clinicians collaborated with academicians and FDA staff in a workshop to suggest ways to successfully evaluate pediatric prosthetic valves and conduct pediatric clinical trials to provide acceptable <b>heart</b> valve <b>replacement</b> options for this patient population.

Class I devices include simple devices such as arm slings and hand-held surgical instruments. Class II devices are considered to need more regulation than Class I devices and are required to undergo specific requirements before FDA approval. Class II devices include X-ray systems and physiological monitors. Class III devices require the most regulatory controls since the device supports or sustains human life or may not be well tested.

These findings indicate that valve design criteria directly influence the durability of pericardial valves. However, other factors unique to pericardial tissue also affect the durability and performance of BPVs. These factors include the inability of pericardial tissue to accommodate dynamic stresses; the extensive insudation of plasma proteins and lipids; and the inability to reduce leaflet calcification using agents that effectively mitigate calcification in PAV bioprostheses...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} the clinical experiences of 21 patients treated with tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) and investigate the surgical indications and methods.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of dysfunctional aortic valves is increasing every year, and current <b>replacement</b> <b>heart</b> valves, although having {{been shown to}} be clinically successful, are only short-term solutions and suffer from many agonizing long-term drawbacks.
