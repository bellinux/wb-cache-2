40|$|Voluntary {{return of}} {{refugees}} and asylum seekers {{is seen as}} an increasingly important element of the UK policy agenda on immigration and asylum, consistent with proposals contained within the 2002 White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain. Since 1999, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) of the UK Home Office has been funding programmes to assist failed asylum applicants, those awaiting a decision and those with time-limited <b>exceptional</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> enter or <b>remain,</b> who wish <b>to</b> return to their country of origin. In the context of increasing UK government interest in this area, this report describes the findings of a study commissioned by the Home Office to explore the factors influencing the decision to return, including the role played by incentives, as well as to enhance understanding of the concept of the ‘sustainability’ of return. The research was conducted by a team based at the Sussex Centre for Migration Research, and involved fieldwork both in the UK and in the Balkans. This chapter sets out the aims and objectives of the report, its background and relevance, and its structure...|$|R
5000|$|Othman, aka Qatada, {{was born}} in Jordan {{and came to the}} United Kingdom in September 1993. He made an {{application}} for asylum and was recognised as a refugee on 30 June 1994 and granted <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> 30 June 1998. On 8 May 1998 he applied for indefinite <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 24 July 2016 a {{bomb was}} detonated in a {{restaurant}} in the city, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring multiple people. The perpetrator was reported to be a Syrian refugee whose asylum application had been rejected but who had been given <b>exceptional</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> until the security situation in Syria returned to a safe condition. Witnesses reported he had tried to enter a nearby music festival but had been turned away, before detonating his device outside a nearby wine bar.|$|E
5000|$|The term superdiversity is used {{to refer}} to some current levels of {{population}} diversity that are significantly higher than before. Vertovec argues superdiversity in Britain [...] "is distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immigrants who have arrived over the last decade". It denotes increased diversity not only between immigrant and ethnic minority groups, but also within them. It has also been called the [...] "diversification of diversity". Vertovec gives the example of Somalis in the United Kingdom, arguing that the Somali community includes British citizens, refugees and asylum seekers, people granted <b>exceptional</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain,</b> undocumented migrants, and secondary migrants from other European states. Parveen Akhtar, a sociologist at the University of Bradford, argues that the UK is no longer characterized by diversity but by superdiversity: [...] "Post-1945 you had large waves of immigration from fewer places in the world, largely from the former colonies. Now, since the 1980s, you’ve got smaller waves of immigration from a wider range of places".|$|E
40|$|Since 1982 asylum seekers, {{de facto}} {{migrants}} {{and people with}} <b>exceptional</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> for humanitarian reasons are placed in camp-like "asylum seekers and refugee accommodations" which are placed and organized locally throughout the country. This system is understood as the decentralized half-open camp system, the term camp is discussed critically (Agamben, Goffman, Herbert). The history of immigration in Germany is rolled up under {{the focus of the}} installation of camps since 1945. Even today over a hundred thousand people are still affected by this system. With the installation of the new regulated immigration law (Zuwanderungsgesetz) departure preparing accommodations/ deportation camps are codified as a new type of camp to promote a forced voluntary departure. The exclusion of immigrants mostly takes place behind the back of a critical public. This research project is based on the analysis of the social space camp from the perspective of its inhabitants and develops structural patterns to make it analytically comprehensible. By doing so an area potentially unregulated by law is exposed, which systematically produces human rights violations. Based on assumptions of theories about space, racism and security technology an analysis of the political, economical and ideological function of the decentralized camp system is developed. Embedded in critical-materialist theory approaches, a substantiated concept for institutional racism (Hall, Bourdieu) is formulated. The historical dimension of the deprivation of migrants of their rights and their forced stay in camps is hereby comprehensible as an important regulation mode for the movement and control of immigrants in Germany...|$|E

50|$|Many unaccompanied asylum-seeking {{children}} {{are facing a}} change in status as they approach 18, as most are initially given discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> until age 17 ½. This expiration of leave affects not only their benefits but also their ability <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the UK at all. <b>To</b> extend <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain,</b> the young person has to apply for an extension of discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> prior <b>to</b> the expiration, but even applying on time does not guarantee outcomes. Pathway planning at eighteen, therefore, covers similar options to those that refugees face while undergoing the initial asylum process. If the young person received refugee status upon first application, then he/she will retain that status upon turning eighteen and pathway planning is much simpler.|$|R

50|$|By far {{the most}} common outcome for {{separated}} children is a grant of discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b> Discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> is provided most frequently when there are inadequate return arrangements for these children in their country of origin. This <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> is usually granted for three years or until the young person reaches 17 ½, whichever is sooner. The child may appeal if he thinks {{he should have been}} granted refugee status or humanitarian protection, but only if he was initially granted more than twelve months’ leave. It should be noted that both grants of humanitarian protection and of discretionary leave are still rejection of asylum claims, so the young people granted either of these have the right to appeal this decision.|$|R

50|$|Even if a {{child born}} in the UK on or after 1 January 1983 but does not acquire British {{citizenship}} at birth, the child is considered a lawful resident in the UK and is not required <b>to</b> apply for <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b> The child, however, is subject to immigration control and the child's parent(s) can choose to apply for regularisation of the child's immigration status by the grant of <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> (for the same period as that held by the parent(s)).
