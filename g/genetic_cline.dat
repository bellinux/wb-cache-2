40|$|International audienceComparative phylogeography of deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} vent species has uncovered several genetic breaks between populations inhabiting {{northern and southern}} latitudes of the East Pacific Rise. However, the geographic width and position of <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> are variable among species. In this report, we further characterize the position and strength of barriers to gene flow between populations of the deep-sea vent mussel Bathymodiolus thermophilus. Eight allozyme loci and DNA sequences of four nuclear genes were added to previously published sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. Our data confirm the presence of two barriers to gene flow, one located at the Easter Microplate (between 21 degrees 33 'S and 31 degrees S) recently described as a hybrid zone, and the second positioned between 7 degrees 25 'S and 14 degrees S with each affecting different loci. Coalescence analysis indicates a single vicariant event at the origin of divergence between clades for all nuclear loci, although the clines are now spatially discordant. We thus hypothesize that the Easter Microplate barrier has recently been relaxed after {{a long period of}} isolation and that some <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> have escaped the barrier and moved northward where they have subsequently been trapped by a reinforcing barrier to gene flow between 7 degrees 25 'S and 14 degrees S...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{extensive and}} realistic simulations of the colonization process of Europe by Neolithic farmers, {{as well as}} their potential admixture and competition with local Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. We find that minute amounts of gene flow between Palaeolithic and Neolithic populations should lead to a massive Palaeolithic contribution to the current gene pool of Europeans. This large Palaeolithic contribution is not expected under the demic diffusion (DD) model, which postulates that agriculture diffused over Europe by a massive migration of individuals from the Near East. However, genetic evidence in favour of this model mainly consisted in the observation of allele frequency clines over Europe, which are shown here to be equally probable under a pure DD or a pure acculturation model. The examination of the consequence of range expansions on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity reveals that an ascertainment bias consisting of selecting SNPs with high frequencies will promote the observation of <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> (which are not expected for random SNPs) and will lead to multimodal mismatch distributions.

40|$|In {{a single}} well-mixed population, equally {{abundant}} neutral alleles are equally likely to persist. However, in spatially complex populations structured by an asymmetric dispersal mechanism, {{such as a}} coastal population where larvae are predominantly moved downstream by currents, the eventual frequency of neutral haplotypes will depend on their initial spatial location.

This quantification of an evolving genetic boundary in a coastal system demonstrates that novel genetic alleles or haplotypes that arise or are introduced into upstream retention zones (regions whose export of larvae is not balanced by import from elsewhere) will increase in frequency in the entire system. This phenomenon should be widespread when there is asymmetrical dispersal, in the oceans or on land, suggesting that the upstream edge of a species’ range can influence genetic diversity throughout its distribution.

40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} are commonly invoked to explain geographic gradients in gene frequencies (clines) : gene flow and natural selection. Thus gene frequency clines in Europe {{have been attributed}} to gene flow because expanding Neolithic farmers from the Near East spread and absorbed resident foragers, a process Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues labeled demic diffusion. Alternatively, gradients in natural selection can produce the same genetic pattern. A third mechanism to explain European clines has recently been proposed by Barbujani et al. (1995). They found that European allele frequencies were consistent with distributions generated by a simple model of total replacement of foragers by expanding farmers. Clines were produced by repeated founder effects in colonizing farmer groups. Here, I present a simulation model using different population parameters to test the generality of the Barbujani model. Results of the simulation show that steep clines (measured by spatial autocorrelation statistics) can be produced by kin-structured founder effects. The implication of these findings is that several genetic {{mechanisms are}} consistent with the allele distributions in Europe. To discriminate among these alternatives, other information, such as better archeological and demographic characterization of interactions between farmers and foragers, is required.

40|$|Range {{expansions}} {{may create}} a unique spatial genetic pattern characterized by alternate genetically homogeneous domains and allele frequency clines. Previous attempts to model range expansions have mainly {{focused on the}} loss of genetic diversity during expansions. Using individual-based models, we examined spatial genetic patterns under two expansion scenarios, boundary-limited range expansions (BLRE) and phenotype-limited range expansions (PhLRE). Our simulation revealed that the genetic diversity within populations lost quickly during the range expansion, while the genetic difference accumulated between populations. Consequently, accompanying the expansions, the overall diversity featured a slow decrease. Specifically, during BLREs, high speed of boundary motion facilitated the maintenance of total genetic diversity and sharpened <b>genetic</b> <b>clines.</b> Very slight constraints on boundary motion of BLREs drastically narrowed the homogeneous domains and increased the allele frequency fluctuations from those levels exhibited by PhLREs. Even stronger constraints, however, surprisingly brought the width of homogeneous domains and the allele frequency fluctuations back to the normal levels of PhLREs. Furthermore, high migration rates maintained a higher total genetic diversity than low ones did during PhLREs. Whereas, the total genetic diversities during BLREs showed a contrary pattern: higher when migration was low than those when migration was high. Besides, the increase of migration rates helped maintain {{a greater number of}} homogeneous domains during PhLREs, but their effects on the number of homogeneou...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{zones are}} {{commonly}} studied to dissect {{the processes that}} drive divergence among lineages, which have incomplete barriers of reproduction. Most hybrid zones have existed for an extended time making inferences on the initial mode of formation difficult. It is a priori unclear how fast a nascent hybrid zone would form {{as a response to}} endogenous and exogenous factors. We have studied several hybrid zones between two lineages of sculpins (Cottus spp.), which emerged due to a recent range expansion of one of the lineages along the river Rhine in the early 1990 s. Applying a dense sampling across two contact areas and using a highly informative set of 45 microsatellite markers we found pronounced genetic structure. Steep <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> suggest that strong selective forces have shaped the respective hybrid zones from the beginning. We find that the zones are coupled to ecological transitions from small streams to larger rivers. The width of these zones is much smaller than estimates of annual individual dispersal distances, as estimated outside of the hybrid zones. The pattern is apparently not strongly affected by pre- or postzygotic reproductive isolation because numerous backcross hybrids occur within the zones. This suggests that strong natural selection acts against immigrant genotypes.

A prominent constituent of this biome is Calycophyllum candidissimum, an insect-pollinated and wind-dispersed canopy tree of high socio-economic importance, particularly in Nicaragua. Here, we surveyed amplified fragment length polymorphisms across 13 populations of this species in Nicaragua to elucidate the relative roles of contemporary vs historical factors in shaping its genetic variation. Genetic diversity was low in all investigated populations (mean HE= 0. 125), and negatively correlated with latitude. Overall population differentiation was moderate (ΦST = 0. 109, Po 0. 001), and Bayesian analysis of population structure revealed two major latitudinal clusters (I: ‘Pacific North’+’Central Highland’; II: ‘Pacific South’), along with a <b>genetic</b> <b>cline</b> between I and II. Population-based cluster analyses indicated a strong pattern of ‘isolation by distance’ as confirmed by Mantel’s test. Our results suggest that (1) the low genetic diversity of these populations reflects biogeographic/population history (colonisation from South America, Pleistocene range contractions) rather than recent human impact; whereas (2) the underlying process of their isolation by distance pattern, which is best explained by ‘isolation by dispersal limitation’, implies contemporary gene flow between neighbouring populations as likely facilitated by the species’ efficient seed dispersal capacity. Overall, these results underscore that even tree species from highly decimated forest regions may be genetically resilient to habitat fragmentation due to species-typical dispersal characteristics, the necessity of broad-scale measures for their conservation notwithstanding...|$|E
40|$|Relative to {{terrestrial}} plants, {{and despite}} similarities in life history characteristics, the poten-tial for corals to exhibit intra-reef local adaptation {{in the form}} of genetic differentiation along an environmental gradient has received little attention. The potential for natural selection to act on such small scales is likely increased by the ability of coral larval dispersal and settle-ment to be influenced by environmental cues. Here, we combine genetic, spatial, and envi-ronmental data for a single patch reef in Kāne‘ohe Bay, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i, USA in a landscape genetics framework to uncover environmental drivers of intra-reef genetic structuring. The genetic dataset consists of near-exhaustive sampling (n = 2352) of the coral, Pocillopora damicornis at our study site and six microsatellite genotypes. In addition, three environmen-tal parameters – depth and two depth-independent temperature indices – were collected on a 4 m grid across 85 locations throughout the reef. We use ordinary kriging to spatially inter-polate our environmental data and estimate the three environmental parameters for each colony. Partial Mantel tests indicate a significant correlation between genetic relatedness and depth while controlling for space. These results are also supported by multi-model infer-ence. Furthermore, spatial Principle Component Analysis indicates a statistically significant <b>genetic</b> <b>cline</b> along a depth gradient. Binning the genetic dataset based on size-class re-vealed that the correlation between genetic relatedness and depth was significant for new recruits and increased for larger size classes, suggesting a possible role of larval habitat se-lection as well as selective mortality in structuring intra-reef genetic diversity. That both pre-and post-recruitment processes may be involved points to the adaptive role of larval habitat selection in increasing adult survival. The conservation importance of uncovering intra-reef patterns of genetic diversity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{investigate}} evolution and diversification of montane birds that inhabit dramatic environmental and latitudinal gradients, specifically within the genus Anairetes (Aves, Tyrannidae). I use phylogenetic, population genetic, and physiological methods to examine patterns of diversification across environmental gradients. In the first chapter, I infer the phylogeny of Anairetes tit-tyrants {{to provide an}} essential phylogenetic framework to ask subsequent questions of biogeography and diversification within the group. In the second chapter, I investigated the role of differential adaptation to altitude in promoting diversification and maintaining species limits between A. reguloides and A. nigrocristatus. The phylogeny of the flycatcher genus Anairetes was previously inferred using short fragments of mitochondrial DNA and parsimony and distance-based methods. The resulting topology spurred taxonomic revision and influenced understanding of Andean biogeography. In the first chapter, I revisit the phylogeny of Anairetes tit-tyrants using more mtDNA characters, seven unlinked loci (three mitochondrial genes, six nuclear loci), more closely related outgroup taxa, partitioned Bayesian analyses, and two coalescent species-tree approaches (Bayesian estimation of species trees, BEST; Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees, *BEAST). Of these improvements in data and analyses, the fourfold increase in mtDNA characters was both necessary and sufficient to incur {{a major shift in}} the topology and near-complete resolution. The species-tree analyses, while theoretically preferable to concatenation or single gene approaches, yielded topologies that were compatible with mtDNA but with weaker statistical resolution at nodes. Previous results that led to taxonomic and biogeographic reappraisal were refuted, and my results support the resurrection of the genus Uromyias as the sister clade to Anairetes. The sister relationship between these two genera corresponds to an ecological dichotomy between a depauperate humid cloud forest clade and a diverse dry-tolerant clade that has diversified along the latitudinal axis of the Andes. Species-tree and the concatenation approaches each reaffirm the use of mtDNA to provide phylogenetic signal for avian phylogenies at the species and subspecies level. This result {{is due in part to}} the abundance of informative characters in mtDNA, and in part to its lower effective population size that allows it to track the species tree. Local environmental pressures can drive the evolution of adaptive traits that confer a fitness advantage to an organism under local conditions. In the second chapter I investigate the role of differential physiological adaptation to altitude between sister-species: the elevationally widespread A. reguloides and the high-elevation restricted A. nigrocristatus. I measure the physiological response of each species to low ambient partial-pressure of oxygen at high elevations. At high elevation, A. reguloides shows evidence of hypoxic stress while A. nigrocristatus shows evidence of hypoxia resistance. I further quantify the phenotypic and <b>genetic</b> <b>cline</b> shape and the rate and direction of gene flow between the two species across a narrow contact zone where hybridization occurs at middle elevations. Phenotypic and genetic clines show a dramatic shift from A. reguloides to A. nigrocristatus across the 212 km elevational transect. Coalescent-based Isolation with Migration (IMa 2) analysis suggests effectively zero introgression between parental populations. Upon secondary contact, the two species segregate elevationally. Physiological data, phenotypic and <b>genetic</b> <b>cline</b> shapes, and introgression patterns suggest that maladapted A. reguloides alleles are selected against at high elevations in the presence of hypoxia resistant A. nigrocristatus alleles. Differential local adaptation is associated with restricted gene flow and essential reproductive isolation, despite at least limited reproductive compatibility.

The southern hybrid zone between the southeastern Australian tree frogs Litoria ewingii and L. paraewingi has been comprehensively studied over the last 40 years, primarily using reproductive compatibility experiments and male advertisement calls. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and eight nuclear microsatellite markers to characterize this hybrid zone along a historically studied transect and to test various dispersal-dependent and dispersal-independent hybrid zone models. The species are genetically distinct and the level of hybridization within the contact zone is low, with the majority of admixed individuals representing later-generation hybrids. Based on previous experimental genetic compatibility studies, we predicted that hybrids with L. paraewingi mtDNA would be more frequent than hybrids with L. ewingii mtDNA. Surprisingly, a greater proportion of the identified hybrids had L. ewingii mtDNA. Geographical cline analyses showed a sharp transition in allele frequencies across the transect, and both the mtDNA and microsatellite data showed concordant cline centres, but were best supported by a model that allowed width to vary. Overall, the L. ewingii-L. paraewingi hybrid zone is best characterized as a tension zone, due to the narrow <b>cline</b> width, concordant <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> and low levels of hybridization.

It has been argued, however, {{that the degree}} of clustering is diminished by use of samples with greater uniformity in geographic distribution, and that the clusters we identified were a consequence of uneven sampling along <b>genetic</b> <b>clines.</b> Expanding our earlier dataset from 377 to 993 markers, we systematically examine the influence of several study design variables [...] sample size, number of loci, number of clusters, assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across populations, and the geographic dispersion of the sample [...] on the "clusteredness" of individuals. With all other variables held constant, geographic dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree of clustering. Examination of the relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993 -locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Adaptation {{to winter}} cold in {{temperate}} and boreal trees involves complex genetic, physiological, and devel-opmental processes. Genecological studies demonstrate {{the existence of}} steep <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> for cold adaptation traits in relation to environmental (mostly temperature related) gradients. Population differentiation is generally stronger for cold adaptation traits than for other quantitative traits and allozymes. Therefore, these traits appear to be under strong natu-ral selection. Nonetheless, high levels of genetic variation persist within populations. The genetic control of cold adap-tation traits ranges from weak to strong, with phenological traits having the highest heritabilities. Within-population genetic correlations among traits range from negligible to moderate. Generally, bud phenology and cold hardiness in the fall are genetically uncorrelated with bud phenology and cold hardiness in the spring. Analyses of quantitative trait loci indicate that cold adaptation traits are mostly controlled by multiple genes with small effects and that quantitative trait loci × environment interactions are common. Given this inherent complexity, we suggest that future research should focus on identifying and developing markers for cold adaptation candidate genes, then using multilocus, multi-allelic analytical techniques to uncover the relationships between genotype and phenotype at both the individual and population levels. Ultimately, these methods may be useful for predicting the performance of genotypes in breeding programs and for better understanding the evolutionary ecology of forest trees. Key words: association genetics, cold hardiness, dormancy, genecology, bud phenology, quantitative trait loci...|$|R
40|$|Background: On-going {{climate change}} is {{shifting}} the timing of bud burst (TBB) of broad leaf and conifer trees in temperate areas, raising concerns about the abilities of natural populations to respond to these shifts. The level of expected evolutionary change depends on the level and distribution of genetic variation of TBB. While numerous experimental studies have highlighted the role of divergent selection in promoting clinal TBB differentiation, we explored whether the observed patterns of variation could be generated by the joint effects of assortative mating for TBB and gene flow among natural populations. We tested this hypothesis using an in silico approach based on quantitative genetic models. Results: Our simulations showed that <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> can develop even without divergent selection. Assortative mating in association with environmental gradients substantially shifted the mean genetic values of populations. Owing to assortative mating, immigrant alleles were screened for proximal or distant populations depending {{on the strength of}} the environmental cline. Furthermore, we confirmed that assortative mating increases the additive genetic variance within populations. However, we observed also a rapid decline of the additive genetic variance caused by restricted gene flow between neighboring populations resulting from preferential matings between phenologically-matching phenotypes. Conclusions: We provided evidence that the patterns of genetic variation of phenological traits observed in forest trees can be generated solely by the effects of assortative mating and gene flow. We anticipate that predicted temperature increases due to climate change will further enhance genetic differentiation across the landscape. These trends are likely to be reinforced or counteracted by natural selection if phenological traits are correlated to fitness...|$|R
40|$|The peopling of East Asia by {{the first}} modern humans is {{strongly}} debated from a genetic point of view. A north-south genetic differentiation observed in this geographic area suggests different hypotheses {{on the origin of}} Northern East Asian (NEA) and Southern East Asian (SEA) populations. In this study, the highly polymorphic HLA markers were used to investigate East Asian genetic diversity. Our database covers a total of about 127, 000 individuals belonging to 84 distinct Asian populations tested for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB 1, and/or -DRB 1 alleles. Many Chinese populations are represented, which have been sampled in the last 30 years but rarely taken into account in international research due to their data published in Chinese. By using different statistical methods, we found a significant correlation between genetics and geography and relevant <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> in East Asia. Additionally, HLA alleles appear to be unevenly distributed: some alleles observed in NEA populations are widespread at the global level, while some alleles observed in SEA populations are virtually unique in Asia. The HLA genetic variation in East Asia is also characterized by a decrease of diversity from north to south, although a reverse pattern appears when one only focuses on alleles restricted to Asia. These results reflect a more complex migration history than that illustrated by the "southern-origin" hypothesis, as genetic contribution of ancient human migrations through a northern route has probably been quite substantial. We thus suggest a new overlapping model where northward and southward opposite migrations occurring at different periods overlapped...|$|R

40|$|The moose (Alces alces) is {{the most}} {{intensely}} managed game species in Fennoscandia; approximately one-third of the population, ca. 160, 000 animals, is harvested annually. Despite the species' biological and socioeconomic importance, there are knowledge gaps with respect to its intraspecific diversity and genetic structure. Recent studies of moose in neighboring countries report 2 genetic groups in Finland, 3 in Norway {{with one of them}} suggested to be of ancient origin, and no indications of bottlenecks. To delineate the spatial genetic landscape of the Swedish moose, we used allozyme variability from over 20, 000 georeferenced moose collected all over Sweden in combination with 12 microsatellites (n = 1, 200) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (n = 44). We combined individual-based and traditional statistical approaches with coalescence-based simulations. The results indicate a complex history with bottlenecks and recent expansions that is consistent with historical records. Swedish moose are separated into 2 major genetic groups, a northern and a southern one, where the southern group is further divided into 3 subgroups. The 2 main subpopulations are moderately differentiated (F-ST = 0. 1; R-ST = 0. 07) and separated by sharp genetic discontinuities occurring over a relatively narrow transition zone in central Sweden that coincides with a similar, previously reported transition zone in Norway. This differentiation is not reflected in mtDNA variation, where no significant divergence was observed. Together with the F-ST andR(ST) similarities, this suggests that the 2 major subpopulations in Sweden reflect divergence shaped after the postglacial recolonization of Scandinavia. Neighborhood size assessments indicate that gene flow is relatively restricted with an estimated average dispersal distance of 3. 5 - 11. 1 km, and spatial autocorrelograms suggest that genetic similarity decreases almost linearly over space resulting in continuous <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> within major subgroups. Management areas largely coincide with genetic clusters, simplifying the integration of genetic information into management...|$|R
40|$|Range expansions, empirically and in simulations, lead to clinal {{patterns}} of <b>genetic</b> diversity. <b>Clines</b> {{are often used}} as spatial markers of past migrations. This study investigated the effects of migration, growth, and carrying capacities on clinal patterns during range expansions, using forward-time simulations in Nemo. Initial results show, {{in the absence of}} prior population structure, range expansions result in a loss of diversity strongly affected by migration, growth, and carrying capacity. This loss of diversity did not persist to the final generation, corresponding to 10, 000 years, indicating clinal patterns are less durable than previously assumed—challenging the utility of clinal patterns as specific markers of past migrations. Further simulations are necessary to evaluate the effects of large demographic collapses, negative selection, and non equilibrium migration upon clines. While the case study for these experiments is the peopling of Europe, these results are broadly applicable to other human colonization events...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Direct Repeat {{locus of}} the Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTC) {{is a member}} of the CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) sequences family. Spoligotyping is the widely used PCR-based reverse-hybridization blotting technique that assays the genetic diversity of this locus and is useful both for clinical laboratory, molecular epidemiology, evolutionary and population genetics. It is easy, robust, cheap, and produces highly diverse portable numerical results, as the result of the combination of (1) Unique Events Polymorphism (UEP) (2) Insertion-Sequence-mediated genetic recombination. Genetic convergence, although rare, was also previously demonstrated. Three previous international spoligotype databases had partly revealed the global and local geographical structures of MTC bacilli populations, however, there was a need for the release of a new, more representative and extended, international spoligotyping database. Results The fourth international spoligotyping database, SpolDB 4, describes 1939 shared-types (STs) representative of a total of 39, 295 strains from 122 countries, which are tentatively classified into 62 clades/lineages using a mixed expert-based and bioinformatical approach. The SpolDB 4 update adds 26 new potentially phylogeographically-specific MTC genotype families. It provides a clearer picture of the current MTC genomes diversity as well as on the relationships between the genetic attributes investigated (spoligotypes) and the infra-species classification and evolutionary history of the species. Indeed, an independent Naïve-Bayes mixture-model analysis has validated main of the previous supervised SpolDB 3 classification results, confirming the usefulness of both supervised and unsupervised models as an approach to understand MTC population structure. Updated results on the epidemiological status of spoligotypes, as well as genetic prevalence maps on six main lineages are also shown. Our results suggests the existence of fine geographical <b>genetic</b> <b>clines</b> within MTC populations, that could mirror the passed and present Homo sapiens sapiens demographical and mycobacterial co-evolutionary history whose structure could be further reconstructed and modelled, thereby providing a large-scale conceptual framework of the global TB Epidemiologic Network. Conclusion Our results broaden the knowledge of the global phylogeography of the MTC complex. SpolDB 4 should be a very useful tool to better define the identity of a given MTC clinical isolate, and to better analyze the links between its current spreading and previous evolutionary history. The building and mining of extended MTC polymorphic genetic databases is in progress. </p...|$|R
