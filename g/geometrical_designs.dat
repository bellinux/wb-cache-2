5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and <b>geometrical</b> <b>designs.</b> Nature is frequently {{used as the basis}} of Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering. Toraja's ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics to reveal their mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Murals dated 9000 to 7000BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers, clothed in garb decorated with <b>geometrical</b> <b>designs,</b> and holding mushroom-like objects. Parallel lines extend from the mushroom shapes {{to the center of the}} dancers' heads. 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as Psilocybe hispanica, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the hadith's {{prohibition}} against creating images of sentient living beings, which is particularly strictly observed with respect to God and Muhammad, Islamic religious art {{is focused on the}} word. Muslims generally avoid depictions of Muhammad, and mosques are decorated with calligraphy and Quranic inscriptions or <b>geometrical</b> <b>designs,</b> not images or sculptures. Today, the interdiction against images of Muhammad– designed to prevent worship of Muhammad, rather than God– is much more strictly observed in Sunni Islam (85%–90% of Muslims) and Ahmadiyya Islam (1%) than among Shias (10%–15%). While both Sunnis and Shias have created images of Muhammad in the past, Islamic depictions of Muhammad are rare. They have, until recently, mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of the miniature, and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.|$|E

Due to grid-pattern of town planning like a chess board, all houses opened out {{to at least}} two or three roads or lanes. Each house had a courtyard and 6-7 rooms on three sides, with a well in some houses. One house had stairs for going to the roof. Houses were built of 30 × 15 × 7.5cm mud bricks (same as those used in second structural phase of fort wall). Burnt bricks were used in drains, wells, bathing platforms and door-sills, besides fire-altar. Floors of rooms were built of thrashed fine mud, sometimes laid with mud bricks or terracotta cakes. One house had floors built of burnt tiles decorated with <b>geometrical</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|E

60|$|If I went {{again to}} Seville I {{should try to}} visit them--but, as it was, we gave our second day to the Alcazar, which is merely {{the first in the}} series of palaces and gardens once {{stretching}} from the flank of the cathedral to the Tower of Gold beside the Guadalquivir. A rich sufficiency is left in the actual Alcazar to suggest the splendor of the series, and more than enough in the gardens to invite our fatigue, day after day, to the sun and shade of its quiet paths and seats when we came spent with the glories and the bustling piety of the cathedral. In our first visit we had the guidance of a patriotic young Granadan whose zeal for the Alhambra would not admit the Alcazar to any comparison, but I myself still prefer it after seeing the Alhambra. It is as purely Moorish as that and it is in better repair if not better taste. The taste in fact is the same, and the Castilian kings consulted it as eagerly as their Arabic predecessors in the talent of the Moslem architects whom they had not yet begun to drive into exile. I am not going to set up rival to the colored picture postals, which give a better notion than I could give of the painted and gilded stucco decoration, the ingenious <b>geometrical</b> <b>designs</b> on the walls, and the cloying sweetness of the honeycombing in the vaulted roofs. Every one will have his feeling about Moorish architecture; mine is that a little goes a great way, and that it is too monotonous to compete with the Gothic in variety, while it lacks the dignity of any form of the Greek or the Renaissance. If the phrase did not insult the sex which the faith of the Moslem insufferably insults, one might sum up one's slight for it in the word effeminate.|$|E
60|$|In St. Michele of Lucca we have {{perhaps the}} noblest {{instance}} in Italy of the Lombard spirit in its later refinement. It is some four centuries later than St. Michele of Pavia, and {{the method of}} workmanship is altogether different. In the Pavian church, nearly all the ornament is cut in a coarse sandstone, in bold relief: a darker and harder stone (I think, not serpentine, but its surface is so disguised by the lustre of ages that I could not be certain) {{is used for the}} capitals of the western door, which are especially elaborate in their sculpture;--two devilish apes, or apish devils, I know not which, with bristly moustaches and edgy teeth, half-crouching, with their hands impertinently on their knees, ready for a spit or a spring if one goes near them; but all is pure bossy sculpture; there is no inlaying, except of some variegated tiles in the shape of saucers set concave (an ornament used also very gracefully in St. Jacopo of Bologna): and the whole surface of the church is enriched with the massy reliefs, well preserved everywhere above the reach of human animals, but utterly destroyed to some five or six feet from the ground; worn away into large cellular hollows and caverns, some almost deep enough to render the walls unsafe, entirely owing to the uses to which the recesses of the church are dedicated by the refined and high-minded Italians. But St. Michele of Lucca is wrought entirely in white marble and green serpentine; there is hardly any relieved sculpture except in the capitals of the shafts and cornices, and all the designs of wall ornament are inlaid with exquisite precision--white on dark ground; the ground being cut out and filled with serpentine, the figures left in solid marble. The designs of the Pavian church are encrusted on the walls; of the Lucchese, incorporated with them; small portions of real sculpture being introduced exactly where the eye, after its rest on the flatness of the wall, will take most delight in the piece of substantial form. The entire arrangement is perfect beyond all praise, and the morbid restlessness of the old designs is now appeased. Geometry seems to have acted as a febrifuge, for beautiful <b>geometrical</b> <b>designs</b> are introduced amidst the tumult of the hunt; and there is no more seeing double, nor ghastly monstrosity of conception; no more ending of everything in something else; no more disputing for spare legs among bewildered bodies; no more setting on of heads wrong side foremost. The fragments have come together: we are out of the Inferno with its weeping down the spine; we are in the fair hunting-fields of the Lucchese mountains (though they had their tears also),--with horse, and hound, and hawk; and merry blast of the trumpet.--Very strange creatures to be hunted, in all truth; but still creatures with a single head, and that on their shoulders, which is exactly the last place in the Pavian church where a head is to be looked for.|$|E

40|$|For maximum {{operating}} efficiency of Roots type blowers, the leakage of compressed air through clearance must {{be reduced to}} a minimum. At the same time it is desirable to keep the design as compact as possible. The following analysis endeavours to show, for involute rotors, the effect of the <b>geometrical</b> <b>design</b> variables, pressure angle, rotor tip radius, and base circle radius, on leakage and compactness. Firstly limits of permissible values of the <b>geometrical</b> <b>design</b> variables, to allow correct mating between rotors, are established. Within these limits, relative blower compactness and carry-over of compressed air back to the inlet tract is obtained for the ideal blower with no clearance between relative rotating parts. The analysis and results are expressed in dimensionless form independent of blower size, and results are compared with cycloid rotors. Leakage through blower clearances, in terms of the <b>geometrical</b> <b>design</b> variables, is then determined for a range of pressure ratios, and the dependence on blower size is examined. It is concluded that optimum design values cannot be obtained. A compromise solution between minimum total leakage and maximum compactness is necessary, depending on the operating requirements for a particular Roots blower...|$|R
