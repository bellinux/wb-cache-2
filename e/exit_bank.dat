40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{long-term}} change of the industrial organization of the Japanese banking industry and its efficiency implication. In postwar Japan, the "convoy administration" by the Ministry of Finance rigidly controlled the entry into and <b>exit</b> from the <b>banking</b> industry, {{as well as the}} competition among the incumbent <b>banks.</b> <b>Exits</b> of <b>banks</b> were not only few, but also all of the exits were through mergers. On the other hand, in prewar Japan, a lot of <b>banks</b> <b>exited</b> through dissolution and bankruptcy, as well as thorough mergers. Using the data of the individual <b>bank</b> <b>exits,</b> we analyze the relationship between the <b>exit</b> of the <b>bank</b> and its performance. We find that, in prewar period, the lower the bank's performance was, the larger the probability of its exit through dissolution and bankruptcy was. Interestingly, this relationship cannot be observed concerning the exit thorough merger. The result concerning the exit thorough merger in the postwar period is the same. What differed from the prewar period was that there was no exit through the dissolution and bankruptcy in postwar period. We can conclude that while the selection mechanism of the inefficient banks worked in prewar Japan, it did not in the postwar period. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates <b>bank</b> <b>exit</b> {{regimes in}} {{selected}} financial centres using econometric methods. The {{focus is on}} <b>bank</b> <b>exit</b> regimes applicable to commercial banks in New York, London, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Tokyo in 1998 – 2002. <b>Bank</b> <b>exit</b> regimes are studied {{from the perspective of}} bank creditors and bank shareholders. In order to apply econometric methods, the exit regimes are indexed and then evaluated by comparing them with market indicators that reflect the interests of bank creditors and shareholders. These market indicators comprise bank refinancing costs and bank growth rates. In other words, two specific questions are addressed: (1) Do differences in <b>bank</b> <b>exit</b> regimes of significance to bank creditors explain differences in bank refinancing costs? (2) Do differences in <b>bank</b> <b>exit</b> regimes significant to bank shareholders explain differences in bank growth? The study shows that in those financial centres where the probability of bailout is higher, refinancing costs for banks are lower. evaluation, bank, regulation, supervision, reorganisation, liquidation...|$|R

40|$|We {{test for}} the {{presence}} of market discipline in the banking sector in early 20 th century Mexico. Using a panel of financial data from note-issuing banks between 1905 and 1910, we examine whether bank fundamentals influenced the pattern of withdrawals. If we do not control for exit, our estimation suggests that fundamentals were not a significant determinant of depositor behavior. Instead, bank specific fixed effects and systemic risk seem to have been the most important determinants of net changes in deposits. However this period included the banking crisis of 1907 and the subsequent <b>exit</b> of several <b>banks.</b> Our results change when we use a two step estimator to take this into account. Controlling for the selection bias created by <b>exiting</b> <b>banks,</b> we show that fundamentals were indeed an important determinant of bank withdrawals in this period, indicating the existence of market discipline. market discipline, selection bias...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} increased competition from deregulation on {{the dynamics of the}} U. S. banking industry. We find the link between a bank’s relative performance and its subsequent market share growth strengthens significantly after deregulation as competitive reallocation effects transfer assets to better performers. The increase in the link is strongest in states that were initially more regulated and therefore likely to be less competitive, e. g., states with unit banking restrictions and high market concentrations. Exit dynamics also change in ways consistent with the disciplinary role of competition. After states deregulate, both the exit rates and the average profitability of <b>exiting</b> <b>banks</b> increase as more banks are exposed to the corporate takeover market. The net effect of these forces is a substantial reallocation of market share toward better banks. We conclude that earlier regulation of U. S. banks blunted this market mechanism and seriously hindered the competitive process. Stiroh is a Research Officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strahan is an Associate Professor o...|$|R

50|$|Another {{option to}} {{minimize}} crash risk due to low DG at entrance or <b>exit</b> of <b>banked</b> outercurves, {{is to move}} the superelevation further from the curve and out to a straight road section. This results in a banked straight lane. This design can yield another risk, since the water film (when raining) on an adjacent lane may become thicker. However, this is on a straight section where the lack of road curvature minimize the lateral forces and thus keep the skid risk low.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} the <b>exit</b> behaviour of <b>banks</b> in the Nigerian consolidation program during July 2004 and December 2005. We conceptualise the exit process in a flexible bivariate competing risks model to examine the importance of macroeconomic and industry-specific factors for both merged banks and failed banks jointly. The preliminary results suggest that bank-specific characteristics mattered more for preventing bank failure than they did for emergence of the M&A banks. Second, the Central Bank of Nigeria’s assistance was highly influential in preventing bank failure, and, for banks that benefited, the assistance increased their probability of being merged or acquired. Also, we found no strong evidence suggesting that the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and industry-specific factors had influenced <b>exit</b> behaviour of <b>banks</b> during the consolidation exercise.

With reference to the comparatively rigid control of entries and <b>exits</b> in <b>banking,</b> four hypotheses are formulated: (1) acquisitions constitute the principal method of closure in banking; (2) the early years are less hazardous for members of the banking industry than for members of other industries; (3) the survival rates of banks are negatively related to the freedom of bank operations; and (4) the survival rates of banks are negatively related to the degree to which customer relationships already exist. The analysis provides evidence supporting the four hypotheses. ...|$|R
