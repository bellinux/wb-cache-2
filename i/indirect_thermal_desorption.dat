40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the use of an}} indirectly heated, high temperature (900 ºC), high vacuum (28 " Hg) rotary kiln, developed and patented by Raduce, Inc. (subsidiary of Sepradyne Corp.), to treat a dioxin contaminated mixed waste incinerator ash from the Idaho National Engineering Lab (INEEL) Waste Experimental Reduction Facility (WERF). The Raduce process differs from conventional thermal processing systems (e. g., direct-fired incinerators and <b>indirect</b> heated <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> units) primarily due to the combination of a high vacuum and rotary mixing action achieved by means of a proprietary rotating vacuum seal. Treatment {{in the absence of an}} oxidative environment distinguishes the technology from conventional techniques and eliminates products of incomplete combustion. A 500 cm 3 bench-scale rotary vacuum <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> and destruction unit (DDU) was used at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to demonstrate this thermal treatment process. Dioxins and furans were successfully decomposed at both low (450 ºC) and high (700 - 800 ºC) temperature regimes. Dioxin homologue concentrations in the untreated ash ranged between 30 and 565 ppb and furan homologue concentrations ranged between 78 and 267 ppb. After thermal treatment, dioxin/furan homologue concentrations were close to non-detectable (the highest dioxin concentration was reported at 0. 067 ppb and the highest furan concentration was 0. 119 ppb) for samples treated at both 450 ºC and 750 ºC. In addition, substantial volume and mass reduction of the ash was achieved. Stabilization of the nonvolatile residues by a post-treatment encapsulation process will be required to reduce the leachability of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) metals to levels below the EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) requirements...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{considered}} a solar sail coated with materials that undergo <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> at a specific temperature, {{as a result of}} heating by solar radiation at a particular heliocentric distance. Three different scenarios, that only differ in the way the sail approaches the Sun, were analyzed and compared. In every case once the perihelion is reached, the sail coat undergoes <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption.</b> When the desorption process ends, the sail then escapes the Solar System having the conventional acceleration due to solar radiation pressure. <b>Thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> here comes as an additional source of solar sail acceleration beside traditional propulsion systems for extrasolar space exploration. The compared scenarios are the following: i. Hohmann transfer plus <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption.</b> In this scenario the sail would be carried as a payload to the perihelion with a conventional propulsion system by an Hohmann transfer from Earth's orbit to an orbit very close to the Sun (almost at 0. 1 AU) and then be deployed there. ii. Elliptical transfer plus Slingshot plus <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption.</b> In this scenario the transfer occurs from Earth's orbit to Jupiter's orbit.

40|$|An in-situ {{derivatization}} <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> method {{followed by}} gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IDTD-GC-TOFMS) {{was developed for}} determination of polar organic compounds. Hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of compounds such as anhydrous sugars, alcohols and phenols, fatty acids and resin acids are targets of the derivatization procedure. Derivatization is based on silylation with N-Methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) during the step of <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption.</b> The high temperature of 300 &deg;C during desorption is utilized for the in-situ derivatization on the collection substrate (quartz fibre filters) accelerating the reaction rate.

30|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> {{dispose of}} oily {{cuttings}} is a feasible remediation method (Stephenson et al. 2004), and the removed oil can be recovered fully or partially (Eze et al. 2015; Shie et al. 2000). Indirect heating and direct heating have used for <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> disposing of oily cuttings. Heat conduction oil heating and flue gas heating are the conventional heating methods (Pierce et al. 2006). The total heating efficiency {{is low and}} equipment is large in size. Heat generating by grinding cuttings with a hammer mill is a friction heating method for removing oil (Murray et al. 2008). Friction heating method is limited in heat production and temperature rise, which has strict requirements for liquids content of material. Microwave heating is an advanced direct heating method, which has used for <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> (Júnior et al. 2017). The efficiency of microwave heating depends on microwave absorption of oil containing material. The texture and oxides present of material highly influence microwave absorption and contaminant removal (Falciglia and Vagliasindi 2015; Petri et al. 2017). Material selectivity is a disadvantage of <b>thermal</b> <b>desorption</b> by microwave heating.
