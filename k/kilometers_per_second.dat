5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E

25|$|After a star {{passes through}} the {{asymptotic}} giant branch (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins as gases blow away from the central star at speeds of a few <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB. As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss. In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse. During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity, {{while at the same}} time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a white dwarf, and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution. For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000years passes between its formation and recombination of the star.|$|E
40|$|We {{suggest that}} two-to-two dark matter fusion {{may be the}} {{relaxation}} process that resolves the small-scale structure problems of the cold collisionless dark matter paradigm. In order for the fusion cross section to scale correctly across many decades of astrophysical masses from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, we require the fractional binding energy released to be greater than v^n ~ [10 ^{-(2 - 3) }]^n, where n= 1, 2 depends on local dark sector chemistry. The size of the dark-sector interaction cross sections must be sigma ~ 0. 1 - 1 barn, moderately larger than for Standard Model deuteron fusion, indicating a dark nuclear scale Lambda ~ O(100 MeV).

50|$|A partial {{lunar eclipse}} occurs when {{only a portion}} of the moon enters the umbra. When the moon travels {{completely}} into the Earth's umbra, one observes a total lunar eclipse. The moon's speed through the shadow is about one <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (2,300 mph), and totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes. Nevertheless, the total time between the moon's first and last contact with the shadow is much longer and could last up to four hours. The relative distance of the moon from the Earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse's duration. In particular, when the moon is near its apogee, the farthest point from the Earth in its orbit, its orbital speed is the slowest. The diameter of the umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the orbital distance of the moon. Thus, a totally eclipsed moon occurring near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality.|$|R

The pulse period agrees well with the radio predictions. The NUV and FUV pulse profiles are little changed from the visible wavelength profile. Spectra obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope were combined with the UV spectra for full coverage from 1140 - 9250 Angstoms. Dereddening the spectrum with a standard extinction curve achieves a flat spectrum for E(B-V) = 0. 52, R= 3. 1.

500|$|The {{emission}} of hydroxyl megamasers occurs predominantly {{in the so-called}} [...] "main lines" [...] at 1665 and 1667 MHz. The hydroxyl molecule also has two [...] "satellite lines" [...] that emit at 1612 and 1720MHz, but few hydroxyl megamasers have had satellite lines detected. Emission in all known hydroxyl megamasers is stronger in the 1667MHz line; typical ratios of the flux in the 1667MHz line to the 1665MHz line, called the hyperfine ratio, range from a minimum of 2 to greater than 20. For hydroxyl emitting in thermodynamic equilibrium, this ratio will range from 1.8 to 1, depending upon the optical depth, so line ratios greater than 2 are indicative of a population out of thermal equilibrium. This may be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers in star-forming regions, where the 1665MHz line is typically strongest, and hydroxyl masers around evolved stars, in which the 1612MHz line is often strongest, and of the main lines, 1667MHz emission is frequently stronger than 1612MHz.

Our results demonstrate that, after the protostar first forms, ambipolar diffusion causes the magnetic flux to decouple in a growing region around the center.

We examine several data sets, including H-alpha images from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on Hinode, EUV images from TRACE, and line-of-sight magnetograms from SOHO/MDI. Flux cancelation occurs among two different sets of flux elements inside of the erupting active region: First, for several days prior to eruption, opposite-polarity sunspot groups inside the region move toward each other, leading to the cancelation of approximately 10 ^{ 21 } Mx of flux over three days. Second, within hours prior to the eruption, positive-polarity moving magnetic features (MMFs) flowing out of the positive-flux spots at approximately 1 <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> repeatedly cancel with field inside a patch of negative-polarity flux located north of the sunspots. The filament erupts as a surge whose base is rooted in the location where the MMF cancelation occurs, while during the eruption that filament flows out along the polarity inversion line between the converging spot groups.

Light curves are constructed, using a total of 1647 continuum level measurements. These results support the semidetached status of this interacting binary star. Radial velocities, residual intensities, full width half maxima (FWHM), line asymmetries, and equivalent widths of UV absorption lines for aluminum, magnesium, iron, and silicon {{in a range of}} ionization states are determined and analyzed. For selected epochs, we were able to isolate gas stream and photospheric contributions by an examination of the differences between spectral line shapes. We observed variations in line shape and strength, with orbital phase and epoch, indicating the presence of stable gas streams and circumstellar gas, and periods of increased mass-transfer activity associated with transient gas streams. The 1989 data indicates moderate activity. This epoch was examined most closely since it provides the greatest phase coverage. Spectral line profiles in 1978 and 1984 have the strongest gas-flow absorption components, indicating that these are the epochs of the greatest activity. The dense phase coverage in September 1989 allows us to measure the mass loss rate from Algol B into Algol A which is of order ~ 10 E- 14 solar masses per year.
