50|$|The kayfabe {{purpose of}} a {{professional}} wrestling referee is to render decisions (pinfalls, submissions, disqualifications, countouts) during a match but the legit purpose they serve is to transmit messages to wrestlers about the progress of matches, communicate with them {{about the amount of}} time left (plus {{the beginning and end of}} commercial breaks on live broadcasts), and, if necessary, help them gauge the crowd reaction as well as reminding them of match script. They also have a key role in ensuring that the wrestlers are physically capable to continue, and to stop the match/inform the opponent if there is a risk of <b>injury</b> <b>present.</b> Presently, referees wear wireless earpieces, to allow backstage officials to communicate with them during matches. Referees are also selected by their employers subject to their height and weight, and normally referees would be no more than six feet tall, weigh no more than 180 lb and may generally display a non-athletic physique; examples of this are World Wrestling Entertainment referees Mike Chioda and Charles Robinson. The purpose of this size discrepancy is purely to emphasize the height, weight and musculature of some of the larger wrestlers and to compensate for smaller stars.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePatients with right-brain <b>injury</b> <b>present,</b> more {{frequently}} in the acute phase, with a deviation of the subjective vertical (SV) contralateral to the lesion. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on this disorder. Twelve patients presenting with a right hemispheric lesion, seven with neglect (N+) and five without (N-) were compared to eight control subjects. They had to orient vertically a luminous rod in darkness, in three galvanic stimulation (1. 5 mA) conditions: cathode left, cathode right and no stimulation (baseline). Without stimulation, the patients' SV, and especially that of N+, showed an anticlockwise deviation. In comparison with baseline values, GVS induced a deviation toward the side opposite to the cathode in the three groups. In the patients, the deviation was of larger amplitude and appeared greater for left than for right cathodic stimulation. In conclusion, we showed an influence of vestibular stimulation on the SV of right brain-injured patients, especially when spatial neglect was present. As left cathodic stimulation can reduce the SV deviation associated with spatial neglect, such a tool could be introduced in rehabilitation...|$|E

Objective: To assess the neurotherapeutic effect of HBOT on prolonged post-concussion syndrome (PPCS) due to TBI, using brain microstructure imaging. Methods: Fifteen patients afflicted with PPCS were treated with 60 daily HBOT sessions. Imaging evaluation was performed using Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast-Enhanced (DSC) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) MR sequences. Cognitive evaluation was performed by an objective computerized battery (NeuroTrax). Results: HBOT was initiated 6 months to 27 years (10. 3 ± 3. 2 years) from injury. After HBOT, DTI analysis showed significantly increased fractional anisotropy values and decreased mean diffusivity in both white and gray matter structures. In addition, the cerebral blood flow and volume were increased significantly. Clinically, HBOT induced significant improvement in the memory, executive functions, information processing speed and global cognitive scores. Conclusions: The mechanisms by which HBOT induces brain neuroplasticity can be demonstrated by highly sensitive MRI techniques of DSC and DTI. HBOT can induce cerebral angiogenesis and improve both white and gray microstructures indicating regeneration of nerve fibers.

40|$|Excessive {{platelet}} accumulation and recruitment, {{leading to}} vessel occlusion at sites of vascular <b>injury,</b> <b>present</b> major therapeutic challenges in cardiovascular medicine. Endothelial cell CD 39, an ecto-enzyme with ADPase and ATPase activities, rapidly metabolizes ATP and ADP released from activated platelets, thereby abolishing recruitment. Therefore, a soluble form of CD 39, retaining nucleotidase activities, {{would constitute a}} novel antithrombotic agent. We designed a recombinant, soluble form of human CD 39, and isolated it from conditioned media from transiently transfected COS- 1 cells and from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Conditioned medium from CHO cells grown under serum-free conditions was subjected to anti-CD 39 immunoaffinity column chromatography, yielding a single approximately 66 -kD protein with ATPase and ADPase activities. Purified soluble CD 39 blocked ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro, and inhibited collagen-induced platelet reactivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that, while soluble CD 39 had a Km for ADP of 5. 9 microM and for ATP of 2. 1 microM, the specificity constant kcat/Km was the same for both substrates.

40|$|Abstract Background Care of the polytrauma patient {{does not}} end in the {{operating}} room or resuscitation bay. The patient presenting to the intensive care unit following initial resuscitation and damage control surgery may be far from stable with ongoing hemorrhage, resuscitation needs, and injuries still requiring definitive repair. The intensive care physician must understand the respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immunologic consequences of trauma resuscitation and massive transfusion in order to evaluate and adjust the ongoing resuscitative needs of the patient and address potential complications. In this review, we address ongoing resuscitation {{in the intensive care unit}} along with potential complications in the trauma patient after initial resuscitation. Complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome, transfusion related patterns of acute lung injury and metabolic consequences subsequent to post-trauma resuscitation are presented. Methods A non-systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to May 2012. Results and conclusion Polytrauma patients with severe shock from hemorrhage and massive tissue <b>injury</b> <b>present</b> major challenges for management and resuscitation in the intensive care setting. Many of the current recommendations for “damage control resuscitation” including the use of fixed ratios in the treatment of trauma induced coagulopathy remain controversial.

Ongoing trials and improvements in monitoring and resuscitation technologies will further influence how we manage these complex and challenging patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGEs), {{the final}} {{products of the}} Maillard reaction, {{have been shown to}} impair endothelial proliferation and function, thus contributing to endothelial cell <b>injury</b> <b>present</b> in diabetes, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggered under hyperglycemic, hypoxic and oxidative conditions has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction through activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The present study investigates the role of AGEs in ER stress induction in human aortic endothelial cells exposed to variable AGE treatments. Methods: Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were treated with increasing concentrations (100, 200 μg/mL) of AGE-bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) at different time-points (24, 48, 72 h). The induction of ER stress and the involved UPR components were investigated on mRNA and protein levels. Apoptosis was quantitatively determined by flow cytometry detecting propidium iodide expression and annexin V binding simultaneously. Results: AGEs administration significantly reduced HAEC proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. An immediate induction of the ER chaperones GRP 78, GRP 94 and the transcriptional activator, XBP- 1 was observed at 24 h and 48 h. A later induction of the phospho-lF 2 α and proapoptotic transcription factor CHOP was observed at 48 h and 72 h, being correlated with elevated early apoptotic cell numbers at the same time-points. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that AGEs directly induce ER stress in human aortic endothelial cells, playing an important role in endothelial cell apoptosis. Targeting AGEs signaling pathways in order to alleviate ER stress may prove of therapeutic potential to endothelial dysfunction-related disorders...|$|E

In both patient groups there are clinical signs of altered nerve movement and increased nerve trunk mechanosensitivity. Previous studies of NSAP patients have identified altered median nerve movement at the wrist. The present study uses high frequency ultrasound imaging to examine changes to median nerve movement and clinical examination to assess altered mechanosensitivity of the median nerve. Longitudinal median nerve movement {{was measured in}} the forearm during maximal inspiration in nine post-whiplash patients with chronic neck and arm pain and eight controls subjects. Eight NSAP patients and seven controls were also studied. Transverse median nerve movement at the proximal carpal tunnel during 30 degrees wrist extension to 30 degrees flexion was also measured. A clinical examination of nerve trunk allodynia was performed in all subjects. Longitudinal nerve movement in the forearm was reduced by 71 % in the post-whiplash patients and by 68 % in NSAP patients compared to controls. In the whiplash patients the pattern of transverse median nerve movement at the proximal carpal tunnel was significantly different to controls (patient mean= 2. 57 +/- 0. 80 mm (SEM) in a radial direction; control mean= 0. 39 +/- 0. 52 mm in an ulnar direction). Signs of neural mechanosensitivity (i. e. painful responses to median nerve trunk and brachial plexus pressure and stretch) were apparent in both patients groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{assess the}} {{hypothesis}} that retinopathies are indicative of systemic microvascular injury. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The only U. S. national survey assessing microvascular hemorrhaging at two distinct anatomical sites was the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 1994). The systemic microvascular injury hypothesis was assessed by modeling the association of retinal and gingival hemorrhaging and the factors that explain this association. RESULTS — Individuals in whom one or more in five gingival sites was hemorrhaging had a 57 % increased odds for retinal hemorrhaging (95 % CI: 1. 26 – 1. 94). This association between retinal and gingival hemorrhaging was 51 % explained by A 1 C concentrations. Retinal and gingival hemorrhaging exhibited the signature J-shaped prevalence patterns when plotted {{as a function of}} A 1 C concentrations. CONCLUSIONS — Gingival hemorrhaging reflected on retinal hemorrhaging, and both shared chronic hyperglycemia as an explanatory marker. These epidemiological findings support {{the hypothesis that}} retinopathies are reflective of systemic microvascular injury. The retina was often considered the only tissue in which microangiopathic processes can be visualized and graded using simple noninvasive diagnostic tools. Studies reported that these retinal pathological conditions were predictive of systemic morbidities such as myocardial infarction, dementia, stroke, and kidney failure (1). As early as 1988, such findings have led to the hypothesis that retinal microvascular changes are reflective of systemic microvascular <b>injury</b> <b>present</b> in tissues ranging from the kidney to the heart (2). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether multiple microvascular pathological conditions can be linked epidemiologically and to explore factors explaining such co-occurrence...|$|E
40|$|A major {{advance in}} recent years has been the {{demonstration}} in children that most injuries of the spleen can safely be repaired. There is, however, a relative paucity of data regarding primary suture repair of the spleen in adults. This report describes experience with the treatment of 27 consecutive injuries of the spleen between 1978 - 1980. Splenorrhaphy was successful in 24 of 27 patients. Eighteen of the 24 patients were older than 15 years of age. Seven injuries resulted from penetrating trauma, 13 from blunt trauma, and four from injuries during operation. Repair included debridement, partial splenectomy, and primary suture repair, often in conjunction with Avitene®. There were no reoperations for bleeding or postoperative infection. Three splenectomies (11 %) were necessary because of either complete destruction of the splenic pulp, or separation of the spleen from its blood supply at the hilum. A separate question for decades has been the influence of types of drainage on infection following splenectomy. To study this question, between 1976 - 1978, 78 patients undergoing splenectomy were randomized prospectively by sealed envelopes into three groups. Group I—no drainage (23 patients); Group II—closed drainage with Jackson-Pratt drains (30 patients); Group III—open drainage with Penrose drains (25 patients). All but three drains were removed within 48 hours. In these three patients, the drains were removed after 96 hours. In the 53 patients in Group I and II, there were no infections. In Group III (Penrose drains) there were two complications: evisceration of a loop of small bowel through the drain site, and one subphrenic abscess in a patient with a concomitant colonic <b>injury.</b> <b>Present</b> experience does not show any significant difference among the three groups.

Azathioprine (Aza) and 6 -mercaptopurine (6 -MP) can cause liver injury, but no large series exist. Clinical and laboratory data and 6 -month outcomes of patients with thiopurine hepatotoxicity from the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network Prospective Study were analyzed. Twenty-two patients were identified, 12 due to Aza and 10 due to 6 -MP, with a median age of 55 years; the majority were female (68 %). Inflammatory bowel disease was the indication in 55 %, and the median thiopurine dose was 150 (range, 25 to 300) mg daily. The median latency to onset was 75 (range, 3 to 2584) days. Injury first arose after a dose escalation in 59 % of patients, the median latency after dose increase being 44 (range, 3 to 254) days. At onset, the median alanine aminotransferase level was 210 U/L, alkaline phosphatase was 151 U/L, and bilirubin was 7. 4 mg/dL (peak, 13. 4 mg/dL).
