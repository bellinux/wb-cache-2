These tanks contain many different oxidizable compounds covering {{a wide range of}} concentrations. The chemical hazards are a function of several interrelated factors, including the amount of energy (heat) produced, how fast it is produced, and the thermal absorption and heat transfer properties of the system. The reaction path(s) will determine the amount of energy produced and kinetics will determine the rate that it is produced. The tanks also contain many inorganic compounds inert to oxidation.

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Environmental Resources Engineering, 2013 Disposal {{costs of}} scrap tires have {{prompted}} researchers to investigate beneficial reuses for waste tires. One important application is use of tire chips as tire derived aggregate (TDA), {{which can be}} a substitute for rock aggregate in engineering applications. Properties of TDA were investigated through a series of experiments using type A TDA (maximum 8 -in. length), type B TDA (maximum 12 -in. length) and a 50 / 50 mixture of type A and type B TDA. Three areas of testing were completed on TDA, which included physical properties, substitution of rock aggregate with TDA in leach fields, and exothermic properties of TDA. A small and large magnitude dynamic vertical compression test was completed using tri-axial cylinders to measure the compressibility of TDA. Density, weight specific gravity, void ratio, and porosity were also calculated during experimental tests. During compression testing, TDA initially exhibited plastic compression under load, but after TDA was subjected to compressive loads it behaved like an elastic material. A constant-head permeameter, under loads up to 95 pounds per square inch, was used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of TDA. The hydraulic conductivity varied for all tests by TDA type (type A or B or a 50 / 50 mixture), applied pressure, and hydraulic gradient. Implications of substituting TDA for rock in leach fields were also investigated. Results indicated that TDA was a viable substitute for rock aggregate in septic systems with regards to wastewater treatment and durability. A leach field that contained TDA showed increased microbiological growth within the media and statistically significant effluent quality for eight constituents (of 84 tested constituents) when compared to a leach field containing rock aggregate that was under equivalent wastewater loading conditions. A thermal analysis of temperature changesover time was also completed using clean (did not have flammable liquids on the material) type A TDA in (1) a septic leach field, (2) a 20 ft. tall column of packed TDA, and (3) an underground earthen pit, where TDA was placed in the ground within 12 hours of manufacturing.

The presented approach will help to focus the experimental work to the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>reaction</b> scenarios with a better understanding of the reactive system chemistry. Computational methods are used to predict reaction stoichiometries, thermodynamics, and kinetics, which then are used to exclude thermodynamically infeasible and non-hazardous reaction pathways.

40|$|The present project {{deals with}} the {{improvement}} of the design of gas-liquid microreactors. The term microreactor characterizes devices composed of channels that have dimensions in the several tens to several hundreds of microns. Due to their increased surface to volume ratios these devices are a promising way to control fast and highly exothermic reactions, often employed in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical compounds. In the case of gas-liquid systems, these are for example direct fluorination, hydrogenation or oxidation reactions. Compared to conventional equipment microreactors offer the possibility to suppress hot spots and to operate <b>hazardous</b> <b>reaction</b> systems at increased reactant concentrations. Thereby selectivity may be increased and operating costs decreased. In this manner microreaction technology well fits in the challenges the chemical industry is continuously confronted to, which are amongst others the reduction of energy consumption and better feedstock utilization. The main topics which have to be considered with respect to the design of gasliquid μ-reactors are heat and mass transfer. In two phase systems both are strongly influenced {{by the nature of the}} flow and thus hydrodynamics play a central role. Consequently we focused our work on the hydrodynamics of the two-phase flow in microchannels and the description of the inter-linkage to gas-liquid mass transfer. In this context we were initially concerned with the topic of gas-liquid flow regimes and the main parameters prescribing flow pattern transitions. From a comparison of flow patterns with respect to their mass transfer capacity, as well as the flexibility offered with respect to operating conditions, the Taylor flow pattern appears to be the most promising flow characteristic for performing fast, highly exothermic and mass transfer limited reactions. This flow pattern is characterized by elongated bubbles surrounded by a liquid film and separated from each other by liquid slugs. In addition to the fact that this flow regime is accessible within a large range of gas and liquid flow rates, and has a relatively high specific interfacial area, Taylor flow features a recirculation motion within the liquid slugs, which is generally assumed to increase molecular transport between the gas-liquid interface and the bulk of the liquid phase. From a closer look on the local hydrodynamics of Taylor flow, including the fundamentals of bubble transport and the description of the recirculation flow within the liquid phase, it turned out that two-phase pressure drop and gas-liquid mass transfer are governed by the bubble velocity, bubble lengths and slug lengths. In the following step we have dealt with the prediction of these key hydrodynamic parameters. In this connection the first part of our experimental study was concerned with the investigation of the formation of bubbles and slugs and the characterization of the liquid phase velocity field in microchannels of rectangular cross-section. In addition we also addressed the phenomenon of film dewetting, which plays an important rôle concerning pressure drop and mass-transfer in Taylor flow. In the second part we focused on the prediction of gas-liquid mass transfer in Taylor flow. Measurements of the volumetric liquid side mass transfer coefficient (kLa-value) were conducted and the related two-phase flow was recorded. The measured bubble velocities, bubble lengths and slug lengths, as well as the findings previously obtained from the characterization of the velocity field were used to set-up a modified model for the prediction of kLa-values in μ-channels of rectangular cross-section. Describing the interaction of channel design hydrodynamics and mass transfer our work thus provides an important contribution towards the control of the operation of fast, highly exothermic and mass transfer limited gas-liquid reactions in microchannels. In addition it enabled us to identify gaps of knowledge, whose investigation should be items of further research...|$|R

Nitriles {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important classes of organic compounds used as intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds and pharmaceutical substances.

Alternatively, amines can directly be oxidized to nitriles by the use of transition metal catalysis.

While only arylsilanes can be polymerized by this route, the resulting oligophenylsilane can be functionalized by free radical hydrosilation of olefins, carbonyls and imines. Substitution along the polysilane backbone with sol-gel precursors should generate soluble functionalized polymer and ought to yield, after sol-gel polymerization, materials where the chromophore is entrained within a relatively inert siloxane matrix, an attractive strategy for utilizing polysilanes under thermally demanding or photooxidative conditions. Here the authors describe the extension of this approach to include (alkoxysilyl) propyl functionalities as latent sol-gel polymerizable residues, and the preparation of {{a new class of}} hybrid organic-inorganic polysilane-siloxane materials, derived from the sol-gel polymerization of functionalized polysilanes 2 a-c...|$|R
40|$|The Larsen group {{focuses on}} {{accessing}} small molecules through one-step multi-component coupling reactions from inexpensive starting materials and a catalyst source. To this end, {{we have developed}} a solvent-free catalytic method to access various substituted 2 -(2 '-pyridyl) quinoline compounds in one step directly from inexpensive and commercially available materials. Purification is simple and is accomplished {{with the use of}} a short basic alumina plug and diethyl ether as the eluent. Current published methods to access these targets are plagued with lengthy multi-step <b>reactions,</b> <b>hazardous</b> reagents, and/or the wasteful use of solvents and other materials for purification purposes. In vitro studies of two substituted 2 -(2 '-pyridyl) quinoline compounds revealed cytotoxic activities in the A 549 lung cancer cell line. In addition to the synthesis of various bidentate substituted 2 -(2 '-pyridyl) quinoline ligands, the neutral 5 -coordinate gold(III) complexes of 6 -phenyl- 2 -(2 '-pyridyl) quinolines substituted at position 6 of the quinoline ring with fluorine, methyl, methoxy, and phenyl groups were also achieved. The x-ray crystallographic data revealed that the neutral complexes have distorted square pyramidal geometries. Furthermore, the cationic gold(III) complex of a 6 -phenyl- 2 -(2 '-pyridyl) quinoline with a methoxy moiety at position 6 of the quinoline ring was also synthesized with a tetrafluoroborate counter anion. The x-ray structure of this cationic complex revealed its distorted square planar geometry...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{interest}} in environmental forms of trace evidence, and ecological trace evidence collected from footwear has proved valuable within casework. Simultaneously, there has been growing awareness of the need for empirical experimentation to underpin forensic inferences. Diatoms are unicellular algae, and each cell (or ‘frustule’) consists of two valves which are made of silica, a robust material that favours their preservation both in sediments and within forensic scenarios. A series of experiments were carried out to investigate the transfer and persistence of diatoms upon common footwear materials, a recipient surface that has historically been overlooked by studies of persistence. The effectiveness of two novel extraction techniques (jet rinsing, and heating and agitation with distilled water) was compared to the established extraction technique of hydrogen peroxide digestion, for a suite of five common footwear materials: canvas, leather, and ‘suede’ (representing upper materials), and rubber and polyurethane (representing sole materials). It was observed that the novel extraction technique of heating and agitation with distilled water did not extract fewer diatom valves, or cause increased fragmentation of valves, when compared to peroxide digestion, suggesting that the method may be viable where potentially <b>hazardous</b> chemical <b>reactions</b> may be encountered with the peroxide digestion method. Valves could be extracted from all five footwear materials after 3 min of immersion, and more valves were extracted from the rougher, woven upper materials than the smoother sole materials. Canvas yielded the most valves (a mean of 2511 /cm 2) and polyurethane the fewest (a mean of 15 /cm 2). The persistence of diatoms on the three upper materials was addressed with a preliminary pilot investigation, with ten intervals sampled between 0 and 168 h. Valves were seen to persist in detectable quantities after 168 h on all three upper materials. However, some samples produced slides with no valves, and the earliest time after which no diatom valves were found was 4 h after the transfer. Analysis of the particle size distributions over time, by image analysis, suggests that the retention of diatoms may be size-selective; after 168 h, no particles larger than 200 μm 2 could be found on the samples of canvas, and > 95...|$|R
