30|$|A new {{numerical}} algorithm for {{the analysis}} of single line to ground arc faults is presented [21] and a genetic algorithm is proposed to estimate the fault-related wiring parameters such as <b>intermittent</b> <b>arc</b> location and average <b>intermittent</b> <b>arc</b> resistance [22]. However, in wind farms the harmonics can be easily polluted by those from wind power back-to-back converters. The harmonic based algorithms and the above algorithms often have poor performance in wind farms because the harmonic proportion of fault current is relatively lower. The harmonic based algorithms may have difficulty to detect HIFs in wind farms.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to study surges in the 10 kV cable {{distribution}} network in the presence (occurrence) of the <b>intermittent</b> <b>arc,</b> which could lead to significant damages in the network, including the failure of distribution transformers. Surge analysis is performed for single-phase to ground faults in the network. Surges’ levels in the 10 kV distribution network were determined for single-phase-to-ground faults and for HV winding inter-turn fault in the 10 / 0, 4 kV distribution transformer. It is shown, that the maximum surge values are determined mainly by the functioning of installed surge arresters and are not directly related to the presence of the arc elimination reactor, which acts mainly as the current limiter in the place of short-circuit and only smoothes high-frequency oscillations. The elaborated model may be used for analyses of surges in the cable network, caused by short circuits via (due to) the <b>intermittent</b> <b>arc...</b>|$|E

Rocks exposed {{west of the}} Coast Plutonic Complex in {{southern}} southeast Alaska form an imbricate thrust belt that overprints the tectonic boundary {{between two of the}} largest allochthonous crustal fragments in the North American Cordillera, the Insular and Intermontane composite terranes. In the Alexander terrane (Insular composite terrane), lower Paleozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (Descon Formation) and dioritic plutons are unconformably overlain by Lower Devonian clastic strata (Karheen Formation). These rocks are overlain locally by Upper Triassic basalt, rhyolite and marine clastic strata (Hyd Group).

40|$|The Palaeozoic to Mesozoic igneous and {{metamorphic}} basement rocks {{exposed in}} the Mérida Andes of Venezuela and the Santander Massif of Colombia are {{generally considered to}} define allochthonous terranes that accreted to the margin of Gondwana during the Ordovician and the Carboniferous. However, terrane sutures have not been identified {{and there are no}} published isotopic data that support the existence of separate crustal domains. A general paucity of geochronological data led to published tectonic reconstructions for the evolution of the north- western corner of Gondwana that do not account for the magmatic and metamorphic histories of the basement rocks of the Mérida Andes and the Santander Massif. We present new zircon U–Pb (ICP-MS) data from 52 igneous and metamorphic rocks, which we combine with whole rock geochemical and Pb isotopic data to constrain the tectonic history of the Precambrian to Mesozoic basement of the Mérida Andes and the Santander Massif. These data show that the basement rocks of these massifs are autochthonous to Gondwana and share a similar tectono- magmatic history with the Gondwanan margin of Peru, Chile and Argentina, which evolved during the subduc- tion of oceanic lithosphere of the Iapetus Ocean. The oldest Palaeozoic arc magmatism is recorded at ~ 500 Ma, and was followed shortly by Barrovian metamorphism. Peak metamorphic conditions at upper amphibolite facies are recorded by anatexis at ~ 477 Ma and the intrusion of synkinematic granitoids until ~ 472 Ma. Subsequent retrogression resulted from localised back-arc or intra-arc extension at ~ 453 Ma, when volcanic tuffs and interfingered sedimentary rocks were deposited over the amphibolite facies basement. Continental arc magmatism dwindled after ~ 430 Ma and terminated at ~ 415 Ma, coevally with most of the western margin of Gondwana. After Pangaea amalgamation in the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian, a magmatic arc developed on its western margin at ~ 294 Ma as a result of subduction of oceanic crust of the palaeo-Pacific ocean. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>arc</b> magmatism recorded between ~ 294 and ~ 225 Ma was followed by the onset of the Andean subduction cycle at ~ 213 Ma, in an extensional regime. Extension was accompanied by slab roll-back which led to the migration of the arc axis into the Central Cordillera of Colombia in the Early Jurassic...|$|E

In the Alexander terrane (Insular composite terrane), lower Paleozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (Descon Formation) and dioritic plutons are unconformably overlain by Lower Devonian clastic strata (Karheen Formation). These rocks are overlain locally by Upper Triassic basalt, rhyolite and marine clastic strata (Hyd Group). Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous metavolcanic and metasedimentary strata of the Gravina sequence unconformably overlie the Alexander terrane. The Gravina sequence forms a structural package over 15 km thick and records <b>intermittent</b> <b>arc</b> volcanism along {{the eastern edge of the}} Alexander terrane. The Gravina sequence is structurally overlain by upper Paleozoic and lower Mesozoic metamorphosed basaltic strata, marble, and argillite (Alava sequence), and locally by lower Paleozoic supracrustal rocks and orthogneiss (Kah Shakes sequence). Together, these constitute the Taku terrane which we correlate with the Intermontane composite terrane. Local unconformity of Gravina sequence strata over the Alava sequence demonstrates that the Gravina sequence overlapped an earlier structural boundary between the Intermontane and Insular composite terranes. The rocks were deformed in the mid-Cretaceous by west-vergent thrusting that was was broadly coeval with arc magmatism. Deformation involved emplacement of west-directed thrust nappes over the structurally intact and relatively unmetamorphosed Alexander terrane basement. Mid-Cretaceous tonalite, granodiorite, and quartz diorite intrude rocks of the thrust belt and are locally affected by the deformation. Mid-Cretaceous deformation occurred during two episodes that were contemporaneous with the emplacement of large sill-like plutons. Older structures record ductile southwest-vergent folding and faulting, regional metamorphism, and development of axial-planar foliation. The second-generation structures developed during the later stages of southwest-directed thrust faulting, which juxtaposed rocks of contrasting metamorphic pressures and temperatures. Structural, stratigraphic, and geochronologic data indicate that the two phases of regional thrusting in southeast Alaska occurred between 113 Ma and 89 Ma. Rocks in the western part of the thrust belt were uplifted regionally by 70 Ma. Deformation involved the collapse of a marginal basin(s) and a magmatic arc, and overprinted the older tectonic boundary between the Insular composite terrane and the late Mesozoic western margin of North America (at that time the Intermontane composite terrane). Contractional deformation along the length of the thrust belt was broadly coeval with arc magmatism, and thus records intra-arc tectonism. Late Paleocene to early Eocene igneous activity and extensional (?) deformation subsequently affected the thrust belt...|$|E
40|$|The mid-Cretaceous Winton Formation {{is one of}} Australia's most {{important}} sources of Mesozoic terrestrial fossils. In recent years it has produced some of the continent's most significant body and trace fossil records of mid-Cretaceous dinosaurian and crocodilian assemblages. Additionally, the Winton Formation preserves a diverse assemblage of lungfish and primitive ray-finned fish, aquatic lizards, turtles, numerous invertebrates along with a high diversity of plant macrofossils, {{including some of the}} world's earliest flowering plants. The Winton Formation is exposed over large portions of remote central-western Queensland, in addition to northern New South Wales, north-western South Australia and the south-western corner of the Northern Territory. Despite its importance for our understanding of Australian terrestrial environments during {{the latter part of the}} Mesozoic, very little in the way of detailed geological work has been carried out on the Winton Formation. As a consequence, palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological conditions associated with many of Australia's key dinosaur faunas are poorly understood. A greater understanding of the stratigraphy, sedimentology, age, and taphonomy of these sites will provide critical context for evaluating Australia's late-Mesozoic vertebrate taxa to other well-known Gondwanan faunas. This study utilizes detrital zircon geochronology and Lu-Hf isotope analysis to constrain the depositional age, tectonic setting, basin evolution, and stratigraphic context of the Winton Formation, northeastern Australia. A number of geological studies in the past several decades have focused on U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology for maximum depositional age; however, this approach is still underutilized in palaeontology. Thus, these ten samples, which were composed of 100 grain detrital zircon samples from different stratigraphic levels and key fossil locations throughout the Winton and underlying units (basin wide) were analyzed. Detrital zircon ages were obtained via U-Pb LA-ICPMS geochronology and the resulting U-Pb grain ages were subjected to various metrics to interpret maximum depositional age and sedimentary provenance. The results of this work considerably improve upon existing palynological age constraints, suggesting that there are two distinctly different aged faunas: one that is likely 100 - 98 Ma (Isisford Fauna); and one that is no older than earliest Turonian or latest Cenomanian (92 - 94 Ma), which includes most other Winton vertebrates (Lark/Bladensburg Fauna). The most abundant detrital zircon age population clusters between 92 - 115 Ma, suggesting that much of the volcanic-rich sediment that characterizes the Winton Formation was eroded syndepositionally or shortly after emplacement of an active continental volcanic arc system located along the eastern margin of Australia (presumably the Whitsunday Volcanic Province). This volcanic arc activity was not a singular event; rather I have identified near-continuous detrital zircon grain ages between 92 - 330 Ma, indicating <b>intermittent</b> <b>arc</b> volcanism along that eastern margin due to continuous slab subduction of the Phoenix/Pacific Plate under the eastward migrating Gondwana margin. A particularly interesting result is the identification of Jurassic-age grain populations that represent a period not previously associated with significant arc magmatism in northeastern Queensland. The identification of fairly continuous detrital zircon ages is compared with established terranes including the New England Province via Lu-Hf isotopes and found to be of similar isotopic signatures. By combining U-Pb detrital zircon ages and ƐHf values, I interpret that these sediments were derived from a mixed juvenile magma source associated with a fairly long-lived tectonic system (300 - 92 Ma) on the east coast of northern Australia. In addition to this, multiple populations have been identified from other, older easterly sources (330 - 900 Ma) including but not limited to the Macrossan, Anakie, Cape River, Greenvale and Georgetown Provinces. Small populations of apparently recycled Proterozoic and Archean grains are also variably present in each of the samples. By coupling the above results with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and paleocurrent data, this study provides compelling evidence for sediment input into the Winton Formation from a long-lived continuous subduction margin along the eastern margin of Australia. Eroded materials from this region were transported via transverse fluvial systems westward into the Eromanga Basin and form the principal provenance source for all Winton sandstones investigated in this study. In addition to understanding provenance patterns and refining the age of the Winton Formation, the other primary objective of this thesis was to place the important Winton flora and fauna into a refined palaeoenvironmental context. In order to achieve this, detailed facies and architectural element analysis of both the Winton and the top of the underling Mackunda Formation was conducted and a basin model was developed. Based on a combination of field and core investigation, 23 distinct lithofacies were identified, and these were used to construct nine distinct facies assemblages. The Winton Formation can be informally separated into an upper and lower unit respective of gross changes in depositional patterns, alluvial architecture, and fauna, and confirmed by distinct maximum depositional age constraining zircon populations and a newly constructed basin model. Environmentally, the lower Winton formation preserves the last vestiges of the shallow marine conditions in the Eromanga Basin, and an up section transition from coastal and tidally influenced deltaic strata to alluvial strata. The upper Winton Formation preserves mature floodplain strata, dominantd by a series of stacked channel sandstones with west- to southwest- oriented paleocurrent indicators...|$|E
