This was one of the factors that led to its selection for the attempt on the world rail speed record in July of that year.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Diagram of a {{locomotive}} <b>blast</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>Blast</b> <b>Pipe</b> (a) directs exhaust steam into the smokebox (b). The steam entrains {{the smoke from}} the firebox (c), creating more draft which helps speed the smoke out the chimney (d).|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} Adams' Vortex <b>blast</b> <b>pipes.</b> These had an outer annular orifice for steam and an inner circular opening for exhaust gases and formed the upper {{portion of a}} bell-mouth scoop. The lower portion of the scoop was open towards the bottom rows of tubes so that the draught though them was increased. The vortex <b>blast</b> <b>pipes</b> were, however, removed {{after a few years}} since it was found to choke up more readily than an ordinary <b>blast</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{common with}} most Maunsell designs, the Q class {{locomotives}} were reliable, {{but there were}} complaints of poor steaming when used on main-line trains (for which they were never designed). In 1940 Bulleid fitted {{one member of the}} class with a Lemaître <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> in an attempt to improve their efficiency. This proved to be successful and the remainder of the class were so fitted between 1946 and 1949. During the 1950s further experiments were carried out by the fitting of a British Railways Standard Class 4 plain <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> and small stovepipe chimney to no. 30549 in 1955, resulting in further improvements in both steaming and fuel consumption; in 1958–61, six more received the same <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> with a BR Standard Class 4 chimney.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological {{specimens}} {{found at}} the site include stove walls used for iron reduction, <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> fragments, pottery shards, and slag heaps.|$|R
25|$|The pistons and valves on the {{earliest}} locomotives were lubricated by the enginemen dropping {{a lump of}} tallow down the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 45 <b>Blast</b> <b>pipe</b> [...] - [...] Directs {{exhaust steam}} up the chimney, {{creating}} a draught that draws air through {{the fire and}} along the boiler tubes.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhaust steam}} {{from the rear}} engine unit was {{conveyed}} to the smokebox through a pipe arranged on the left-hand side of the engine {{on the outside of}} the main boiler frame. In line with the left-hand side of the smokebox, it then passed through the frame and into the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe.</b> The exhaust steam from the front engine unit passed through a pipe connected directly to the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe,</b> which had two distinct orifices. The two engine units were virtually identical and could be interchanged by a slight alteration in the arrangement of their steam pipes.|$|R
50|$|The spark arresters {{were made}} from {{perforated}} plate, arranged in V-shape and attached to movable wings which were hinged to the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> {{so that they could}} be moved aside when the tubes were being cleaned.|$|R
50|$|Exhaust steam was {{extracted}} from the steam chest and fed through a 100 mm diameter pipe under the locomotive to the tender. There the steam was fed directly into the feedwater, which thus heated up to boiling point. The remaining steam was allowed to escape to atmosphere through a second chimney on the tender. The quantity of steam could be regulated using a cock on the tender. The Rohrbeck system differed in detail from the Kirchweger condenser. Here steam was removed at the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> and led away {{along the top of}} the boiler. It was regulated by a throttle valve on the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 13 December 2013, <b>double</b> <b>blasts</b> in {{the northeastern}} town of Wajir killed one {{individual}} and wounded {{at least three other}} people.|$|R
50|$|In the smokebox, it was {{necessary}} to provide a clearing chute beneath the smokebox where the flue joined the casing, to prevent it from becoming clogged with cinders. Just forward of the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe,</b> another chute was installed to clear cinders from the smokebox.|$|R
25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a mechanical stoker, and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating brake gear on the tender, power-operated reversing gear, American-style bar frame construction, thermic siphons, and duplex <b>blast</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{hot blast}} stoves were troublesome, as thermal {{expansion}} and contraction could cause breakage of pipes. This was somewhat remedied by supporting the pipes on rollers. It was also necessary to devise new methods of connecting the <b>blast</b> <b>pipes</b> to the tuyeres, as leather could not longer be used.|$|R
50|$|A sequel was released, called Nerf N-Strike Elite. The game {{comes with}} a red reveal accessory. Both games were {{compiled}} in the 2010 release Nerf N-Strike <b>Double</b> <b>Blast</b> Bundle.|$|R
50|$|The NCB {{continued}} to use Austerities in the 1970s and a small number remained in service until the early 1980s, notably at Bickershaw Colliery, Greater Manchester. Some of the examples that survived the longest were those fitted with mechanical stokers and Kylpor <b>blast</b> <b>pipes</b> or Giesl ejectors to improve their performance and reduce smoke.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> had {{separate}} {{outlets for}} the exhaust steam from each engine unit, with the rear engine unit's exhaust feeding through an annulus arranged around the exhaust {{from the front}} engine unit. A device was installed by which either engine unit could be cut out whilst running so that steam could be admitted to one pair of cylinders only when running light engine.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, G.I. Joe {{issued a}} 12" [...] Roadblock action {{figure for the}} 1992 Hall of Fame series that brought back the 12" [...] G.I. Joe action figures. After that, G.I. Joe issued two other {{versions}} of the 12" [...] Roadblock. Roadblock's head is bald and the face has a mustache. Some versions have a small goatee on the chin. An action figure called <b>Double</b> <b>Blast</b> used one of the Roadblock molds causing fear in fans that Hasbro lost the rights to Roadblock's name. Interestingly enough, Hasbro released a figure named Roadblock with <b>Double</b> <b>Blast's</b> information and real name on the filecard. All other versions of Roadblock have been remakes of the original.|$|R
5000|$|A {{locomotive}} boiler {{has three}} main components: a double-walled firebox; a horizontal, cylindrical [...] "boiler barrel" [...] containing {{a large number}} of small flue-tubes; and a smokebox with chimney, for the exhaust gases. The boiler barrel contains larger flue-tubes to carry the superheater elements, where present. Forced draught is provided in the locomotive boiler by injecting exhausted steam back into the exhaust via a <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> in the smokebox.|$|R
5000|$|The boilers were a {{conventional}} type with round-topped firebox and a working pressure of [...] The boiler barrel was 4 ft in diameter, 13 ft long between the tubeplates, {{and there were}} 198 brass boiler tubes, 2 in in diameter. The smokebox extended well forward of the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> and chimney, to provide space for a spark arrestor, and baffle plates that were the forerunners of the self-cleaning smokebox.|$|R
50|$|As built, the {{locomotives}} {{were not}} successful, {{with the result}} that they were staged for some time while the Mechanical Engineer of the Durban workshops, G. Ramsay, carried out experiments with the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> arrangement. After successful modification, their steaming capacity was improved {{to the extent that they}} could be placed in service. Like the earlier Modified Fairlies they proved to be powerful locomotives, but they were less successful than their Garratt equivalent.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the stack}} of a {{locomotive}} is too short to provide natural draft, during normal running forced draft is achieved by directing the exhaust steam from the cylinders through a cone (“blast pipe”) upwards and into a skirt {{at the bottom of}} the stack. When the locomotive is stationary or in a restricted space “live” steam from the boiler is directed through an annular ring surrounding the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> to produce the same effect.|$|R
50|$|A Giesl ejector is a suction draught {{system for}} steam {{locomotives}} that {{works on the}} same principle as a feedwater pump. This ejector (German: Ejektor, Flachschornstein or Quetschesse) was invented in 1951 by the Austrian engineer, Dr. Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen. The Giesl ejector ensures improved suction draught and a correspondingly better use of energy. The existing blastpipe in a locomotive is replaced by several, small, fan-shaped, diverging <b>blast</b> <b>pipes,</b> from which the diffuser gets its flat, long, drawn-out shape.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{improvements}} and optimisations {{were carried out}} on the new designs. For example, in the boiler, the heating areas and tube cross-sections were more carefully matched to one another to make best use of heat generation. At {{the same time the}} flow of smoke gases was optimised by the superheater tube system to minimise suction draught. The low position of the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> in the larger smokebox {{at the front of the}} boiler is the least visible feature of the Einheitslokomotiven.|$|R
2500|$|Rocket uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous {{locomotive}} boilers {{consisted of}} a single pipe surrounded by water (though the Lancashire Witch did have twin flues). Rocket has 25 copper fire-tubes that carry the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> and chimney. [...] This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with boiler water when compared to a single large flue. Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.|$|R
50|$|A {{successful}} smokebox innovation on the 8th Class locomotive was {{the installation}} of a petticoat pipe, suspended {{from the top of}} the smokebox below the base of the chimney with its bell-shaped bottom end above the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe.</b> Its function was to enhance and equalise the draught through the boiler tubes. The petticoat pipe was new to South Africa. Previously, locomotive builders relied on the length of the chimney to enhance draught, but as boiler sizes increased and chimneys became shorter to remain within loading gauge limitations, the petticoat pipe became vital.|$|R
50|$|The boiler {{capacity}} was not {{increased to}} compensate for the additional cylinders and, in service, trouble was experienced under working conditions. Tests showed that the locomotives could not maintain steam and had insufficient adhesive weight to prevent slipping on the steep gradient. The boiler had to generate the supply of steam while the engine passed through the tunnel {{at the head of the}} incline with the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> not functioning, since the exhaust steam was diverted to the side tanks while the counter-pressure air brake system was in operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{carrying}} axle {{was in the}} form of an Adams axle. The rear cylinders were the high-pressure cylinders, which drew all of their steam directly from the centrally located steam dome. The front cylinders were fed with the exhaust steam of the high-pressure cylinders. Steam was supplied to the cylinders by fixed pipes, the ball joint of which was located in the pivot. The exhaust steam was led to the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> via an articulated exhaust pipe fitted with stuffing boxes. To start the locomotive, the low-pressure cylinders could be supplied with low-pressure steam.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve the {{steaming}} properties of further orders of Class 16DA locomotives, A.G. Watson, who had succeeded Colonel Collins as CME in 1929, designed a boiler of the Wootten type. It had a very wide firebox with a grate area of 60 ft2 m2. Watson was {{a firm believer in}} large firegrates with enlarged <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> caps to give a reasonably low burning rate of fuel per unit of grate area, which improved boiler efficiency and reduced the emission of sparks and partially burnt fuel.|$|R

5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a <b>blast</b> <b>pipe,</b> made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|R
500|$|All {{seven of}} the Billinton L Class {{locomotives}} entered Eastleigh works in 1934 for rebuilding, each leaving the works the same year. Conversion into the 4-6-0 tender type, entailed removing the trailing bogie, water tanks, and bunker, shortening the mainframes [...] and fitting new cabs; these were of the side-window variety already used on the Lord Nelson class. At {{the same time there}} was a revision of the locomotives' front end arrangement incorporating a [...] "King Arthur" [...] N15 type of <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> and chimney; boiler pressure was increased to , whilst the piston diameter was marginally decreased from [...] to [...]|$|R
40|$|There is a {{trend for}} small {{satellites}} to be brought into Low Earth Orbit. The current way of using expendable launchers for transport is associated with several drawbacks, such as high cost, considerable risks and environmental pollution.

The key issue of this future launch device is a very long evacuated tube called “Space Blast Pipe” (SBP). This paper intro-duces the basic idea of the Space <b>Blast</b> <b>Pipe,</b> shows initial technical solutions and gives elementary performance calculations. The limits concerning the feasibility aspect are discussed...|$|R
