5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as {{the importance of the}} <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money,</b> but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not work under rational expectations. Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} much of {{monetary}} policy {{was influenced by}} an economic theory known as monetarism. Monetarism is an economic theory which argues that management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating economic activity. The stability of the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> prior to the 1980s was a key finding of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz supported {{by the work of}} David Laidler, and many others. The nature of the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> changed during the 1980s owing to technical, institutional, and legal factors and the influence of monetarism has since decreased.|$|E

25|$|The {{monetary}} explanation has two weaknesses. First it is {{not able}} to explain why the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31. Second {{it is not}} able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the Money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations.|$|E
25|$|Economics is {{a social}} science which studies the production, distribution, trade, and {{consumption}} of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers {{the economy as a}} whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money,</b> capital and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} inflation in an economy with commodity money and supports it by evidence from the inflationary episodes in France during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The paper shows that commodity money can be inflated similarly to fiat money through repeated debasements, which act like devaluation. Furthermore, as with fiat <b>money,</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> commodity <b>money</b> falls with inflation. Unlike fiat money, at high rates of inflation the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> commodity <b>money</b> becomes insensitive to inflation, since commodity money has intrinsic value in addition to transactions, and thus losses from inflation are bounded. Finally, we show that an anticipated stabilization reduces the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> commodity <b>money,</b> which is opposite {{to the effect of}} an anticipated standard stabilization on the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> fiat <b>money.</b> All the results of the model are supported by the data.

25|$|In both {{classical}} and Keynesian economics, the money market is analyzed as a supply-and-demand system with interest rates being the price. The money supply {{may be a}} vertical supply curve, if the central bank of a country chooses to use monetary policy to fix its value regardless of the interest rate; {{in this case the}} money supply is totally inelastic. On the other hand, the money supply curve is a horizontal line if the central bank is targeting a fixed interest rate and ignoring the value of the money supply; in this case the money supply curve is perfectly elastic. The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> intersects with the money supply to determine the interest rate.|$|E

The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages changes into the town of New Ilmorog.

Munira goes to see her to attempt to rekindle their romance, but is met with only a <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money.</b> He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present the downtrodden but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel, and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, he pours petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill to watch it burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire.

500|$|Friedman {{developed}} his own quantity {{theory of money}} that referred to Irving Fisher's but inherited much from Keynes. Friedman's 1956 [...] "The Quantity Theory of Money: A Restatement" [...] incorporated Keynes's <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> and liquidity preference into an equation similar to the classical equation of exchange. Friedman's updated quantity theory also allowed {{for the possibility of}} using monetary or fiscal policy to remedy a major downturn. Friedman broke with Keynes by arguing that money demand is relatively stable—even during a downturn. Monetarists argued that [...] "fine-tuning" [...] through fiscal and monetary policy is counterproductive. They found money demand to be stable even during fiscal policy shifts, and both fiscal and monetary policies suffer from lags that made them too slow to prevent mild downturns.|$|E
500|$|The {{extensive}} {{reliance on}} the money-printing press to finance the war {{contributed significantly to the}} high inflation the South experienced {{over the course of the}} war, although fiscal matters and negative war news also played a role. Estimates of the extent of inflation vary by source, method used, estimation technique, and definition of the aggregate price level. According to a classic study by Eugene Lerner in 1956, a standard price index of commodities rose from 100 at the beginning of the war to more than 9200 by the war's de facto end in April 1865. By October 1864, the price index was at 2800, which implies that a very large portion of the rise in prices occurred in the last six months of the war. This drop in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money,</b> the corresponding increase in [...] "velocity of money" [...] (see next paragraph) and the resulting rapid increase in the price level has been attributed to the loss of confidence in Southern military victory or the success of the South's bid for independence.|$|E
500|$|In 1937 John Hicks {{published}} an article that incorporated Keynes's thought into a general equilibrium framework where the markets for goods and money met in an overall equilibrium. Hick's IS/LM (Investment-Savings/Liquidity preference-Money supply) model {{became the basis for}} decades of theorizing and policy analysis into the 1960s. The model represents the goods market with the IS curve, a set of points representing equilibrium in investment and savings. The money market equilibrium is represented with the LM curve, a set of points representing the equilibrium in supply and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>money.</b> The intersection of the curves identifies an aggregate equilibrium in the economy where there are unique equilibrium values for interest rates and economic output. The IS/LM model focused on interest rates as the [...] "monetary transmission mechanism," [...] the channel through which money supply affects real variables like aggregate demand and employment. A decrease in money supply would lead to higher interest rates, which reduce investment and thereby lower output throughout the economy. Other economists built on the IS/LM framework. Notably, in 1944, Franco Modigliani added a labor market. Modigliani's model represented the economy as a system with general equilibrium across the interconnected markets for labor, finance, and goods, and it explained unemployment with rigid nominal wages.|$|E

Burgevine was an unsavory character known for his greed and for being an alcoholic. Moreover, Burgevine made little effort to hide his racism, and his relations with the Chinese were very difficult at the best of times. Li Hongzhang, the governor of the Jiangsu province, requested Staveley to appoint a British officer to command the contingent. Staveley selected Gordon, who had been made a brevet major in December 1862 and the nomination was approved by the British government. Given Burgevine's alcoholism, open corruption, and a tendency to engage in acts of mindless violence when drunk, the Chinese wanted [...] "a man of good temper, of clean hands and a steady economist" [...] as his replacement. These requirements led Staveley to choose Gordon. Li was impressed with Gordon, writing:It is a direct blessing from Heaven, the coming of this British Gordon. ... He is superior in manner and bearing to any of the foreigners whom I have come into contact with, and does not show outwardly that conceit which makes most of them repugnant in my sight...What an elixir for a heavy heart-to see this splendid Englishman fight! ...

Gordon was honest and incorruptible, and unlike many Chinese officers, did not steal the money that was meant to pay his men, but rather insisted on paying the Ever Victorious Army on time and in full. Gordon's insistence on paying his men meant that he always pressing the Imperial government for money, something which often irritated the mandarins who did not understand why Gordon did not just let his men loot and plunder as a compensation for wages. Gordon designed the uniform for the Ever Victorious Army, which consisted of black boots together with turbans, jackets and trousers that were all green while his personal bodyguard of 300 men wore blue uniforms.|$|E
