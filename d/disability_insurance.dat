25|$|One of {{the most}} common reasons for {{disability}} is on-the-job injury, which explains why the second largest form of <b>disability</b> <b>insurance</b> is that provided by employers to cover their employees.

The states which currently fund <b>disability</b> <b>insurance</b> programs are California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{the single}} most important form of <b>disability</b> <b>insurance</b> is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the UK's version is part of National Insurance; the U.S.'s version is Social Security (SS)—specifically, several parts of SS including Social Security <b>Disability</b> <b>Insurance</b> (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These programs provide a floor beneath all other <b>disability</b> <b>insurance.</b> In other words, they are the safety net that catches everyone who was otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory of the benefit formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.|$|E

30|$|The {{evidence}} {{reviewed in}} the present paper – showing that joblessness not only produces long-term unemployment, but also <b>disability</b> <b>insurances</b> recipients – clearly implies that the hysteresis problem {{may be even more}} serious than indicated by ratcheting unemployment rates. If human capital deteriorates during long-term idleness, a sufficient level of activation may not only be required to discourage social insurance dependency and encourage self-sufficiency “today”, but also to prevent the number of disability claimants from rising in the future.|$|R

25|$|The old age pension program, {{insurance}} equally {{financed by}} employers and workers, {{was designed to}} provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70. Unlike the accident and sickness insurance programs, this program covered all categories of workers (industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants) from the start. Also, unlike the other two programs, the principle that the national government should contribute a portion of the underwriting cost, with the other two portions prorated accordingly, was accepted without question. The <b>disability</b> <b>insurance</b> program was intended to be used by those permanently disabled. This time, the state or province supervised the programs directly.|$|E

40|$|Self-reported {{health status}} {{measures}} are generally used to analyse Social Security <b>Disability</b> <b>Insurance's</b> (SSDI) application and award decisions {{as well as}} the relationship between its generosity and labour force participation. Due to endogeneity and measurement error, the use of self-reported health and disability indicators as explanatory variables in economic models is problematic. We employ county-level aggregate data, instrumental variables and spatial econometric techniques to analyse the determinants of variation in SSDI rates and explicitly account for the endogeneity and measurement error of the self-reported disability measure. Two surprising results are found. First, it is shown that measurement error is the dominating source of the bias and that the main source of measurement error is sampling error. Second, results suggest that there may be synergies for applying for SSDI when the disabled population is larger. ...|$|R
