5|$|Early COBOL compilers were {{primitive}} and slow. A 1962 US Navy evaluation found compilation speeds of 3–11 statements per minute. By mid-1964, they had increased to 11–1000 statements per minute. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> increasing memory would drastically increase speed and that compilation costs varied wildly: costs per statement were between $0.23 and $18.91.|$|E
5|$|In nature, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>{{observed}}</b> <b>that</b> males would venture {{away from}} the nest {{in order to attract}} females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, males were attracted to other male scents.|$|E

5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} {{the motions of}} Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side}} of the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> {{immediately}} after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (or lack thereof) {{was being}} pursued in paleontology, {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|E

5|$|As at the , the {{resident}} population was 360 {{people and the}} number of tourists was not allowed to exceed 400. Early settlers were European and American whalers and many of their offspring have remained on the island for more than six generations. Residents are now involved with the kentia palm industry, tourism, retail, some fishing and farming. In 1876 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> on Sundays although there was a suspension of games and labour, there were no religious services. Nowadays, in an area known locally as Church Paddock, there are Anglican, Catholic and Adventist churches, the religious affiliations on the island being 30% Anglican, 22% no religion, 18% Catholic and 12% Seventh Day Adventist. There is about an equal division of the sexes with 47% of the population in the age group 25–54 and 92% holding Australian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the Columbidae {{tend to have}} short legs, short {{bills with}} a fleshy cere, and small heads on large, compact bodies. In a series of {{experiments}} in 1975 by Dr.Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown {{to be due to}} their natural desire to keep their vision constant. It was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr.Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant. The wings are large, and have eleven primary feathers, and low wing loading; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles comprise 31–44% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds. They are also highly manoeuvrable in flight.|$|E

5|$|Two villages {{situated}} on the southern boundary were shifted to the Firozpur–Manpur area {{situated on}} Ramnagar–Kashipur highway during 1990–93; the vacated areas were designated as buffer zones. The families in these villages were mostly dependent on forest products. With the passage of time, these areas began {{to show signs of}} ecological recovery. Vines, herbs, grasses and small trees began to appear, followed by herbaceous flora, eventually leading to natural forest type. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> grass began to grow on the vacated agricultural fields and the adjoining forest areas started recuperating. By 1999–2002 several plant species emerged in these buffer zones. The newly arisen lush green fields attracted grass eating animals, mainly deer and elephants, who slowly migrated towards these areas and even preferred to stay there throughout the monsoon.|$|E
