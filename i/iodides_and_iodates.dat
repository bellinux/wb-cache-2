40|$|The {{dissolved}} iodine {{species that}} dominate aquatic systems are <b>iodide,</b> <b>iodate</b> <b>and</b> organo-iodine.

In this study, a fast, sensitive and accurate method for determining these iodine species in waters was developed by derivatizing <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> to organic iodine and measuring organic iodine with a total organic iodine (TOI) measurement approach. Within this method, organo-iodine was determined directly by TOI measurement; iodide was oxidized by monochloramine to hypoiodous acid and then hypoiodous acid reacted with phenol to form organic iodine, which was determined by TOI measurement; iodate was reduced by ascorbic acid to <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> then determined as iodide. The quantitation limit of organo-iodine or sum of organo-iodine <b>and</b> <b>iodide</b> or sum of organo-iodine, <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> was 5 μg/L as I for a 40 mL water sample (or 2. 5 μg/L as I for an 80 mL water sample, or 1. 25 μg/L as I for a 160 mL water sample).

40|$|Radioactive iodine in the {{environment}} comes both from nature {{and as a result}} of human activities. Understanding its behavior and fate in {{the environment}}, to enable assessment be made of its environmental impact, requires knowledge of its chemical form (speciation). The aim of this research work was to develop new analytical methods for the identification and measurement of radioactive iodine species, with an emphasis on the measurement of <b>iodate</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodide</b> in aqueous bsamples. A new derivatisation-solid phase extraction (DSPE) method was developed based on the conversion of iodine species to 4 -iodo-N, N-dimethylaniline (IDMA) which was then extracted from the aqueous sample by using solid phase extraction. Stable iodine could be measured by HPLC determination of IDMA, giving a detection limit of ~ 1 ?mol L- 1 for both <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> when a sample size of 250 mL was employed. DSPE methods could also be adapted to collect individual 129 I species as radioactive IDMA, with final measurement by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). The mean recoveries from determining 129 I- (~ 9. 2 Bq g- 1) and 129 IO 3 - (~ 0. 52 Bq g- 1) in water were 96. 5 ± 2. 6 % and 94. 6 ± 0. 8 %, respectively. These adapted methods were applied to the speciation analysis of 129 I in an effluent from a nuclear facility without pre-separation. The inorganic forms of 129 I in the effluent were <b>iodide,</b> <b>iodate</b> <b>and</b> elemental iodine. To overcome salt-derived interferences during DSPE analysis of seawater, an anion exchange approach was developed to pre-separate <b>and</b> enrich <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> from seawater (1 litre) prior to re-enrichment using the DSPE method. Total yields of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> obtained from this combined approach were 81. 6 ± 1. 8 % and 79. 1 ± 7. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} investigation was to understand the transformation and reaction kinetics of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> added to soil in relation to soil properties. In addition, to integrate the data into a predictive model of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> sorption kinetics parameterised by soil properties. Solid phase fractionation coupled with solution phase speciation (HPLC-ICPMS) was used to follow the assimilation of 129 I- and 129 IO 3 - spikes into ‘steady state’ soil microcosms. The extraction efficiency of tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) for soil iodine, and the effects of experimental procedures and conditions on the speciation of extracted iodine were tested. Moreover, the possibility of extracting ‘reactive’ inorganic iodine forms sorbed on soil metal oxides by competition with PO 43 - ions was investigated. Results showed that changing TMAH concentration, extraction time, extraction temperature or soil particle size did not generally affect the concentrations of total iodine extracted. The ratio of iodide to total iodine in the TMAH extracts varied with the extraction conditions which led to the conclusion that part, or all, of the measured iodide is possibly produced by hydrolysis of organic iodine forms. This conclusion was also confirmed by the detection of high concentrations of iodide in TMAH extracts of a humic acid. Only iodide was measured in the phosphate extracts of soil and it constituted up to 33 % of the total iodine in the KH 2 PO 4 extracts which indicates that most of the iodine mobilised by KH 2 PO 4 is organically bound. When soil / KH 2 PO 4 suspensions were spiked with 129 I- and 129 IO 3 -, at least 50 % of 129 I- and 15 % of 129 IO 3 - were recoverable after 72 hours of reaction. The lowest recoveries were observed with the highest concentration of KH 2 PO 4, which also mobilised the greatest concentrations of DOC, indicating that although KH 2 PO 4 is capable of releasing sorbed <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> in soil, it may also promote <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> reaction with soil organic matter. Iodine content of soil biomass was determined following chloroform fumigation of soil. The concentrations of total iodine in fumigated soil samples were only marginally higher than iodine concentration in the control samples indicating that microbial biomass iodine constitutes {{only a small fraction of}} total soil iodine (0. 01 – 0. 25 %). The change in iodine (129 I) solubility and speciation in nine soils with contrasting properties (pH, Fe/Mn oxides, organic carbon and iodine contents), incubated for nine months at 10 oC and 20 oC, was also investigated. The rate of 129 I sorption was greater in soils with large organic carbon contents, low pH and at higher temperatures. Loss of iodide (129 I-) from solution was extremely rapid, apparently reaching completion over minutes-hours; iodate (IO 3 -) loss from solution was slower, typically occurring over hours-days. In all soils an apparently instantaneous sorption reaction was followed by a slower sorption process for IO 3 -. For iodide a faster overall reaction meant that discrimination between the two processes was less clear. Instantaneous sorption of IO 3 - was greater in soils with high Fe/Mn oxide content, low pH and low organic content, whereas the rate of time dependent sorption was greatest in soils with higher organic contents. Phosphate extraction (0. 15 M KH 2 PO 4) of soils, ~ 100 h after 129 I spike addition, indicated that concentrations of sorbed inorganic iodine (129 I) were very low in all soils suggesting that inorganic iodine adsorption onto oxide phases has little impact on the rate of iodine assimilation into humus. Transformation kinetics of dissolved inorganic 129 IO 3 - and 129 I- to sorbed organic forms was modelled using a range of reaction and diffusion based approaches. Irreversible and reversible first order kinetic models, and a spherical diffusion model, adequately described the kinetics of both IO 3 - and I- loss from the soil solution but required inclusion of a distribution coefficient (Kd) to allow for instantaneous adsorption. A spherical diffusion model was also collectively parameterised for all the soils studied by using pH, soil organic carbon concentration and combined Fe + Mn oxide content as determinants of the model parameters (Kd and D/r 2). From the temperature-dependence of the sorption data the activation energy (Ea) for 129 IO 3 - transformation to organic forms was estimated to be ~ 43 kJ mol- 1 suggesting a reaction mechanism slower than pore diffusion or physical adsorption, but faster than most surface reactions.

In a prospective study lasting five years, a striking reduction in the prevalence of goitre was observed in areas receiving salt fortified with either potassium iodide or potassium iodate. During the same period, goitre prevalence remained unchanged in the control zone, which received plain, unfortified salt. The study has an important bearing on the problem of goitre control in developing countries that use moist, coarsely crystalline salt...|$|R
40|$|Found in {{the nature}} in form different, the iodine {{has been used in}} diverse works {{in the area of the}} {{industry}} and health. The iodine is very unstable and volatile in the ambient temperature and the I 2 is one of the diverse gaseous forms found. In this work was developed methodology for production of gaseous tracer from the sodium iodide (NaI) 0, 1 M marked with 123 I. The synthesis was processed with in chlorine acid (HCl) 1 M <b>and</b> sodium <b>iodate</b> salt (NaIO 3). The production of gas I 2 initially was carried through in unit of glass with the inert material and the purpose was to study the kinetic of reaction. The synthesis occurs in the reaction bottle and the produced gas is stored in the collect bottle that contains a starch solution (5 g/ 100 mL water). To determine the efficiency of production of gas I 2, analytic tests had been carried through, where the consumption of iodide ions of the bottle of reaction is measured. The optimization of production of the gaseous tracer was studied varying parameters as: concentration of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate,</b> concentration of acid and temperature. Then, the synthesis of the radiotracer was realized in the compact unit, being utilized as main reagent the salt radiated of sodium iodide, Na 123 I. The transportation of elementary iodine was studied by a scintillation detector NaI (2 x 2) ” placed in the reaction bottle. To acquire the data, the detector use a set of electronic modules for the acquisition of signals generated...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to understand iodine availability in various soils in China to efficiently manage and control environmental iodine. A series of batch experiments was conducted on a variety of Chinese soils {{in order to determine the}} adsorption characteristics of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate.</b> For five soils, the sorption isotherms of iodide were determined, while for all 17 soils, iodide adsorption was studied under one initial concentration to evaluate its sorption capacity. Furthermore, iodate sorption isotherms on two soils at five different initial concentrations were determined in this study, to complement the earlier work of Dai et al. (2004 a). From the sorption isotherm results. five Chinese soils were ranked in terms of their capacity for iodate adsorption: Perudic Ferrisols soil, HN>Orthic Aridisols soil, XJ 1 >Udic Ferrisols soil JX 2 >Usdic Luvisols soil BJ>Udic Isohumisols soil, JL. As a comparison, iodide adsorption was ranked as follows: Udic Ferrisols soil, JX 2 >Perudic Ferrisols soil, HN>Udic Isohumisols soil, JL>Usdic Luvisols soil, BJ>Orthic Aridisols soil XJ 2. It was also found that the desorbed amounts demonstrated a significant positive correlation with the adsorption of the XJ 1 and BJ soils for <b>iodate,</b> <b>and</b> also did the HN and JX 2 soils for iodide. At an initial iodide concentration of 4 mg L(- 1), the values of the sorption distribution coefficient, K(d), ranged between 0. 78 and 6. 59 mg kg(- 1) soil in 17 soils from China, <b>and</b> <b>iodide</b> adsorption was significantly correlated with soil organic matter and cation exchange capacity. Kd exhibited a linear relationship with soil organic matter, a polynomial relationship with free iron oxide content and a logarithmic relationship with cation exchange capacity. Furthermore, results from <b>iodate</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodide</b> adsorption from 17 Chinese soils, except for Fimic Anthrosols soil (GX) showed that the adsorption capacities of iodate were greater than those of <b>iodide,</b> <b>and</b> organic matter in soil environments plays an important role in controlling iodine geochemistry.

40|$|It is {{reported}} that iodine volatilization {{can occur in}} any elemental analysis of total iodine by ICP-MS. This problem affects {{the accuracy of the}} results, and it has been neither rationalized nor solved up to now. In this work, the formation of volatile iodine compounds in concentrated acid solutions (nitric acid or aqua regia) under microwave heating was studied by UV-vis spectrophotometry, linear sweep voltammetry, and cyclic voltammetry. It was evidenced that molecular iodine (I 2) can unexpectedly form in concentrated hot HNO 3 solutions, irrespective of the starting iodine compound (iodide, iodate, periodate, 3 -iodo-L-tyrosine, 3, 5 -diiodo-L-tyrosine dehydrate). I 2 is produced by the nitrogen oxides existing in these conditions. The formation of volatile iodine is minimized in aqua regia, as chloride is able to keep iodine in solution due to the formation of charged chloro-iodo complexes (e. g. I 2 Cl–). The dilution of the concentrated acid solution, required prior to the ICP-MS analysis, causes the disruption of I 2 Cl– so that I 2 can again volatilize. To avoid this, 0. 1 M thiocyanate can be added, as it forms a strong I 2 SCN– complex which keeps I 2 in solution as ion. Also other iodine species possibly occurring in the explored conditions, <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate,</b> were demonstrated to be converted to I 2 SCN– in diluted HNO 3 solutions and in the presence of 0. 1 M thiocyanate. Recovery tests demonstrated that iodine volatilization is minimized if samples containing iodine are treated in aqua regia and, after dilution, they are added with 0. 1 M thiocyanat...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIodine oxides, such as iodate, should {{theoretically}} be {{the only}} stable sink species for iodine in the troposphere. However, field observations have increasingly found very little <b>iodate</b> <b>and</b> significant amounts of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> organically bound iodine in precipitation and aerosols. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate iodine speciation, including the organic fraction, in rain, snow, and aerosols in an attempt to further clarify aqueous phase iodine chemistry. Diurnal aerosol samples were taken with a 5 stage cascade impactor and a virtual impactor (PM 2. 5) from the Mace Head research station, Ireland, during summer 2006. Rain was collected from Australia, New Zealand, Patagonia, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland while snow was obtained from Greenland, Germany, Switzerland, and New Zealand. All samples were analysed for total iodine by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and speciation was determined by coupling an ion chromatography unit to the ICP-MS. Total iodine in the aerosols from Mace Head gave a median concentration of 50 pmol m ? 3 of which the majority was associated with the organic fraction (median day: 91 ± 7 %, night: 94 ± 6 % of total iodine). Iodide exhibited higher concentrations than iodate (median 5 % vs. 0. 8 % of total iodine), and displayed significant enrichment during the day compared to the night. Interestingly, up to 5 additional, presumably anionic organic peaks were observed in all IC-ICP-MS chromatograms, composing up to 15 % of the total iodine. Organically bound iodine was also the dominant fraction in all rain and snow samples, with lesser amounts of <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> (iodate was particularly low in snow). Two of the same unidentified peaks found in aerosols were also observed in precipitation from both Southern and Northern Hemispheres, suggesting that these species are transferred from the aerosol phase into precipitation. It is suggested that organo-I is formed by reactions between HOI and organic matter derived from the ocean surface layer. This may then photolytically decompose to give <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> the unidentified species. The data in this study show that iodine oxides are the least abundant species in rain, snow, and aerosols and therefore considerably more effort is required on aqueous phase iodine chemistry for a holistic understanding of the iodine cycle...|$|R
40|$|Variations in I- 129 /I- 127 ratios {{were used}} to trace {{terrestrial}} organic carbon (tDOC) across an estuary because (1) iodine is biophilic, up to 75 % of total iodine in fresh and coastal marine waters partitions into organic iodine; (2) I- 129 /I- 127 ratios in tDOC are greatly elevated over those from marine systems because atmospheric emissions of I- 129 from European nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities were mixed more quickly in the surface ocean, up to 500 m in a decade, than the terrestrial system, which mixed approximately 10 cm in 10 to 50 y; and (3) the oceanic contribution of I- 127 (50 to 65 ppb) to the ratio has a greater dilution effect than I- 127 from freshwater (0. 5 to 40 ppb). Analytical techniques were developed for I- 129 /I- 127 ratio determination in dissolved organic iodine (DOI) and the other iodine species, using dehydrohalogenation, anion chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and accelerator mass spectrometry, {{to be applied to}} samples from Galveston Bay, Texas. Results indicate that I- 129 /I- 127 ratios in DOI from terrestrial sources are elevated in the upper estuary up to salinity of about 20, similar to a behavior previously described for this estuary for stable isotopic signals for dissolved organic matter. I- 129 /I- 127 ratios in the other iodine species, e. g., <b>iodide</b> <b>and</b> <b>iodate,</b> did not show this feature, indicating fast isotopic and chemical equilibration between the two isotopes among the different inorganic species in the estuary. These results thus provide proof of concept that I- 129 /I- 127 -DOI can serve as a tracer for tDOC in the coastal zone...|$|R
