The microworld however necessitates a introduction of Quantum ideas for its understanding.

40|$|We {{consider}} Neveu-Schwarz pp-waves with spacetime supersymmetry. Upon compactification of a spacelike direction, these backgrounds develop Closed Null Curves (CNCs) and Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs), and are U-dual to supersymmetric Godel type universes. We study {{classical and}} quantum strings in this background, {{with emphasis on}} the strings winding around the compact direction. We consider two types of strings: long strings stabilized by NS flux and rotating strings which are stabilized against collapse by angular momentum. Some of the latter strings wrap around CNCs and CTCs, and are thus a potential source of pathology. We analyze the partition function, and in particular discuss {{the effects of these}} string states. Although our results are not conclusive, the partition function seems to be dramatically altered due to the presence of CNCs and CTCs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{how we might}} go about about {{performing}} a Bell experiment in which humans are used to decide the settings at each end. To get a sufficiently high rate of switching at both ends, I suggest an experiment over {{a distance of about}} 100 km with 100 people at each end wearing EEG headsets, with the signals from these headsets being used to switch the settings. The radical possibility we wish to investigate is that, when humans are used to decide the settings (rather than various types of random number generators), we might then expect to see a violation of Quantum Theory in agreement with the relevant Bell inequality. Such a result, while very unlikely, would be tremendously significant for our understanding of the world (and I will <b>discuss</b> <b>some</b> <b>interpretations).</b> Possible radical implications aside, performing an experiment like this would push the development of new technologies. The biggest problem would be to get sufficiently high rates wherein there has been a human induced switch at each end before a signal as to the new value of the setting could be communicated to the other end and, at the same time, a photon pair is detected. It looks like an experiment like this, while challenging, is just about feasible with current technologies. Comment: 28 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the media}} coverage of parental leave policies (parental and paternity leaves) in Swiss French-speaking press articles from 1999 to 2009. Switzerland {{is one of the}} rare European countries which has no statutory parental or paternity leave. The aim is to describe the mediatisation of these policies and to analyse the arguments in favour and against their implementation. We investigate the status of a fertility frame - the mobilisation of discourse relating to fertility issues - among the various arguments used to justify or reject parental leave policies. We proceed with a content analysis of 579 press articles, as well as a frame analysis on a subset in which parental leave policies are the central theme (N= 206). Results show that paternity leave is the predominant public issue addressed in the dataset. A mediatisation peak was reached in 2007, following an initiative of a member of the Federal executive to implement a short paternity leave. Parental leave policies are predominantly represented in a positive light. The main positive frame is economic, in which leaves are represented as serving the interests of companies. Involved fatherhood and gender equality are also frequently mentioned as positive frames. The fertility frame is only moderately used in articles covering Swiss news on paternity leaves. Conversely, the fertility frame is largely mobilised in articles covering parental leave in other countries. We <b>discuss</b> <b>some</b> <b>interpretations</b> of this discrepancy and suggest future avenues of research on parental leave policies in Switzerland...|$|R

40|$|A new supersymmetric {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} dynamical symmetries for matrix quantum systems is presented. Contrary to standard one dimensional quantum mechanics where there is no role for an additional symmetry due to nondegeneracy, matrix hamiltonians allow for non-trivial residual symmetries. This approach is based on a generalization of the intertwining relations familiar in SUSY Quantum Mechanics. The corresponding matrix supercharges, of first or of second order in derivatives, lead to an algebra which incorporates an additional block diagonal differential matrix operator (referred to as a "hidden" symmetry operator) found to commute with the superhamiltonian.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{further evidence}} on the recent increase in international consumption risk sharing. We show that this increase is more pronounced among EU and EMU countries than among non-E(M) U industrialised countries. We also show that the patterns of international but intra-European risk sharing have started to diverge from what is found {{at the level of}} the OECD as a whole. During the 1990 s, capital income flows have started to play a relatively more important role between European countries, whereas the increase in international risk sharing among the OECD as a whole is almost exclusively driven by better consumption smoothing through the accumulation or decumulation of foreign assets. This EMU effect on the pattern of risk sharing survives once we control for differences in international portfolio holdings: while we find that countries with higher equity cross-holdings also tend to share more risk through capital income flows there remains an independent EMU-effect on the way how risk is shared.

Then, we <b>discuss</b> <b>some</b> possible <b>interpretations</b> of the recent evolution, focussing on diverse aspects of the crisis: from the "elements of novelty" (financial innovations and new practices of risk management) to "known mechanisms" (the pro-cyclicality of the credit supply and the role of finance in a monetary production economy) and its "fundamental causes" which, in our opinion, date back to the deregulation policies implemented in many countries during the last decades, starting from the US and the UK. These decisions have created new profit opportunities in various contexts, so promoting a renewed process of capitalist accumulation. This process has taken place at the cost of a wide-ranging increase of inequality and instability, thus implying a "crescendo" of crisis episodes (both at the national and the international level) until the more recent one. Accordingly, we think that the current crisis is linked to the underlying movements of capitalist accumulation (from the financiarization of advanced economies to the gradual shift of the centre of the world economy towards China and other Asian emerging countries), its functioning as a monetary production economy and its political dimension. ...|$|R

In vocabulary studies, for example, interference characterises Meara's seminal 1978 article, the base reference for most work on L 2 word associations over the last 25 years. His main conclusion is that L 2 learners and native speakers provide fundamentally different responses, and this is automatically attributed to defective underlying mental representations resulting largely from negative L 1 transfer.

If their L 1 responses are taken as the baseline, then any differences in the L 2 data should be indicative of influence from the L 2 irrespective of whether such responses approach L 2 norms. In other words, we are looking for evidence of approximating towards the L 2 rather than deficiency away from it...|$|R

BD+ 53 ^∘ 2790 misled the astronomers showing itself very likely as a Be star. However, a deeper spectral analysis and more intense monitoring, revealed that the real picture was a bit more complicated: a) Although it shows evidence of a circumstellar envelope, its observable properties differ from those typical envelopes in Be stars. b) Comparison with spectral standards and models indicates a possible over-abundance in He. This would open the possibility to link the behavior of BD+ 53 ^∘ 2790 to the He-rich class of stars. c) UV spectra shows an abnormally slow and dense wind for an O 9. 5 V star. d) Spectral classification in the IR wavelength region suggest a more likely supergiant nature of the source, in contradiction with the optical classification. e) The presence of an intense magnetic field is under investigation.

The centroid frequency of the strongest peak is ~ 66 Hz, its quality factor above 5 and its rms is between 4 and 10 %. We found a possible additional peak at 164 Hz when selecting a subset of data; however, at 4. 5 sigma level we consider this detection marginal. These QPOs have hard spectrum and are stronger in observations performed between September and October 2011, during which IGR J 17091 - 3624 displayed for the first time light curves which resemble those of the gamma variability class in GRS 1915 + 105. We find that the 66 Hz QPO is also present in previous observations (4. 5 sigma), but only when averaging ~ 235 ksec of relatively high count rate data. The fact that the HFQPOs frequency in IGR J 17091 - 3624 matches surprisingly well that seen in GRS 1915 + 105 raises questions on the mass scaling of QPOs frequency in these two systems.

40|$|Auroral {{emissions}} {{serve as}} a powerful tool to investigate the magnetospheric processes at Saturn. Solar wind and internally driv en processes largely control Saturn’s auroral morphology. The main aur oral emission at Saturn is suggested to be connected with the magnetosphere - solar wind interaction, through the flow shear related to rotational dynamics. Dawn auroral enhancements are associated with intense field-aligned currents generated by hot tenuous plasma carried towards the planet in fast moving flux tubes as they return from tail reconnection site to the dayside. In this work we demonstrate, based on Cassini auroral observations, that the main auroral emission at Saturn, as it rotates from midnight to dusk via noon, occasionally stagnates near noon {{over a couple of}} hours. In half of the sequences examined, the auroral emission is blocked close to noon, while in three out of four cases, the blockage of the auroral emission is accompanied with signatures of dayside reconnection. We <b>discuss</b> <b>some</b> possible <b>interpretations</b> of the auroral ’blockage’ near noon. According to the first one it could be related to local time variations of the flow shear close to noon. Auroral local time variations are also suggested to be initiated by radial transport process.

40|$|AbstractThis {{theoretical}} work covers {{structural and}} biochemical aspects of nucleotide binding and GDP/GTP exchange of GTP hydrolases {{belonging to the}} family of small GTPases. Current models of GDP/GTP exchange regulation are often based on two specific assumptions. The first is that the conformation of a GTPase is switched by the exchange of the bound nucleotide from GDP to GTP or vice versa. The second is that GDP/GTP exchange is regulated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which stabilizes a GTPase conformation with low nucleotide affinity. Since, however, recent biochemical and structural data seem to contradict this view, we present a generalized scheme for GTPase action. This novel ansatz accounts for those important cases when conformational switching in addition to guanine nucleotide exchange requires the presence of cofactors, and gives a more nuanced picture of how the nucleotide exchange is regulated. The scheme is also used to <b>discuss</b> <b>some</b> problems of <b>interpretation</b> that may arise when guanine nucleotide exchange mechanisms are inferred from experiments with analogs of GTP, like GDPNP, GDPCP, and GDP γ S...|$|R
