Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I <b>ever</b> <b>tell</b> you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding his {{portrayal}} of the character, Morgan commented, [...] "I played him with extra angst.

Because, indeed, {{there was a lot more}} going on." [...] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, [...] "It's our view that John knew everything the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E

500|$|Later, Sun as {{an adult}} (Yunjin Kim) is shown {{having an affair with}} Jae Lee (Tony Lee), who {{attempts}} to give her a pearl necklace. She refuses, afraid that her husband would see it. [...] Then, to her shame, Mr. Paik barges in and finds them in bed together. Mr. Paik later summons Sun's husband, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), saying that Jae has been stealing from him, and telling Jin {{to put an end to}} it (implying that he is to be killed). But when Jin ambushes and beats up Jae, he still cannot bring himself to commit murder, and instead orders Jae to leave the country. However, as Jin gets into his car, Jae's body suddenly lands on his windshield. Jae's corpse hand is clutching the pearl necklace, implying that he jumped from the window. At Jae's funeral, Sun runs into her father. She asks if he would <b>ever</b> <b>tell</b> Jin about the affair, but he says that it was not his place to tell Jin.|$|E
500|$|While in {{his first}} several Doctor Who appearances, Jack {{did not have a}} set costume, Torchwood {{established}} a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance. The design has been described as [...] "an iconic piece of sci-fi culture". A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: [...] "I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and bow ties and Stetsons. The only difference is that Captain Jack doesn't <b>ever</b> <b>tell</b> you his coat is cool. It just is." [...] In fact, in her essay [...] "Fashioning Masculinity and Desire", Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwoods popularity—as well as that of the character—to the costume. She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse [...] "through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows".|$|E

[...] Kansas and Missouri police note that long stretches of Robinson's time remain unaccounted for, and they fear that there are additional undiscovered victims.
