40|$|The fruit {{harvesting}} {{is a key}} factor involving both product quality and profitability. Particularly, mechanical harvesting of traditional oil olive orchards is hint by tree training system for manual harvesting, tree size and several and slanted trunks which makes difficult trunk shaker work. Therefore, canopy shaker technology could be a feasible alternative to develop an integral harvester able to work on irregular canopies. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine vibration parameters applied to the olive tree for efficient mechanical harvesting by canopy shaker measuring fruit removal efficiency and debris. In this work, a continuous lateral canopy shaker harvester has been developed and tested on large olive trees in order to analyse the operating harvester parameters and tree properties to improve mutual adaptation. Vibration amplitude and frequency, rod density and ground speed were assessed. Vibration amplitude and frequency beside ground speed were decisive factors on fruit removal efficiency. Increasing rod density has not influenced on removal efficiency although it increased significantly debris. Promising results has been reached with 77. 3 % of removal efficiency, applying a 28 <b>s</b> <b>shaking</b> duration, 0. 17 m amplitude vibration and 12 rod drum.

The 1960 s- 1970 s seemed to foster a balance between from a “from the top approach” and a “from the basis” renewal of entrepreneurship, thanks to new layers of entrepreneurial bourgeoisies, either family business or transfers from the state system – France being supposed to become the “South Korea of Europe”.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} heated debates taking place on Capitol Hill {{surround}} a proposed American national missile defense system. The debate is not new. For twenty years, the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and its underlying acceptance of mutual assured destruction (MAD) enjoyed widespread support among U. S. leaders. Events of the early 1990 <b>s</b> <b>shook</b> support for America's "no missile defense" posture to its very core. The fall of the Soviet Union, the {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile technology, and the Gulf War presented new challenges to existing strategic doctrine. As a result, a renewed push for a U. S. National Missile Defense (NMD) system began in earnest, and a new round of debates began over the utility of the bilateral ABM Treaty in a multilateral post-Cold War international environment This thesis identifies four distinct paths which the United States could follow in addressing the NMD-ABM Treaty debate. Each path is characterized by distinct factors which historically have influenced past ABM system debates. The most likely path to NMD that the United States is following, based on these driving factors, is identified. The potential implications which this prevalent NMD path may have on U. S. Navy force structure and planning is also addressed. Understanding how the current NMD debate is structured and driven enables one to discern which path to NMD deployment the United States is on.

40|$|The {{publication}} of the Aramaic archive from fourth-century Bactria (ADAB: Naveh and Shaked 2012) sheds {{new light on the}} eastern satrapies in the last decades of the Achaemenids and the era of Alexander. Historians have long been frustrated by the paucity of written sources on the region, even in the narrow window off ered by classical accounts of Alexander’s campaigns, and the appearance of new evidence is cause for great excitement. The ADAB documents refer to numerous individuals unattested in other written sources, from minor village offi cials to a probable satrap of Bactria in the reign of Artaxerxes III. The infamous regicide and would-be king Bessus, previously known from classical authors alone, appears now in a Bactrian context, separated from his role in the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty (ADAB C 1). 2 Another individual who may appear in both the Alexander histories and the Bactrian archive is a certain Vishtaspa (wšt’sp), who appears in a short letter concerning a transfer of sheep between two other men with Iranian names (ADAB C 2 : 1). 3 The editors note the existence of a prominent general named Hystaspes in the reigns of Darius III and Alexander, but do not press the identifi cation. 4 His asso- 1 I am grateful to Pierre Briant and the editors of Arta for their valuable comments and critique on an initial version of this paper.

40|$|Este artigo propõe analisar as relações entre o pentecostalismo e o protestantismo “histórico” nos últimos 100 anos. Desde o ano 2010 comemora-se o centenário da chegada do pentecostalismo no Brasil por meio das pregações do ítalo-americano Luis Francescon e dos suecos Daniel Berg e Gunner Vingren. Até os anos 1950, a Congregação Cristã no Brasil e a Assembléia de Deus, resultantes do trabalho dos três, eram os dois maiores exemplos de igrejas pentecostais consolidadas no Brasil. Uma nova explosão pentecostal ocorrida nos anos 1950 voltou a desestabilizar as relações entre protestantes e pentecostais. As igrejas surgidas desde então faziam da cura divina, dos milagres e prodígios o centro de suas atividades. Mas, no decorrer do século passado houve um crescente acirramento da competição, conflitos, sincretismo e acomodação. Isso se tornou mais forte após os anos 1970, quando um pentecostalismo com maior capacidade competitiva passou a levar vantagem. Esses neopentecostais cresceram em números, porém, ao ampliar os seus respectivos universos simbólicos, incorporaram símbolos, crenças e se tornaram portadores de teologias e discursos, híbridos e sincréticos. Que futuro tais acertos e desacertos poderão trazer para o campo religioso do País? Palavras chaves : Pentecostalismo brasileiro; Protestantismo Histórico; Acomodação Cultural; Conflito Religioso.   Abstract This article proposes an {{analysis}} between Pentecostalism and “historical” Protestantism {{in the last}} century. Since 2010 there have been celebrations of the 100 th anniversary of the establishment of Pentecostalism in Brazil, featuring renowned preachers such as the Italian-American Luis Francescon and Swedish Daniel Berg and Gunnar Vingren. Until the 1950 s, the Christian Congregation in Brazil and Assembly of God, which resulted {{from the work of}} these three preachers, were the two major Pentecostal churches in Brazil. A new Pentecostal outbreak in the 1950 <b>s</b> <b>shook</b> up the relations between Protestants and Pentecostal once again. Until then, Pentecostal churches centered their activities on divine healing and miracles. But in the last century, there was a process of intensification of the competition, conflicts, syncretism and complacency within the religious scenario, which accelerated after the 1970 s, when a more competitive Pentecostalism started to advance. These neo-Pentecostals grew in numbers, and while expanding their symbolic universes, they incorporated symbols and beliefs, becoming the bearers of a hybrid and syncretic theology and rhetoric. What future can these successes and failures bring to Brazil’s religious field? Key words : Brazilian Pentecostalism; Historical Protestantism; Cultural Complacency; Religious Conflict. </p...|$|R

40|$|This poster {{provides}} {{a comparison between}} the strong ground motions observed in the 22 February 2011 Mw 6. 3 Christchurch earthquake with those observed in Tokyo during the 11 March 2011 Mw 9. 0 Tohoku earthquake. The destuction resulting from both of these events has been well documented, although tsunami was the principal cause of damage in the latter event, and less attention {{has been devoted to}} the impact of earthquake-induced ground motions. Despite Tokyo being located over 100 km from the nearest part of the causative rupture, the ground motions observed from the Tohoku earthquake were significant enough to cause structural damage and also significant liquefaction to loose reclaimed soils in Tokyo Bay. The author was fortunate enough (from the perspective of an earthquake engineer) to experience first-hand both of these events. Following the Tohoku event, the athor conducted various ground motion analyses and reconniassance of the Urayasu region in Tokyo Bay affected by liquefaction in collaboration with Prof. Kenji Ishihara. This conference is therefore a fitting opportunity in which to discuss some of authors insights obtained {{as a result of this}} first hand knowledge. Figure 1 illustrates the ground motions recorded in the Christchurch CBD in the 22 February 2011 and 4 September 2010 earthquakes, with that recorded in Tokyo Bay in the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake. It is evident that these three ground motions vary widely in their amplitude and duration. The CBGS ground motion from the 22 February 2011 event has a very large amplitude (nearly 0. 6 g) and short duration (approx. 10 <b>s</b> of intense <b>shaking),</b> as a result of the causal Mw 6. 3 rupture at short distance (Rrup= 4 km). The CBGS ground motion from the 4 September 2010 earthquake has a longer duration (approx. 30 <b>s</b> of intense <b>shaking),</b> but reduced acceleration amplitude, as a result of the causal Mw 7. 1 rupture at a short-to-moderate distance (Rrup= 14 km). Finally, the Urayasu ground motion in Tokyo bay during the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake exhibits an acceleration amplitude similar to the 4 September 2010 CBGS ground motion, but a significantly larger duration (approx 150 <b>s</b> of intense <b>shaking).</b> Clearly, these three different ground motions will affect structures and soils in different ways depending on the vibration characteristics of the structures/soil, and the potential for strength and stiffness degradation due to cumulative effects. Figure 2 {{provides a}} comparison between the arias intensities of the several ground motion records from the three different events. It can be seen that the arias intensities of the ground motions in the Christchurch CBD from the 22 February 2011 earthquake (which is on average AI= 2. 5 m/s) is approximately twice that from the 4 September 2010 earthquake (average AI≈ 1. 25). This is consistent with a factor of approximately 1. 6 obtained by Cubrinovski et al. (2011) using the stress-based (i. e. PGA-MSF) approach of liquefaction triggering. It can also be seen that the arias intensity of the ground motions recorded in Tokyo during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake are larger than ground motions in the Christchurch CBD from the 4 September 2011 earthquake, but smaller than those of the 22 February 2011 earthquake. Based on the arias intensity liquefaction triggering approach it can therefore be concluded that the ground motion severity, in terms of liquefaction potential, for the Tokyo ground motions is between those ground motions in Christchurch CBD from the 4 September 2010 and 22 February 2011 events...|$|R

40|$|In the UK, listed {{companies}} {{are required to}} comply or explain reasons for non-compliance with the UK code of corporate governance. In this paper, using detailed compliance data for a panel of FTSE 350 companies, I first investigate how firms change their compliance practices over time. I then investigate the factors associated with these changes. The period covered in this study, that is 2000 to 2003, was marked by {{a sharp decline in}} the UK stock market, followed by intensive merger/acquisition and restructuring activity. It therefore offered a particularly good context for studying how firms’ compliance practices change in response to changing business conditions. I find that firms tend to behave in an opportunistic manner so far as their compliance is concerned – becoming more compliant when their prior period stock market performance declines and less so with improvements in their operating performance. Moreover, I find that mergers and acquisitions (which may be viewed as a somewhat aggressive response to a business shock) tend to decrease compliance, whereas reorganizations/restructuring (a rather defensive response) tends to increase compliance. These findings provide a useful insight about the behaviour of the firms. After all, the code was a response to the corporate scandals of the late 1980 s and early 1990 <b>s</b> that <b>shook</b> investor confidence in the UK. In some ways it is not surprising then to find that companies tend to `ride the waves` becoming more compliant when the going gets tough, and less so as performance improves. Both for companies and their investors these findings have important implications. For companies, the message is clear – it is consistency in compliance that matters. For investors, to separate the sheep from goat in terms of their compliance, it is important to look at governance arrangements beyond a mere year or two...|$|R

Plasmids were extracted from the strains used, amplified in E. coli, and digested with HindIII and KpnI, and the digestion pattern verified by gel electrophoresis. Growth assays Strains deep-frozen (- 80 °C) in 20 % glycerol were inoculated in 350 µl of SD medium and incubated for ∼ 72 h at 30 °C (pre-pre culture). This procedure was repeated once (second incubation∼ 48 h – preculture). For experimental runs, strains were inoculated to an OD of 0. 03 - 0. 1 in 350 µl of SD medium and cultivated for 47 h in a Bioscreen analyzer C (Labsystems Oy, Finland). Optical density was measured using a wide band (450 - 580 nm) filter. Incubation was at 30. 0 °C (± 0. 1 °C) with ten minutes preheating time. Plates were subjected to shaking at highest shaking intensity with 60 <b>s</b> of <b>shaking</b> every other minute. OD measurements were taken every 20 minutes during a 47 h period. Strains were run as five replicates in one single experiment with five wildtype strains (WT) included in each experiment. Growth rates were calculated as earlier described (Warringer et al, 2003). Strain growth defects as compared to the WT in a particular environment, termed Logarithmic Strain Coefficients (LSCs), were calculated a...|$|R
40|$|As {{in other}} cinemas around the world, Brazilian cinema came to modernity {{in the late}} 1950 s, early 1960 <b>s,</b> when Cinema Novo <b>shook</b> the {{traditional}} structures of production and aesthetics of film. New narrative structures and new aesthetic forms were tried by the filmmakers. The change also affected the way the actors bodies were filmed, to make them interact with {{each other and with}} the directors. New forms of acting appeared. The traditional theater centers of the country were not enough to give the film industry its interpreters.  The persona of former players is recovered and restructures by new movies. Television influences films, and it’s influenced by them. New parameters for the star system are revealed. Assim como no cinema mundial, o cinema brasileiro chegou à modernidade no final dos anos 1950, início dos anos 1960, quando o Cinema Novo abalou as estruturas tradicionais da produção e da estética dos filmes, no Brasil. Novas estruturas narrativas e novas formas estéticas foram experimentadas pelos cineastas. A mudança atingiu também a maneira de se filmar os corpos dos atores, de fazê-los interagir entre si e com os diretores. Surgem novas formas de interpretação.  Os centros teatrais tradicionais do país já não bastam para fornecer ao cinema seus intérpretes. A persona de antigos atores é recuperada e trabalhada pelos novos filmes. A televisão influencia o cinema, é influenciada por ele e surgem novos parâmetros para o star system...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} nature of {{numerous}} inclusion bodies seen in red cells from patients with sickle cell disease (Hb SS), we have prepared red cell ghosts free of oxyhemoglobin and analyzed them by spectrophotometric and heme extraction methods. The absorption spectrum in the visible region of the ghost suspensions was typical of hemichromes. The spectrum {{was similar to that}} of denatured hemoglobin repared by treatment of oxyhemoglobin <b>S</b> with mechanical <b>shaking</b> or heat. Similar treatment of cells containing only normal hemoglobin (Hb AA) showed a very small amount of denatured hemoglobin, approximately one-fifth of the amount in Hb SS cells. The amount of denatured hemoglobin determined after solution of membrane with 2. 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate was 0. 158 +/- 0. 070 % (1 SD) of the total cellular heme in Hb SS patients. In controls, the amount was 0. 030 +/- 0. 016 %. Persons with Hb AA and reticulocytosis did not have an elevated amount of membrane-associated heme. In patients with hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, denatured stromal hemoglobin was normal or slightly elevated before and after splenectomy. The increased amount of denatured hemoglobin in Hb SS red cells {{may be related to the}} instability of sickle oxyhemoglobin...|$|R
40|$|Com o advento da revolução {{industrial}} o capitalismo assumiu uma forma assombrosa jamais vista anteriormente em outras passagens do mundo do trabalho, ao se alimentar de um ritmo acelerado de produção, consumo e acumulação. Esta nova era baseada na mecanização e numa nova divisão do trabalho impôs ao trabalhador o principio da fragmentação, que seguindo o modelo do cronômetro da gerência científica e a linha de produção do açougue dividiu a força de trabalho do empregado e multiplicou a acumulação do empregador. Na década de 1970 o capitalismo sofreu uma crise estrutural que viria a transformar o mundo do trabalho novamente. Esta nova transformação do capital fundamentado na globalização e nos conceitos neoliberais visando ainda mais a lucratividade em cima da força de trabalho atingiu a objetividade e a subjetividade da classe-que-vive-do-trabalho ao (des) re regulamentar seus direitos e conquistas. No mundo do trabalho brasileiro as transformações do capital mundial tiveram seu impacto nos anos 1990 abalando regiões produtivas inteiras como a do Grande ABC, com o desemprego estrutural e com a reestruturação produtiva. Em 2002 o diretor de cinema Eduardo Coutinho filmou um documentário Peões com 21 operários que narram suas origens, suas participações no movimento nas décadas de 1970 - 1980 - 1990 e os desfechos de suas vidas fazendo uma construção de si pela fala. Desta forma, Peões será para esta dissertação o corpus de análise para uma aproximação entre ciência e arte, onde será utilizado o método fenomenológico para a análise das narrativas que se apresentam para compreensão da divisão do trabalho capitalista que vem transformando o mundo do trabalho e atingindo perversamente a classe-que-vive-do-trabalho ao fragmentar sua subjetividade que se explicita objetivamente na fragmentação da relação intersubjetiva com o outro, os objetos e o mundo. Por meio da aplicação do método para a compreensão das narrativas pode se chegar à seguinte síntese: os homens e mulheres, de Peões, viveram e vivem ainda hoje intensamente entre a linha tênue da resistência e da submissão, da desalienação e alienação, do despontar e do anonimato na esfera pública evidenciando a importância ainda em nossos dias do alargamento do pensamento dialético entre a lógica da acumulação capitalista {{versus a}} lógica da sobrevivência humana. With {{the advent of}} the industrial revolution, capitalism has taken an astonishing way never seen before in other places in the world of work, to feed a fast-paced production, consumption and accumulation. This new era based on mechanization and a new division of labor imposed on the worker by the principle of fragmentation that following the chronometer model of scientific management and the production line of "butcher shop", that shared the work force and employee multiplied the accumulation of employer. However, in the 1970 s capitalism has undergone a structural crisis that would transform the world of work again. This new transformation of capital based on the globalization and neo liberal concepts in order to further profitability over the labor force reached the objectivity and subjectivity of class that makes a living from working the (un) re-regulate their rights and conquests. In the world of Brazilian work changes of the world capital had their impact in the 1990 <b>s</b> <b>shaking</b> entire production regions as do of Grande ABC, with structural unemployment and the restructuring process. In 2002 the filmmaker Eduardo Coutinho filmed a documentary - Peões - with 21 workers who recount their origins, their participation in the movement in the decades of 1970 - 1980 - 1990 and the outcomes of their lives making a building of itself by speaks. Thus, Peões will is for this dissertation the great link that will analysis corpus. that allow an approach between science and art. The phenomenological method will be used to analyze the present narratives for the understanding of the division of the capitalist work. This one is transforming the world of the work and it s perversely reaching the work-live-class when breaking up its subjectivity, that is explicit objectively in the fragmentation of the intersubjective relation with the others, the objects and the world. By means of the application of this method for the understanding of these narratives it was possible to reach at the following synthesis: the men and women, of Peões, had lived and still live nowadays intensely between the tenuous line of the resistance and of the submission, of the aware and alienation, blunting and the anonymity in the public sphere. It shows the importance, still in our days, of the widening of the dialectical thinking between the logic of the capitalist accumulation versus the logic of the human being survival...|$|R
40|$|A map {{of how we}} 2 ̆ 7 re {{using the}} Net will help us {{identify}} where it can go next, writes JULIAN THOMAS THE internet is everywhere: at work, at home, and on the move. If Kevin Rudd 2 ̆ 7 s plans come to anything, it will soon be in every school. The underlying technologies are scarcely three decades old; {{some of the most}} popular sites, such as YouTube and Facebook, only a few years. But this new world of information and communication is now, for many of us, an utterly everyday experience. What is equally remarkable is how little we really know about how the Net is used, where and by whom. The Net may be all around us, but it is still very strange. We know that the Net is changing rapidly, with broadband and new kinds of social media. But we don 2 ̆ 7 t know what difference broadband actually makes, and whether it will be worth the 5 billion or so the government is planning to spend. Recent work in Australia by researchers as part of the World Internet Project is tackling these and other questions on several fronts. Like the global Human Genome Project, this study of the Net is an ambitious, collaborative, world-wide attempt to map something that was very recently unthinkable. It has the potential to tell us a great deal about who we now are or more precisely, who Australians are becoming in the new era of networks. The work will also help us gauge the real prospects for turning Australia into one of those new, desirable 2 ̆ 7 knowledge economies 2 ̆ 7 based on innovation and creativity. Perhaps the most striking finding of the project so far is that while the Net may seem to be everywhere, a fifth of Australians have never used it. And in Britain, the non-users are almost a third of the adult population. In other words, there is a digital divide in Australia and it reflects patterns of uptake that are repeated elsewhere in the prosperous West. If you 2 ̆ 7 re male, employed or studying, if you have a university degree and a higher than average income, you are more likely to be online. These patterns are familiar, but the Net is changing, and computers have been getting cheaper. The divide is not as simple as the old idea of the better-off information 2 ̆ 7 haves 2 ̆ 7 and the struggling 2 ̆ 7 have nots 2 ̆ 7. Lower-income families with children are much more likely to have access to the Net than those without children. Many older non-users actually do access the Net through their friends and families. So the digital divide is, in some cases, more likely to be a digital choice. At the same time, new divides are appearing around the more recent internet technologies. In Australia, just under four in five home connections are now broadband. That means that about half the population have it, and half don 2 ̆ 7 t, but that 2 ̆ 7 s changing quickly, because the technology is in a rapid take-up phase. Although the quality of our broadband may not match that of some European and Asian countries, Australia has recently jumped a few notches in the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s league table in this area. Broadband is much more than an improved version of the old dialup access: it seems to change what people do online in quite fundamental ways. It is helping to transform something we have long thought of as dry IT into a social, cultural and political technology. Broadband users spend more time on the Net. Six out of 10 users under the age of 30 say they watch less TV. For women even more than for men, broadband dramatically changes the online experience. So the Net is now coming into its own. It 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shaking</b> up traditional media, especially television, less so newspapers, books and magazines. And it 2 ̆ 7 s changing politics, as we saw in the federal election last year. Those who are online think the Net matters politically; those who are not are unsure. What is the point of this sort of research? A global, long-run study of the Net is useful for many people: for policy makers, for consumers, businesses and innovators. This kind of knowledge has another possible benefit, if it can help make what now seems strange a bit less scary. We could then spend a little less time worrying about what the Net might do to us or our children, and some more time figuring out what it could achieve for us all.
