A critical parameter in predicting the ultimate strength of FRP-confined concrete is the ultimate circumferential (i. e., <b>hoop)</b> <b>strain.</b> This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel test method aimed at providing reliable experimental measurements of the ultimate <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> in FRP circular jackets with different laminate thickness and diameter. The proposed approach simulates the lateral expansion of concrete columns subjected to axial loads by enlisting the property of water (which expands when it changes state of matter from liquid to solid) as a medium to apply an internal hydrostatic pressure on cylindrical glass FRP (GFRP) jacket specimens. The average ultimate <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> results from 54 cylindrical GFRP-jacket specimens with different diameter and laminate thickness clearly indicate a lower level of strain than those found in similar flat coupon specimens.

Due to the change of the stress, some of cracks in damaged rock open and the others close, which greatly affects the flow of gas in rock. The change and development of cracks in rock and the unusual flow of gas are two main reasons that cause all kinds of gas accidents to happen in roadways. Based on this fact, a water seepage test was conducted in a sandstone specimen under triaxial stress condition by using MTS 815. 02 Electro-Hydraulic Servo-controlled Rock Mechanics Testing System. During the test, the deformation parameters and permeability of the specimen at twelve testing points were measured.

40|$|The use of {{externally}} bonded FRP-systems is {{an effective}} retrofitting technique widely recognized to increase strength and deformability of reinforced concrete columns. With the expanding use of FRP jacketing, accurate prediction in performance for design purposes becomes increasingly important, achieved through well characterised materials. A critical parameter in predicting the ultimate behaviour of FRP confined concrete is measured with the ultimate FRP tensile strain, determined from material direct tensile tests. However, ultimate FRP tensile strain determined experimentally according to flat coupon tests has not been reached at the circumferential (hoop) rupture of FRP jackets confining concrete cylinders. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel 'Investigation of Circumferential-strain Experimental' (ICE) methodology for FRP characterisation, aimed at providing a reliable experimental technique to assess the ultimate <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> of FRP laminates. The ICE methodology uses the unique property of water that expands when it changes state of matter from liquid to solid, as a medium to apply an internal hydrostatic pressure replicating the effect of concrete columns subjected to axial loads. The method was first assessed on circular metal containers to assess its feasibility, and then validated on cylindrical Glass FRP specimens made of different diameters and laminate thicknesses. The results indicate that the proposed ICE methodology is a reliable test method generating statistically reproducible <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> measurements, while providing an effective test technique. Furthermore, average ultimate <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> results indicate a lower level of strain than those found in similar flat coupon specimens under direct tensile tension...|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} {{models for}} predicting the ultimate capacity and stress-strain relationships of confined concrete rely on an assumed FRP ultimate strain value. It is commonly assumed that FRP fails when <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> in the jacket reaches its ultimate tensile strain determined according to flat coupon tests. However, experimental results of FRP confined concrete {{showed that in}} most cases, FRP experimental ultimate tensile strain is clearly not reached at the rupture of the FRP jacket. The discrepancies may include the shape and conditions of concrete substrate as well as defects or stress concentrations in FRP jackets (in particular, the multiaxial stress state in FRP wrapping due to the transfer of loads through the bond with concrete). The present paper covers only issues related to this latter aspect. Since the average absolute error of all confinement models showed a remarkable decrease when the effective FRP <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> (smaller than ultimate flat coupon strain) was inserted in the equations, an analytical model to directly evaluate the FRP strain efficiency factor as the strain ratio between the effective FRP <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> at failure and the flat coupon test outcomes has been formulated.

40|$|The brain, {{like many}} parts of the human body, can {{experience}} swelling, also known as cerebral edema. Cerebral edema may occur because of an injury, health related issues, tumors, or even high altitudes[1]. When cerebral edema occurs, a rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) becomes prevalent and may cause a serious threat. Without immediate treatment, increased intracranial pressure can prevent blood from flowing to the brain and depriving it of necessary oxygen it needs to function. A normal ICP is usually between 5 - 15 mmHg (666 Pa- 1333 Pa). Any ICP observed to be above 20 mmHg (2666 Pa) can be associated with brain ischemia and is usually treated[2, 3]. If prolonged, high intracranial pressures can be fatal. Current methods of measuring increased ICP are invasive and may involve drilling into the skull.

The shaft lining is built with freezing method. From the measurement, some changes of regularity in construction, thawing and post thawing period are obtained, including the temperature, freezing pressure and the vertical and <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> of the shaft lining. Measurement studies have shown that: during the plastic stage of shaft construction period, {{with the release of}} hydration heat, the thermal expansion occurs in the concrete and the strain gauge, leading to tensile strain. In the earlier stage, the elastic modulus and strength of concrete increases rapidly. When the shaft lining temperature reaches its maximum, the cooling and growth in the freezing pressure make the <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> increase sharply. However, the <b>hoop</b> <b>strain</b> is at lower tensile or compressive value. In the early stage and mature stage, the strain change is mainly affected by temperature. In the thawing and post thawing period, the concrete strain is also primarily influenced by temperature change. During the measurement, when the maximum compressive strain is less than ultimate value, the shaft lining is in a safe state. To ensure the security of the shaft lining, the concrete strength growth and sidewall temperature should be controlled in the similar shaft condition. In addition, the reinforcement ratio should not be too small for the shaft lining in frozen bedrock. And further, the fiber reinforced concrete, shrinkage-compensating concrete and low hydration heat concrete technology can also be adopted to reduce the cracks as much as possible and to avoid penetrating cracks. For the soft aquifers in West China, the further field measurement is still needed to obtain the stress and deformation regularities of the shaft lining, which can not only provide a basis for security assessment of the shaft, but also guide its design and optimization to improve the design theory...|$|E
