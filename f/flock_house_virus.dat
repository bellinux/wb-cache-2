(3) The development, application and analysis of an experimental model of programme evaluation.

40|$|<b>Flock</b> <b>house</b> <b>virus</b> (FHV) is the best-characterized {{member of}} the Nodaviridae, a family of small, positive-strand RNA viruses. Unlike most RNA viruses, FHV encodes only a single polypeptide, protein A, that is {{required}} for RNA replication. Protein A contains a C-proximal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain and localizes via an N-terminal transmembrane domain to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where FHV RNA replication takes place in association with invaginations referred to as spherules. We demonstrate here that protein A self-interacts in vivo by using flow cytometric analysis of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), spectrofluorometric analysis of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, and coimmunoprecipita-tion. Several nonoverlapping protein A sequences were able to independently direct protein-protein interaction, including an N-terminal region previously shown to be sufficient for localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane (D. J. Miller and P. Ahlquist, J. Virol. 76 : 9856 – 9867, 2000). Mutations in protein A that diminished FRET also diminished FHV RNA replication, a finding consistent with an important role for protein A self-interaction in FHV RNA synthesis. Thus, the results imply that FHV protein A functions as a multimer {{rather than as a}} monomer at one or more steps in RNA replication. <b>Flock</b> <b>house</b> <b>virus</b> (FHV) is an alphanodavirus with a 4. 5 -kb positive-strand RNA genome.

It has recently been found {{that this is the}} case for some strains of Wolbachia, which both cause cytoplasmic incompatibility and protect their hosts against viruses. Here, we carry out the first test as to whether a male-killing strain of Wolbachia also provides a direct benefit to its host by providing antiviral protection to its host Drosophila bifasciata. We infected flies with two positive sense RNA viruses known to replicate in a range of Drosophila species (Drosophila C virus and <b>Flock</b> <b>House</b> <b>virus)</b> and measure the rate of death in Wolbachia positive and negative host lines with the same genetic background. Results: Both viruses caused considerable mortality to D. bifasciata flies, with Drosophila C virus killing 43 % more flies than the uninfected controls and <b>Flock</b> <b>House</b> <b>virus</b> killing 78 % more flies than the uninfected controls. However, viral induced mortality was unaffected by the presence of Wolbachia. Conclusion: In the first male-killing Wolbachia strain tested for antiviral effects, we found no evidence that it conferred protection against two RNA viruses.

40|$|Abstract – Maedi-Visna Virus (MVV) {{seroprevalence}} and {{its relationship}} with housing and mode of rearing of replacement ewe-lambs was investigated in 38 non-randomly selected sheep-flocks in Spain. They included extensive lamb-producing Manchega cross-bred flocks raised almost permanently at pasture, semi-intensive Latxa dairy <b>flocks</b> <b>housed</b> 2 – 8 months/year and intensively raised Assaf dairy <b>flocks</b> <b>housed</b> most time and at higher stocking density in less ventilated buildings than other flocks. Most flocks raised replacement lambs naturally with their dams until weaning and as a separate flock thereafter until lambing at one year of age. Seroprevalence (95 % confidence intervals) was 77 %, 25 % and 5 % (4 – 6) in intensive, semi-intensive and extensive flocks, respectively and the median (interquartile range) flock-seroprevalence was 82 % (66 – 94) in intensive flocks, 31 % (14 – 31) in semi-intensive flocks and 4 % (0 – 7) in extensive flocks. Seroprevalence was lowest in one year-old sheep and increased to flock levels during the year after introduction into the adult flock in most intensive flocks and more gradually in other flocks. Adult flock seroprevalence was associated with housing time but this relationship was not evident within a particular rearing system, indicating that other unknown factors are critical in horizontal MVV-transmission. Low seroprevalence in extensive flocks further supports previous indications that lactogenic MVV-infection is relativel...|$|R
