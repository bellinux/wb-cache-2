25|$|The {{expression}} of Class III β-tubulin is regulated {{at both the}} transcriptional and translational levels. In neural tissue, constitutive expression is driven by Sox4 and Sox11. In non-neural tissues, regulation is dependent on an E-box site in the 3' <b>flanking</b> <b>region</b> at +168 nucleotides. This site binds basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) hypoxia induced transcription factors Hif-1α and Hif-2α and is epigenetically modified in cancer cells with constitutive TUBB3 expression. Translational regulation of TUBB3 occurs in the 3`flanking region with {{the interaction of the}} miR-200c family of micro-RNA. MiR-200c is in turn modulated by the protein HuR (encoded by ELAVL1). When HuR is predominantly in the nucleus, a phenomenon typically occurring in low stage carcinomas, miR-200c suppresses class III β-tubulin translation. By contrast, cytoplasmic HuR and miR-200c enhance class III β-tubulin translation by facilitating the entry of the mRNA into the ribosome.|$|E

Here we present an improved inverse PCR scheme that enables walking of rare fragments in environmental metagenomes. Our scheme includes the following steps: (i) inverse PCR in which one primer is connected to an affinity tag; (ii) affinity purification of PCR products for removing background metagenome; and (iii) nested PCR to recover target <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> (IAN-PCR). In a model experiment, <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> of a gene fragment in Ralstonia eutropha were recovered from mixtures of Ralstonia and Escherichia genomes by standard inverse PCR, inverse PCR coupled to nested PCR (IN-PCR), and IAN-PCR, showing that they were recovered when ratios of Ralstonia genome to the background Escherichia genome were greater than 10 - 1, 10 - 3, and 10 - 5, respectively. The utility of IAN-PCR was also examined by recovering <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> of PCR-amplified putative chitinase gene fragments from a groundwater metagenome, showing that IAN-PCR obtained <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> for more diverse gene fragments than IN-PCR.

40|$|Well-resolved phylogenetic {{trees are}} {{essential}} for us to understand evolutionary processes {{at the level of}} species. The degree of species-level resolution in the plant phylogenetic literature is poor, however, largely due to the dearth of sufficiently variable molecular markers. Unlike the common genic approach to marker development, we generated DNA sequences of monomorphic nuclear microsatellite <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> in a phylogenetic study of Annona species (Annonaceae). The resulting data showed no evidence of paralogy or allelic diversity that would confound attempts to reconstruct the species tree. Microsatellite <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> are short, making them practical to use, yet have astounding proportions of variable characters. They have 3. 5 - to 10 -fold higher substitution rates compared to two commonly used chloroplast markers, have no rate heterogeneity among nucleotide positions, evolve in a clock-like fashion, and show no evidence of saturation. These advantages are offset by the short length of the <b>flanking</b> <b>regions,</b> resulting in similar numbers of parsimony informative characters to the chloroplast markers. The neutral evolution and high variability of <b>flanking</b> <b>regions,</b> together with the wide availability of monomorphic microsatellite loci in angiosperms, are useful qualities for species-level phylogenetics.

40|$|Five {{closely related}} {{immunoglobulin}} V ^ genes (subgroup II) were compared by sequencing of several kb of DNA. In {{three of the}} genes homology greater than 75 % was found along an area of 4 kb that includes the coding region. The homology in <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> is only slightly lower than that in the coding sequences. Two other genes, which are located on the same EcoRI frag-ment, show high homology to the first three genes in the coding and immedia-tely <b>flanking</b> <b>regions.</b> In more distant <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> no homology is found with the first three genes.

A region of simple DNA sequence composed of repetitive TCC and TCA elements was found at a distance of ̂ 380 bp upstream from the initiator ATG of these V ^ genes. This region is the site where the two sets of genes abruptly start to diverge. The structure of the simple DNA sequence in the various V ^ genes suggests that it may be involved in gene interaction. We propose that both simple DNA sequences and homology in <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> serve a function in the correction of V ^ genes, which seem to be rather free to diverge and drift into pseudogenes.

40|$|Traditional {{transcription}} factor binding site analyses focus {{solely on the}} nucleotide composition of site {{despite the fact that}} more recent studies have shown {{transcription factor}}s to rely on the DNA structural features within and surrounding their binding sites. In this study a metric of intrinsic DNA flexibility referred to as the TRX scale is used to assess the structural features within functionally annotated binding sites and their up- and downstream <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> based on their Shannon information content (IC). Two methods of sequence alignment, center and a novel delta TRX based multiple sequence alignment, are compared. The results show that at least 95 % of all up- and downstream <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> contained more IC in their structural signature as defined by the TRX scale. Between 23 % and 35 % (excluding and including bridging phosphate bonds, respectively) of <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> also showed significant differences between the sets of confirmed and non-confirmed matches. However, few to no significant differences in IC were observed in consensus match regions where sequence dependent major groove contacts are most likely to occur. These findings support the notion that structural context is highly important in the distinction between true and false binding sites. Enhanced consensus logos are demonstrated for the visualization of these structural signatures. While delta TRX based multiple sequence alignment appeared to be superior in <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> when compared to center alignment, further analyses are needed in order to increase the confidence in these findings...|$|R

50|$|Silencers are DNA {{sequences}} {{found in}} the 5' <b>flanking</b> <b>region</b> of eukaryotic genes, that aid in the silencing of a gene. They can be found upstream, downstream, or within the gene of interest. When repressors bind silencers, they act {{in a similar fashion}} as enhancers and bend over to prevent the interaction of RNA polymerase with promoters. This silences the gene and therefore the gene will not be expressed in the cell.|$|E
50|$|Transcription {{termination}} of RNA polymerase II transcripts is proposed to occur by a two-stage process. The first stage involves pre-termination cleavage (PTC) of the nascent transcript downstream of the poly(A) site. This process is {{also referred to}} as co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). The CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene was proposed to involve an RNA self-cleaving activity located in the 3' <b>flanking</b> <b>region</b> of the beta-globin gene. The CoTC core is highly conserved in the 3' UTR of other primate beta-globin genes.|$|E
50|$|Enhancers are DNA {{sequences}} {{found in}} 5' flanking regions of eukaryotic genes that affect transcription. If a transcription factor binds to an enhancer in a 5' <b>flanking</b> <b>region,</b> the DNA strand bends {{in a way}} that the transcription factor that is bound to the enhancer can also bind the promoter of a gene. This leads to RNA polymerase recruitment and interaction with transcription factors and the promoter, and an overall higher transcription rate than the basal level. Although enhancers are usually present upstream of the transcription start site, they can be present anywhere on or around the gene of interest.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{instability}} of microtubules {{is thought to}} be regulated by MAPs and phosphorylation. Here we describe the effect of the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau by observing the dynamics of single microtubules by video microscopy. We used recombinant tau isoforms and tau mutants, and we phosphorylated tau by the neuronal kinases MARK (affecting the KXGS motifs within tau's repeat domain) and cdk 5 (phosphorylating Ser-Pro motifs in the <b>regions</b> <b>flanking</b> the repeats). The variants of tau can be broadly classified into three categories, depending on their potency to affect microtubule dynamics. "Strong" tau variants have four repeats and both <b>flanking</b> <b>regions.</b> "Medium" variants have one to three repeats and both <b>flanking</b> <b>regions.</b> "Weak" variants lack {{one or both of the}} <b>flanking</b> <b>regions,</b> or have no repeats; with such constructs, microtubule dynamics is not significantly different from that of pure tubulin. N- or C-terminal tails of tau have no influence on {{dynamic instability}}. The two ends of microtubules (plus and minus) showed different activities but analogous behavior. These results are consistent with the "jaws" model of tau where the <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> are considered as targeting domains whereas the addition of repeats makes them catalytically active in terms of microtubule stabilization. The dominant changes in the parameters of dynamic instability induced by tau are those in the dissociation rate and in the catastrophe rate (up to 30 -fold). Other rates change only moderately or not at all (association rate increased up to twofold, rates of rescue or rapid shrinkage decreased up to approximately twofold). The order of repeats has little influence on microtubule dynamics (i. e., repeats can be re-arranged or interchanged), arguing in favor of the "distributed weak binding" model proposed by Butner and Kirschner (1991); however, we confirmed the presence of a "hotspot" of binding potential involving Lys 274 and Lys 281 observed by Goode and Feinstein, 1994. Phosphorylation of Ser-Pro motifs by cdk 5 (mainly Ser 202, 235, and 404) in the <b>flanking</b> <b>regions</b> had a moderate effect on microtubule dynamics while phosphorylation at the "Alzheimer"-site Ser 262 MARK eliminated tau's interactions with microtubules. In both cases the predominant effects of phosphorylation are on the rates of tubulin dissociation and catastrophe whereas the effects on the rates of association or rescue are comparatively small...|$|R

50|$|The {{expression}} of Class III β-tubulin is regulated {{at both the}} transcriptional and translational levels. In neural tissue, constitutive expression is driven by Sox4 and Sox11.

50|$|An {{insightful}} {{study of}} vasopressin is {{its role in}} the stimulation of monogamous behavior. The V1a vasopressin receptor gene is a mechanism most widely studied. Different species of voles were studied, prairie voles which are monogamous in nature and montane voles, which tend towards polygamy. Using viral vector mediated gene expression, which allows the cross-species transplanting of genes, when the V1a receptor expression was increased in the reward and reinforcement neural circuitry of montane voles, they acquired a more selective preference for their mate. Their behavior became more akin to that of prairie voles. Therefore, it is alteration of vasopressin receptor gene expression patterns is thought to affect social behavior, rather than the neuropeptide itself. A proposed mechanism for the difference in these patterns is the variation of microsatellite DNA length that is upstream of the V1a receptor gene—short microsatellite DNA in the 5' <b>flanking</b> <b>region</b> of the gene has a different effect on prairie vole behavior than longer microsatellite DNA. Whether this is a mechanism that is replicable in the wild is uncertain.|$|E

This RING domain interacts with associated proteins, including BARD1, which also contains a RING motif, to form a heterodimer. The BRCA1 RING motif is flanked by alpha helices formed by residues 8-22 and 81-96 of the BRCA1 protein. It interacts with a homologous region in BARD1 also consisting of a RING finger flanked by two alpha-helices formed from residues 36-48 and 101-116. These four helices combine to form a heterodimerization interface and stabilise the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer complex. Additional stabilisation is achieved by interactions between adjacent residues in the <b>flanking</b> <b>region</b> and hydrophobic interactions. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by tumorigenic amino acid substitutions in BRCA1, implying that {{the formation of a}} stable complex between these proteins may be an essential aspect of BRCA1 tumor suppression.|$|E
50|$|All SLBP {{proteins}} {{are capable}} of forming a highly stable complex with histone stem-loop RNA. Complex formation with the histone mRNA stem-loop is achieved by a novel three-helix bundle fold. SLBP proteins also recognize the tetraloop structure of the histone hairpin, {{the base of the}} stem, and the 5' <b>flanking</b> <b>region.</b> The crystal structure of human SLBP in complex with the stem-loop RNA as well as the exonuclease Eri1 reveals that the Arg181 residue of SLBP specifically interacts with the second guanine base in the RNA stem.

The SLBP RBD also undergoes proline isomerization about this sequence and is a substrate for the prolyl isomerase Pin1. The N-terminal domain of human SLBP is required for translation activation of histone mRNAs via its interaction with SLIP1. SLBP also interacts with the CBP80 associated protein CTIF to facilitate rapid degradation of histone mRNAs. SLBP is a phosphoprotein and besides T171, it is also phosphorylated at Ser7, Ser20, Ser23, Thr60, Thr61 in mammalian cells. The phosphorylation at Thr60 is mediated by CK2 and Thr61 is by Cyclin A/Cdk1.|$|E
