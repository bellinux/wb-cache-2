5|$|The game's {{premise is}} similar to that of the {{original}} Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic's nemesis, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, is planning world <b>domination</b> through the power of the Chaos Emeralds and an army of robots powered by trapped animals. Specific to this game, he is additionally constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg (a parody of the Death Star), also for the means of world <b>domination.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Paul, Tipu {{shifted his}} hatred for the British to the Mangalorean Catholics and other South Indian Christian communities. Sita Ram Goel mentions that Tipu's {{justification for the}} conversion was that during the Portuguese <b>domination,</b> many Muslims were forcibly converted to Christianity. Tipu proclaimed his actions as a punishment for the conversion of Muslims to Christianity.|$|E

50|$|Rimini has a rich {{historical}} and artistic heritage, which includes churches and monasteries, villas and palaces, fortifications, archaeological sites, streets and squares. This richness {{is the result}} of the succession of various civilizations, <b>dominations</b> and historical events through 22 centuries of history: the Romans, the Byzantines, the role of medieval comune and capital of the Malatesta seignory, the Venetian Republic and the Papal States <b>dominations.</b>|$|R
5|$|After CoreFire, the world's {{greatest}} superhero, goes missing, {{the former}} members of The Champions re-unite to investigate his disappearance, bringing in two new replacement heroines, Lily and Fatale. They immediately suspect CoreFire's nemesis, Dr. Impossible, was involved, {{even though he has}} been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth world <b>domination</b> attempt. An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at world <b>domination.</b> The New Champions search for Impossible, convinced he is responsible for CoreFire's demise, while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan. This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin, as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life.|$|E

5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{political}} conditions in what would become a united Kingdom of Italy only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was enormous. (For background information, see History of Italy during foreign <b>domination</b> and the unification.) The libbra (pound) generally consisted of the standard twelve ounces, however.|$|E

5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to {{have been a number of}} small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian <b>domination</b> at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian <b>domination.</b>|$|E
5|$|New Formulation {{reviewer}} Michael Glavin cited Newman's {{ignorance of}} the initiative of anarchists to decentralize power and of anarchist forms of organisation such as trade unions, federations and affinity groups as evidence that he failed to understand power and wrongly conflated it with <b>domination.</b>|$|E

In the 17th century, the city decayed due to revolts, plagues, and famines, but in the following century, it grew from 16,000 to 30,000 inhabitants; commerce remained of local importance, while its military position in the Kingdom of Naples remained notable.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} role {{is played by}} multiple <b>dominations.</b> Multiple <b>dominations</b> {{can be used to}} construct hierarchical overlay networks in peer-to-peer applications for more efficient index searching. The hierarchical overlay networks usually serve as distributed databases for index searching, e. g. in modern file sharing and instant messaging computer network applications. Dominating sets of several kinds are used for balancing efficiency and fault tolerance {{as well as in the}} distributed construction of minimum spanning trees. Another good example of direct, important and quickly developing applications of multiple <b>dominations</b> in modern computer networks is a wireless sensor network. A wireless sensor network (WSN) usually consists of up to several hundred small autonomous devices to measure some physical parameters. Each device contains a processing unit and a limited memory as well as a radio transmitter and a receiver to be able to communicate with its neighbors. Also, it contains a limited power battery and is constrained in energy consumption...|$|R
