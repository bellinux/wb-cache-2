5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E
25|$|At 29, McQueen got a {{significant}} break when Frank Sinatra removed Sammy Davis, Jr., {{from the film}} Never So Few after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen's character, Bill Ringa, was never more comfortable than when driving at high speed—in this case in a jeep—or handling a switchblade or a tommy gun.|$|E
25|$|The pair {{looked to}} close England's lead, but again the England bowlers intervened – {{this time in}} the shape of the {{invisible}} man in England's attack, Simon Jones, who <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> reverse swing and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's tail – thought to be strengthened by the absence of McGrath, were all dismissed for single-figure scores, Andrew Flintoff taking the two last men lbw with the two last balls, although there was some argument about the first dismissal.|$|E

60|$|That evening {{it began}} to snow, with the wind strong in the east. Me and Idaho moved camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain, {{thinking}} {{it was only a}} November flurry. But after falling three foot on a level it went to work in earnest; and we knew we was snowed in. We <b>got</b> in <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> firewood before it got deep, and we had grub enough for two months, so we let the elements rage and cut up all they thought proper.|$|R
25|$|The pair {{looked to}} close England's lead and batted unbeaten after tea for eight overs, but again the England bowlers intervened, {{this time in}} the shape of Simon Jones, who <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> reverse swing both ways and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's last four, which now {{included}} Michael Kasprowicz who had a batting average 10 runs higher than McGrath, were nevertheless all dismissed for single-figure scores, Flintoff taking the two last men LBW with the two last balls, although there was some argument about whether the first dismissal, that of Gillespie, was actually out or not. Meanwhile, Ashley Giles' return of three for 78, including Ponting, Clarke and Warne, was to be his best bowling figures all series.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{practice}} {{in their last}} ODI of the group stage, but were found lacking after resting their best bowlers, Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori. Nehra and Pathan, India's opening bowlers, were taken for runs early on as they sought for wickets but the openers Fleming and Astle escaped, adding 44 in the first 10 overs before Fleming let himself loose {{with a couple of}} aerial shots on the off side to take ten off an over from Pathan. Agarkar, who had come on for Nehra earlier, then had Astle caught behind for 11, but Vincent and Fleming continued to punish the bowling, {{and by the end of}} 15 overs they were 81 for 1 – Nehra having conceded 35 in five overs. However, once again Agarkar was responsible for a breakthrough, running out Fleming with a good throw after having picked up the ball in his follow-through.|$|E
25|$|This match was, in effect, a semi-final, {{with both}} teams needing a win {{to proceed to}} the final with Sri Lanka. Rahul Dravid won the toss and chose to bat. His {{teammates}} were immediately worried by the hostile bowling of the West Indian seamers who <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> swing and awkward bounce. It was enough to send Sourav Ganguly out of the match with an arm injury in the fourth over, and Virender Sehwag and V. V. S. Laxman were also dismissed early. Effectively, India were three batsmen down for 21 at that point. Dravid and Yuvraj Singh rebuilt with a 30-run partnership when Omari Banks struck with his first ball bowling out Dravid, reducing India to 51/3 after 16 overs. Singh, however, kept his calm, and was well supported by Mohammad Kaif (83*), putting together 165 runs off 178 balls for the fourth wicket. The pair took runs off Narsingh Deonarine in particular, clubbing hi for 69 in eight overs, while the seamers Deighton Butler, Tino Best and Daren Powell were not used for the full ten overs. Singh was eventually got out for 110, sweeping Best to short fine leg. Blitz by Mahendra Singh Dhoni (28*) in the final overs which included two sixes, lifted India to 262/4.|$|E
5000|$|The {{march was}} written around 1889 in Ulm, Germany, by {{military}} music composer Carl Teike. Teike wrote many pieces for the marching band of Grenadier-Regiment König Karl (5.

When bringing his newly composed {{march to the}} regiment, the Kapellmeister Oelte simply told him: [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> enough <b>of</b> musical marches, put this one in the stove!". This episode eventually led to Teike taking his leave of the band and naming the march as [...] "Alte Kameraden". Teike later worked {{as a police officer}} but also continued composing military marches, adding up to approximately 100 in total.|$|R

The song also features two lines by Diddy ("Hey, what up girl?" [...] and [...] "Let's go!") Lyrically, the song speaks about [...] "excess pleasures, from drinking ('Ain't got a {{care in the}} world but I <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> beer') to men ('We kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger')."

500|$|Hogg and her {{brothers}} were avid art collectors; she owned a large collection, including Native American art and works by Picasso, Chagall, Matisse and Modigliani. Her interest in collecting began during her convalescence in Philadelphia. Her first purchase, in 1922, was a Spanish foot chair or Queen Anne maple chair with carved feet. She researched the early American furniture market extensively, personally visiting Luke Vincent Lockwood, {{the author of}} the standard work on the topic, for more information. At the time, Hogg was one of a small number of people who believed that American antiques had value—by contrast, most collectors concentrated on furniture built in Europe. Other collectors soon saw the value in early American pieces. Hogg remained one of the few collectors not located on the East Coast. As her collection grew, she was often asked to loan pieces for exhibit in New England; Hogg always refused, stating [...] "they've <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> these things up there".|$|E

According to Nintendo Power, Mileena's original powers [...] "may prove insufficient" [...] for using her with same effectiveness in UMK3 in which most of the other characters got some additional special moves. Sega Saturn Magazine wrote that [...] "she's pretty much identical to the last time." [...] On the other hand, Total 64 wrote that Mileena of Trilogy (directly based on UMK3 version) is [...] "a damn good fighter, has <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> powerful moves" [...] and is [...] "an all round classy fighting star!"

The mother had just entered Delilah in a baby contest. The curry effect on Delilah happened at the time her boastful mother had arranged for a journalist to take her photo. Her mother was similar to another mother called [...] "Mrs Proudpants" [...] who was boasting about her baby who she said was sure to win the contest, just like Delilah's mother.

According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast.

500|$|The Persona {{series has}} been {{referred}} to as the most popular spin-off from the Megami Tensei franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. Io9's James Whitbrook commented that while [...] "here in the west, we've <b>got</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane [...] "normal" [...] life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". Nintendo Power, in an article concerning the Megami Tensei series, cited the Persona series' [...] "modern-day horror stories" [...] and [...] "teams of Japanese high-school kids" [...] as the perfect example of the franchise. Persona was mentioned in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying [...] "Examining Persona reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. Persona 3 was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed Persona 3 and 4 in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list.
