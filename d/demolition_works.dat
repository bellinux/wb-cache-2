5|$|Original {{plans for}} a Water Coaster at Sea World were {{released}} by the local council in 2008; however, they were put on hold. In 2010, the Bermuda Triangle ride closed, sitting dormant until mid-2012 when construction for the Storm Coaster began. After <b>demolition</b> <b>works</b> were completed, track for the Storm Coaster arrived at Sea World, taking five months to erect. Storm Coaster officially {{opened to the public}} on 6 December 2013.|$|E

25|$|Restoration {{projects}} and plans have {{gone as far}} as the negotiation process, but none has come to fruition. Since 2011, <b>demolition</b> <b>works,</b> minor structural repairs, repairs of the roof structure, and covering the glass roof openings in the concourse have been performed. The basement, which was once full of water, has been fully drained, and a barbed wire fence has been installed in an attempt to keep out vandals and the windows in the tower have been replaced.|$|E
25|$|Without any {{ceremony}} or fanfare, the National Theatre {{boarded up}} its doors and {{pulled down the}} curtains on an eventful era for local theatre. Its last performance was held on 15 January 1984. Another landmark that was located within {{close proximity to the}} theatre, the Van Kleef Aquarium suffered the same fate too in 1996. The National Theatre Trust moved to the smaller Kallang Theatre in March 1986. <b>Demolition</b> <b>works</b> took place between June to August 1986, just as the Kallang Theatre opened to its first performance in June of that year. The site today remains empty, much like the site of the old national library building, another building close to the hearts of many Singaporeans.|$|E
25|$|East of the New Cross Gate railway {{tracks the}} railway land {{continues}} to be wide enough for the SCR to have passed with only limited <b>demolition</b> <b>works</b> required as it headed towards Lewisham town centre. At Lewisham the SCR would have merged with a spur from the north-west that was planned to run 0.75 miles along the New Cross railway line to end at a junction on New Cross Road (A2). The SCR would have crossed to {{the north side of}} the railway to skirt the town centre passing through industrial and commercial areas and crossing over the route now occupied by the Docklands Light Railway. Residential demolitions would have been required at the west end of Granville Park to clear the path but the route was then clear to Blackheath station.|$|E

25|$|Costing around £600,000 {{and begun}} on 18 August 2014, the building's {{brickwork}} and timber {{was built by}} the museum's own staff and apprentices, using Georgian bricks salvaged from <b>demolition</b> <b>works</b> to widen the A1. Unlike previous buildings built on the site, the museum had to replicate rather than relocate this one {{due to the fact}} that fewer buildings are being demolished compared to the 1970s, and in any case it was deemed unlikely one could be found to fit the curved shape of the plot. The studio is named after a real business run by John Reed Edis and his daughter Daisy. Mr Edis, originally at 27 Sherburn Road, Durham, in 1895, then 52 Saddler Street from 1897. The museum collection features several photographs, signs and equipment from the Edis studio. The name for the chemist is a reference to the business run by William Smith, who relocated to Silver Street, near the original building, in 1902. According to records, the original Edis company had been supplied by chemicals from the original (and still extant) Smith business.|$|E

It's gonna be a big one.". <b>Demolition</b> <b>works</b> began in August 2012. Due to this construction, nearby attractions, including Viking's Revenge Flume Ride, Jet Rescue and the Skyway, were intermittently closed throughout {{the latter part of}} 2012 and into 2013. The first pieces of ride track arrived on site in April 2013, with vertical construction commencing in the following month. An official announcement for Storm Coaster made by Sea World in May 2013 detailed the ride would feature [...] of track and a series of water and fire effects. Although an opening date of September 2013 was initially set, Sea World later revised this to be Summer 2013. By September 2013, the ride's track was complete, with focus moving towards theming and testing the ride. On 2 December 2013, Storm Coaster soft opened to the public, with an official opening held four days later.|$|E

2500|$|In 1929, Melbourne Gaol {{was closed}} for routine demolition, and the bodies in its {{graveyard}} were uncovered during the <b>demolition</b> <b>works.</b> During {{the recovery of the}} bodies, spectators and workers stole skeletal parts and skulls from a number of graves, including one marked with an arrow and the initials [...] "E. K." [...] in the belief they belonged to Ned Kelly. The E.K. marked grave was situated by itself, and {{on the opposite side of}} the yard where the rest of the graveyard was situated. The site foreman, Harry Franklin, retrieved the skull from the E.K. marked grave and gave it to the police. As no provision had been made for the disposal of the remains, Franklin had the bodies reburied in Pentridge prison at his own expense. The skull from the E.K. marked grave, which had been stored at the Victorian Penal Department was taken to Canberra for research by the first director of the Australian Institute of Anatomy (Sir Colin Mackenzie) in 1934. For a period of time it was lost, but was later found while cleaning out an old safe in 1952. In 1971, the Institute gave it to the National Trust.|$|E
