At a candidates' forum, Davis stated she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> best qualified for the position because of her 26 {{years of experience in}} the clerk's office.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, at 62, <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too old {{to travel}} to India, but two American {{supporters}} visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E

5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The Farrar {{children}} were all engaged in activities outside the home. Timothy played both soccer and ice hockey, while Kate was a ballerina with the State Ballet of Missouri {{by the age}} of ten. During this time, Farrar worked long hours and Green accompanied the children to their activities, though perception of her by other parents at the activities varied—some <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a supportive mother, while others believed she drove her children too hard and put down their efforts too often.|$|E
5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not cut back on her performance schedule; he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too busy, {{to the point of}} forgetting their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E
5|$|In early 2003, The Walt Disney Company and Square Enix {{confirmed}} {{the sequel to}} their commercially and critically acclaimed video game, Kingdom Hearts (2002). That July, the games creator Tetsuya Nomura aimed to have the game in stores by 2004, but several legal issues regarding the approval of characters and aesthetics from the Disney franchise obscured this, such as the Tarzan world being denied due {{to a change in}} ownership. Regarding the games theme song, the producer only had Utada in mind as he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> part of the franchise's family, and believed her music could break both foreign and international markets. But scheduling time with Nomura proved to be impossible, as the singer started work on her debut English album in her hometown New York City; she had been signed to Island Def Jam the previous year as their headquarters discovered her success in Japan. Though her debut Western release Exodus was a success in Japan, its commercial appeal was lacking in North America; after promoting it, she moved back to Tokyo to start recording her record Ultra Blue (2006).|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club {{when she was a}} student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E

25|$|Lorraine Heggessey became Controller of BBC One, a post {{she took}} up on 1 November 2000. She had {{previously}} been sounded out about the job in 1997 after Michael Jackson's departure, but had turned down the opportunity as she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> then not yet experienced enough.|$|E
25|$|She was {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tessa in The Constant Nymph (also 1943), wherein she would play opposite Errol Flynn. However, studio executive Jack L. Warner <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unsuitable and the part went to Joan Fontaine. The Australian-born actor Flynn was rejected because the director wanted a British actor.|$|E
25|$|Leonard became {{interested}} in Penny almost immediately after seeing {{her for the first}} time. His infatuation with Penny becomes the major force that drives the series during the first few seasons. By {{the end of the first}} season, Leonard finally manages to ask Penny out, and they have their first date. Subsequently, they break up because Penny <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not as smart as Leonard would like.|$|E

25|$|Garrett and {{her mother}} arrived in Manhattan {{in the summer of}} 1936 and Garrett began classes in September. Her {{teachers}} included Graham and Anna Sokolow for dance, Sandy Meisner for drama, Lehman Engel for music, and Margaret Webster for the Shakespearean classics, and fellow students included Daniel Mann and Richard Conte. She <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> destined to be a dramatic actress and shied away from playing comedic roles.|$|E
25|$|She {{took a job}} as an usher at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater for The Sound of Music, {{early in}} 1960. During the run of the play, she heard that the casting {{director}} was auditioning for more singers, and it marked the first time she sang in pursuit of a job. Although the director <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not right for the part, he encouraged her to begin including her talent as a singer on her résumé when looking for other work.|$|E
25|$|Catherine became {{pregnant}} and miscarried {{at least three}} times, and during a severe illness in 1663, she imagined, for a time, that she had given birth. Charles comforted her by telling her she had indeed given birth to two sons and a daughter. Her position was a difficult one, and though Charles continued to have children by his many mistresses, he insisted she be treated with respect, and sided with her against his mistresses when he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not receiving the respect she was due.|$|E

5000|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by city-based entrepreneur Vinod Agrawal. [...] "After knowing about Dutt's life I <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> an unsung literary hero.

25|$|During the task, {{a massive}} {{argument}} flared up when Sharon <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being sidelined in Invicta's decision making, {{despite the fact}} she had the most experience of the fashion industry, and accused her teammates of ganging up on her, angering Paul and Syed, the latter disgusted by this after {{walking out of the}} argument. After refusing to {{take an active role in}} the task on the second day, she quickly changed her mind after realising that Nick and Margaret were both watching her.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} over {{why she did}} not step up to do Renaissance's pitches, Claire {{answered that}} she would have been happy to have done so at the start, but <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> set up as a scapegoat after Kevin was initially dead set on doing so, but asked her later on in the task to take over. Sir Alan doubted any pitch of hers could have been worse than Kevin's, after noting that the theme had doomed the team, but advised her to step up if a similar situation arose again.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the judges}} of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her {{alongside}} his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri. After returning home, she was convinced by Jaya Bachchan to star opposite her son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's Aakhari Mughal. However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined.|$|E
