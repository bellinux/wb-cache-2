5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake venom {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated <b>just</b> <b>once</b> among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet.|$|E
5|$|Andrei Rublev {{was invited}} to the Cannes Film Festival in 1967 {{as part of a}} planned {{retrospective}} of Soviet film on occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The official answer was that the film was not yet completed and could not be shown at the film festival. A second invitation was made by the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival in 1969. Soviet officials accepted this invitation, but they only allowed the film to screen at the festival out of competition, and it was screened <b>just</b> <b>once</b> at 4 A.M. {{on the final day of}} the festival. Audience response nevertheless was enthusiastic, and the film won the FIPRESCI prize. Soviet officials tried to prevent the official release of the film in France and other countries, but were not successful as the French distributor had legally acquired the rights in 1969.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of the decade, the club won the league <b>just</b> <b>once</b> more in 1966–67. However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong {{position}} in Italian football. Under former player Čestmír Vycpálek, they won the scudetto in 1971–72 and 1972–73, with players such as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio and José Altafini breaking through. During {{the rest of}} the decade, they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title (the UEFA Cup) in 1977 and helped the club's domination continue on into {{the early part of the}} 1980s. During Trapattoni's tenure, many Juventus players also formed the backbone of the Italy national team during Enzo Bearzot's successful managerial era, including the 1978 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980 and 1982 world champion squads.|$|E

5|$|In the {{qualification}} {{tournament for}} the 2010 World Cup, they lost all ten matches played {{and failed to}} qualify. They conceded 47 goals in those fixtures, including 10 in a defeat by Poland, which became Poland's highest scoring victory of all time, and scored <b>just</b> <b>once,</b> in a 3–1 defeat by Slovakia. Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 started in a similar way, the first nine matches all being defeats with an aggregate of 49 goals conceded and none scored, their best result being a one-goal loss to Finland at home, with the worst being a heavy 11–0 loss to the Netherlands, which became the Netherlands' highest scoring victory of all time and San Marino's worst-ever away defeat. This was then followed up by two lighter defeats, a 5–0 home loss against Sweden, before completing the campaign with a 4–0 away loss to Moldova.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{regarding}} {{moves to}} the Premier League came to nothing. By October, Žigić had appeared <b>just</b> <b>once</b> for Valencia, in the UEFA Cup, and an opportunity arose to join his former club, Racing Santander, on an emergency loan. This depended on the league allowing Racing to release Luis Fernández on medical grounds, because of a degenerative condition of his knee, thus freeing up a space in the first-team squad. The LFP's medical committee decided that the condition was not yet clearly career-ending, so any agreement with Žigić had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window. In the meantime, he played in four more cup matches for Valencia, two domestic and two UEFA, and scored in three of them, but took no part in the league campaign.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick {{returned}} to Test cricket in May, scoring 106 against Sri Lanka {{to become the}} first Test centurion of the 2006 English season. The century proved to be the high point of Trescothick's Test summer, however, as he reached a half-century <b>just</b> <b>once</b> in the subsequent six Tests against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. This run of form was lifted later in the year by two ODI centuries, one apiece against Ireland and Sri Lanka. In September, he withdrew from the remaining ODIs against Pakistan and asked not to be considered for the forthcoming ICC Champions Trophy squad because of a stress-related illness. It was later believed likely that Trescothick had been suffering from clinical depression, which was also the cause of much of his trouble throughout 2006.|$|E

He scored seven his debut on 21 March at home against Lewes, which finished as a 2–0 victory. In Barrow's next match on 29 March, he was sent off against Weymouth {{for the second time}} that season after he received two yellow cards in the 3–0 away win, picking up the first for kicking the ball away {{in the first half and}} then a second in the 69th minute for a foul on Gavin Hoyte, resulting his dismissal. He made six appearances in the Conference National for Barrow, scoring once. On 2 May, McEvilly made one last appearance for Rochdale in their 1–0 home defeat to Gillingham, replacing Adam Rundle as a substitute in the 75th minute. Rochdale terminated his contract by mutual consent at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|In the Women's Quadrangular Series {{hosted by}} India in early 2007, Taylor was England's best {{performer}} with the bat. Despite her side losing {{all six of}} their group matches, she finished the tournament with the second-most runs of any player, totalling 346. She scored half-centuries against {{each of the other}} three teams competing—Australia, India and New Zealand—and also scored an unbeaten 113 in the first match against Australia. She had a relatively quiet domestic season in 2007, ranking sixth amongst run-scorers in the Super Fours, having passed 50 runs <b>just</b> <b>once,</b> and despite ranking second by both runs scored and batting average in the County Championship, Taylor only scored two half-centuries in her five appearances in that competition. England started the summer with four Twenty20 matches, one against South Africa and three against New Zealand, in which Taylor made three scores of 20 or more, but did not reach a half-century. In the third ODI against New Zealand, she scored her sixth century in the format, but her 110 runs came from 133 deliveries, and the Wisden series report suggests that the scoring rate was too slow: New Zealand chased down the total in fewer than 36 overs. In the next match, Taylor scored 72 as England attempted to chase down 240 runs to win, but they were eventually bowled out 43 runs short. Though she only made small totals in the other three matches of the series, Taylor finished as the leading run-scorer in the series, though New Zealand's Aimee Watkins had a superior batting average. Her performances over the year from August 2006 resulted in Taylor being shortlisted for the ICC Women's Cricketer of the Year award, alongside Australia's Lisa Sthalekar and the eventual winner, India's Jhulan Goswami. During the voting period, Taylor scored three centuries and three half-centuries in international cricket.|$|E
5|$|The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke {{brought in}} Bill Sharman as head coach, and Elgin Baylor {{announced}} his retirement {{early in the season}} after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough. Sharman increased the team's discipline. He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots. They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December. They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104. By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in American professional sports. The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96. Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game. West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game. The team failed to score 100 points <b>just</b> <b>once</b> all year, {{and at the end of}} the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year. The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
