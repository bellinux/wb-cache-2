40|$|This study {{documents}} the helminth assemblages of grassland melomys: Melomys burtoni (Ramsay, 1887), Melomys sp. cf. burtoni and Melomys lutillus (Thomas, 1913). In total, 22 helminth species comprising one cestode and 21 nematodes from 112 hosts were found. All the specimens of Physaloptera spp. examined {{proved to be}} Physaloptera banfieldi Johnson & Mawson, 1941 with P. trouhtoni Johnston & Mawson, 1941 the junior synonym. The dominant helminth group was the trichostrongyloid nematodes including Odilia melomyos (Mawson, 1961) and O. mackerrasae (Mawson, 1961). The most prevalent, O. melomyos, occurred {{in each of the}} host species across all areas sampled (New South Wales, Northern Territory, Papua New Guinea, Queensland and Western Australia). The helminth assemblage of M. burtoni from hosts from New South Wales and Queensland was the most diverse. The helminths of M. burtoni from the Northern Territory and of M. lutillus from Papue New Guinea were subsets of that assemblage. That of M. cf. burtoni from Western Australia, with only six helminth species, was not dominated by trichostrongyloids, three of the six species were not found in other localities, and, with Sorensen's Indices of 18. 2 % when compared with the helminths from Papua New Guinea and Northern Territory and 24 % when compared with Queensland, was the least similar. No substantial {{differences were found between the}} helminth assemblages of the grassland melomys group, excluding M. cf. burtoni and Melomys cervinipes (Gould, 1852), the <b>fawn</b> <b>footed</b> melomys. This was reflected in a Sorensen's Index of 67. 9 % The time between the arrival of Melomys into Australia during the Pleistocene and the present day suggests that the trichostrongyloids O, melomyos, O mackerrasae and O mawsonae (Durette-Desset, 1969) may have travelled with their rodent hosts from New Guinea to Australia and other helminths in the assemblace may have been acquired in Australia...|$|R

60|$|Fanny {{inherited}} {{yet another}} sinecure; {{and it was}} not envy on my side that helped her to shine in it, though I had my fits of jealousy. She was determined to please; and when Fanny made up her mind, circumstances seemed just to <b>fawn</b> at her <b>feet.</b> Life became a continuous game of chess, the moves of which at times kept me awake and brooding in a far from wholesome fashion in my bed. Pawn of pawns, and one at the point of being sacrificed, I could only squint at the board. Indeed, I deliberately shut my eyes to my own insignificance, strutted about, sulked, sharpened my tongue like a serpent, and became a perfect pest to myself when alone. Yet I knew in my heart that those whom I hoped to wound merely laughed at me behind my back, that I was once more proving to the world that the smaller one is the greater is one's vanity.|$|R
60|$|His {{appearance}} on the threshold was like a flash. They heard his flying feet down the hall, and without a moment's hesitation they all followed. The Professor led the way down a narrow and concealed path, but {{when they reached the}} little clearing in which the hut was situated, they were unable to approach any nearer. The place was a whirlwind of flame. The smell of kerosene was almost overpowering. The wild yell of the leopard rose above the strange, half-human gibbering of the monkeys and the hoarse, bass calling of another voice, at the sound of which Lenora and even Quest shuddered. Then, as they came, breathless, to a standstill, they saw a strange thing. One side of the hut fell in, and almost immediately the leopard with a mighty spring, leapt from the place and ran howling into the undergrowth. The monkeys followed but they came straight for the Professor, wringing their hands. They <b>fawned</b> at his <b>feet</b> as though trying to show him their scorched bodies. Then for a single moment they saw the form of the ape-man as he struggled to follow the others. His strength failed him, however. He fell backwards into the burning chasm.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. 9. 'They fawn on {{the proud}} feet that spurn them lying low.' In the Pisan edition we read 'that spurn {{them as they}} go.' No doubt the change (introduced as in other {{instances}} named on pp. 105 and 113) must be Shelley's own. The picture presented to the mind is more consistent, according to the altered reading. The critics, as we are told in this stanza, had at first 'fled' from Byron's arrow; afterwards they 'fawned on his proud feet.' In order to do this, they must have paused in their flight, and returned; and, {{in the act of}} <b>fawning</b> on Byron's <b>feet,</b> they must have crouched down, or were 'lying low.' (Mr. Forman, in his edition of Shelley, pointed this out.) With the words 'as they go' the image was not self-consistent: for the critics could not be 'going,' or walking away, at the same time when they were fawning on the poet's feet. This last remark assumes that the words 'as they go' mean 'as the critics go ': but perhaps (and indeed I think this is more than probable) the real meaning was 'as the feet of Byron go'--as Byron proceeds disdainfully on his way. If this was Shelley's original meaning, he probably observed after a while that the words 'as they go' seem to follow on with 'they fawn,' and not with 'the proud feet'; and, in order to remove the ambiguity, he substituted the expression 'lying low.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{hear your}} task {{and see the}} shape into which {{circumstances}} have molded my design. I would have you exercise a self-restraint that shall leave Gilbert no hold upon you, accept all invitations like that which you refused when we passed him {{on the threshold of}} the billiard room an hour ago, and seem to find in such amusements the same fascination as himself. Your skill in games of chance excels his, as you proved at home where these pastimes lose their disreputable aspect by being openly enjoyed. Therefore I would have you whet this appetite of his by losing freely at first--he will take a grim delight in lessening the fortune he covets--then exert all your skill till he is deeply in your debt. He has nothing but what is doled out to him by Babie's father, I find; he dare not ask help there for such a purpose; other resources have failed else he would not have married; and if the sum be large enough, it lays him under an obligation which will be a thorn in his flesh, the sharper for your knowledge of his impotence to draw it out. When this is done, or even while it is in progress, I would have you add the pain of a new jealousy to the old. He neglects this young wife of his, and she is eager to recover the affections she believes she once possessed. Help her, and teach Gilbert the value of what he now despises. You are young, comely, accomplished, and possessed of many graces more attractive than you are conscious of; your southern birth and breeding gift you with a winning warmth of manners in strong contrast to the colder natures around you; and your love for me lends an almost tender deference to your intercourse with all womankind. Amuse, console this poor girl, and show her husband what he should be; I have no fear of losing your heart nor need you fear for hers; she is one of those spaniel-like creatures who love the hand that strikes them and <b>fawn</b> upon the <b>foot</b> that spurns them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My money," [...] he continued, [...] "was no large sum, but I eked it {{out with}} gambling. The luck was always on my side. It's quite true that I ruined {{the father of the}} young lady who paid me a visit to-day. After a {{somewhat}} chequered career he was settling down in a merchant's office in Montreal when I met him. His luck at cards was as bad as mine was good. I won all he had, and more. I believe that he committed suicide. A man there was kind to me, asked me to his house--I persuaded his wife to run away with me. These are amongst the slightest of my delinquencies. I steeped myself in sin. I revelled in it. I seemed to myself in some way to be showing my defiance for the hidden powers of life which I had cursed. I played a match with evil by day and by night until I was glutted. And then I stole away from the city, leaving behind a hideous reputation and not a single friend. Then a new mood came to me. I wanted to get to a place where I should see no human beings at all, and escape in that way from the memories which were still like a clot upon my brain. So I set my face westwards. I travelled till at last civilization lay behind. Still I pushed onward. I had stores in plenty, an Indian servant who chanced to be faithful, and whom I saw but twice a day. At last I reached Lake Ono. Here between us we built a hut. I sent my Indian away then, and when he <b>fawned</b> at my <b>feet</b> to stay I kicked him. This was my third phase of living, and it was true that some measure of sanity came back to me. Oh, the blessed relief of seeing the face of neither man nor woman. It was the unpeopled world of Nature--uncorrupted, fresh, magnificent, alive by day and by night with everlasting music of Nature. The solitudes of those great forests were like a wonderful balm. So the fevers were purged out of me, and I became once more an ordinary human being. I was content, I think, to die there, for I had plenty to eat and drink, and the animals and birds who came to me morning and evening kept me from even the thought of loneliness. The rest is obvious. I lost two cousins in South Africa, an uncle in the hunting-field. A man in Montreal had recognized me. I was discovered. But before I returned I killed Brooks, the police-court missionary. This girl has forced me to bring him to life again." ...|$|R
