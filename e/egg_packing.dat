40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the internal quality of white-shelled consume eggs, sanitized or not, stored under different packaging conditions at room temperature. It was used 300 eggs, distributed in a completely randomized experimental design in a 3 × 2 × 4 + 1 factorial arrangement, three packaging conditions (PVC film, partial vacuum, partial vacuum with oxygen gas absorber), storage period (7, 14, 21 and 28 days), sanitized or not, and control (fresh eggs), with four repetitions. At {{the end of each}} period the analysis were performed. Partial vacuum condition was able to maintained Haugh unit, and promoted the best results for yolk index. The weight maintenance was better when packaged under vacuum, with or without O 2 sachets absorbers. Lower values of water activity were obtained in <b>eggs</b> <b>packed</b> in PVC film, and when the sanitation was performed. It can be concluded that the internal egg quality decreases with storage time sharper in the <b>eggs</b> <b>packed</b> in PVC film, because vacuum has preserved some features of them.

50|$|Chief {{among the}} {{community}} members who financially and otherwise supported Olga Averbuch following her brother's death was Jane Addams. Addams' Hull House assisted many Eastern European Jewish immigrants since its establishment in 1889, near Averbuch's neighborhood. Addams {{did not believe}} Shippy's version of events, and was moved by Olga's inability to get even a proper burial for her brother. Addams mobilized the resources of Hull House and raised at least $10,000, {{perhaps as much as}} $40,000, for Olga and for her brother's burial. Addams was also instrumental starting the independent investigation into Averbuch's death. She hired lawyer Harold LeClair Ickes for what would be his first case. He ordered Averbuch's body exhumed, and had an independent autopsy performed. This autopsy showed that Averbuch was fatally wounded by a shot from behind, and that he was shot at least once from above. Ickes discovered that Averbuch's brain was removed (a violation of civil and Jewish law), but he kept this information private until some years later. The evidence of this autopsy, as well as the testimony of Olga Averbuch and Lazarus Averbuch's boss at the <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> facility were presented at the coroner's inquest on March 24, 1908. However, the jury decided the shooting was justified, and Shippy and Foley were exonerated.|$|E
40|$|The {{criteria}} for assessing {{external and internal}} quality of eggs include such diverse and important aspects as safety, nutritional, organoleptic and technological properties of eggs and is influenced by {{a broad range of}} factors such as the physiology, genetics, nutrition and management of the hens. Genetics are an efficient tool to improve quality but historically egg productivity was the first priority producing spectacular improvement. Selection for egg quality was used mainly to avoid any negative shift in eggshell quality or internal defect. However, internal quality has taken on greater importance for about 10 years and development of molecular genetics is promising for selecting hens with superior egg quality. Nutrition is important for controlling eggshell quality and can successfully enrich the egg in some minor components of interest for human nutrition. The system of production influences the hygienic quality of eggs, This is particularly true in the alternative systems to cage production. Egg safety can have a very large impact on egg consumption and is highly dependant on government regulation. A promising area for improvement is the development of non invasive and rapid physical techniques to measure eggshell and internal egg quality at the <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> plant. The sensitivity of this technique can enlarge the number of downgraded egg but eliminate egg at risk for the consumers and is also providing new tools for genetic selection. Egg quality has therefore been continuously improved as has the demand for higher quality eggs from the consumers...|$|E
40|$|Improved {{sanitation}} procedures during {{shell egg}} processing {{may reduce the}} risk of food-borne illness. Experiments were conducted to determine the ability of an alcohol-quaternary ammonium sanitizer or water to reduce Salmonella inoculated onto stainless steel and shell egg processing equipment. A nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella typhimurium (ST) isolate was grown on agar plates at 37 °C for 18 - 24 h; cells were harvested and added to Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to generate 8. 5 Salmonella cells/mL inoculum in two experiments. Both experiments were repeated twice. In the first experiment four stainless steel beakers were contaminated by spraying 10 mL of inoculum, respectively. Beakers were allowed to dry for 15 min. Two of the beakers were sprayed with 20 mL of water and the other two were sprayed with a sanitizer solution (70 % isopropyl alcohol and 200 ppm quaternary ammonium). After 5 min and 24 h each beaker was swabbed with a PBS moistened sponge and plated onto BGS supplemented with 200 ppm nalidixic acid to enumerate surviving ST. In the second experiment, inoculum was sprayed onto two brushes from shell <b>egg</b> <b>packing</b> machinery. After 15 min, one brush was sprayed with water for five min and the other was sprayed with the sanitizer for 30 s. Each brush was sampled by swabbing three times after 5 min and 24 h. After 5 min, 5. 5 and 0. 6 log CFU/mL ST and after 24 h, 2. 8 and 0. 0 log CFU/mL ST were recovered from stainless steel, respectively. Packer head brush average results were 4. 7 and 3. 1 log CFU/mL ST after 5 min and were 4. 0 and 0. 00 log CFU/ml ST after 24 h.

The aim {{of the present study}} is to assess the internal quality of <b>eggs</b> <b>packed</b> under modified atmosphere and stored at room temperature. Six hundred and twelve fresh commercial eggs from 38 -week old Hisex White laying hens were used. The present study was conducted in a completely randomized experimental design in a 4 x 4 + 1 factorial arrangement [vacuum, vacuum with oxygen gas (O 2) absorbent, vacuum with oxygen gas (O 2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) absorbents, vacuum with oxygen gas (O 2) absorbent and carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas generator; storage times (7, 14, 21 and 28 days), control group (fresh eggs) ], with three repetitions (12 eggs each). The following factors were assessed: weight maintenance during storage; Haugh unit; color and yolk index. The modified atmosphere packaging maintained the weight of the eggs during a period of 28 days. Vacuum packaging with O 2 absorbent and CO 2 gas generator was more efficient in maintenance of egg quality, based on the values ​​of Haugh unit and yolk index. The luminosity of the yolk was preserved during the 28 storage days in all of the packaging types used.

40|$|Female Eledone cirrhosa held in {{aquarium}} {{conditions for}} {{periods of time}} of five daysand over show relatively enlarged ovary sizes. Values for ovary index considerably exceed thoseof freshly caught animals and the incidence of {{the final stage of}} maturity, in which <b>eggs</b> <b>pack</b> the oviducts, is greater. A comparison of maturity indices for fresh and aquarium males was inconclusive. The range of factors associated with aquarium conditions is briefly reviewed and it is concluded that studies of cephalopod reproductive maturation must distinguish fresh and aquarium animals. Introduction External factors effective in inducing sexual maturation in cephalopods have been suggested several times. The influence of the absence of light has been implicated since the experiments of Wells & Wells (1959) showed that blinded Octopus vulgar is matured precociously. An effect of short day length in stimulating the optic glands of Sepia has been found by Defretin & Richard (1967) and Richard (1967) but this is not clearly the case for Octopus (Buckley, 1977). Octopuses kept in aquarium conditions for lengthy periods are said to have larger relative gonad sizes than those fresh from the sea (Wells & Wells, 1975). One of the factors associated with aquarium conditions is often a degree of starvation, and this circumstance alone is held to be a factor in inducing precocious sexual maturation in Eledone (Mangold & Boucher-Rodoni, 1973). In the course of recent studies on the growth and reproduction of Eledone cirrhosa from the North Sea (Boyle & Knobloch, 1982, 1983, 1984) animals which had remained in aquarium conditions for 5 days or over were separated from the analysis...|$|R

Pinguin launched its newly assembled seaplane in order to snatch the ship's wireless aerials or if necessary to bomb her. The seaplane failed to snatch the aerials on its first attempt. The aircrew then dropped a weighted bag onto the ship's bridge with a message commanding her captain to stop his engines and to maintain radio silence or be attacked. The commands were not obeyed, and the ship's radio operator sent signals reporting {{that they were being}} attacked from the air. The seaplane then dropped two small bombs in front of the ship. A second attempt was made to snatch the aerials which succeeded. The seaplane came under machine-gun and rifle fire hitting it several times. The seaplane fired back. The seaplane was forced to land on the water with a perforated petrol tank and one of its floats damaged. The aircrew crouched down in the cockpit, expecting the freighter's gunners to finish them off, which they could easily have done. Pinguin slowed down to half speed and in a risky manoeuvre ‘dropped’ a boat with a three-man crew beside the seaplane then pursued the cargo ship. Pinguins battle flag was hoisted and at the maximum effective range of 12 nmi km for the 150 mm guns she opened fire. Two salvos were fired, one long and the other falling short, forcing the cargo ship to a halt. A boarding party identified the ship as the coal-burning refrigeration ship Maimoa.

The impact of garlic treatment in goats naturally infected with Haemonchus contortus and Coccidia was evaluated by measuring fecal <b>egg</b> counts, <b>packed</b> cell volume, FAMACHA scores, and body weight. Goats were exposed to four dosage levels of concentrated (99. 3 %) garlic juice (2. 5 ml, 5 ml, and 10 ml) during four weeks. There was a significant decrease in fecal counts of Coccidia eggs in goats treated with 10 ml of garlic juice (group 4; p 0. 05). However, at the intermediate dose of garlic (5 ml), goat body weight was significantly increased (group 3; p< 0. 05). Packed cell volume and FAMACHA scores did not show significant changes. These studies have implications for the control of Coccidia in goats. Garlic extract contributes to the alleviation of gastrointestinal infections in goats by reducing the Coccidia burden and may enhance animal performance in adult goats...|$|R
