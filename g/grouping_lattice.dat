40|$|Four-dimensional twisted <b>group</b> <b>lattices</b> {{are used}} as models for space-time structure. Compared to other {{attempts}} at space-time deformation, they have two main advantages: They have a physical interpretation {{and there is no}} difficulty in putting field theories on these structures. We present and discuss ordinary and gauge theories on twisted <b>group</b> <b>lattices.</b> We solve the free field theory case by finding all the irreducible representations. The non-abelian gauge theory on the two-dimensional twisted <b>group</b> <b>lattice</b> is also solved. On twisted <b>group</b> <b>lattices,</b> continuous space-time translational and rotational symmetries are replaced by discrete counterparts. We discuss these symmetries in detail.

40|$|Recently, {{the skyline}} {{computation}} and analysis have been extended from one single full space to multidimensional subspaces, {{which can lead}} to valuable insights in some applications. Particularly, compressed skyline cubes in the form of skyline groups and their decisive subspaces provide a succinct summarization and compression of multidimensional subspace skylines. However, computing skyline cubes remains a challenging task since the existing methods have to search an exponential number of nonempty subspaces for subspace skylines. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method, Stellar, which exploits an interesting skyline <b>group</b> <b>lattice</b> on a small subset of objects which are in the skyline of the full space. We show that this skyline <b>group</b> <b>lattice</b> is easy to compute and can be extended to the skyline <b>group</b> <b>lattice</b> on all objects. After computing the skyline in the full space, Stellar only needs to enumerate skyline groups and their decisive subspaces using the full space skyline objects. Avoiding searching for skylines in an exponential number of subspaces improves the efficiency and the scalability of subspace skyline computation substantially in practice. An extensive performance study verifies the merits of our new method. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a series}} of {{publications}} we developed "differential geometry" on discrete sets based on concepts of noncommutative geometry. In particular, {{it turned out that}} first order differential calculi (over the algebra of functions) on a discrete set are in bijective correspondence with digraph structures where the vertices are given by the elements of the set. A particular class of digraphs are Cayley graphs, also known as <b>group</b> <b>lattices.</b> They are determined by a discrete group G and a finite subset S. There is a distinguished subclass of "bicovariant" Cayley graphs with the property that ad(S) S is contained in S. We explore the properties of differential calculi which arise from Cayley graphs via the above correspondence. The first order calculi extend to higher orders and then allow to introduce further differential geometric structures. Furthermore, we explore the properties of "discrete" vector fields which describe deterministic flows on <b>group</b> <b>lattices.</b> A Lie derivative with respect to a discrete vector field and an inner product with forms is defined. The Lie-Cartan identity then holds on all forms for a certain subclass of discrete vector fields. We develop elements of gauge theory and construct an analogue of the lattice gauge theory (Yang-Mills) action on an arbitrary <b>group</b> <b>lattice.</b> Also linear connections are considered and a simple geometric interpretation of the torsion is established. By taking a quotient with respect to some subgroup of the discrete group, generalized differential calculi associated with so-called Schreier diagrams are obtained.

40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>lattices</b> (Cayley digraphs) of a {{discrete}} group are in natural correspondence with differential calculi on the group. On such a differential calculus geometric structures can be introduced following general recipes of noncommutative differential geometry. Despite of the non-commutativity between functions and (generalized) differential forms, for the subclass of ``bicovariant'' <b>group</b> <b>lattices</b> considered {{in this work}} {{it is possible to}} understand central geometric objects like metric, torsion and curvature as ``tensors'' with (left) covariance properties. This ensures that tensor components (with respect to a basis of the space of 1 -forms) transform in the familiar homogeneous way under a change of basis. There is a natural compatibility condition for a metric and a linear connection. The resulting (pseudo-) Riemannian geometry is explored in this work. It is demonstrated that the components of the metric are indeed able to properly describe properties of discrete geometries like lengths and angles. A simple geometric understanding in particular of torsion and curvature is achieved. The formalism has much in common with lattice gauge theory. For example, the Riemannian curvature is determined by parallel transport of vectors around a plaquette (which corresponds to a biangle, a triangle or a quadrangle).
