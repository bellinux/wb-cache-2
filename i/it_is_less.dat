5|$|Cèpe des pins ("pine tree cep"; Boletus pinophilus or Boletus pinicola) grows among pine trees. Rarer than B.edulis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> {{appreciated}} by gourmets {{than the two}} other kinds of porcini, but remains a mushroom rated above most others.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Shade of Pale' is {{an unusual}} pale-pink flowered form of T.speciosissima. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> {{vigorous}} than the parent plant. It was initially promoted as 'Light Shade of Pale' but there can only be three words in a registered cultivar name.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a large bony frill {{and three}} horns on its large four-legged body, and {{possessing}} similarities {{with the modern}} rhinoceros, Triceratops {{is one of the}} most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. It shared the landscape with and was probably preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> certain that the two did battle in the manner often depicted in traditional museum displays and popular images.|$|E

5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|Clotted {{cream can}} be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, {{especially}} clotted cream from Devon, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout southwest England in the production of ice cream and fudge.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{galactose}} {{does not}} occur {{in the free state}} but is a constituent with glucose of the disaccharide lactose or milk sugar. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> sweet than glucose.

5|$|It is a bird of open sclerophyll forests, {{eucalypt}} and acacia woodlands and scrublands, with sparse or no understory, or low {{cover with}} shrubs such as Triodia, Lomandra or Hibbertia. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> common in mallee scrub. In arid areas and northern Australia, {{it is more}} restricted to woodland alongside rivers and billabongs. It has become more common in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that two billion cases of gastroenteritis resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children {{and those in the}} developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those below age five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in about 700,000 deaths. In the developing world children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity.|$|E
5|$|Koningsdag is also {{celebrated in}} Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, {{constituent}} {{countries of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> widely celebrated on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, {{also a part of}} the Kingdom, where the local celebration of Dia di Rincon (held on 30 April) is more popular.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the time}} of the prophet, a solar eclipse happened. People hurried to link this to a worldly event, namely, the death of the prophet's son, Ibrahim. The prophet {{explained}} the truth of this matter to them. In his Sahih, Imam Muslim reported that `A'ishah said: There was a solar eclipse in {{the time of}} the Messenger of Allah. He stood up to pray and prolonged his standing very much. He then bowed and prolonged very much his bowing. He then raised his head and prolonged his standing much, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than the (duration) of the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged bowing much, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than the duration of his first bowing. He then prostrated and then stood up and prolonged the standing, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged his bowing, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than the first bowing. He then lifted his head and then stood up and prolonged his standing, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged bowing and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than the first bowing. He then prostrated himself; then he turned about, and the sun had become bright, and he addressed the people. He praised Allah and lauded Him and said: [...] "The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death or on account of anyone's birth. So when you see them, glorify and supplicate Allah, observe the Prayer, give alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant than Allah when His servant or maid commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, by Allah, if you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little. O Allah, witness, I informed them." ...|$|R

5|$|Maltose {{is formed}} during the {{germination}} of certain grains, {{the most notable}} being barley, which is converted into malt, {{the source of the}} sugar's name. A molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> sweet than glucose, fructose or sucrose. It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase.|$|E
5|$|Separately, the Treaty of Nice {{establishes}} Brussels as {{the venue}} for all formal summits of the European Council after 2004. However some extraordinary sessions are sometimes held outside the city. The European Council's seat is however fixed by a declaration {{rather than a}} protocol, meaning <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> binding than the other seats.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{photoluminescence}} mapping, {{the energy}} of the excitation light can be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E

50|$|Imagine a {{world without}} bees. Not only would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> {{colourful}} — with fewer wildflowers and flowering plants — <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>less</b> fruitful as well. A world without bees would mean {{a world where the}} food supply would be significantly diminished. Global bee researcher Laurence Packer estimates that bees are responsible for 1/3 of our food supply.|$|R

5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} part of Clifton Hall is {{the early}} 16th-century tower wing of the hall, {{often referred to as}} a pele tower. Despite this label, its construction date is relatively late compared to similar fortifications, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> robustly designed than equivalent towers in the region.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} {{recorded}} bites from this species {{compared to other}} venomous species such as cobras and vipers as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> aggressive and tends to avoid humans. If they do bite, it is usually in self-defense when accidentally grabbed. Most sea snake bites occur when fishermen attempt to untangle the snakes from their fishing nets.|$|E

5|$|Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous {{and highly}} {{crystalline}} transition metal in group 3. As expected by periodic trends, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> electronegative {{than its predecessor}} in the group, scandium, and less electronegative than the next member of period 5, zirconium; additionally, it is more electronegative to its successor in its group, lanthanum, being closer in electronegativity to the later lanthanides due to the lanthanide contraction. Yttrium is the first d-block element in the fifth period.|$|E
5|$|A {{widespread}} {{species with}} an almost cosmopolitan distribution, {{it has been reported}} from Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania), Asia (China, Himalayas, Japan, southern India), Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America (Brazil). It has been collected from subarctic areas of Greenland, and subalpine regions in Iceland. In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges from Alaska to Mexico, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> common in Central America. The species is popular on postage stamps, and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea, Paraguay, Romania, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>less</b> effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E
