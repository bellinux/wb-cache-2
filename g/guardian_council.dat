25|$|Presidential {{candidates}} and parliamentary candidates {{must be approved}} by the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> (all members of which are directly or indirectly elected by the Leader) or the Leader before running, in order to ensure their allegiance to the Supreme Leader. The Leader very rarely does the vetting himself directly, but has the power to do so, in which case additional approval of the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> would not be needed. The Leader can also revert the decisions of the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council.</b> The <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> can, and has dismissed some elected members of the Iranian parliament in the past. For example, Minoo Khaleghi was disqualified by <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> even after winning election, as she had been photographed in a meeting without wearing headscarf.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to reformist {{gains in the}} 2015-2016 election cycle, Khamenei lamented the loss of conservative clerics from the Assembly of Experts and suggested changes to the law by which the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> vets candidates may be needed because it is currently too difficult for the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> to vet so large a number of candidates.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> {{comprises}} twelve jurists, {{including six}} {{appointed by the}} Supreme Leader. Others are elected by the Parliament, from among the jurists nominated by the Head of the Judiciary. The Council interprets the constitution and may veto the Parliament. If a law is deemed incompatible with the constitution or Sharia (Islamic law), it is referred back to the Parliament for revision. The Expediency Council {{has the authority to}} mediate disputes between the Parliament and the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council,</b> and serves as an advisory body to the Supreme Leader, {{making it one of the}} most powerful governing bodies in the country. Local city councils are elected by public vote to four-year terms in all cities and villages of Iran.|$|E

25|$|The {{legislature}} of Iran, {{known as}} the Islamic Consultative Assembly, is a unicameral body comprising 290 members elected for four-year terms.

25|$|Today, as Supreme Leader, Khamenei is {{the head}} of state of Iran and the {{commander-in-chief}} of its armed forces. For this reason, he is considered the most powerful political authority in the country. As Supreme Leader, Khamenei can issue decrees and make the final decisions on the main policies of the government in many fields such as economy, the environment, foreign policy, national planning in Iran. According to Karim Sadjadpour, Khamenei has either direct or indirect control over the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, as well as the military and media. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), are vetted by the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council,</b> whose members are selected directly or indirectly by the Supreme Leader of Iran. There have been also instances when the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> reversed its ban of particular people after being ordered to do so by Khamenei.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Leader is the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces, controls the military intelligence and security operations, and has sole power to declare war or peace. The heads of the judiciary, the state radio and television networks, the commanders of the police and military forces, and six of the 12 members of the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> are directly appointed by the Supreme Leader.|$|E

Confirmed {{to run on}} 29 December 2004. IIPF, an influential reformist party in Iran, has mentioned that they won't support any presidential candidate outside the party, except Mousavi and Moeen. Since Mousavi has declined to run, they supported Moeen, whom they {{claimed to be the}} most probable candidate to win the approval of other parties in the reformist alliance. Some conservative Majlis representatives had asked for the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council's</b> rejection of Moeen, which happened finally but was reversed after a letter by Ayatollah Khamenei. Moeen had announced that he would choose Mohammad Reza Khatami as his First Vice President if he was elected, and had already chosen Elaheh Koulaee, a female representative of the sixth Islamic Assembly, as his spokeswoman.|$|R
50|$|The reformists and moderates, centrist {{allies of}} President Rouhani, made the “Alliance of Reformists and Government Supporters” {{or as the}} reformists named it, the “Pervasive Coalition of Reformists: The Second Step”, a name {{suggesting}} a sequel to the first step, 2013 presidential election victory. The coalition was headed by Mohammad Reza Aref and included pro-government moderate conservatives {{who were on the}} Followers of Wilayat fraction of Ali Larijani's companions, and aimed to prevent the hardliners from entering the parliament. Larijani himself was also backed by the list. Mohammad Khatami, who renamed the coalition to the “List of Hope” and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani endorsed the list, alongside Hassan Rouhani who tacitly supported them by sending text message to every cell phone encouraging citizens to “to build {{the future of the country}} with plenty of hope”. The moderates faced considerable challenges in the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council’s</b> vetting process and many of their lead figures were disqualified.|$|R

He sends a servant to request the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council's</b> help, when he talks to them asking them to help him fight off the voice. Then they all enter the void and talk to the voice where it promptly undoes all that it has done killing him. His final words were very important: [...] "Go to Algos Island." ...|$|R
25|$|In February 2004, Parliament elections, the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> banned {{thousands}} of candidates, including {{most of the}} reformist members of the parliament and all the candidates of the Islamic Iran Participation Front party from running. This led to a win by the conservatives of at least 70% of the seats. Approximately 60% of the eligible voting population participated in the elections.|$|E
25|$|As Supreme Leader, Khamenei has {{influence}} over elections in Iran since the Constitution of Iran {{allows him to}} appoint half {{of the members of}} the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> and the Chief Justice of Iran. The Constitution also establishes that the Council approves or disqualifies candidates for office while the Chief Justice presents the other half {{of the members of the}} Council to be selected by Parliament. These constitutional provisions give Khamenei direct and indirect {{influence over}} the Council; an entity that, in turn, has direct influence over who can run for government. This influence was evident in the 2004 parliamentary elections, in which the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> disqualified thousands of candidates from runningincluding 80 incumbents, many of the reformist members of Parliament, and all the candidates of the Islamic Iran Participation Front party. Subsequently, the conservatives won about 70% of parliamentary seats. The election became a key turning point in the country's political evolution as it marked the end of the campaign for political and social reform initiated by former President Mohammad Khatami.|$|E
25|$|Khatami is {{regarded}} as Iran's first reformist president, since the focus of his campaign was on the rule of law, democracy and the inclusion of all Iranians in the political decision-making process. However, his policies of reform led to repeated clashes with the hardline and conservative Islamists in the Iranian government, who control powerful governmental organizations like the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council,</b> whose members are appointed by the Supreme Leader. Khatami lost most of those clashes, {{and by the end}} of his presidency many of his followers had grown disillusioned with him.|$|E
40|$|Middle Eastern {{societies}} {{have their own}} inherent political ideas, {{which can not be}} understood by judging how far they have absorbed Western political values, such as the liberal democracy. One of these is the idea of nizam ash- Shura or the system of Consultation. This concept is central to what we may call Islamic democracy. There is a striking similarity between the ideas expressed in Dr. A. I. al-Ansari's recent books on the Shura system, which are based on Sunni Islamic Law, and the political structure of contemporary Iran, which is based on the Shi'i tradition. In any Islamic state, authority derives partly from Islamic Law, as interpreted by the scholars, partly from the Ummah, or the whole community of believers. The idea of the ShUra system, which insists that no ruler can govern without consulting both the scholars of Islamic Law and the Ummah, was developed during the medieval period, when hereditory monarchies prevailed. After the denial of hereditory monarchies in the modern period the concept established itself as the fbundation for the Islamic democracy. The parallel existence of the National Assembly and the <b>Guardians</b> <b>Council,</b> which has the power of veto over the Assembly's legislation, as. seen in Iran, derives directly from this system...|$|R
5000|$|Between 2006 and 2009, {{he was a}} {{research}} fellow funded by the UK Research Councils (RCUK) studying citizenship, governance and local politics, {{with a focus on}} forging links between academic research, national public policy and local practice. His main concern in this role was with the significance of citizen empowerment for democracy, wellbeing and social justice, and his attempts to challenge mainstream thinking on the impact and potential implications of New Labour's 'new localism' agenda frequently caused controversy. [...] His writing on local empowerment appeared in national newspapers and magazines, including the <b>Guardian,</b> Local <b>Council</b> Review, MJ and Clearway, and he regularly addressed policy and practitioner audiences. In recognition of his contribution to debates over empowerment and localism, he has been profiled by Regeneration and Renewal magazine and made a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Arts (FRSA).|$|R
50|$|By 1914, {{there were}} about 420 Labour representatives sitting on {{municipal}} Councils of various kinds, not including a few County councilors in the mining areas, or a much larger number on Boards of <b>Guardians,</b> Parish <b>Councils,</b> and District Councils. Aside from education, and the feeding and medical inspection and treatment of schoolchildren, the issues which the Labour Party pressed most urgently in local government were the local provision of work for the unemployed, the eight-hour workday, the adoption and enforcement of the Fair Wages Clause in public contracts, and fair wages and conditions for local authority employees. In some areas (particularly Birmingham and Glasgow) there was active pressure in support of municipal housing and slum clearance schemes, while there was also continued agitation (in relation to the Board of guardians) for improved treatment both of the unemployed and other classes of paupers, particularly the disabled and the aged. House-building, midway between a public health service and a trading enterprise, {{became one of the}} main planks in the Labour municipal platform.|$|R
25|$|When the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> {{announced}} the final {{list of candidates}} on 30 January, 125 reformist members of parliament declared that they would boycott the election and resign their seats, and the Reformist interior minister declared that the election would not be held on the scheduled date, 20 February. However, Khatami then announced that the election would be held on time, and he rejected the resignations of his cabinet ministers and provincial governors. These actions {{paved the way for}} the election to be held and signaled a split between the radical and moderate wings of the reformist movement.|$|E
25|$|He had a {{determining}} role in {{the dismissal}} of Abulhassan Banisadr as commander-in-chief of Iranian military and then his impeachment in the parliament as Iran's first president in June 1981. In the summer of 1981, he protested to the veto of the parliament's plan by the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> and informed it to Ruhollah Khomeini. This led {{to the establishment of}} Expediency Discernment Council, which later he chaired the council. He had an active role in Iran–Contra affair, which was divulged by Mehdi Hashemi and failed. Mehdi Hashemi was executed but Rafsanjani was the loser at internal dimension.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of killings of political prisoners occurred {{in the first decade of}} the Islamic Republic, after which violent repression lessened. With the rise of the Iranian reform movement and the election of moderate Iranian president Mohammad Khatami in 1997 numerous moves were made to modify the Iranian civil and penal codes in order to improve the human rights situation. The predominantly reformist parliament drafted several bills allowing increased freedom of speech, gender equality, and the banning of torture. These were all dismissed or significantly watered down by the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> and leading conservative figures in the Iranian government at the time.|$|E
50|$|Another body, the <b>Council</b> of <b>Guardians,</b> has {{the power}} to veto bills from majlis (parliament), approve or {{disapprove}} candidates who wish to run for high office (president, majlis, the Assembly of Experts). The council supervises elections, and can greenlight or ban investigations into the election process. Six of the <b>Guardians</b> (half the <b>council)</b> are faqih empowered to approve or veto all bills from the majlis (parliament) according to whether the faqih believe them to be in accordance with Islamic law and customs (Sharia). The other six members are lawyers appointed by the head of the judiciary (who is also a cleric and also appointed by the Leader).|$|R
50|$|The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (French: Comité des ministres du Conseil de l'Europe) or {{commonly}} the Committee of Ministers (French: Comité des ministres) is the Council of Europe's decision-making body. It {{comprises the}} Foreign Affairs Ministers {{of all the}} member states, or their permanent diplomatic representatives in Strasbourg. It is both a governmental body, where national approaches to problems facing European society can be discussed on an equal footing, and a collective forum, where Europe-wide responses to such challenges are formulated. In collaboration with the Parliamentary Assembly, it is the <b>guardian</b> of the <b>Council's</b> fundamental values, and monitors member states' compliance with their undertakings.|$|R
25|$|Rafsanjani became {{president}} of Iran after winning the 1989 election. He served another term by winning the election in 1993. In the 2005 election he ran for a third term in office, placing first {{in the first round}} of elections but ultimately losing to rival Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the run-off. He and his family faced political isolation for their support of the opposition in 2009. Rafsanjani entered the race for the 2013 presidential election, but he was disqualified by the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council.</b> With Hassan Rouhani's election, in which Rafsanjani openly supported him, the Rafsanjani family gradually recovered their political reputation. Rafsanjani died following a heart attack on 8 January 2017 in a hospital in Tehran at the age of 82.|$|E
25|$|It {{was rumored}} that Ahmadinejad would run for {{presidency}} again in 2017 after {{he did not}} deny plans when questioned by the media in 2015. Ahmadinejad remained mostly {{out of the public}} eye since leaving office, but his anti-Western rhetoric and combative style remained popular among many Iranian Principlists, and he was widely viewed as among the most formidable political figures capable of unseating Hassan Rouhani. In December 2015, it was reported that he had begun his presidential campaign by appointing his campaign's chiefs. He also began provincial travels in April 2016 by traveling to Amol. Travels were continued until September 2016, when he traveled to Gorgan. Ahmadinejad's advisors said his travels were not electoral and he only delivered speeches due to public demand. In September 2016, it was rumored that Ahmadinejad had asked Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran, for permission to run for the office and was rejected by Khamenei, who said that it was not in the best interests of Iran. On 26 September 2016, Ayatollah Khamenei confirmed the news, stated that it was only advice, not an order. It was the first time since Khamenei's election as Supreme Leader in 1989 that he advised a person to not run for election. Formerly, some candidates had asked him for advice (former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani for his campaign in 2005 and 2013), but Khamenei chose to not give his opinion on those occasions. The following day, Ahmadinejad officially announced he will not run in the upcoming 2017 presidential election. He later supported Hamid Baqai's candidacy. However, Ahmadinejad registered as presidential candidate on 12 April 2017. He was disqualified by the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> on 20 April 2017, making him the second person after Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to be barred from running the office for a third term.|$|E

2500|$|Khatami {{recalled}} his strong opposition against holding an election his government saw as unfair and not free. He also narrated {{the story of}} his visit to the Supreme Leader, Khamenei, together with the Parliament's spokesman (considered the head of the legislature) and a list of conditions they had handed him before they could hold the elections. The list, he said, was then passed on to the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council,</b> the legal supervisor and major obstacle to holding free and competitive elections in recent years. The members of the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> are appointed directly by the Supreme Leader and were considered to be [...] applying his will. [...] "But", Khatami said, [...] "the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council</b> kept neither the Supreme Leader's nor its own word [...] and we were faced with a situation in which we had to choose between holding the election or risking huge unrest [...] and so damaging the regime". At this point, student protesters repeatedly chanted the slogan [...] "Jannati is the nation's enemy", referring to the chairman of the <b>Guardian</b> <b>Council.</b> Khatami replied, [...] "If you are the representative of the nation, then we are the nation's enemy". However, after a clarification by students stating that [...] "Jannati, not Khatami", he took advantage of the opportunity to claim a high degree of freedom in Iran.|$|E
