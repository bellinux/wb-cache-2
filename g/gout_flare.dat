40|$|Objective Various nonvalidated {{criteria}} for disease flare {{have been used}} in studies of gout. Our objective was to develop empirical definitions for a <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> from patient-reported features. Methods Possible elements for flare criteria were previously reported. Data were collected from 210 gout patients at 8 international sites to evaluate potential <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> criteria against the gold standard of an expert rheumatologist definition. Flare definitions based on the presence of the number of criteria independently associated with the flare and classification and regression tree approaches were developed. Results The mean +/- SD age of the study participants was 56. 2 +/- 15 years, 207 of them (98 %) were men, and 54 of them (26 %) had flares of gout. The presence of any patient-reported warm joint, any patient-reported swollen joint, patient-reported pain at rest score of > 3 (010 scale), and patient-reported flare were independently associated with the study gold standard. The greatest discriminating power was noted for the presence of 3 or more of the above 4 criteria (sensitivity 91 % and specificity 82 %). Requiring all 4 criteria provided the highest specificity (96 %) and positive predictive value (85 %). A classification tree identified pain at rest with a score of > 3, followed by patient self-reported flare, as the rule associated with the gold standard (sensitivity 83 % and specificity 90 %). Conclusion We propose definitions for a disease flare based on self-reported items in patients previously diagnosed as having gout. Patient-reported flare, joint pain at rest, warm joints, and swollen joints were most strongly associated with presence of a <b>gout</b> <b>flare.</b> These provisional definitions will next be validated in clinical trials.

40|$|International audienceObjectives The {{objective}} of this sub-study {{was to assess the}} use of colchicine for the treatment of gout flares in real life conditions in the GOSPEL cohort following the 2006 EULAR recommendations for gout management. Methods This national cross-sectional epidemiologic survey included outpatients with gout suffering from acute flare followed by randomly selected primary care physicians (n = 398) and private practice rheumatologists (n = 109) between October 2008 and September 2009 in France. Data regarding patient characteristics and treatment prescription was collected by each physician. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. Patients included in the survey for a <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> filled in a specific self-questionnaire including colchicine effective intake and pain relief (numeric scale). Results This analysis focused on the 349 patients presenting with <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> and treated with colchicine. Mean (±SD) prescribed dose of colchicine was 2. 8 (± 0. 7) mg within the first 24 hours and the cumulative dose over the first three days of treatment was 6. 9 (± 1. 8) mg. Patients with mild decline in eGFR (eDFG 60 – 80 mL/min) were prescribed an average initial dose of 2. 8 mg (± 0. 8) mg (n = 58), 2. 7 (± 0. 8) mg in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 (n = 43) and 2. 5 (± 0. 7) mg in CKD stage 4 (n = 2).

40|$|Abstract Introduction In phase- 3 {{clinical}} trials, the interleukin (IL- 1) blocker, rilonacept (IL- 1 Trap), demonstrated efficacy for <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> prevention during {{initiation of}} urate-lowering therapy. This trial evaluated rilonacept {{added to a}} standard-of-care, indomethacin, for treatment of acute gout flares. Methods Adults, aged 18 - 70 years, with gout presenting within 48 hours of flare onset and having at least moderate pain as well as swelling and tenderness in the index joint were randomized to subcutaneous (SC) rilonacept 320 mg at baseline plus oral indomethacin 50 mg TID for 3 days followed by 25 mg TID for up to 9 days (n = 74); SC placebo at baseline plus oral indomethacin as above (n = 76); or SC rilonacept 320 mg at baseline plus oral placebo (n = 75). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in pain in the index joint (patient-reported using a Likert scale (0 = none; 4 = extreme)) from baseline to the average of values at 24, 48 and 72 hours (composite time point) for rilonacept plus indomethacin versus indomethacin alone. Comparison of rilonacept monotherapy with indomethacin monotherapy was dependent on demonstration of significance for the primary endpoint. Safety evaluation included clinical laboratory and adverse event (AE) assessments. Results Patient characteristics were comparable among the groups; the population was predominantly male (94. 1 %), white (75. 7 %), with mean &# 177; SD age of 50. 3 &# 177; 10. 6 years. All treatment groups reported within-group pain reductions from baseline (P < 0. 0001). Although primary endpoint pain reduction was greater with rilonacept plus indomethacin (- 1. 55 &# 177; 0. 92) relative to indomethacin alone (- 1. 40 &# 177; 0. 96), {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (P = 0. 33), so formal comparison between monotherapy groups was not performed. Pain reduction over the 72 -hour period with rilonacept alone (- 0. 69 &# 177; 0. 97) was less than that in the other groups, but pain reduction was similar among groups at 72 hours. Treatment with rilonacept was well-tolerated with no reported serious AEs related to rilonacept. Across all groups, the most frequent AEs were headache and dizziness.

40|$|Gouty arthritis, one of {{the most}} painful and common forms of adult arthritis, is caused by monosodium urate crystal {{deposits}} in joints, most often in the lower extremities. Crystals trigger an inflammatory response leading to acute flares characterized by a rapid onset of pain, warmth, swelling, and redness in involved joints. Over time, continued monosodium urate crystal deposits and inflammation can lead to chronic tophaceous gout that result in bone erosion, progressing to joint destruction and significant disability. The goal of therapy in an acute <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> is prompt and safe termination of pain and inflammation. Acute gouty arthritis is usually treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, or corticosteroids. However, for a growing number of patients, current standard treatments are ineffective or are contraindicated, largely due to the presence of comorbidities. Gouty arthritis can have a major negative impact of health-related quality of life, especially in patients with difficult-to-treat disease, as revealed by recent studies comparing health-related quality of life with that of the general population. Additionally, gouty arthritis also constitutes an important economic burden through absence from work and medical costs. This burden is even greater in patients with difficult-to-treat disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Trend of gout {{arthritis}} prevalence {{is increasing}} every year. Obesity, high purine diet, especially from an animal source, are some {{risk factors for}} recurrent gout attacks. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between diet, obesity, and frequency of gout flares in gout arthritis patients.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aims of {{this article}} were to {{systematically}} review the literature about the mechanism of action of colchicine in the multimodal pathology of acute inflammation associated with gout and to consider the clinical utility of colchicine in other chronic inflammatory diseases. MethodsThe English-language literature on PubMed was searched for articles published between 1990 and October 2013, with a cross-reference to citations across all years. Relevant articles pertaining to the mechanism of action of colchicine and the clinical applications of colchicine in gout and other inflammatory conditions were identified and reviewed. FindingsThe molecular pathology of acute inflammation associated with gouty arthritis involves several concurrent pathways triggered {{by a variety of}} interactions between monosodium urate crystals and the surface of cells. Colchicine modulates multiple pro- and antiinflammatory pathways associated with gouty arthritis. Colchicine prevents microtubule assembly and thereby disrupts inflammasome activation, microtubule-based inflammatory cell chemotaxis, generation of leukotrienes and cytokines, and phagocytosis. Many of these cellular processes can be found in other diseases involving chronic inflammation. The multimodal mechanism of action of colchicine suggests potential efficacy of colchicine in other comorbid conditions associated with gout, such as osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease. ImplicationsColchicine has multiple mechanisms of action that affect inflammatory processes and result in its utility for treating and preventing acute <b>gout</b> <b>flare.</b> Other chronic inflammatory diseases that invoke these molecular pathways may represent new therapeutic applications for colchicine...|$|E
40|$|Treatment-failure gout (TFG) affects {{approximately}} 50, 000 {{patients or}} about 1 % {{of the overall}} population of patients with gout in the United States of America. The severity of TFG is manifested by frequent acute attacks of disabling arthritis, chronic deforming joint disease, destructive masses of urate crystals (tophi), progressive physical disability, and poor health-related quality of life. Pegloticase (Krystexxa((R)); Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc), a novel PEGylated urate oxidase (uricase) enzyme, has been resubmitted for US Food and Drug Administration approval. In a 6 -month, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 8 mg of pegloticase for every 2 weeks induced a lytic decrease of serum urate (sUr) concentrations, leading to dissolution of tophi in 40 % of patients at final visit. However, 58 % were nonresponders to the defined target sUr of 0. 36 mmol/L (80 % were nonresponders during months 3 and 6), possibly due to anti-body formation. Also, 26 %- 31 % experienced infusion reactions (IRs) and 77 % suffered from <b>gout</b> <b>flares.</b> Although long-term data are awaited, an anti-inflammatory strategy, eg, based on glucocorticosteroids, is needed to prevent pegloticase antibody formation leading to IRs and diminished or shortened efficacy, and might also prevent <b>gout</b> <b>flares.</b> According to the current clinical data, pegloticase might {{have an important role}} as a (bridging) treatment in sUr-responsive patients for tophi clearance in severe chronic refractory gout...|$|R

Methods: This prospective observational study recruited 20 patients with acute gout flares. Patients were recruited from emergency departments, hospital wards and rheumatology outpatient clinics throughout Auckland, New Zealand. Patients were recruited at the time of the flare (baseline visit) and then reassessed at a follow-up visit once the acute flare had resolved 6 - 8 weeks after the initial assessment. Joint counts, C-reactive protein and serum urate were recorded at both visits. General and foot-specific outcome measures were also recorded at each visit including pain visual analogue scale, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) -II, Lower Limb Tasks Questionnaire, and the Leeds Foot Impact Scale. Results: The foot was affected by acute gout in 14 (70 %) patients. Objective measures of joint inflammation including swollen and tender joint counts and C-reactive protein significantly improved at the follow-up visit, compared with the baseline visit.

40|$|Crystal-induced {{arthritis}} (CIA) {{is characterized}} by an intense inflammatory reaction triggered by the deposition of monosodium urate, calcium pyrophosphate, and basic calcium phosphate crystals in articular and periarticular tissues. Severe, acute pain constitutes the most important clinical symptom in patients affected by these diseases. Pain along with redness, warmness, swelling, and stiffness in the affected joint arises abruptly in gout and disappears when the acute phase of the attack resolves. While an acute joint attack caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals can mimic a <b>gout</b> <b>flare,</b> basic calcium phosphate crystal arthritis {{gives rise to a}} series of clinical manifestations, the most severe of which are calcific periarthritis, mostly asymptomatic, and a highly destructive arthritis known as Milwaukee shoulder syndrome, which {{is characterized by}} painful articular attacks. Pain development in CIA is mediated by several inflammatory substances that are formed after cell injury by crystals. The most important of these molecules, which exert their effects through different receptor subtypes present in both peripheral sensory neurons and the spinal cord, are prostaglandins, bradykinin, cytokines (in particular, interleukin (IL) - 1 β), and substance P. The pharmacological treatment of pain in CIA is strictly associated with the treatment of acute phases and flares of the disease, during which crystals trigger the inflammatory response. According to international guidelines, colchicines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or corticosteroids are first-line agents for the systemic treatment of acute CIA, while biologics, namely anti-IL- 1 β agents, should be used only in particularly refractory cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Surgical site wound closure plays a {{vital role}} in {{post-operative}} success. This effect is magnified in regard to commonly performed elective procedures such as total knee arthroplasty. The use of either sutures or staples for skin re-approximation remains a contested subject, which may {{have a significant impact on}} both patient safety and surgical outcome. The literature remains divided on this topic. Methods Two cohorts of patients at a level one trauma and regional referral center were reviewed. Cohorts consisted of consecutive total knee arthroplasties performed by two surgeons who achieved surgical wound re-approximation by either staples or absorbable subcuticular sutures. Outcome variables included time of surgery, wound dehiscence, surgical site infection per Center for Disease Control criteria and repeat procedures for debridement and re-closure. Results 181 patients qualified for study inclusion. Staples were employed in 82 cases (45. 3 % of total) and sutures in 99 cases (54. 7 %). The staples group had no complications while the sutures group had 9 (9. 1 %). These consisted of: 4 infections (2 superficial, one deep, one organ/space); three patients required re-suturing for dehiscence; one allergic type reaction to suture material; and one <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> resulting in dehiscence.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the long-term safety (up to 3 years) of treatment with pegloticase {{in patients with}} refractory chronic gout. METHODS: This open-label extension (OLE) study was conducted at 46 sites in the USA, Canada and Mexico. Patients completing either of two replicate randomised placebo-controlled 6 -month trials received pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks (biweekly) or every 4 weeks (monthly). Safety was evaluated as the primary outcome, with special interest in <b>gout</b> <b>flares</b> and infusion-related reactions (IRs). Secondary outcomes included urate-lowering and clinical efficacy. RESULTS: Patients (n= 149) received a mean+/-SD of 28 +/- 18 pegloticase infusions and were followed for a mean of 25 +/- 11 months. <b>Gout</b> <b>flares</b> and IRs were the most frequently reported adverse events; these were least common in patients with a sustained urate-lowering response to treatment and those receiving biweekly treatment. In 10 of the 11 patients with a serious IR, the event occurred when uric acid exceeded 6 mg/dl. Plasma and serum uric acid levels remained /dl in most randomised controlled trial (RCT) -defined pegloticase responders throughout the OLE study and were accompanied by sustained and progressive improvements in tophus resolution and flare incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The safety profile of long-term pegloticase treatment was consistent with that observed during 6 months of RCT treatment; no new safety signals were identified. Improvements in clinical status, {{in the form of}} flare and tophus reduction initiated during RCT pegloticase treatment in patients maintaining goal range urate-lowering responses were sustained or advanced during up to 2. 5 years of additional treatment...|$|R

However, 58 % were nonresponders to the defined target sUr of 0. 36 mmol/L (80 % were nonresponders during months 3 and 6), possibly due to antibody formation. Also, 26 %&ndash; 31 % experienced infusion reactions (IRs) and 77 % suffered from <b>gout</b> <b>flares.</b> Although long-term data are awaited, an anti-inflammatory strategy, eg, based on glucocorticosteroids, is needed to prevent pegloticase antibody formation leading to IRs and diminished or shortened efficacy, and might also prevent <b>gout</b> <b>flares.</b> According to the current clinical data, pegloticase might {{have an important role}} as a (bridging) treatment in sUr-responsive patients for tophi clearance in severe chronic refractory gout.

40|$|Purpose: Current {{treatments}} for arthritis <b>flares</b> in <b>gout</b> (gouty arthritis) are not effective in all patients {{and may be}} contraindicated in many due to underlying comorbidities. Urate crystals activate the NALP 3 inflammasome which stimulate production of IL- 1 β, driving inflammatory processes. Targeted IL- 1 β blockade may be an alternative treatment for gouty arthritis. Canakinumab (ACZ 885) is a fully human monoclonal anti- IL- 1 β antibody with a long half-life (28 days). Method: This was an 8 -weeks, dose-ranging, multicenter, blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled trial of patients ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 y with an acute gouty arthritis flare, refractory to or contraindicated to NSAIDs and/or colchicine. Patients were randomized to 1 subcutanous (sc) dose of canakinumab (10, 25, 50, 90, or 150 mg) or 1 intra muscular (im) dose of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) [40 mg]. The primary variable was assessed 72 h post-dose, measured on a 0 - 100 mm VAS pain scale. Secondary variables included pain intensity 24 and 48 h post dose, time to 50 % reduction in pain intensity, and time to recurrence of <b>gout</b> <b>flares</b> up to 8 weeks post dose. Results: 200 patients were enrolled (canakinumab n= 143, TA n= 57) and 191 completed the study. A statistically significant dose response was observed at 72 h. The 150 mg dose reached superior pain relief compared to TA starting from 24 h: estimated mean difference in pain intensity on 0 - 100 mm VAS was - 11. 5 at 24 h, - 18. 2 at 48 h, and - 19. 2 at 72 h (all p< 0. 05). Canakinumab 150 mg provided a rapid onset of pain relief: median time to 50 % reduction in pain was reached at 1 day with canakinumab 150 mg vs 2 days for the TA group (p= 0. 0006). The probability of recurrent <b>gout</b> <b>flares</b> was 3. 7 % with canakinumab 150 mg vs. 45. 4 % with TA 8 weeks post treatment, a relative risk reduction of 94 % (p= 0. 006). Serious AEs occurred in 2 patients receiving canakinumab (appendicitis and carotid artery stenosis) and 1 receiving TA (cerebrovascular disorder). Investigator's reported these events as not study drug related. There were no discontinuations due to AEs. Conclusion: Canakinumab 150 mg provided faster onset and superior pain relief compared to TA for acute flares in gouty arthritis patients refractory to or contraindicated to standard treatments. The 150 mg dose of canakinumab prevented recurrence of <b>gout</b> <b>flares</b> with a relative risk reduction compared to TA of 94 % at 8 weeks post-dose, and was well tolerated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGouty {{arthritis}} {{is caused}} by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints. Despite many treatment options for gout, there is a substantial need for alternative treatments for patients unresponsive to current therapies. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in experimental models of antibody-dependent arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis in humans, but to date, the potential effects of such inhibitors on gouty arthritis has not been evaluated. Here we demonstrate that treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) can suppress inflammation induced by injection of MSU crystals into subcutaneous air pouches or into the ankle joint of wild type mice. Moreover, imatinib treatment also largely abolished the lower levels of inflammation which developed in IL- 1 R 1 -/- or KitW-sh/W-sh mice, indicating that this drug can inhibit IL- 1 -independent pathways, as well as mast cell-independent pathways, contributing to pathology in this model. Imatinib treatment not only prevented ankle swelling and synovial inflammation when administered before MSU crystals but also diminished these features when administrated after the injection of MSU crystals, a therapeutic protocol more closely mimicking the clinical situation in which treatment occurs after the development of an acute <b>gout</b> <b>flare.</b> Finally, we also assessed the efficiency of local intra-articular injections of imatinib-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles in this model of acute gout. Treatment with low doses of this long-acting imatinib:PLGA formulation was able to reduce ankle swelling in a therapeutic protocol. Altogether, these results raise the possibility that tyrosine kinase inhibitors might have utility in the treatment of acute gout in humans...|$|E
40|$|In gout, monosodium urate (MSU) {{crystals}} deposit intra-articularly {{and cause}} painful arthritis. In {{the present study}} we tested the hypothesis that Transient Receptor Poten-tial Ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1), an ion channel mediating nociceptive signals and neurogenic in-flammation, is involved in MSU crystal-induced responses in gout by utilizing three experi-mental murine models. Methods The effects of selective pharmacological inhibition (by HC- 030031) and genetic depletion of TRPA 1 were studied in MSU crystal-induced inflammation and pain by using 1) spontaneous weight-bearing test to assess MSU crystal-induced joint pain, 2) subcutaneous air-pouch model resembling joint inflammation to measure MSU crystal-induced cytokine production and inflammatory cell accumulation, and 3) MSU crystal-induced paw edema to assess acute vascular inflammatory responses and swelling. Results Intra-articularly injected MSU crystals provoked spontaneous weight shift off from the affected limb in wild type but not in TRPA 1 knock-out mice referring alleviated joint pain in TRPA 1 deficient animals. MSU crystal-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and accumulation of cytokines MCP- 1, IL- 6, IL- 1 beta, MPO, MIP- 1 alpha and MIP- 2 into subcu-taneous air-pouch (resembling joint cavity) was attenuated in TRPA 1 deficient mice and in mice treated with the selective TRPA 1 inhibitor HC- 030031 as compared to control animals. Further, HC- 030031 treated and TRPA 1 deficient mice developed tempered inflammatory edema when MSU crystals were injected into the paw. Conclusions TRPA 1 mediates MSU crystal-induced inflammation and pain in experimental models supporting the role of TRPA 1 as a potential mediator and a drug target in <b>gout</b> <b>flare.</b> Public Library of Science open acces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of gout is increasing, and most {{research on the}} associated burden has focused on serum urate (sUA) levels. The present study quantifies {{the impact of the}} presence of tophi and frequency of acute gout attacks on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), productivity, and healthcare resource utilization. Methods Patients with self-reported gout (n[*]=[*] 620; 338 in US and 282 across France, Germany, and UK) were contacted based on inclusion in the 2010 US and EU National Health and Wellness Surveys (Kantar Health) and the Lightspeed Research ailment panel. Respondents were categorized into mutually-exclusive groups based on number of gout flares experienced in the past 12 months (0 /don’t recall, 1 – 2, 3, 4 – 5, 6 +), current presence of tophi (none, 1 +, or not sure), and sUA level awareness (yes, no). HRQOL (SF- 12 v 2), healthcare provider visits in the last 6 months, and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) were compared across groups. Results Most patients were males, mean age of 61 years, who reported experiencing at least one acute <b>gout</b> <b>flare</b> in the past 12 months, and 12. 3 % (n[*]=[*] 76) reported presence of tophi. Among the 27. 7 % (n[*]=[*] 172) of patients who were aware of their sUA levels, higher sUA was associated with more flares and tophi. Decreased HRQOL was associated with more frequent flares and presence of tophi. In multivariable models predicting outcomes based on presence of tophi and number of flares, both flares (≥ 4) and tophi (≥ 1) were associated with HRQOL decrements on physical and mental component summary scores and health utilities (all p [*] Conclusions Impairments associated with gout flares and presence of tophi, across patients in the US and EU, underscore the importance of effective management of this potentially curable condition. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the acceptable level of {{positive predictive value}} (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for classification criteria for gout, given the type of study. METHODS: We conducted an international web-based survey with 91 general practitioners and rheumatologists experienced in gout. Conjoint analysis {{was used as the}} framework for designing and analyzing pairs of 2 profiles, each describing a study type, a PPV, and an NPV. There were 5 study types presented: a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug versus prednisone for acute <b>gout</b> <b>flares,</b> a phase III RCT of a biologic agent for acute <b>gout</b> <b>flares,</b> a phase II RCT of a novel uricosuric drug of unknown efficacy and limited toxicity data, a case-control, genome-wide association study of gout, and a cohort study examining long-term outcomes of gout. PPV and NPV both had 5 levels ranging from 60 - 99 %. RESULTS: The panelists in majority were male (65 %) rheumatologists (93 %) with an average of 19 years of practice, seeing 5 to 60 gout patients monthly. PPV was most highly weighted in decision making: the relative importance was 59 % for PPV, 29 % for NPV, and 13 % for study type. The preferred PPV was 90 % or 80 %, with an accompanying NPV of 70 % or 80 %, dependent on study type. CONCLUSION: Preferred PPVs and NPVs range between 70 % and 90 % and differ by study type. A single cut point can be a reasonable approach for all study types if a PPV of 90 % and NPV of 80 % is approximated...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the need for greater attention to serum uric acid levels when profiling patients, and suggests that the threshold above which uricemia is considered abnormal is 6 mg/dl, {{in light of the}} available evidence. Another important question is whether lowering serum uric acid can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and what therapeutic mechanism of action could provide more clinical benefits to patients; the available literature shows a trend toward improvement associated with administration of urate-lowering drugs, in particular for the xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The demonstrated efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on outcomes other than <b>gout</b> <b>flares</b> leads to the consideration that treatment may be beneficial {{even in the absence of}} overt gout when hyperuricemia accompanies other clinical conditions, such as urate deposition, advanced CKD or cardiovascular risk factors...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a disproportionate}} burden of gout in African-Americans in the U. S. {{due to a}} higher disease {{prevalence}} and lower likelihood of receiving urate-lowering therapy (ULT), compared to Caucasians. There is an absence of strong data {{as to whether the}} response to ULT differs by race/ethnicity. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders recently published a secondary analyses of the CONFIRMS trial, a large randomized controlled, double-blind trial of 2, 269 gout patients. The authors reported that the likelihood of achieving the primary study efficacy end-point of achieving serum urate < 6 mg/dl was similar between African-Americans and Caucasians, for all three treatment arms (Febuxostat 40 mg and 80 mg and allopurinol 300 / 200 mg). More importantly, rates were similar in subgroups of patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency. Adverse event rates were similar, as were the rates of <b>gout</b> <b>flares.</b> These findings constitute a convincing evidence to pursue aggressive ULT in gout patients, regardless of race/ethnicity. This approach will likely help to narrow the documented racial disparities in gout care...|$|R
