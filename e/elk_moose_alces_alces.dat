50|$|Subarctic {{regions are}} often {{characterized}} by taiga forest vegetation, though where winters are relatively mild, as in northern Norway, broadleaf forest may occur—though {{in some cases}} soils remain too saturated almost throughout the year to sustain any tree growth and the dominant vegetation is a peaty herbland dominated by grasses and sedges. Typically, {{there are only a}} few species of large terrestrial mammals in the subarctic regions, the most important being <b>elk,</b> <b>moose</b> (<b>Alces</b> <b>alces),</b> bears, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and wolves (Canis lupus). Agriculture is mainly limited to animal husbandry, though in some areas barley can be grown. Canada and Siberia are very rich in minerals, notably nickel, molybdenum, cobalt, lead, zinc and uranium, whilst the Grand Banks and Sea of Okhotsk are two of the richest fisheries in the world and provide support for many small towns.|$|E

50|$|Although the Bitterroot River passes {{close by}} to many {{residential}} areas, {{it is an}} excellent place for wildlife viewing. Many species of ducks and waterfowl are common along with osprey, bald eagles and heron. <b>Elk</b> (Cervus canadensis), <b>moose</b> (<b>Alces</b> <b>alces),</b> and both white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) frequent the river {{as a source of}} water and to graze near its banks. The most notable wildlife viewing locale along the river is the famous Lee Metcalf National Wildlife Refuge, named for U.S. Senator Lee Metcalf, a pioneer of the conservation movement.|$|R
3000|$|The {{study area}} {{supported}} a diverse community of large mammals. Carnivores included wolves, black bears (Ursus americanus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), coyotes (Canis latrans), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Ungulates included <b>elk,</b> mule deer, <b>moose</b> (<b>Alces</b> <b>alces),</b> bison (Bison bison), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), {{and a small}} number of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and pronghorn exhibited seasonal migrations (Sawyer et al. 2005; Smith 2007; Elbroch et al. 2013); elk were heavily harvested (10 – 12  % annually) in efforts to reduce their population, and deer and moose supported limited, male-only harvest rates.

50|$|These {{mountains}} {{are home to}} good numbers of large mammals. All five species of North American deer inhabit this ecoregion including caribou (woodland caribou subspecies) (Rangifer tarandus caribou), <b>elk</b> (Cervus elaphus), <b>moose</b> (<b>Alces</b> <b>alces),</b> mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and white-tailed deer (northern Rocky Mountains/tawny white-tail) (Odocoileus virginianus ochrourus). Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), and mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) {{can also be found}} here. Predators in the mountains and forests include Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), American black bear (Ursus americanus cinnamomum), cougar (Puma concolor), and gray wolf (Canis lupus). Smaller wildlife such as snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and American pygmy shrew (Sorex hoyi) can be found here as well and the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) which is endemic to Banff National Park. Birds include Townsend's warbler (Setophaga townsendi), veery (Catharus fuscescens), and bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).|$|R
40|$|Adult male Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus) grew {{the largest}} antlers of any extinct or extant cervid. These antlers {{have often been}} implicated in the {{extinction}} of the Irish elk, although the effects of antler growth on Irish elk physiology have not been analysed quantitatively. We used a simulation model of energy and mineral metabolism to compare nutritional requirements for antler growth in Irish <b>elk</b> and <b>moose</b> (<b>Alces</b> <b>alces),</b> the largest extant cervid. The model simulates intake, metabolism, deposition, and excretion of energy, nitrogen, ash, calcium and phosphorus with mass balance {{for each of these}} nutrients on a daily time step. Predicted energy requirements for antler growth by moose are half as large as energy requirements for summer fat and protein deposition. In contrast, the predicted energy requirements for antler growth by Irish elk were about 75 % as large as energy requirements for summer fat and protein deposition. Irish elk antlers weighing 40 kg at the end of velvet shedding would have contained 2. 1 kg nitrogen, 7. 6 kg calcium and 3. 8 kg phosphorus. The nitrogen requirements for antler growth were met by forage intake. The model predicts that, to grow 40 kg antlers in a 150 day period, more than 60 g of calcium and more than 30 g of phosphorus were deposited in antlers daily fo...|$|R
5000|$|The leading {{ungulate}} prey for brown bears {{is normally}} deer. Up {{to a dozen}} species have been eaten by brown bears but the main prey species are the larger species they encounter: <b>elk</b> (Cervus canadensis), <b>moose</b> (<b>Alces</b> <b>alces)</b> and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Larger deer are preferred {{because they tend to}} be less agile and swift than small or medium-sized deer (although a caribou can handily outpace a grizzly bear in the open), they are found in large quantities in several areas inhabited by brown bears and provide a larger meal per carcass. Moose may be preferred where found in large numbers because of their solitary habits and tendency to dwell in wooded areas, both of which makes them easier to ambush. Despite its diminished reputation as a predator, the brown bear is the most dangerous solitary predator of moose, with only packs of wolves a more regular predator; even Siberian tigers take other prey, primarily (elk and boar), in areas where they co-exist with the giant deer. Brown bears normally avoid the potential risks of hunting large deer, which can potentially fight back but usually escape bears by running, by picking out young calves or sickly adults from deer herds. In northeastern Norway, it was found that moose were the most important single food item (present in up to 45% of scats and locally comprising more than 70% of the bear's dietary energy) for local brown bears and several local bears appear to be specialized moose hunters, most often picking off sickly yearling moose and pregnant but healthy cows. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears who derived much of their food energy from ungulates were studied, and 30% of the ungulates consumed were through predation, the remaining amount from scavenging of carcasses. <b>Elk,</b> bison and <b>moose</b> (the three largest native ungulates in the region) each constituted nearly a quarter of the overall ungulate diet. 13% of the total of ungulates actively hunted and killed per that study in Yellowstone were elk calves, while 8% of the actively and successfully hunted prey there were adult cow elk. Despite their lack of preference for smaller deer, other species including red deer (Cervus elaphus), sika deer (Cervus nippon [...] ), axis deer (Axis axis), European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), fallow deer (Dama dama), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have turned up in their diet.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Following {{an overall}} {{population}} decline of <b>moose</b> (<b>Alces</b> <b>alces)</b> after the 1970 s, exten-sive aerial and ground surveys conducted since 1985 {{indicated that there}} were 7 distinct populations in northern Yakutia. They are isolated geographically by mountain ridges and major rivers, and are named the Leno-Olenek, Predverkhoyansk, Yana, Chondon, Momo-Selenyakh, Indigirka, and Kolyma populations. Although most occupy forest habitat associated with major rivers, some are migratory (40 - 200 km) moving both N-S and E-W, and certain populations overlap on winter range. Population densities generally range from 1 - 2 moose/ 10 km 2, with higher and lower local densities. The northern-most Chondon population is unique by occupying sub-tundra forests and ridges. Because protective regulations did not produce measurable population recovery and were abandoned in 2004, management strategies must be adopted to address the ecological differences of these separate populations. Effec-tive moose management in Yakutia will require further identification of range and habitat use, habitat structure and availability, and population estimates and dynamics of regional populations.
