5000|$|The {{original}} recording features Coltrane (tenor saxophone), Paul Chambers (double bass), Tommy Flanagan (piano), and Art Taylor (drums). John Coltrane {{was known}} for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs, and [...] "Giant Steps" [...] was no exception. On the original recording, Flanagan played a choppy start-stop solo where <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan revisited [...] "Giant Steps" [...] on several recordings later in his career and mastered the progression. In some of the alternate takes, Cedar Walton is at the piano, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan.|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: [...] "Cold and Bouncy is an {{accurate}} description of the High Llamas' music, in many ways. On the surface, it's light and airy, with sprightly or sighing melodies, sometimes quite detailed, but that very attention to detail keeps the music at an emotional distance ... While it's not the marathon of Hawaii, the album still runs way too long, lasting well over an hour. Instead of adding depth, the length makes O'Hagan's ideas difficult to assimilate, {{and by the end}} of the record, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> only has variations on a handful of themes. But when the album is consumed in small doses, however, O'Hagan's flair for arrangement and sonic detail burns brightly." ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{had told}} the Cyclops earlier that his name was 'Noman' or 'Nobody' (Greek outis or mētis), so when the Cyclops yells out who was {{responsible}} for blinding him, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is saying [...] "No man blinded me". In addition to this pun, there is a less easily translated joke {{based on the fact that}} the form of [...] "no man" [...] (mētis) is identical to the word for cleverness or art. The Satyrs have some fun with him over it. Odysseus makes the mistake, however, of blurting out his true name as a result of his big ego. Although he successfully makes his escape, the rest of the troubles Odysseus faces on his voyage home are related to this act, as he then faces the wrath of Poseidon, the father of the Cyclops.|$|E
5000|$|The {{version that}} {{everyone}} knows, I actually hate ... Martin Hannett played {{one of his}} mind games when we were recording it - <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was a tyrant, but he wasn't, he was nice. We had this one battle where it was nearly midnight and I said, [...] "Is it all right if I go home, Martin - it's been a long day?" [...] And he said whispers, [...] "OK ... you go home". So I {{went back to the}} flat. Just got to sleep and the phone rings. [...] "Martin wants you to come back and do the snare drum". At four in the morning! I said, [...] "What's wrong with the snare drum!?" [...] So every time I hear [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", I grit my teeth and remember myself shouting down the phone, [...] "YOU BASTARD!" [...] up imaginary phone. I can feel the anger in it even now. It's a great song and it's a great production, but I do get anguished every time I hear it.|$|E

5000|$|Arte Johnson, {{who created}} many memorable characters, insisted on star billing, {{apart from the}} rest of the cast. The {{producer}} mollified him, but had announcer Gary Owens read Johnson's credit as a separate sentence: [...] "Starring Dan Rowan and Dick Martin! And Arte Johnson! With Ruth Buzzi ..." [...] This maneuver gave Johnson star billing, but made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was still part of the ensemble cast. Johnson left the show after the 1970-71 season. Henry Gibson also departed after the 1970-71 season. Johnson and he were replaced by former Hogan's Heroes stars Richard Dawson and Larry Hovis, both of whom had appeared occasionally in the first season. However, the loss of Johnson's many popular characters caused ratings to drop further.|$|R

Although Sweet and DeMille didn’t quite click, she had a much better experience with his brother, William C. DeMille, “who, ‘had a more subtle way of doing things.’” [...] She worked with William on three films, The Ragamuffin, The Blacklist, and The Sowers. These films were all released in 1916.

5000|$|The last {{track on}} the album is [...] "The Sorcerer", written for Davis. It is also {{featured}} on the homonymous Sorcerer.

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was mixed to negative. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album 1 star {{out of a possible}} 5, declaring the album [...] "sterile" [...] and representing [...] "the same old hard rock that Nugent has been cranking out for over three decades now, and <b>it</b> sure <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> been doing <b>it</b> that long, as the riffs are recycled, the production is too clean, and the performances too professional." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reflektor {{is an art}} {{rock and}} dance-rock album. Primary lyricist Win Butler notes that the 1959 film Black Orpheus {{inspired}} his lyrics on the album, in particular its themes of isolation and death: [...] "Black Orpheus {{is one of my}} favorite films of all time, which is set in Carnival in Brazil. The Orpheus myth is the original love triangle, Romeo and Juliet kind of story. Lyrically, it's not literally about my life. I feel like I'm kind of a bit of a sponge in a way. Like, if people around me are going through things, I find it very hard not to be empathetic." [...] Also influential to the album's lyrical content is an essay by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, entitled [...] "Two Ages". Butler states, [...] "It's about the reflective age. This is like in 1846, and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> talking about modern times. He's talking about the press and alienation, and you kind of read it and you're like, 'Dude, you have no idea how insane it's gonna get.'" ...|$|R

Wagner's Dresden performance of 1864 {{was the first to}} place the chorus and the solo singers behind the orchestra as has since become standard; previous conductors placed them between the orchestra and the audience.|$|R
