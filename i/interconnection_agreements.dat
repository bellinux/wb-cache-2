40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{determination}} of an original initiator of transmission on demand as well as profits of the providers. For that purpose we present a new model, called differentiated traffic-based <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreement</b> (DTIA) that differentiates traffic into two types, referred to as native and stranger {{in order to determine}} a transmission initiator. In comparison to the existing financial settlement, under which the payments are based on the net traffic flow, the proposed model governs cost compensation according to the differentiated traffic flows. In addition, a traffic management mechanism that supports the presented approach was described. Analytical studies were provided using Nash bargaining solution to explore how the proposed strategy affects the outcome of providers¡¯ negotiation. The key consequence of the obtained results showed that determination of an initiator of transmission induces providers to receive higher profits.

50|$|The {{state has}} officially {{committed}} to developing Moldova as an information society, {{although many of}} its policies undermine this objective. Moldtelecom, {{which is also the}} major national ISP, remains under state control despite large-scale criticism and four failed privatization attempts. Moldtelecom also controls Unite, one of the four mobile operators created in 2007. At present, ISPs are forced to rent access from Moldtelecom's well-developed infrastructure, a necessity which increases their costs and diminishes their competitiveness. Moldtelecom provides the nondiscriminatory Reference Interconnection Offer, the last version having been approved by the regulator after much delay in December 2007. Even though some <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> are now agreed between the incumbent and IP and data transmission operators, some new entrants have complained about insufficient access to Moldtelecom's network leading to inefficient usage of infrastructure. In April 2009, the Moldovan regulator introduced new guidelines on interconnection tariffs. The regulation addresses the issues of obligations imposed on operators, with emphasis on transparency and nondiscriminatory stances toward competitors. It remains to be seen in practice how the new guideline will be applied by Moldtelecom.|$|E

A brief overview of existing pricing policies and research work in this area is presented and some new issues are introduced. We believe that the role of information asymmetry is critical when considering agreements for Internet access and interconnection. In negotiation and contract preparation, information asymmetry gives rise to adverse selection. The current structure of connectivity agreements does not address information asymmetries thus allowing the possibility of opportunistic behaviour in the form of moral hazard. Inasmuch as <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> involve sharing and/or exchanging network resources, either party will tend to exploit the agreement to its own advantage (i. e. conserving its own resources) and, possibly, {{to the detriment of the}} other (i. e. over-utilising the other’s resources).

This {{is supported by a}} topological analysis of the <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> among top-level Internet providers and by the lessons derived from alliances forged in the airline and card-based payment sectors. We conclude that on the Internet, the optimal organizational form should be a centralized alliance with a hub-and-spoke network structure.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the structure of}} the Internet connectivity market by focusing on the business relations of stakeholders involved in network services provision. We believe that the role of information asymmetry is critical when considering <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements,</b> and should be taken into account in {{the structure of the}} contract. Information asymmetry due to incomplete information concerning important operating parameters such as network load, capacity, cost, gives rise to adverse selection during negotiation and contract preparation. The current at structure of <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> does not address such information asymmetries. In many cases, the dfficulty of observing the actual effort allocated by the contracted network for providing quality of service, and in particular, the absence of appropriate incentives in the contract, allows for the possibility of opportunistic behaviour in the form of moral hazard. We formulate two simple analytical models which demonstrate the effects of moral hazard in the market for network transport services. The first deals with the case where the network is contracted for short duration transport where the customer can not use the statistical information obtained during the life time of the service to determine with certainty the actual effort allocated by the network. The second model deals with transit contracts of longer duration, where the actual cost for provisioning the service at various quality levels is only statistically known at the time the contract is set up. Although these models are too simple for capturing the complexity of <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> between ISPs, they demonstrate the bad effects of information asymmetry and motivate the importance of incentive contracts for improving efficiency. interconnection moral hazard incentives...|$|E
