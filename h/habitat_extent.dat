40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades there has been {{increasing}} interest in developing indicators to monitor environmental change. Remote sensing techniques have been primarily used to generate information on land use/land cover changes. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has used this technology to monitor wetland trends and recently developed a set of remotely-sensed indicators to characterize and assess trends in the integrity of natural habitat in watersheds. The indices largely focus on the extent of “natural ” cover throughout a given watershed, with an emphasis on locations important to fish, wildlife, and water quality. Six indices address natural <b>habitat</b> <b>extent</b> and four deal with human-caused disturbance. A composite index of natural habitat integrity combining the <b>habitat</b> <b>extent</b> and habitat disturbance indices may be formulated to provide an overall numeric value for a watershed or subbasin. These indices facilitate comparison between watersheds (and subbasins) and assesssment of trends useful for environmental monitoring. This paper describes the indices and presents an example of their application for characterizing and assessing conditions of subbasins within Delaware’s Nanticoke River watershed...|$|E

40|$|The Upper Mississippi River (UMR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} diverse and {{valuable}} ecosystems in the entire world. The UMR is considered a “multi-use ” resource, meaning it is vital for wildlife, transportation, commerce, public utilities, and recreation. Prioritizing and balancing these uses can be a difficult challenge. A critical component to understanding and communicating knowledge about the UMR lies in defining aquatic habitat types. Backwater habitat areas, in particular, serve as one of the most valuable habitat types because they directly impact river flora and fauna and are crucial to maintaining river water quality. Currently, backwater aquatic habitat is identified and classified solely by visual photo-interpretation and historic geomorphology. As it becomes increasingly important to be able to protect and study backwater areas, and distinguish them from the flowing portions of the river, the need has arisen to more precisely locate these areas based on scientific data. Long-Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP) data components from Pool 8 near Lacrosse, WI, are used to define backwater aquatic habitat areas based upon water chemistry. The main components of the LTRMP data chosen for analysis include: water current velocity, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a. In this study, backwater habitat locations are defined by creating acceptable criteria for each component and interpolating a surface based on the criteria. Newly defined <b>extents</b> for backwater <b>habitat</b> are then compared to current backwater <b>habitat</b> <b>extents.</b> This new approach to identifying and classifying these backwater habitat areas serves as an important decision-marking tool for river managers involved in a variety of projects such as habitat restoration and water quality standards testing...|$|R
40|$|Restoring the {{heterogeneity}} of agricultural landscapes has been proposed as a key measure to promote farmland biodiversity. Recent studies, however, warn against generalizing this measure because effects can vary across agricultural contexts and species. We explored the hypothesis that heterogeneity has {{a negative effect on}} habitat specialists and a positive effect on generalists. We studied 22 species of common farmland birds belonging to three groups: arable specialists, grassland specialists, and mixed habitat (arable, grassland) “generalist” species. Abundances of these three groups were compared on a nationwide gradient of heterogeneity in France (2006 data), including 510 survey sites. We addressed {{the heterogeneity}} of the two main farmland habitats: arable land and grassland. We measured <b>habitat</b> <b>extent</b> (arable/(arable + grassland) ratio) and two heterogeneity components: composition (evenness in the land use proportions) and configuration (probability of adjacency). Although maximal configurational heterogeneity was found at maximal compositional heterogeneity, several landscapes had high compositional heterogeneity but low configurational heterogeneity. The abundance of specialists was strongly correlated with <b>habitat</b> <b>extent</b> and negatively correlated with configurational heterogeneity. It suggests that the most important mechanism influencing their population level could be habitat loss, worsened by fragmentation. Generalist species were more abundant in landscapes with higher proportion of arable land and high configurational heterogeneity, which suggests resource supplementation could be the mechanism that improves their population level. Depending on targeted species, opposite effects of heterogeneity can occur. No unique conservation policy solution to maintain all groups of farmland birds exists, promoting landscapes with various heterogeneity levels will be necessary...|$|E

40|$|Modelling {{approaches}} {{have the potential}} to significantly contribute to the spatial management of the deep-sea ecosystem in a cost effective manner. However, we currently have little understanding of the accuracy of such models, developed using limited data, of varying resolution. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the performance of predictive models constructed using non-simulated (real world) data of different resolution. Predicted distribution maps for three deep-sea habitats were constructed using MaxEnt modelling methods using high resolution multibeam bathymetric data and associated terrain derived variables as predictors. Model performance was evaluated using repeated 75 / 25 training/test data partitions using AUC and threshold-dependent assessment methods. The overall extent and distribution of each habitat, and the percentage contained within an existing MPA network were quantified and compared to results from low resolution GEBCO models. Predicted spatial extent for scleractinian coral reef and Syringammina fragilissima aggregations decreased with an increase in model resolution, whereas Pheronema carpenteri total suitable area increased. Distinct differences in predicted habitat distribution were observed for all three habitats. Estimates of <b>habitat</b> <b>extent</b> contained within the MPA network all increased when modelled at fine scale. High resolution models performed better than low resolution models according to threshold-dependent evaluation. We recommend the use of high resolution multibeam bathymetry data over low resolution bathymetry data for use in modelling approaches. We do not recommend the use of predictive models to produce absolute values of <b>habitat</b> <b>extent,</b> but likely areas of suitable habitat.

40|$|Background A three-tiered {{approach}} has been adopted to assess Scotland’s marine blue carbon stores. Information on <b>habitat</b> <b>extent,</b> or predicted <b>habitat</b> <b>extent,</b> has been collated into a GIS. The relevant scientific information on the primary habitats for carbon uptake and storage have been reviewed and quantitative rates of production and storage were obtained. Habitat-specific reviews also include a brief assessment of the main threats to each habitat. Finally, the collected information has been assembled into an ecosystem-scale inventory of the key rates and ultimate sequestration capacity of each habitat. Habitats were reviewed by relevant experts (Michael Burrows, for kelp; Paul Tett, phytoplankton; David Hughes, benthic suspension feeders including reef-building species; Henrik Stahl, for fate of carbon in marine sediments; John Howe; postglacial geology of sediments; Nick Kamenos, maerl beds). Main findings Coastal and offshore sediments are the main repositories for carbon in Scotland’s marine environment. An estimated 18 million tonnes (MtC) of organic carbon are stored in the top 10 cm of sediments across the 470 000 km 2 area of Scotland’s seas. An estimated 1738 million tonnes (MtC) of inorganic carbon are similarly stored as nonliving shell material. Deposition of organic carbon amounts to 7. 2 MtC/yr and inorganic carbon 0. 5 MtC/yr in Scotland’s marine sediments. The main producer of carbon entering long-term storage in sediments is phytoplankton, 3. 9 MtC/yr, with coastal plants (predominantly kelp) potentially contributing a further 1. 8 MtC/yr. Habitat-forming species on the coast (seagrasses, saltmarsh, bivalve beds), are highly productive but their contribution to the overall carbon budget is very small because of the limited extent of each habitat. </p...|$|E

40|$|The EUNIS-compliant {{information}} on Seabed Habitats {{that is currently}} available from the EMODNET portal covers {{only about half of}} the European Union (EU) waters in the Northeast Atlantic and adjacent Seas with EU outermost regions {{in other parts of the}} Atlantic or in the Indian Ocean still remaining out of the exercise. These gaps limit the geographical comprehensiveness of any studies on seabed-related Ecosystem Functions and Services. However, separate broad-scale seabed habitat mapping sources offer complementary seabed-related geospatial information that can be straightforwardly or, after some basic GIS processing, translated into EUNIS classes. This work focused on expeditiously obtaining a comprehensive coverage of permanently submerged seabed habitats (i. e., EUNIS classes A 3 to A 6) throughout most of the EU marine waters. This was achieved by bringing in, and harmonizing where need, complementary EUNIS-compliant broad-scale geospatial information from the UNEP’s Global Seafloor Geomorphic Features Map (GSGFM). The new geospatial dataset obtained, a polygon shapefile, extends for approximately 8. 7 million km 2 and more than doubles the coverage of EUNIS seabed habitat classes when compared to the datasets available from the EMODNET Seabed Habitats portal. The new information details more than 90 % of the EU waters down to EUNIS level 2 and 3, improving EMODNET datasets by populating the deep-sea and offshore areas with previously disregarded geomorphic-based EUNIS habitat classes. Conversely, it is acknowledged that the GSGFM data could did not bring in any relevant information concerning EUNIS shelf habitats. The methodology and some area-based statistics on seabed habitat are presented, including overall and basin-specific mapped extents.

The total drymass accumulation shows striking variations between the pre-winter and post–winter populations.

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{associated}} fragmentation effects are well-recognised threats to biodiversity. Loss of functional connectivity (mobility, gene flow and demographic continuity) {{could result in}} population decline in altered habitat, because smaller, isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. We tested whether substantial habitat reduction plus fragmentation is associated with reduced gene flow in three 2 ̆ 7 decliner 2 ̆ 7 woodland-dependent bird species (eastern yellow robin, weebill and spotted pardalote) identified in earlier work to have declined disproportionately in heavily fragmented landscapes in the Box-Ironbark forest region in north-central Victoria, Australia. For these three decliners, and one 2 ̆ 7 tolerant 2 ̆ 7 species (striated pardalote), we compared patterns of genetic diversity, relatedness, effective population size, sex-ratios and genic (allele frequency) differentiation among landscapes of different total tree cover, identified population subdivision at the regional scale, and explored fine-scale genotypic (individual-based genetic signature) structure. Unexpectedly high genetic connectivity across the study region was detected for 2 ̆ 7 decliner 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 tolerant 2 ̆ 7 species. Power analysis simulations suggest that moderate reductions in gene flow should have been detectable. However, there was evidence of local negative effects of reduced <b>habitat</b> <b>extent</b> and structural connectivity: slightly lower effective population sizes, lower genetic diversity, higher within-site relatedness and altered sex-ratios (for weebill and eastern yellow robin) in 10 x 10 km 2 ̆ 7 landscapes 2 ̆ 7 with low vegetation cover. We conclude that reduced structural connectivity in the Box-Ironbark ecosystem may still allow sufficient gene flow to avoid {{the harmful effects of}} inbreeding in our study species.

40|$|Due to its {{fine grained}} and very ice-rich sediments, {{the coast of}} the Yukon Coastal Plain forms a very dynamic landscape. Changing climatic {{conditions}} add to this by lengthening open water periods and increasing permafrost temperature, which contributes to an increase of coastal erosion. Even though the Yukon Territory has no permanent settlements along its Beaufort coast, this region is of exceptional value as it serves as a calving area for the Porcupine Caribou Herd and it comprises numerous archaeological sites which are rare remains of the rich human history of this region. The importance of this area is underpinned by the fact that about two third of {{the coast of the}} Yukon Territory is protected as part of the Ivvavik National Park, which in turn is a candidate for the UNESCO world heritage site status. Additionally, recurring plans to develop oil and gas-related infrastructure would dramatically change the nature of the coastal environment.

Here, we present initial results of an assessment of shoreline dynamics and their influence on the coastal system in the Ivvavik National Park area. We first quantified shoreline changes of the approximately 150 km long coast by means of remote sensing data. We geocoded aerial photographs from the 1950 s, the 1970 s and the 1990 s to a GeoEye scene from 2011 and digitized the respective shorelines.

Assessing vulnerabilities of California’s salt marshes is {{a case study of}} the diversity and scale of problems that land managers will face. The major questions of this study were: 1) Are recent sediment budgets allowing southern California salt marshes to keep pace with SLR; 2) within its current range, how vulnerable are two sub-species of Ridgway’s rail (Rallus obsoletus; rails), a low elevation salt marsh specialist, to SLR; and 3) within its current range, how vulnerable are Belding’s savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis beldingi; sparrows), a high elevation salt marsh specialist, to SLR? To answer the first question, tidal creek sediment fluxes were measured in two sites with different levels of adjacent urbanization. To answer the second and third questions, original and pre-existing wildlife and habitat data were compiled at 17 sites to forecast habitat suitability. Storms and high tides led to sediment import in tidal creeks at Mugu and Seal. While sediment budgets were balanced during the dry study period, Seal’s elevation declined, and Mugu’s elevation plateaued, suggesting that only Mugu would persist if SLR rate stabilizes. For the Ridgway’s Rail study, under a SLR scenario of + 166 cm/ 100 yr, suitable habitat for the San Francisco Bay Area’s (SF) sub-species will increase by 35 % at mid-century, and current breeding <b>habitat</b> <b>extent</b> for Southern California’s (SC) sub-species will increase by 24 %.

40|$|Marine {{industries}} face {{a number}} of risks that necessitate careful analysis prior to making decisions on the siting of operations and facilities. An important emerging regulatory framework on environmental sustainability for business operations is the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 6 (IFC PS 6). Within PS 6, identification of biodiversity significance is articulated through the concept of “Critical Habitat”, a definition developed by the IFC and detailed through criteria aligned with those that support internationally accepted biodiversity designations. No publicly available tools have been developed in either the marine or terrestrial realm to assess the likelihood of sites or operations being located within PS 6 -defined Critical Habitat. This paper presents a starting point towards filling this gap {{in the form of}} a preliminary global map that classifies more than 13 million km 2 of marine and coastal areas of importance for biodiversity (protected areas, Key Biodiversity Areas [KBA], sea turtle nesting sites, cold- and warm-water corals, seamounts, seagrass beds, mangroves, saltmarshes, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps) based on their overlap with Critical Habitat criteria, as defined by IFC. In total, 5798 × 103 km 2 (1. 6 %) of the analysis area (global ocean plus coastal land strip) were classed as Likely Critical Habitat, and 7526 × 103 km 2 (2. 1 %) as Potential Critical Habitat; the remainder (96. 3 %) were Unclassified. The latter was primarily due to the paucity of biodiversity data in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction and/or in deep waters, and the comparatively fewer protected areas and KBAs in these regions. Globally, protected areas constituted 65. 9 % of the combined Likely and Potential Critical <b>Habitat</b> <b>extent,</b> and KBAs 29. 3 %, not accounting for the overlap between these two features. Relative Critical <b>Habitat</b> <b>extent</b> in Exclusive Economic Zones varied dramatically between countries.

This is being achieved through a combination of state-of-the-art hyperspectral remote sensing techniques, coupled with biodiversity field surveys of the area. Specific aims are to: 1. Use the hyperspectral data to create a bathymetry data set and broad-scale classification of the lagoon <b>habitats</b> over the <b>extent</b> of the Marine Park (Curtin University). 2. Develop a radiation transfer model and optimisation code that can be used by researchers on a number of different systems to reprocess atmospherically corrected reflectance data (Curtin University) ...|$|R
40|$|Eelgrass Zostera marina {{provides}} refuge {{to numerous}} fish species but {{is vulnerable to}} fragmentation through natural and anthropogenic disturbance. In Bonavista Bay, Newfoundland, eelgrass patch size was altered to measure changes in predation risk in Age- 0 juvenile cod, Gadus morhua. Artificial eelgrass mats of 5 sizes (0. 32, 1. 1, 5. 5, 11 and 22 m 2) were deployed in duplicate at each of 2 sites in Newman Sound in Terra Nova National Park during summer/autumn in 1999 and 2000. Predator distribution was determined {{using a combination of}} weekly underwater transect surveys and biweekly seining. Relative predation rates were measured by tethering Age- 0 cod at the center of each patch and recording the incidence of predation (n = 1116 tether sets). Predation rates were negatively correlated with patch size during both years, suggesting that larger patches reduce predator foraging ability. However, high predator densities in the largest eelgrass patch resulted in higher than expected rates of predation. Therefore, habitat dimension affected predation risk in juvenile cod via 2 opposing mechanisms. Our results stress the importance of considering both <b>habitat</b> areal <b>extent</b> and predator distribution when estimating the effects of habitat fragmentation on predation rates...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied a}} {{population}} of the rainforest frog Litoria genimaculata over a 7 -year period at Birthday Creek, an upland rainforest stream in northern Queensland. Estimated population size on a 60 -m transect fluctuated seasonally, decreasing to zero during most winters and reaching a maximum of over 130 during most warmer spring and summer months with an influx of young adult males. Summer population estimates were much smaller during 1990 – 93, coinciding with the disappearance of two sympatric species. However the L. genimaculata population subsequently recovered to pre-‘decline’ levels. Females were rarely captured along the stream so the operational sex ratio of adult frogs was strongly biased in favour of males (overall sex ratio 1 : 0. 04). Sexual dimorphism in this species is extreme. The mean weight of gravid females (23. 35 g) was nearly five times that of males (4. 68 g) and the ratio of female SVL to male SVL was 1. 65. Reproductive and fat-body condition changed seasonally, with males reaching peak reproductive condition in late spring and summer when population densities were greatest. Our data suggest that Litoria genimaculata uses Birthday Creek largely or exclusively as a reproductive <b>habitat.</b> The <b>extent</b> to which this species uses habitats away from stream environments remains to be determined...|$|R
