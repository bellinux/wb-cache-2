The economic landscape has changed significantly since then. But some things remain the same. Most notably, despite substantial improvement in the economy, unemployment is still far too high. Things still have a way to go before we can say we’ve fully recovered from the worst financial crisis and recession since the 1930 s. Today, I’ll talk about how I see the economy now and where I think it’s headed. I’ll offer my forecast {{for the next few years}} and discuss what the Federal Reserve is doing to boost the recovery.
