In fact, Obama {{claimed to be}} planning [...] "the largest <b>infrastructure</b> <b>program</b> in roads and bridges and other traditional infrastructure since {{the building of the}} Interstate Highway System in the 1950s."

2500|$|Jack Beale's father Rupert {{was elected}} a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the New South Wales state {{parliament}} in 1941. After Rupert Beale's death in 1942, Jack Beale {{ran in the}} by-election for his father's electorate, South Coast, winning as an independent and becoming {{at the age of}} 25 the youngest member of the NSW parliament. He served in parliament for 31 years and won three elections as an independent and 8 {{as a member of the}} Liberal Party. [...] He was an independent or in opposition for 22 consecutive years of his parliamentary career, and was a cabinet minister in the Askin government for the last nine 9 years. When Askin became Premier in 1965, he offered Jack Beale the Minister of Public Works portfolio, [...] which ranked fifth in state protocol. He declined the position and asked for the Minister for Conservation portfolio, which ranked thirteenth, but which was responsible for the state's water, soil and forests and which interested him more. He embarked on a program to develop the state's water resources, initiating comprehensive river valley surveys and an <b>infrastructure</b> <b>program</b> constructing new dams and weirs. While his primary motivation was to support farmers, he also directed water releases from state dams to preserve the ecology of the Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve.|$|E
40|$|Journal of Peace Research, vol. 31, no. 3, 1994. Refereed Journal ArticleIn {{the last}} twenty years, {{there has been a}} growing {{interest}} in quantifying the 'guns versus butter' tradeoff facing developing countries. This article examines Pakistan's military expenditures between 1973 and 1986 and estimates ·both a short-run impact model and long-run adjustment model to measure how changes in the defense burden, the deficit, and government debt have affected budget allocations to economic services programs and administrative/social programs. In addition, we investigate whether defense budgets have been increased or maintained either at the expense of economic and social programs in general or merely confined to one or two specific programs. Military expenditure patterns are analyzed {{to see whether or not}} they were responsible for across-the-board cuts in long-term <b>infrastructure</b> <b>programs.</b> Our analysis indicates that the deficit, the debt service, and the military burden are often interrelated in such a compleic manner that the impact of any specific program is difficult to predict. In the short run, most <b>infrastructure</b> <b>programs</b> increased as the military burden declined. The opposite was generally true for social programs such as social security, welfare, and housing. Changes in the defense budget appear to have only a transitory effect on the share of government expenditures allocated toward infrastructure. The long-run model suggests that social programs have just as high a priority as economic services. When the military burden increases, the government is willing to take some resources from <b>infrastructure</b> <b>programs</b> and lets the deficit grow to finance social programs. Our results also suggest a long run pattern of adjustment in social <b>programs</b> but not <b>infrastructure</b> <b>programs</b> - a counter-intuitive result given Pakistan's severe infrastructure constraints...|$|R
