5|$|Easy is {{the most}} recent major {{hurricane}} to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area. Due to the hurricane remaining near the northwest Florida coast {{for an extended period}} of time, Easy produced severe rainfall and strong waves, resulting in heavy damage in the Cedar <b>Key</b> <b>area.</b> Hurricane Easy was one of two major hurricanes to strike Florida during the year; the other was Hurricane King which affected Miami.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is also {{a promising}} way to treat cancers by silencing genes differentially upregulated in tumor cells or genes involved in cell division. A <b>key</b> <b>area</b> {{of research in the}} use of RNAi for clinical applications is the development of a safe delivery method, which to date has involved mainly viral vector systems similar to those suggested for gene therapy.|$|E
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{targeted}} as a <b>key</b> <b>area</b> for population development since the 1960s. In 1959, the London County Council negotiated 5000 new homes {{to be built}} in Ashford as overspill from London, which created most of what is now South Ashford and Kennington. The Buchanan Report, published in 1967, identified Ashford as a major town for growth. In 2001, Ashford was identified as one of four key areas for expansion in South East England. Subsequently, the Ashford's Future Company was set up to support a mix of publicly and privately funded projects in the town.|$|E

5|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a {{widespread}} change in lifestyle as the communities {{living in the}} British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this {{can be attributed to}} an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a <b>key</b> <b>area</b> for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E
5|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Beginning {{in the fifth}} {{millennium}} BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. Archaeologists {{have been unable to}} prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental Europe or because the indigenous Mesolithic Britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies. Either way, it certainly emerged through contact with continental Europe, probably as a result of centuries of interaction between Mesolithic people living in southeast Britain and Linear Pottery culture (LBK) communities in northeastern France. The region of modern Kent would have been a <b>key</b> <b>area</b> for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E

25|$|Benin's tactics {{were well}} organized, with {{preliminary}} plans weighed by the Oba and his sub-commanders. Logistics were organized to support missions {{from the usual}} porter forces, water transport via canoe, and requisitioning from localities the army passed through. Movement of troops via canoes was critically important in the lagoons, creeks and rivers of the Niger Delta, a <b>key</b> <b>area</b> of Benin's domination. Tactics in the field seem to have evolved over time. While the head on clash was well known, documentation from the 18th century shows greater emphasis on avoiding continuous battle lines, and more effort to encircle an enemy (ifianyako).|$|E
25|$|The Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program (EEETP) aims {{to improve}} air {{quality in the}} US and reduce {{dependence}} on foreign oil supplies. There are three key areas of research; electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings, which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a <b>key</b> <b>area</b> of research as the program aims to create affordable, carbon-neutral homes by 2020. Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, geothermal electricity and heating, lower cost wind generators and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.|$|E
25|$|A <b>key</b> <b>area</b> of {{advancement}} on the Mirage F1 {{over its}} predecessors {{was in its}} onboard avionics. The Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV monopulse radar system, developed from the Cyrano II unit installed on the Mirage IIIE, serves as the main sensor; it operates in three different modes: air-target acquisition and tracking, ground mapping, and terrain avoidance. The later Cyrano IV-1 model also provided for a limited look-down capability. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the Cyrano IV radar was capable of detecting aerial targets at double the range of earlier models. The standard production Mirage F1 was furnished with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), radar altimeter, UHF/VHF radio sets, Tactical Air Navigation system (TACAN) and aground data link. Other avionics include an autopilot and yaw damper.|$|E

25|$|NAS Fort Worth JRB units {{schedule}} {{a variety of}} airspace. The <b>key</b> <b>area</b> for fighter operations is the Brownwood Military Operations Area (Brownwood MOA). This MOA, originally developed to serve Commander, Naval Air Force Reserve (COMNAVAIRRESFOR) and 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW) fighter and fighter/attack squadrons stationed at the former Naval Air Station Dallas, now serves as the primary airspace resource for all fighter/attack units assigned to NAS Fort Worth JRB. It is scheduled by the NAS Fort Worth Operations Department; consolidated scheduling was evaluated {{for a period of}} time and the decision made to return this area to the Navy for scheduling. Nevertheless, user comments indicate that access to the area is allocated to its several users on a fair and equitable basis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the centre}} of the country, the populations of Ramla on the Jaffa – Jerusalem line and Lydda where this line joined the Haifa – El Kantara main line had large Arab majorities, who blocked Israelis from using {{railways}} or roads through this <b>key</b> <b>area.</b> One of the few train movements here after the British withdrawal was in July 1948 when Israeli forces launched Operation Danny to expel the Arab populations of Lydda and Ramla. When the Arab defenders blockaded the railway to help defend Lydda, an Israeli force reportedly used S100 0-6-0T number 21 as a battering ram to breach the fortifications. Although Operation Danny succeeded in forcing at least 50,000 Arab residents to leave Lydda and Ramla, the military situation between Ramla and Jerusalem still prevented the restoration of regular trains on that line until March 1950.|$|E
25|$|Transitional {{issues to}} ensure {{successful}} transitions to college, other post-secondary educational options, and careers are a <b>key</b> <b>area.</b> The high school counselor helps {{students and their}} families prepare for post-secondary education including college and careers (e.g. college, careers) by engaging {{students and their families}} in accessing and evaluating accurate information on what the National Office for School Counselor Advocacy calls the 8 essential elements of college and career counseling: (1) College Aspirations, (2) Academic Planning for Career and College Readiness, (3) Enrichment and Extracurricular Engagement, (4) College and Career Exploration and Selection Processes, (5) College and Career Assessments, (6) College Affordability Planning, (7) College and Career Admission Processes, and (8) Transition from High School Graduation to College Enrollment.
