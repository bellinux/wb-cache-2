This thesis evaluates the acceptance of and interest in <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> and multi-storey wood frames among different actors, {{and some of the}} underlying reasons for their approach. The results of quantitative and qualitative studies among members of the general public, private forest owners, architects, and contracts managers in Sweden are presented in six different papers. Both <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> and multi-storey wood frames lack sufficient acceptance and compliance with relevant institutions such as priorities, norms, and regulations {{in the eyes of the}} studied actors. The acceptance of <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> would be larger among members of the general public if they would perceive such practices to have less negative environmental effects and perceive a greater need to increase forest growth. Among the private forest owners, the interest to cultivate non-native tree species would be larger if there were more positive attitudes towards the economic consequences. Architects and contracts managers associate multistorey wood frames with several disadvantages and uncertainties, primarily with respect to fire safety, stability, durability, and sound proofing. The contracts managers’ perceptions have stronger implications for the prospects for wood frames, than the architects’ perceptions do.  Promotional activities aimed to change such perceptions may improve the prospects for more wood framed multi-storey buildings in Sweden. The path dependency of Swedish multi-storey construction however implies that such activities are not enough for multi-storey wood frames to diffuse to greater extent.

30|$|Within the boreal zone, {{the forests}} in Fennoscandian {{countries}} (Finland, Sweden and Norway) {{have been under}} the most intensive and long-lasting utilization (Table 1).

40|$|Lithuania and Southern Sweden {{share similar}} natural conditions, but differ {{considerably}} in forest policies and management; thereby providing an opportune basis for comparative studies. Since the 1990 s, Sweden {{has attempted to}} reduce {{the negative impact of}} its forest management on biodiversity, after decades of <b>intensive</b> production <b>forestry.</b> In contrast, Lithuania has been intensifying forestry practices associated with the post-soviet socio-economic transition. Here we assess the actual outcomes by comparing selected forest structure and composition variables known to be indicators for forest biodiversity; and estimate the prospective trends by scrutinising current forest policies and management. Our results indicate that Lithuanian forests consistently possessed higher rankings in six indices related to tree species composition, stand age, and deadwood quantities that are positively associated with forest biodiversity. The reverse is indicated by those data on stand age and tree diameter that are associated with centennial dynamics in forest utilisation intensity. With respect to policy instruments, Lithuania designates a substantially greater share of forest area to non-timber functions and legislates more severe management restrictions in forests targeting timber production. Concurrently, all estimates of forestry activities indicate more intensive forest management in Southern Sweden, including a higher share of artificial regeneration and shorter rotations. This allows concluding that, if current forest management practices persist, then an increased “biodiversity gap” may be expected between the two countries. The study concludes with discussing to what degree the identified trends are the direct product of targeted policies versus merely by-products of other factors. ...|$|R

Project n° 518128 : EFORWOOD: Tools for Sustainability Impact Assessment Thematic Priority: 6. 3 Global Change and EcosystemsThis report describes research {{carried out}} to derive scores for the recreational value of 240 forest stand types across Europe. The scores were obtained through a Delphi survey involving 46 European experts organised into 4 regional panels: Great Britain, Nordic Region, Central Europe, and Iberia. In each region, 60 forest stand types were defined according to three tree species types (conifer, broadleaved, and mixed), four phases of development (i. e. stand ages: establishment, young, medium and adult), and five forest management alternatives (FMAs) on a continuum from low {{to high levels of}} management intensity (forest nature reserves, close-to-nature forests, combined-objective <b>forestry,</b> <b>intensive</b> even-aged <b>forestry,</b> and wood biomass production). The resulting scores were applied in two ways. First, they were combined with outputs from the European forest resource projection model, EFISCEN, to estimate current and future recreational values under different policy scenarios. This is reported in EFORWOOD D 2. 3. 7. Secondly, which is the focus of this report, conjoint analysis was used to determine, in each European region, the relative importance of the three variables that defined the forest stand types: type of tree species, phase of development (i. e. stand age), and FMA. The research complements EFORWOOD D 2. 3. 3 which used other data derived from the same Delphi survey to assess the nature, and relative importance, of the relationship between 12 key silvicultural attributes and the recreational value of forests {{in each of the four}} regions. The findings suggest that, across Europe, tree species composition was of relatively minor importance in explaining the overall variation in scores. In UK and Central Europe, comparably high importance was attached to FMA and phase of development, while in the Nordic Region and Iberia, phase of development was considered more important than FMA. The relative importance attached to each FMA suggests that most visitors prefer close-to-nature or combined-objective forestry to unmanaged forest nature reserves. The low importance attached to tree species suggest that criticism directed towards non-native conifers, and perceived preferences for broadleaves across Europe, may not be due to the choice of tree species per se, but the use of conifers in intensive management regimes characterized by dense even-aged monocultures and short rotation lengths. It is acknowledged that such a finding may hide substantial variation in preferences between individuals and social groups, between people pursuing different recreational activities, and between geographical regions with their contrasting cultural landscapes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aspen {{naturally}} {{grows in}} large, single-species, even-aged stands that regenerate clonally after fire disturbance. This offers {{an opportunity for}} an <b>intensive</b> clonal <b>forestry</b> system that closely emulates the natural life history of the species. In this paper, we assess the potential of genetic tree improvement and clonal deployment to enhance the productivity of aspen forests in Alberta. We further investigate geographic patterns of genetic variation in aspen and infer forest management strategies under uncertain future climates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genetic variation among 242 clones from Alberta was evaluated in 13 common garden trials after 5 - 8 growing seasons in the field. Broad-sense heritabilities for height and diameter at breast height (DBH) ranged from 0. 36 to 0. 64, allowing 5 - 15 % genetic gains in height and 9 - 34 % genetic gains in DBH. Geographic partitioning of genetic variance revealed predominant latitudinal genetic differentiation. We further observed that northward movement of clones almost always resulted in increased growth relative to local planting material, while southward movement had a strong opposite effect. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Aspen forests are an important natural resource in western Canada that is used for pulp and oriented strandboard production, accounting for ~ 40 % of the total forest harvest. Moderate to high broad-sense heritabilities in growth traits suggest good potential for a genetic tree improvement program with aspen. Significant productivity gains appear possible through clonal selection from existing trials. We propose two breeding regions for Alberta, and suggest that well-tested southern clones {{may be used in}} the northern breeding region, accounting for a general warming trend observed over the last several decades in Alberta...|$|R

Political institutions, governmental agencies, forest companies, and environmental organizations have partly different views on what sustainable forestry means and what strategies to use to achieve it.

This paper analyses how different Swedish stakeholders evaluate the possibilities for <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry,</b> that is, to increase the production of woody biomass through increased use of fertilizers, improved genetic material, the introduction of exotic tree species, and the use of fastgrowing deciduous tree species.

40|$|Due {{to climate}} change, forests {{are likely to}} face new hazards, which may require {{adaptation}} of our existing silvicultural practices. However, {{it is difficult to}} imagine a forest management approach that can simultaneously minimize all risks of damage. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been developed to help decision makers choose between actions that require reaching a compromise among criteria of different weights. We adapted this method and produced a multicriteria risk analysis (MCRA) to compare the risk of damage associated with various forest management systems with a range of management intensity. The objective was to evaluate the effect of four forest management alternatives (FMAs) (i. e., close to nature, extensive management with combined objectives, intensive even-aged plantations, and short-rotation forestry for biomass production) on biotic and abiotic risks of damage in eight regional case studies combining three forest biomes (Boreal, Continental, Atlantic) and five tree species (Eucalyptus globulus, Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris, Picea sitchensis, and Picea abies) relevant to wood production in Europe. Specific forest susceptibility to a series of abiotic (wind, fire, and snow) and biotic (insect pests, pathogenic fungi, and mammal herbivores) hazards were defined by expert panels and subsequently weighted by corresponding likelihood. The PROMETHEE ranking method was applied to rank the FMAs from the most to the least at risk. Overall, risk was lower in short-rotation forests designed to produce wood biomass, because of the reduced stand susceptibility to the most damaging hazards. At the opposite end of the management intensity gradient, close-to-nature systems also had low overall risk, due to lower stand value exposed to damage. <b>Intensive</b> even-aged <b>forestry</b> appeared to be subject to the greatest risk, irrespective of tree species and bioclimatic zone.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{methodological approach}} {{is used to}} analyse the forest biomass production potential in the Middle Norrland region of Sweden, and its use to reduce carbon emissions. Forest biomass production, forest management, biomass harvest, and forest product use are analyzed in a system perspective considering the entire resource flow chains. The system-wide carbon flows as well as avoided carbon emissions are quantified for the activities of forest biomass production, harvest, use and substitution of non-biomass materials and fossil fuels. Five different forest management scenarios and two biomass use alternatives are developed and used in the analysis. The analysis is divided into four main parts. In the first part, plant biomass production is estimated using principles of plant-physiological processes and soil-water dynamics. Biomass production is compared under different forest management scenarios, some of which include the expected {{effects of climate change}} based on IPCC B 2 scenario. In the second part, forest harvest potentials are estimated based on plant biomass production data and Swedish national forest inventory data for different forest management alternatives. In the third part, soil carbon stock changes are estimated for different litter input levels from standing biomass and forest residues left in the forest during the harvest operations. The fourth and final part is the estimation of carbon emissions reduction due to the substitution of fossil fuels and carbon-intensive materials by the use of forest biomass. Forest operational activities such as regeneration, pre-commercial thinning, commercial thinning, fertilisation, and harvesting are included in the analysis. The total carbon balance is calculated by summing up the carbon stock changes in the standing biomass, carbon stock changes in the forest soil, forest product carbon stock changes, and the substitution effects. Fossil carbon emissions from forest operational activities are calculated and deducted to calculate the net total carbon balance. The results show that the climate change effect most likely will increase forest biomass production over the next 100 years compared to a situation with unchanged climate. As an effect of increased biomass production, there is a possibility to increase the harvest of usable biomass. The annual forest biomass production and harvest can be further increased by the application of more <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> practices compared to practices currently in use. Deciduous trees are likely to increase their biomass production because of climate change effects whereas spruce biomass is likely to increase because of implementation of <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> practices. IIIntensive forestry practices such as application of pre-commercial thinning, balanced fertilisation, and introduction of fast growing species to replace slow growing pine stands can increase the standing biomass carbon stock. Soil carbon stock increase is higher when only stem-wood biomass is used, compared to whole-tree biomass use. The increase of carbon stocks in wood products depends largely on the magnitude of harvest {{and the use of the}} harvested biomass. The biomass substitution benefits are the largest contributor to the total carbon balance, particularly for the intensive forest management scenario when whole-tree biomass is used and substitutes coal fuel and non-wood construction materials. The results show that the climate change effect could provide up to 104 Tg carbon emissions reduction, and <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> practices may further provide up to 132 Tg carbon emissions reduction during the next 100 years in the area studied. This study shows that production forestry can be managed to balance biomass growth and harvest in the long run, so that the forest will maintain its capacity to increase standing biomass carbon and provide continuous harvests. Increasing standing biomass in Swedish managed forest may not be the most effective strategy to mitigate climate change. Storing wood products in building materials delays the carbon emissions into the atmosphere, and the wood material in the buildings can be used as biofuel at the end of a building life-cycle to substitute fossil fuels. These findings show that the forest biomass production potential in the studied area increases with climate change and with the application of <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> practices. <b>Intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> practice has the potential for continuous increased biomass production which, if used to substitute fossil fuels and materials, could contribute significantly to net carbon emissions reductions and help mitigate climate change...|$|E
40|$|Capsule’’: <b>Intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> will delay {{recovery}} of severely damaged catchment areas. The geochemical model MAGIC {{was applied to}} estimate streamwater and soil chemistry between 1851 and 2030 at the Lysina catchment, an acid-sensitive granitic catchment covered by planted Norway spruce monoculture in the western Czech Republic. The total deposition of sulfur to the catchment was 164 meq m 2 in 1991, but had declined to 52 meq m 2 by 2000. Although SO 2 emissions in the region declined by 90 % compared to the 1980 s, acidification recovery was small within the period 1990 – 2000. Stream pH increased only slightly (from 3. 92 to 4. 07), although SO 4 concentration declined sharply from 568 meq l 1 (1990) to 232 meq l 1 (2000). Organic acids {{played an important role}} in streamwater buffering. According to the MAGIC prediction using deposition measured in 1999 – 2000, streamwater pH will increase to 4. 3 and soil base saturation will increase to 6. 2 % by 2030 (from 5. 7 % in 2002). Pre-industrial pH was estimated to be 5. 5 and soil base saturation 24. 7 %. The loss of base cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K) was caused predominantly by atmospheric acidity, but <b>intensive</b> <b>forestry</b> was responsible for approximately one third of the net base cation loss via accumulation in harvested biomass. Severely damaged sites, under continued pressure from forestry, will not return to a good environmental status in the near future (if ever) when the acid deposition input is only partially reduced. # 200...|$|E
40|$|Throughout its development, {{humankind}} has drastically {{changed the}} environment {{they live in}} due to their growing needs. Thus, forests has been used improperly by a process of degradation and conversion to other types of soil use, inhibiting their potential for more appropriate uses. Areas of Lands Forestry Vocation (TVF), are those who, due to their physical characteristics of soil, topography and rainfall should be kept with forest cover, or other sustainable use, to avoid the occurrence of negative externalities associated with soil and water. In this context, this article aims to identify, by means of techniques and tools geoprocessing, gvSIG software, satellite imagery and survey the field, areas with potential for TVF, using them for energy purposes in the Farm Iguaçu - StarMilk, located {{in the city of}} Céu Azul, the western region of the state of Paraná. This study is extremely important because it allows the identification and analysis of potential territorial energy use in the region, allowing proper use of soil aggregate values the social, environmental and economic. This analysis allowed us to separate the area under study for their potential in three classes: i) Good for forestry use, ii) Regular use for forestry, and iii) Good for <b>intensive</b> use and <b>forestry.</b> Pages: 2748 - 275...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{disturbance}} on symbiotic organisms such as lichens is particularly severe. In case of heterothallic lichen-forming fungi, disturbances {{may lead to}} unbalanced gene frequency and patchy distribution of mating types, thus inhibiting sexual reproduction and imposing clonality. The impact of disturbance on reproductive strategies and genetic diversity of clonal systems has so far received little attention. To infer the effects of disturbances on mating-type allele frequencies and population structure, we selected three populations in the Parc Jurassien Vaudois (Switzerland), which were affected by uneven-aged <b>forestry,</b> <b>intensive</b> logging and fire, respectively. We used microsatellite markers to infer genetic diversity, allelic richness and clonal diversity of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria and used L. pulmonaria-specific MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 markers to analyse the frequency and distribution of mating types of 889 individuals. Our study shows that stand-replacing disturbances affect the mating-type frequency and distribution, thus compromising the potential for sexual reproduction. The fire-disturbed area had a significantly lower genetic and genotypic diversity and a higher clonality. Furthermore, the majority of compatible mating pairs in this area were beyond the effective vegetative dispersal range of the species. We conclude that stand-replacing disturbances lead to lower chances of sex and symbiont reshuffling and thus have long-lasting negative consequences on the reproductive strategies and adaptive potential of epiphytic lichen symbiose...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intensive</b> modern <b>forestry</b> is {{a threat}} to beetles {{depending}} on dead wood (saproxylic beetles). To mitigate these negative effects, forests are regularly set aside as woodland key habitats or retention patches, as supplements to nature reserves. However, there are considerable uncertainties regarding the relative effectiveness of woodland key habitats and retention patches. In addition, {{it is important to know}} if these types of conservation are effective for organisms with different ecology and biology. To explore these issues, the species richness, abundance and composition of spruce-associated saproxylic beetles was compared between 8 woodland key habitats, 9 retention patches and one nature reserve, in one production forest in Norway. Two types of flight intercept traps were used, which were placed on Norway spruce (Picea abies). Furthermore, I assessed if fungivores and cambium consumers of spruce-associated saproxylic beetles had similar responses to the management categories. Then I examined the relationship between the beetles and environmental variables. Lastly, it was tested for relationships between the species richness of saproxylic beetles and wood-decaying fungi found on the same logs as the traps. My results were that woodland key habitats, but not retention patches, had a significantly different species richness of saproxylic beetles from the nature reserve. No significant differences were found in species abundance. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in species richness or abundance of fungivores and cambium consumers between the management categories. Also, dead-wood parameters and sun-exposure could not explain the variation in species richness. However, species composition differences between management categories were significant for saproxylic beetles, but not for fungivores or cambium consumers. Lastly, the species richness of fungi did neither correlate with the species richness of saproxylic beetles, nor with the different functional groups. These results indicate that the conservation value of the woodland key habitats and the retention patches are useful supplements to the nature reserve, in terms of conserving spruce-associated saproxylic beetles in Selvik. Also, the correlation between spruce-associated saproxylic beetles and fungi appears to be weak on a relatively small temporal and spatial scale. However, it is unclear if the populations that were sampled in woodland key habitats and retention patches will be sustained over time, or if they will go extinct as a result of the relatively high degree of fragmentation in these management categories...|$|R
