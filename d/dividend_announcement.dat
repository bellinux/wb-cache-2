40|$|Dividends are {{the portion}} of the company’s {{earnings}} paid to the shareholders. Many researchers have used different estimation techniques to estimate the smoothness of dividends, determinants of dividends and the impact of <b>dividend</b> <b>announcements</b> on share prices. They used these estimation techniques in order to understand better the reason that companies smooth their dividends, be able to know what determines the dividend decisions and determine if the market reaction to the <b>dividend</b> <b>announcements</b> can be predicted. However, these investigations have been unsuccessful in finding an agreement on the above three issues. Furthermore, the concentration of such empirical investigations has been on the developed markets; rather few studies have been conducted on the developing markets such as Jordan. This study has tried to fill three main gaps in the previous literature by empirically investigating the smoothness of dividends, the determinants of the two dividend decisions and the impact of <b>dividend</b> <b>announcements</b> on share prices. In addition, different empirical methods have been used in the three empirical chapters: firstly, fixed and random effects techniques are used to check the smoothness of dividends; secondly, the results of three estimation techniques (OLS, Tobit and Heckman’s simultaneous technique) are compared to estimate the determinants of the two dividend decisions; finally, the standard OLS event study methodology is compared with a hybrid method (OLS/EGARCH) to check the impact of the <b>dividend</b> <b>announcements</b> on share prices. The results of the first empirical chapter confirmed that the non-financial Jordanian companies smooth their dividends in a moderate rate. In addition, our results contradict the signalling theory; we find that large companies smooth their dividend faster than small ones. Furthermore, in line with the agency cost theory; low leveraged firms smooth their dividends faster than high leveraged firms. Also, our results confirmed that highly profitable companies smooth their dividend more and this comes in line with the signalling theory. The second empirical chapter concluded that Hechman’s model is the better technique to estimate the determinants of the two dividend decisions. The main determinants are profitability, growth, leverage and size. The last empirical chapter showed that the Hybrid method provided a higher level of significance and concluded that dividend has no impact on share prices on the <b>dividend</b> <b>announcements</b> day.

Investors have two ways to make profits with stocks: capital appreciation and annual income in the form of dividend. Capital appreciation is possible in bullish trend.

However, we find that the common negative relation between current short selling and future daily returns prior to unfavorable <b>dividend</b> <b>announcements</b> is similar to the negative relation during non-event times, suggesting that <b>dividend</b> <b>announcements</b> do not provide unusual trading opportunities for informed traders (Gonedes, 1978, and Benartzi et al., 1997). Around ex-dividend dates, we do find abnormal short selling, which may be explained by the return pattern around ex-dividend days documented by Lakonishok and Vermaelen (1986), who suggest that demand for a particular stock by dividend capture traders drives stock prices above their fundamental value thus providing a profitable trading opportunity for short sellers. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that both the level of short selling and the return predictability of short selling is markedly higher on and after the ex-dividend day than during non-event times.
