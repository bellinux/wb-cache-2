40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} approach {{for developing a}} real-time simulation for working mobile vehicles based on multibody modeling. The use of multibody modeling allows comprehensive description of the constrained motion of the mechanical systems involved and permits real-time solving of the equations of motion. By carefully selecting the multibody formulation method to be used, {{it is possible to}} increase the accuracy of the multibody model {{while at the same time}} solving equations of motion in real-time. In this study, a multibody procedure based on semi-recursive and augmented Lagrangian methods for real-time dynamic simulation application is studied in detail. In the semirecursive approach, a velocity transformation matrix is introduced to describe the dependent coordinates into relative (joint) coordinates, which reduces the size of the generalized coordinates. The augmented Lagrangian method is based on usage of global coordinates and, in that method, constraints are accounted using an iterative process. A multibody system can be modelled as either rigid or flexible bodies. When using flexible bodies, the system can be described using a floating frame of reference formulation. In this method, the deformation mode needed can be obtained from the finite element model. As the finite element model typically involves large number of degrees of freedom, reduced number of deformation modes can be obtained by employing model order reduction method such as Guyan reduction, Craig-Bampton method and Krylov subspace as shown in this study The constrained motion of the working mobile vehicles is actuated by the force from the hydraulic actuator. In this study, the hydraulic system is modeled using lumped fluid theory, in which the hydraulic circuit is divided into volumes. In this approach, the pressure wave propagation in the <b>hoses</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes</b> is neglected. The contact modeling is divided into two stages: contact detection and contact response. Contact detection determines when and where the contact occurs, and contact response provides the force acting at the collision point. The friction between tire and ground is modelled using the LuGre friction model, which describes the frictional force between two surfaces. Typically, the equations of motion are solved in the full matrices format, where the sparsity of the matrices is not considered. Increasing the number of bodies and constraint equations leads to the system matrices becoming large and sparse in structure. To increase the computational efficiency, a technique for solution of sparse matrices is proposed in this dissertation and its implementation demonstrated. To assess the computing efficiency, augmented Lagrangian and semi-recursive methods are implemented employing a sparse matrix technique. From the numerical example, the results show that the proposed approach is applicable and produced appropriate results within the real-time period...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} the forensic reconstruction {{of a powerful}} explosion that occurred in a flour mill in Italy in 2007. The mill produced wheat flour and was organised over 4 floors inside a very old building. The explosion occurred just after a tanker had been loaded with flour {{which was to be}} delivered to customers. Since the truck was loaded with a slight excess of flour, a small amount was sent back to one of the silos, via pneumatic transport, through a rubber hose connected to a steel pipe. The explosion destroyed the building and killed 5 workers. Through an analysis of the collected evidence, the testimony of the witnesses and an examination of the debris, the causes and dynamics of the explosion are here described. It was recognised that the explosion was ignited because of an electrostatic arc that occurred in the pneumatic transport duct. Signs of the explosion in the duct were evident because of the deformation that was provoked by internal overpressure. The triggering discharge occurred at the joint between the <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> the <b>pipe.</b> The pipe deformations were coherent with calculations of an internal pressure increase according to EN 14491. The explosion propagated to a flour silo and then to the whole building through the elevator case, and resulted in many secondary explosions.

The anti-submarine aircraft employed were initially the Fairey Swordfish and later the Grumman Avenger, which could be armed with torpedoes, depth charges, 250 lb bombs or the RP-3 rocket projectile. As well as carrying out their own attacks on U-Boats, these aircraft identified their locations for the convoy's escorts to mount an attack. Typically anti-submarine patrols would be flown between dawn and dusk. One aircraft would fly about 10 mi ahead of the convoy, while another patrolled astern.

40|$|The {{control of}} dust on {{construction}} sites {{is an issue}} of concern of many communities that experience a high level of construction activity. Dust suppression typically involves using large water trucks to spray haul roads, material stockpiles, and other areas being worked by equipment. This method of dust control leads to labor, operating, and safety costs and complications that can limit and sometimes prohibit its implementation. Other spray methods that are cost-effective, easy to implement, functionally viable, and safe are needed that provide direct and effective dust control for each piece of equipment. This paper describes a research project to develop and evaluate a water spray system for suppressing dust emissions that is attached directly to a piece of earthmoving equipment, specifically a dump truck. The system consists of distribution <b>hose,</b> <b>pipe,</b> <b>and</b> spray nozzles attached to the perimeter of the truck body, and a water pump and water tank secured to the truck 2 ̆ 7 s frame.
