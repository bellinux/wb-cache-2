5000|$|New {{features}} on the 2005 RL included a keyless entry system which allowed the driver to both lock and unlock the car by touching the door handle, without having to use the remote control, and a <b>keyless</b> <b>start</b> system. A new 260 watt, ten speaker Bose DVD-Audio 5.1 sound system equalized for the RL cabin featured several Bose technologies. [...] Bose AudioPilot is a noise compensation technology which analyzes background environmental cabin noise and uses an algorithm based on cabin acoustics to boost certain portions of the musical signal so {{that it may be}} heard more clearly above environmental sound [...] "clutter" [...] without any apparent change in volume. [...] Bose Centerpoint processes stereo and matrix surround sound recordings to allow play through the 5.1 sound system even though the source may only be a stereo sound track. Bose Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) rounded out the suite. Always on, whether the stereo was on or not, ANC took input from two microphones placed in the cabin to analyze drivetrain-related low-frequency sound waves entering the cabin. The ANC sent information to the sound system to create a precisely shaped and timed reverse-phased audio signal from the door speakers and the subwoofer. The result was a dramatic reduction in engine and exhaust noise.|$|E

40|$|Chirp signals {{have been}} {{extensively}} used in radar and sonar systems to determine distance, velocity and angular position {{of objects and}} in wireless communications as a spread spec-trum technique to provide robustness and high processing gain. Recently, several standards have adopted chirp spread spectrum (CSS) as an underlying physical-layer scheme for precise, low-power and low-complexity real-time localiza-tion. While CSS-based ranging and localization solutions have been implemented and deployed, their security has {{so far not been}} analyzed. In this work, we analyze CSS-based ranging and localiza-tion systems. We focus on distance decreasing relay attacks that have proven detrimental for the security of proximity-based access control systems (e. g., passive vehicle <b>keyless</b> entry and <b>start</b> systems). We describe a set of distance decreasing attacks realizations and verify their feasibility by simulations and experiments on a commercial ranging system. Our results demonstrate that an attacker is able to effectively reduce the distance measured by chirp-based ranging systems from 150 m to 600 m depending on chirp configuration. Finally, we discuss possible countermeasures against these attacks...|$|R
40|$|Multicarrier phase-based ranging is fast {{emerging}} as a cost-optimized solution {{for a wide variety}} of proximity-based applications due to its low power requirement, low hardware complexity and compatibility with existing standards such as ZigBee and 6 LoWPAN. Given potentially critical nature of the applications in which phase-based ranging can be deployed (e. g., access control, asset tracking), it is important to evaluate its security guarantees. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the security of multicarrier phase-based ranging systems and specifically focus on distance decreasing relay attacks that have proven detrimental to the security of proximity-based access control systems (e. g., vehicular passive <b>keyless</b> entry and <b>start</b> systems). We show that phase-based ranging, as well as its implementations, are vulnerable to a variety of distance reduction attacks. We describe different attack realizations and verify their feasibility by simulations and experiments on a commercial ranging system. Specifically, we successfully reduced the estimated range to less than 3 m even though the devices were more than 50 m apart. We discuss possible countermeasures against such attacks and illustrate their limitations, therefore demonstrating that phase-based ranging cannot be fully secured against distance decreasing attacks.

2500|$|Offered {{in three}} levels of luxury: [...] "G", [...] "G Limited Edition", and [...] "G Dignis Edition", AWD is {{optional}} on the two base trims ("G Four" [...] and [...] "G Four Limited Edition"). The base-line Camry [...] "G" [...] features 16-inch steel wheels, six airbags, <b>keyless</b> entry and <b>start,</b> [...] "Optitron" [...] gauges, speed-sensitive automatic door locks, a four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever, a wood grain center console, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, and an electric driver's seat (FWD only). The second level [...] "G Limited Edition" [...] gains 16-inch alloy wheels and cruise control, while the top-level [...] "G Dignis Edition" [...] features a metallic-finished grille insert, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), rain-sensing windscreen wipers, wood grain inserts for {{the steering wheel and}} shift knob, and a [...] widescreen touch LCD (incorporating satellite navigation, television, Bluetooth handsfree support, and G-BOOK telematics). Daihatsu continued with its Altis variant for the Japanese market, also introduced on 30 January 2006. Offered in [...] "G Limited Edition" [...] (FWD) and [...] "G Four Limited Edition" [...] (AWD) specification levels, the Altis roughly correlates with the Camry equivalents. Visually, the Altis is identical to the Japanese market Camry, with only the badging unique to the Daihatsu.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} relay {{attacks on}} Passive <b>Keyless</b> Entry and <b>Start</b> (PKES) systems used in modern cars. We build two efficient and inexpensive attack realizations, wired and wireless physical-layer relays, {{that allow the}} attacker to enter and start a car by relaying messages between {{the car and the}} smart key. Our relays are completely independent of the modulation, protocol, or presence of strong authentication and encryption. We perform an extensive evaluation on 10 car models from 8 manufacturers. Our results show that relaying the signal in one direction only (from the car to the key) is sufficient to perform the attack while the true distance between the key and car remains large (tested up to 50 meters, non line-of-sight). We also show that, with our setup, the smart key can be excited from up to 8 meters. This removes the need for the attacker to get close to the key in order to establish the relay. We further analyze and discuss critical system characteristics. Given the generality of the relay attack and the number of evaluated systems, it is likely that all PKES systems based on similar designs are also vulnerable to the same attack. Finally, we propose immediate mitigation measures that minimize the risk of relay attacks as well as recent solutions that may prevent relay attacks while preserving the convenience of use, for which PKES systems were initially introduced...|$|R
