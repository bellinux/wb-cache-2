The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaudí conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaudí deeply regretted the project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Família, in particular the design of the towers, with their paraboloid shape like those of the Missions.|$|E

In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from RAF Kenley made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.|$|E

This paper presents a new 2 -D chaos based lossless image encryption method. This method is user key based encryption and decryption.

This method generates large key space which results bruit force attack. <b>In</b> <b>spites</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> proposed algorithm is simple enough to consume fewer amounts of computations resulting fast processing. Statistical analysis <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method has been performed and result shows that proposed method is secure enough and is suitable for image encryption...|$|R
