In response to complaints that the All Fronts Collection had identical pricing to the Dark Corners add-on, but significantly more content, {{as well as the}} All Fronts Collection retail package not being made available in certain regions, Epic Games adjusted the release plan; the All Fronts Collection was released digitally via Xbox Live and the Dark Corners add-on was reduced in price.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing <b>gears</b> with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing <b>gears</b> if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|September 21, 1992 KORL, CESSNA 210L, N2013S, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Pilot {{stated that}} while {{attempting}} to extend the landing <b>gear</b> the <b>gear</b> hydraulic motor operated but the <b>gear</b> did not extend. After several seconds of <b>gear</b> motor operation the circuit breaker for the <b>gear</b> motor popped. Further attempts to extend the <b>gear</b> by normal and emergency procedures were unsuccessful. A <b>gear</b> up landing was made. After the accident the aircraft was raised and the landing <b>gear</b> was extended by use of the manual <b>gear</b> extension emergency hydraulic pump. According to maintenance personnel a wire to the nose landing <b>gear</b> squat switch was chafed and grounded which caused the system to be signaled for <b>gear</b> up at all times. They further stated the pilot could not extend the <b>gear</b> by use of the backup hydraulic pump because the <b>gear</b> down solenoid had overheated during attempts to lower the <b>gear</b> and froze in the <b>gear</b> up position. After the solenoid cooled after landing {{they were able to}} manually lower the <b>gear.</b> Probable cause(s): Undetected chafing and grounding of a wire to the nose landing <b>gear</b> squat switch which resulted in the landing <b>gear</b> being signaled at all times for <b>gear</b> up when electrical power was applied to the system. Contributing to the accident was the overheating of the <b>gear</b> down solenoid which caused it to stick in the <b>gear</b> up position and prevented the <b>gear</b> from being manually extended.|$|R
