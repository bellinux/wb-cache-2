RAI International's latest politically appointed President (an avowed right wing nationalist and former spokesperson for Giorgio Almirante, the leader of the post-fascist party of Italy) had unilaterally terminated a 20-year-old agreement and stripped all of its 1,500 to 2,000 annual hours of programming from Telelatino (TLN), a Canadian-run channel which had devoted 95% of its prime time schedule to RAI programs for 20 years since TLN was founded. All Italian-Canadians were denied RAI programming by RAI International's removal of its programming from the Canadian marketplace, a move intended to create a public outcry and a threat that Canadians would resort to using satellite viewing cards obtained via the US in order to watch RAI, even though these cards were either grey market or black market, according to different analyses (see below).

One hundred and fifty (150) <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies, selected from the Times 1000 (1995), were matched with 150 United Kingdom Domestic Companies on the bases of size and industry. The reported performance data of the two sub samples for five years were extracted from the FT Extel secured database. Statistical tests were then carried out, on five year average and annual bases, to establish whether there were differences in the performances {{of the two groups}} of firms. Results revealed statistically significant differences in the reported performances of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies and United Kingdom Domestic Companies operating in the United Kingdom over the five year period. <b>Foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> firms significantly under performed United Kingdom Domestic Companies of comparable size and industry.

The study also found differences in the year to year magnitude of under performance by <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies. While findings in this study corroborate those of earlier United States based studies, the management and owners of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies’ parents should be interested in the apparent underperformance of their United Kingdom based assets.

In which case, the United Kingdom tax authorities may want to take a closer look at <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Ccompanies’ reported performances to establish whether they are the outcome of income shifting practices. Future studies could examine how the performances of the managers of these foreign located assets are evaluated and rewarded and explore other possible explanatory factors for their reported under performance...|$|E

40|$|Under profit-based {{transfer}} pricing methods, {{the selection of}} comparable companies is essential if detection of transfer price manipulation is to be reliable. Comparative advantage as embedded in internalisation theory argues that <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies should, in the long run, display greater profitability than domestic controlled companies. In high tax host countries {{transfer pricing}} manipulation theory predicts an opposite effect on profitability. Applying a refined set of tests to a large sample of firms operating in a high tax country such as Italy offers {{strong support for the}} internalisation prediction. Furthermore, the analysis of the inter-quartile range of our measure of profitability indicates that only a low percentage of <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies would be subject to fiscal enquires, as implied by the OECD guidelines, under the suspicious of transfer pricing manipulation.
