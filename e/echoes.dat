5|$|Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: <b>Echoes</b> of Time Original Soundtrack is {{the soundtrack}} album of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: <b>Echoes</b> of Time, {{containing}} {{the majority of}} the musical tracks from the game, and was composed by Kumi Tanioka. It was released by Square Enix on February 18, 2009. Like previous Crystal Chronicles soundtracks, <b>Echoes</b> incorporates a variety of instruments, including oboes, xylophones, marimbas and Latin guitars. Unlike the previous Crystal Chronicles soundtracks, the <b>Echoes</b> does not include a theme song. The soundtrack spans 51 tracks over 2 discs, covering a duration of 2:07:30, and has the catalog numbers SQEX-10137~8.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime 2: <b>Echoes</b> was {{originally}} released for the GameCube in North America on November 15, 2004, Europe on November 26, and in Australia on December 2. The PAL version of <b>Echoes</b> have lacked the standard 50Hz mode, and offered 60Hz mode only. In Japan, {{it was later}} released on May 26, 2005, titled Metroid Prime 2: Dark <b>Echoes.</b>|$|E

5000|$|These {{methods are}} {{commonly}} called acoustic <b>echo</b> suppression (AES) and acoustic <b>echo</b> cancellation (AEC), and more rarely line <b>echo</b> cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more precise, {{as there are}} various types and causes of <b>echo</b> with unique characteristics, including acoustic <b>echo</b> (sounds from a loudspeaker being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary substantially over time) and line <b>echo</b> (electrical impulses caused by, e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than acoustic <b>echo).</b> In practice, however, the same techniques are used to treat all types of <b>echo,</b> so an acoustic <b>echo</b> canceller can cancel line <b>echo</b> as well as acoustic <b>echo.</b> [...] "AEC" [...] in particular is commonly {{used to refer to}} <b>echo</b> cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were intended for acoustic <b>echo,</b> line <b>echo,</b> or both.|$|R
5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive <b>echoes</b> back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning <b>echoes</b> yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so <b>echoes</b> still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning <b>echoes</b> by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before <b>echoes</b> return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning <b>echoes</b> provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic <b>echo</b> arises due to {{acoustic}} coupling between the loud-speaker and the microphone of a communication device. Acous-tic <b>echo</b> cancellation and suppression techniques {{are used to}} reduce the acoustic <b>echo.</b> In this work we propose to first cancel the early <b>echo,</b> which {{is related to the}} early part of the <b>echo</b> path, and sub-sequently suppress the late <b>echo,</b> which is related to the later part of the <b>echo</b> path. The identification of the <b>echo</b> path is carried out in the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) domain, where a trade-off is facilitated between distortion of the near-end speech, residual <b>echo,</b> convergence rate, and robustness to <b>echo</b> path changes. Experimen-tal results demonstrate that the system achieves high <b>echo</b> and noise reduction while maintaining low distortion of the near-end speech. In addition, it is shown that the proposed system is more robust to <b>echo</b> path changes compared to an acoustic canceller alone.

5|$|Of the {{released}} games, Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fates, and <b>Echoes</b> of Time are {{the only}} ones to have a released soundtrack.

5|$|<b>Echoes</b> also {{features}} a multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to engage in combat using a split screen. It has six arenas and two modes: Deathmatch, in which players attempt to kill their opponents {{as many times as}} possible within a set amount of time; and Bounty, which focuses on collecting coins that injured characters drop. Multiplayer in <b>Echoes</b> features the same control scheme as the single-player mode, including the lock-on system for circle strafing while targeting.|$|E

5|$|The greater noctule bat {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Microchiroptera and uses echolocation. Echolocation is a perceptual system where <b>echoes</b> are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning <b>echoes</b> which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark. The greater noctule bat has keen hearing and sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Echo</b> in the {{telephone}} network {{is a well-known}} phenomenon [...] long delays and noticeable <b>echo</b> may create significant or even unbearable disturbance in a telephone conversation. <b>Echo</b> cancellation is a technique to reduce the <b>echo</b> to an acceptable level.

5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce <b>echoes.</b> By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning <b>echoes,</b> {{the brain and}} auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
