In 2015, the perpetrators of the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary met at the pub to discuss the crime shortly after it occurred, but were secretly filmed there by the Flying Squad. All were subsequently arrested and sent to prison. The current owners, Geronimo Inns, wish {{to distance themselves from}} the burglary and forbid staff to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> customers.|$|E

25|$|The Prince's bath {{before dinner}} is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} Father Pirrone. Concetta has asked Father Pirrone to tell her father that she is in love with Tancredi and that she believes her feelings to be returned. The Prince ponders his fondness for Concetta, which is based in her apparent submissiveness and placidity. However, he thinks that Tancredi's ambitions may require more money than Concetta will bring as her dowry. Keeping his thoughts to himself, the Prince decrees that Father Pirrone is to tell Concetta that the Prince will <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> her later.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of the {{original}} Star Wars (1977), series creator George Lucas hired science fiction author Leigh Brackett to write the sequel with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment. The treatment is similar to the final film, except that Vader does not reveal he is Luke's father. In the first draft that Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke. Lucas was disappointed with the script, but Brackett died of cancer before he could <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> her. With no writer available, Lucas had to write the next draft himself. In this draft, he made use of a new plot twist: Vader claiming to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the year-long struggles writing the first film.|$|E
25|$|Laake reached {{minister}} Ljungberg {{by telephone}} at 0200hrs and discussed mobilizing the army. Laake suggested mobilizing the 1st to the 4th Brigades of the army, meaning {{most of the}} forces ready for mobilization in Eastern, Southern and Western Norway. This was the most wide-ranging of the mobilization alternatives that Laake had proposed on 8 April. Ljungberg quickly received approval from the government, and relayed the message to Laake. The government had agreed with a mobilization and left it to the military {{to decide on the}} details. After the telephone conversation, an argument quickly broke out between Laake and Hatledal. Hatledal viewed the mobilization in question was inadequate and wanted a total and open mobilization, rather than the silent and partial mobilization by mail that Laake was organizing. Laake stated that if Hatledal wanted an open mobilization then he could <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> minister Ljungberg when the minister arrived at the general staff at Akershus Fortress.|$|E
25|$|Rose and the Doctor also {{decide to}} {{investigate}} the party and don servant garb to disguise themselves. The Doctor and Rose learn that Pete and Jackie are childless and about to divorce. When Rose attempts to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Jackie she is rebuked for overstepping her bounds. Suddenly the party is interrupted by the Cybermen, who smash {{into the house and}} surround the guests. Lumic calls the President, who is in attendance, telling him that he is moving forward with his plans and that all of humanity will be upgraded. Lumic tells everyone that upgrading is compulsory and that anyone who refuses will be deleted. The President refuses to be upgraded and is killed by a Cyberman. The partygoers panic, try to flee and the Cybermen begin killing them. The Doctor, Rose, and Pete escape the house and encounter Mickey and the Preachers outside. They try firing upon the advancing Cybermen with automatic rifles, but their bullets do no damage and soon they are surrounded. The Doctor tells everyone to surrender and tells the Cybermen that they are volunteering for the upgrade. The Cybermen tell them that they are incompatible and will be deleted. The episode ends with the Cybermen advancing on them.|$|E

25|$|Allegations of {{cheating}} reignited at the French Grand Prix, when, starting from {{third on the}} grid Schumacher overtook both of the Williams drivers, Damon Hill and Nigel Mansell, leading into the first corner of the race. This raised suspicions, once again, that Benetton were using traction control. There were also incidents involving other teams, notably Ferrari and McLaren. While commentating on the race for Eurosport with John Watson and Allard Kalff, Williams driver David Coulthard, who was replaced by Mansell for the race, stated that Schumacher's start {{reminded him of the}} type of starts from the 1993 season when traction control was legal. Hill was on pole position for the British Grand Prix after qualifying fastest. During the parade lap {{on the way to the}} starting grid, Schumacher, starting second, illegally overtook Hill. As a result of his illegal maneuver, Schumacher was given a five-second penalty at 14:27 local time, 27minutes after the original incident. Schumacher never came into the pit lane to serve the penalty when originally given the penalty, and on lap21, Schumacher was given the black flag. Schumacher stayed out on the circuit while Benetton team boss Briatore, along with Benetton technical director Tom Walkinshaw went to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Race Director Roland Bruynseraede, arguing that they had not been properly informed of the punishment given. Schumacher eventually served the time penalty on lap27, finishing the race in second position behind Hill.|$|E

He was also the first one to fight against the people of Syria in the battle for the water. Moreover, he believes there exists no narration from the family of Ali ibn Abi Talib supporting these accusations against al-Ash'ath, neither his family did not <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> any member of al-Ash'ath's family.

500|$|As the 30th {{anniversary of}} Star Trek was approaching, {{a number of}} plans were being put into place. The film [...] was {{entering}} production, a television special was planned to celebrate the franchise and George Takei had been cast {{to appear in the}} [...] episode [...] "". Producer Ira Steven Behr later recalled that he thought that Deep Space Nine might end up being missed out as he considered it to be the [...] "middle child" [...] of the franchise. However, Rick Berman contacted Behr and asked him if he would be interested in doing something to celebrate the anniversary. Behr agreed to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the staff writers. Initially, there was concern that if the proposed episode aired during the actual anniversary week (around September 8), that it would have to serve as the season opener, pre-empting the already planned opener.|$|E
500|$|During the localization, Bateman had to {{keep track}} of the {{numerous}} plot points throughout the game, as the script had not been written in chronological order due to the numerous endings. Localizing the game took roughly two months. Another big challenge was getting the localization done in time: Nobara Nakayama, the game's translator, worked on it for 30 days, and the editing process took two months. Because of this, Bateman had to do most of the work [...] "on the fly". Nakayama had started playing the game prior to starting work on the localization, but did not finish playing it until she was more than halfway through translating it; after learning that the plot hinged on a Japanese pun, they had to halt the localization, <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Uchikoshi, come up with a solution, and go through the whole game to make sure that it still made sense.|$|E

With regard {{to his first}} assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied {{that he could not}} be more explicit than saying [...] "ind out what you can without damaging the specimen". After the first hours, Shaler thought he had [...] "compassed that fish," [...] but despite Agassiz always being [...] "within call" [...] he was not asked to present his conclusions. During the course of the following week, Shaler recorded the details of [...] "how the scales went in series, their shape, the form and placement of the teeth, etc." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{sculptor}} Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, {{who later}} recounted the story, Laboulaye's comment {{was not intended}} as a proposal, but it inspired Bartholdi. Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III, Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Laboulaye. Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects; in the late 1860s, he approached Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, a plan to build Progress or Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia, a huge lighthouse {{in the form of}} an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant, robed and holding a torch aloft, at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said. Sketches and models were made of the proposed work, though it was never erected. There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal, the Colossus of Rhodes: an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun, Helios. This statue is believed to have been over [...] high, and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships.|$|E
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them to know what I came through and I didn't <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> none of them... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E

[...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name.

500|$|Mwyn {{departed}} {{the band}} when the band's time with Crai {{came to an}} end, and {{a few weeks later}} MRM sought to remove Pegg, leaving it to Matthews to tell her. Pegg was upset, and refused to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> journalists. After her departure, the single [...] "Whale" [...] was published on the Rough Trade Records label. The band had rushed to record it, having only been given a month's notice by the label that they would release on their songs in September 1994. Unlike Hooked, [...] "Whale" [...] was named the NME single of the week akin to For Tinkerbell. The band appeared in the mainstream press for two incidents, the first was when they were thrown off a train at Swindon as they were travelling to London after arguing with a train guard about punk rock, and the other when they swore at the bouncers in Welsh at the Underworld club in Camden and were banned. A further single, [...] "Bleed" [...] was recorded the following November, and was released in February 1995 on Nursery Records. Geoff Travis, who had released [...] "Whale" [...] for his Rough Trade Records, offered the band £350,000 to sign for Blanco y Negro Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records. They duly signed.|$|E
500|$|A {{day prior}} to his {{resignation}} from Congress, The Detroit News reported that after ending his presidential campaign, McCotter took to writing a television pilot he titled, [...] "Bumper Sticker: Made On Motown". It centered on McCotter as {{the host of a}} variety show with characters based on his congressional staffers, who made fun of his presidential campaign and discussed such risqué topics as sex, race, and bodily functions. In one scene in the script, S.E. Cupp guest stars; McCotter tries to conduct a serious interview with her, but the other characters make sexually explicit comments, leading Cupp to describe the show as a [...] "train wreck." [...] A former staffer released the work to the media to show what McCotter did while in office. In response, McCotter denied any wrongdoing, saying it had been largely composed in his garage {{as a way to get}} over his failed presidential campaign. He said the script was unfinished and had not authorized it for release, but decided to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> The News. He cited comedian Martin Mull's short-lived 1977 show Fernwood 2 Night as an inspiration, and revealed that he had planned to leave Congress in 2014 and was preparing for a future career.|$|E
500|$|It {{was when}} the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament began that Dragon Ball truly became popular, having {{recalled}} the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump. Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans. Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created {{around the time of the}} Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the [...] "worst kind of people." [...] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. He added time travel next, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his second editor Yu Kondo. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.|$|E
