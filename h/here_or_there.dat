5|$|Many half-tracks, jeeps {{and trucks}} foundered in deep water; those {{that made it}} ashore soon became jammed up on the {{narrowing}} beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there,</b> the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.|$|E
25|$|Organizing slowed {{after the}} initial burst of success. By 1939, SWOC was in debt by $2.5 million. Little Steel {{continued}} to strongly resist unionization, establishing company unions and intimidating workers. SWOC made little inroad below the Mason-Dixon line, {{except for a few}} beachheads in border states which came about as part of its agreements with U.S. Steel. However, the callous treatment of workers displaced by technological change occasionally helped SWOC organize a plant <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{league is}} {{continually}} {{on the lookout}} for college-quality baseball fields for each team to permanently call home. There are plenty of fields that can host a weekend <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there,</b> but very few have enough summer schedule flexibility to accommodate a 37-game season. Most college facilities have summer camps or youth tournaments that would conflict with LCBL games. One potential solution is {{the creation of a new}} baseball-only four-field complex in St. Louis, though no plans are currently in the works.|$|E

25|$|PSB, to me, is {{not about}} {{selecting}} individual programme strands <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there,</b> financing them from some outside source and then foisting them upon commercial networks. Public Service Broadcasting, watched by a healthy number of viewers, with programmes financed in proportion to their intrinsic needs and not {{the size of the}} audience, can only effectively operate as a network — a network whose aim is to cater for the broadest possible range of interests, popular as well as less popular, a network that measures its success not only by its audience size but by the range of its schedule.|$|E
25|$|Ten years later, she {{undertook}} {{one final}} singing {{tour of the}} United States; however, {{it turned out to}} be a critical, financial and personal failure, owing to the deterioration of her voice through age and wear and tear. From then on she restricted herself to the occasional concert <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there,</b> or to private performances mounted at a little theater she had built in her impressive residence, Craig-y-Nos Castle in Wales. She last sang in public on 24 October 1914, taking part in a Red Cross concert at London's Royal Albert Hall that had been organized to aid victims of World War I. She lived long enough to see the war end, dying in 1919 of natural causes.|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there,</b> I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E

500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there.</b> Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} June 1969 Convention, the newly-made Revolutionary Youth Movement II, with Mike Klonsky at the helm, {{splintered}} off and disintegrated. [...] As {{opposed to the}} Weathermen, who were “secure in the understandings of imperialism and white supremacy,” RYM II “defined {{the existence of a}} black nation that neither the Panthers nor SNCC had asked for”. This caused frustration and disagreement among the relatively young faction, and resulted in the splintering off of members into new, even smaller factions, all of which seemed focused on their own version of Communist Party formation. “By the spring” of 1970, “except for a pocket <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there,</b> RYM was dead”.|$|E

2500|$|In another studio update {{posted on}} April 27, Barakat {{mentioned}} they had narrowed down {{the songs that}} would make the album. Gaskarth said the group needed to write more songs, which resulted in the creation of five additional songs. One of these songs was [...] "Come One, Come All", a track Gaskarth strongly disliked in retrospect. Barakat, who shared Gaskarth's view on the song, added that other songs from the same time would have served better on the record. Barakat mentioned 11 would be on the album, and that they could potentially add [...] "...another [...] <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there</b> if all goes as planned". Barakat said the band's members [...] "felt that ... we have grown as musicians," [...] with assistance from Squire and Leavitt.

2500|$|On February 11, 1970 Cavett {{hosted a}} tribute to the life and works of Sir Noël Coward, who had just been knighted in December 1969. Along with Coward, the other guests were Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, [...] and Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford (who were enjoying a {{successful}} run on Broadway in the revival of Coward's play Private Lives). In reviewing the show for The New York Times, television critic Jack Gould said [...] "The age of youth? Balder dash! The over‐70 set walked off yesterday morning with a television program that combined the engaging qualities of lightly recalled nostalgia, the sophisticated stiletto, and a demonstration of genuine affection that had more substance than adolescent wails on how love will save the world. Sir Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, friends of a lifetime, met on Dick Cavett's show on the American Broadcasting Company network. They exchanged quips, pleasantries and thoughts about the theater with the beguiling charm of talented luminaries. Mr. Cavett was clearly overawed, and for once, the ad libs frequently went over his head. It was an enchanting show…and the badinage was warm and delightful...a fun night, and to take out of context a line or <b>here</b> <b>or</b> <b>there</b> could not convey the whole. To go to bed with a chuckle provided by gifted and nice people, onstage as off, is review enough." [...] (Jack Gould, The New York Times, February 12, 1970, p.59) ...|$|E

[...] He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure [...] "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." [...] In a June {{interview with}} Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he [...] "was actually functioning at a very senior level." [...] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, [...] "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting." [...] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, [...] "I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job {{to come up with a}} way to fix them." ...|$|E
