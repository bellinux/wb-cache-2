While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize {{their ability to}} act, the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently {{and listen to the}} male filmmakers. Her only role <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> object for men to look upon. The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E

25|$|For Arthur Schopenhauer, a {{judgment}} {{is a combination}} or separation {{of two or more}} concepts. If {{a judgment}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground). Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has material truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or formal. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has transcendental truth.|$|E
25|$|The {{country was}} {{in the grip of}} the Anarchy of King Stephen's reign, so great care was taken to ensure assent from a range of {{powerful}} interested parties. The changes at St Alkmund's, a chapel royal, necessitated a charter from King Stephen, which he granted in 1145 at Bury St Edmunds. This confirmed Richard's donation of all his holdings to the canons at Donington Wood and also promised the remaining prebends as they fell vacant. The very eminent witnesses included Imar of Tusculum the Papal Legate of Lucius II; Robert de Bethune, the bishop of Hereford; Rotrou de Warwick, the bishop of Évreux; William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey and Robert of Ghent, Stephen's Chancellor. Pope Lucius died shortly afterwards and his successor, Pope Eugenius III, a Cistercian, was a friend of Bishop Alexander, the great patron of the Arrouaisians in England, whom he received twice in successive years. He ordered Roger de Clinton, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, to issue a charter confirming Richard's gift to the canons and Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, subsequently also issued a confirmatory charter, this time mentioning that the foundation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> abbey in the woods at Lilleshall.|$|E

In the colonial period, Chapultepec Castle was built here, eventually becoming the official residence of Mexican heads of state. It would remain so until 1940, when it was moved to another part of the park called Los Pinos.|$|E
2500|$|Giddens' agents follow {{previous}} psychoanalysis {{work done}} by Sigmund Freud and others. Agency, as Giddens calls it, is human action. To be human <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> agent (not all agents are human). Agency is critical to both the reproduction and the transformation of society. Another way to explain this concept is by what Giddens calls the [...] "reflexive monitoring of actions." [...] "Reflexive monitoring" [...] refers to agents' ability to monitor their actions and those actions' settings and contexts. Monitoring is an essential characteristic of agency. Agents subsequently [...] "rationalize," [...] or evaluate, the success of those efforts. All humans engage in this process, and expect the same from others. Through action, agents produce structures; through reflexive monitoring and rationalization, they transform them. To act, agents must be motivated, must be knowledgeable {{must be able to}} rationalize the action; and must reflexively monitor the action.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 October 1779, Blake {{became a}} student at the Royal Academy in Old Somerset House, near the Strand. While the terms of his study {{required}} no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as Rubens, championed by the school's first president, Joshua Reynolds. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of [...] "general truth" [...] and [...] "general beauty". Reynolds wrote in his Discourses that the [...] "disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that [...] "To Generalize <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit". Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable oil painting, Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, Michelangelo and Raphael.|$|E
