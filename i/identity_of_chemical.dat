Between 1800 and 1803, he visited Germany, France and Holland for lectures. Ørsted welcomed William Christopher Zeise to his family home in autumn 1806; taking the then young chemist (and fellow son of a pharmacist) under his care and giving him encouragement while offering him a position as his lecturing assistant. In 1812 he again visited Germany and France after publishing a manual called Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love and Første Indledning til den Almindelige Naturlære (1811). In Berlin he wrote his famous essay on the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> and electrical forces in which he first stated the connection existing between magnetism and electricity. Then, in Paris he translated that essay into Latin with Marcel de Serres.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} the results of the tests from the contamination point of view of some sour-cream types with the same fat percentage, coming from some of the production units in the Bihor county. Qualitative and quantitative calculations have been performed through the gas-chromatographic method using capillary columns and electrode with electrons capture. The values have been obtained through comparison with a complex standard diluted at 50 ppb. The tests submitted to verification consisted of fat extracts purified through methods specific to determination in extents of ppm-ppb concentrations. The object of the study consisted in the verification of the incidence and concentration of organochlorine compounds under sanitary – veterinary surveillance. After the determinations performed, we discovered, for most of the surveilled compounds, values under the approved limits, except for Endrine and Endosulphane. The monitoring process of chemical contamination of food is an essential compound of food safety [9] and, according to Codex Alimentarius [13], it supplies basic information about the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> contaminants for the selection of the priorities in what regard...|$|E
40|$|TipA is a {{transcriptional}} regulator {{found in}} diverse bacteria. It constitutes a minimal autoregulated multidrug resistance system against numerous thiopeptide antibiotics. Here we report {{the structures of}} its drug-binding domain TipAS in complexes with promothiocin A and nosiheptide, and {{a model of the}} thiostrepton complex. Drug binding induces a large transition from a partially unfolded to a globin-like structure. The structures rationalize the mechanism of promiscuous, yet specific, drug recognition: (i) a four-ring motif present in all known TipA-inducing antibiotics is recognized specifically by conserved TipAS amino acids; and (ii) the variable part of the antibiotic is accommodated within a flexible cleft that rigidifies upon drug binding. Remarkably, the identified four-ring motif is also the major interacting part of the antibiotic with the ribosome. Hence the TipA multidrug resistance mechanism is directed against the same chemical motif that inhibits protein synthesis. The observed <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> motifs responsible for antibiotic function and resistance may be a general principle and could help to better define new leads for antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chemical cues that convey {{information}} {{are widely used}} by living organisms. The cues mediate interactions in food webs as well as non-trophic interactions such as interactions between conspecific organisms or between plants and natural enemies of herbivorous organisms. Communities are composed of food webs and each food web is overlaid with a reticulate infochemical web that {{is more complex than}} the underlying food web. Chemical ecology has addressed the role of information conveyance in intraspecific and interspecific interactions and has mostly concentrated on elucidating the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> and their role in individual interactions of food webs. In addition, the role of infochemicals has been investigated in multitrophic interactions. Recently, several exciting developments have taken place. On the one hand, chemical ecologists more and more address molecular mechanisms underlying the production of infochemicals and the responses to the cues, such as signal transduction and gene expression. On the other hand, studies on the role of infochemicals in population and community ecology have been initiated. These developments are not independent of each other, and knowledge of mechanisms will provide important tools for investigating the role of infochemicals in populations and communities. This will be discussed especially in the context of insect–plant communities...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{members of}} the {{mechanistically}} diverse enolase superfamily share a bidomain structure formed from a (â/R) 7 â-barrel domain [a modified (â/R) 8 - or TIM-barrel] and a capping domain formed from N- and C-terminal segments of the polypeptide. The active sites are located at the interface between the C-terminal ends of the â-strands in the barrel domain and two flexible loops in the capping domain. Within this structure, the acid/base chemistry responsible for formation and stabilization of an enediolate intermediate derived from a carboxylate anion substrate and the processing of it to product is “hard-wired ” by functional groups at the C-terminal ends of the â-strands in the barrel domain; the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the substrate is determined {{in part by the}} <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> residues located {{at the end of the}} eighth â-strand in the barrel domain and two mobile loops in the capping domain. On the basis <b>of</b> the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the acid/base functional groups at the ends of the â-strands, the currently available structure-function relationships derived from functionally characterized members are often sufficient for “deciphering ” the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chemical</b> reaction catalyzed by sequence-divergent members discovered in genome projects.

5000|$|A {{promising}} {{strategy for}} the construction of DNA-encoded libraries is represented by the use of multifunctional building blocks covalently conjugate to an oligonucleotide serving as a “core structure” for library synthesis. In a ‘pool-and-split’ fashion a set of multifunctional scaffolds undergo orthogonal reactions with series of suitable reactive partners. Following each reaction step, the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the modification is encoded by an enzymatic addition of DNA segment to the original DNA “core structure”. The use of N-protected amino acids covalently attached to a DNA fragment allow, after a suitable deprotection step, a further amide bond formation with a series of carboxylic acids or a reductive amination with aldehydes. Similarly, diene carboxylic acids used as scaffolds for library construction at the 5’-end of amino modified oligonucleotide, could be subjected to a Diels-Alder reaction with a variety of maleimide derivatives. After completion of the desired reaction step, the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chemical</b> moiety added to the oligonucleotide is established by the annealing of a partially complementary oligonucleotide and by a subsequent Klenow fill-in DNA-polymerization, yielding a double stranded DNA fragment.

Little is known about the effects and <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> endocrinedisrupting <b>chemicals</b> (EDCs) that target thyroid hormone (TH) action, particularly at the cellular level. Frog tadpole metamorphosis depends completely on TH, which has led to the suggestion of a metamorphosis-based assay for screening potential EDCs. A major mechanism of TH action is the alteration of gene expression via hormone-bound nuclear receptors. To assess the gene expression profiles in the frog model, we designed a novel multispecies frog cDNA microarray. Recently, the preemergent herbicide acetochlor was shown to accelerate 3, 5, 3 ´-triiodothyronine (T 3) induced forelimb emergence and increase mRNA expression of thyroid hormone β receptors in ranid tadpoles. Here we show that T 3 -induced metamorphosis of Xenopus laevis, a species commonly used in the laboratory, is accelerated upon acute exposure to an environmentally relevant level of acetochlor. The morphologic changes observed are preceded by alterations in gene expression profiles detected in the tadpole tail, and the nature of these profiles suggest a novel mechanism of action for acetochlor.

40|$|A {{critical}} experimental test of {{the empirical}} unifying scheme recently proposed by Bachmann, Leers, and Lydtyn [Diamond and Related Mater. 1, 1 (1991) ] about the gas compositions useful to grow diamond films by plasma-assisted chemical-vapor deposition has been performed. The data confirm the main concept of the Bachmann scheme, namely, {{the existence of a}} single compositional" diamond domain" in a C-O-H triangular diagram, in which the overall gas compositions are plotted; however, quantitatively, the shape and the borders of such a diamond domain are rather different from those assumed in the work of Bachmann and co-workers. For all the gas mixtures investigated, the changes in the plasma optical emission spectra consequent to crossing the border from the"no-growth zone" into the"diamond domain" have been studied. These changes show universal features, which point to the presence of the same growth mechanisms over all the diamond domain, independent <b>of</b> the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the initial <b>chemical</b> species...|$|R
