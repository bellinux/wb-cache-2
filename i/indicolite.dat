25|$|<b>Indicolite</b> (blue tourmaline) and verdelite (green tourmaline) {{are found}} in the Nuristan region (Ghazi Abad district) and Pech Valley (Pech and Chapa Dara districts) of Kunar province. Gem-quality tourmalines are faceted (cut) from 0.50–10gram sizes and have high clarity and intense shades of color.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{valuable}} {{variety is}} chrome tourmaline, a rare type of dravite tourmaline from Tanzania. Chrome tourmaline {{is a rich}} green color due {{to the presence of}} chromium atoms in the crystal; chromium also produces the green color of emeralds. Of the standard elbaite colors, blue <b>indicolite</b> gems are typically the most valuable, followed by green verdelite and pink to red rubellite. There are also yellow tourmalines, sometimes known as canary tourmaline. Zambia is rich in both red and yellow tourmaline, which are relatively inexpensive in that country. Ironically the rarest variety, colorless achroite, is not appreciated and is the least expensive of the transparent tourmalines.|$|E

2500|$|Red {{and pink}} tourmalines {{have the lowest}} {{magnetic}} susceptibilities among the elbaites, while tourmalines with [...] bright yellow, green and blue colors are the most magnetic elbaites. Dravite species such as green chromium dravite and brown dravite are diamagnetic. A handheld neodymium magnet {{can be used to}} identify or separate some types of tourmaline gems from others. For example, blue <b>indicolite</b> tourmaline is the only blue gemstone of any kind that will show a drag response when a neodymium magnet is applied. Any blue tourmaline that is diamagnetic can be identified as paraiba tourmaline colored by copper in contrast to magnetic blue tourmaline colored by iron.|$|E
