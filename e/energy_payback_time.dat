5|$|The energy {{needed to}} build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life, Energy Return on Energy Invested, of wind power varies but averages about 20–25. Thus, the <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> is {{typically}} around one year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time,</b> is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

25|$|The <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> {{is defined}} as the {{recovery}} time required for generating the energy spent for manufacturing a modern photovoltaic module. In 2008 it was estimated to be from 1 to 4years depending on the module type and location. With a typical lifetime of 20 to 30 years, this means that, modern solar cells would be net energy producers, i.e. they would generate more energy over their lifetime than the energy expended in producing them. Generally, thin-film technologies—despite having comparatively low conversion efficiencies—achieve significantly shorter energy payback times than conventional systems (often < 1nbsp&year).|$|E
25|$|Driven by {{advances}} in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication, the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions. Net metering and financial incentives, such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries. The <b>Energy</b> <b>Payback</b> <b>Time</b> (EPBT), also known as energy amortization, depends on the location's annual solar insolation and temperature profile, {{as well as on}} the used type of PV-technology. For conventional crystalline silicon photovoltaics, the EPBT is higher than for thin-film technologies such as CdTe-PV or CPV-systems. Moreover, the payback time decreased in the recent years due to a number of improvements such as solar cell efficiency and more economic manufacturing processes. As of 2014, photovoltaics recoup on average the energy needed to manufacture them in 0.7 to 2 years. This results in about 95% of net-clean energy produced by a solar rooftop PV system over a 30-year life-time. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (either building-integrated photovoltaics or simply rooftop).|$|E

Developing a dissolution procedure for chalcogens will help lower the production cost of the solar cells produced by the associated nanoparticles. Dissolution was performed in both aqueous and nonaqueous solutions. Precursors for sulfur and selnium were dissolved in both the aqueous solution of ammonium thioglycolate and ammonium hydroxide and in combinations of amines and thiols. Precursors for tellurium were dissolved in ethylenediamine and different thiols. Lead telluride forms larger microparticles that can be suitable for thermoelectric devices. The optimum solutions and solvent ratios were determined by analyzing XRD, SEM, and TEM of the nanoparticles. The results from these characterizations also helped identify which nanoparticles were the right sizes for quantum dot solar cells and for thermoelectric devices. The lead sulfide nanoparticles that were synthesized were around 5 - 10 nanometers in size.

Photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power. However, prices for PV systems show strong regional variations, much more than solar cells and panels, which tend to be global commodities.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the focus}} on the {{building}} energy consumption in the use phase prevails over an interest concerning the energy impacts linked to all the other phases of the construction process. However, reducing operational energy could lead to shifting the impacts from one stage to another. Thus, combining the study of strategies improving energy efficiency in the use phase with a life cycle approach is crucial. Exhibition halls are peculiar buildings from the geometry, construction and use points of view, rarely addressed in energy and life cycle energy analysis studies. Therefore, in this paper, a representative hall of the Milan Trade Fair is taken as a case study. A building energy simulation model is firstly calibrated in order to derive the operational energy for climatisation. The operational energy appears artificially low due to the short use period during the year. When compared with the calculated embodied energy of the envelope and structure, it is found that 57 years would be needed to balance energy spent in the construction and in the use phase. Further, some retrofit interventions are proposed and analyzed. Insulation interventions are not attractive from the economic <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> point of view. However, when the embodied energy of the retrofit interventions is compared with the energy savings in the use phase, interesting <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>times</b> are obtained. Therefore, this study puts in evidence on the importance of adopting a life cycle perspective, especially for buildings with low-intensity use. Eventually, the critical issues of the life cycle energy analysis are deeply discussed...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{benefits}} of a photovoltaic system to a homeowner or tenant are easy to predict {{in terms of a}} reduction in electricity bills. There is an additional indirect benefit of the PV system in that it can change people’s attitude towards energy usage and conservation. This paper reports on a study of the direct and indirect {{benefits of}} PV applied to nine low energy Eco-homes in Hampshire, UK. The three bedroom houses incorporate a range of energy features including photovoltaics, solar thermal, passive solar design, high insulation construction, energy efficient appliances and grey water recycling. In addition to detailed monitoring of the PV system in each house the environmental parameters and the electricity import and export is also recorded. The diverse range of tenant type (age, social background, family size) has resulted in a broad spectrum of energy requirements despite the relatively small size of the development. The selection of green electricity tariffs by some tenants; which credit the tenant for every unit of electricity generated; were seen to raise energy awareness, resulting in a further reduction in electricity demand. In the case of some of the high energy consumption tenants, the PV system raised energy awareness to such a level that energy savings in excess of that generated by the PV system itself could be realised. In these cases, the financial and <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>times</b> for the PV systems are, in reality, half the traditionally calculated figure. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{increased}} public environmental awareness {{coupled with the}} introduction of governmental incentives, has resulted in a remarkably rapid growth in rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations at a residential level in Australia. Despite the widely perceived economic and environmental benefits of rooftop PV, the economic and environmental performance of rooftop PV under Australian conditions are yet to be thoroughly examined. Whilst prior studies on the subject of rooftop PV are extensively overseas based, the conditions under which they are performed differ immensely from the Australian conditions. Consequently, this paper focuses on evaluating the life cycle economic and environmental merit of rooftop PV in Australia. By making use of component-wise costs and embedded emissions associated with each component of the rooftop PV generation system, the life cycle cost and emission models have been developed. For this to occur, the Australian costs and, energy and emission intensities have been used. All the life cycle factors relating to the manufacturing, purchasing, installation and operation of rooftop PV are considered. A sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to electricity price, feed-in tariff, battery price, battery lifetime and emission intensities. The results of the cost and emissions analyses are collectively used to estimate the cost of emissions mitigation through the use of rooftop PV for current and potential future scenarios in Australia. The cost <b>payback</b> and the <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>times</b> are found to range between 11 to more than 25 years and 1. 75 to 14 years, respectively. The study also reveals that local load profile can {{have a significant impact on}} <b>payback</b> <b>times.</b> For example, the cost payback without battery storage is found to be the least for Tasmania which hosts the least favourable solar insolation conditions and lowest feed-in tariff amongst the Australian states however possesses a high daily load and electricity price.

The purpose of this thesis work is to further evaluate and develop this LED array characterization technique focusing on contact methods and signal interpretation. Two modes were examined; a contact mode and a capacitive contact-less mode. Both modes gave comparable results and indicated strong variations in performance of sub cells in the measured modules. Other methods to address individual cells also showed similar behavior. However, by manually adding extra contact points, current-voltage curves could be measured on the individual sub cells in the modules. Extraction of photocurrents were similar, but the parallel resistances varied strongly between the cells in the module. Increasing the frequency of the LEDs resulted in less variations. Calculations indicated that this frequency dependence could be used to separate the photocurrent generation and parallel resistance in the sub cells...|$|R

Over the next 15 years (2015 – 2030) with anticipated rapid social and economic development in Myanmar, the demand for electricity is expected to increase from 23718 GWh in 2015 to 136605 GWh in 2030, which is nearly a six-fold increase. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the critical role of hydropower in the Myanmar electricity sector in meeting projected demand in 2030. As a result this thesis presents a detailed analysis of electricity generation in Myanmar using chiefly two methods: Energy Return on Investment (EROI) and Carbon Emissions Pinch Analysis (CEPA). The contributions of this thesis to literature and Myanmar include: (1) the development of a low energy investment, low emissions roadmap towards achieving electricity demand in 2030 for Myanmar; (2) the identification of 20 storage-type hydropower stations that with excellent EROI values and low <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>times,</b> which help form the foundation of the future development roadmap; and (3), the determination of dam-type-specific empirical correlations for EROI by inputting the estimated electricity output (based on head, water flow, overall efficiency and capacity factor) and dam volume.

40|$|Thin-film {{solar cells}} on glass {{substrates}} {{are likely to}} have a bright future due to the potentially low costs and the short <b>energy</b> <b>payback</b> <b>times.</b> Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si, grain size > 1 pm) has the advantage of being non-toxic, abundant, and long-term stable. Glass as a substrate, however, limits the processing temperatures to ~ 600 °C for longer process steps. Films with large grain size can be achieved by solid phase crystallisation (SPC), and especially by solid phase epitaxy (SPE) on seed layers, using amorphous silicon deposited at low temperatures as a precursor film. With SPC and SPE, the amorphous silicon film is typically crystallised at ~ 600 °C over hours. During this anneal at atmospheric pressure -depending on the properties of the amorphous silicon film- ambient gas can percolate the film and can negatively affect the crystallisation. In this work, a high-vacuum anneal chamber was designed and built to allow the in-situ crystallisation of amorphous silicon films deposited on glass in a PECVD cluster tool. An important aspect of the design was the comfortable and safe operation of the vacuum anneal chamber to enable unattended operation. This was realised by means of a state-of-the-art, programmable temperature controller and a control circuit design that incorporates various safety interlocks. The chamber interior was optimised such that a temperature uniformity of 2 - 3 K across the sample area was achieved. The chamber was calibrated and tested, and SPC and SPE samples were successfully crystallised. In initial SPC crystallisation experiments with solar cell structures, after post-deposition treatments, a 1 -sun open-circuit voltage of 465 mV was obtained, similar to furnace-annealed samples. In initial experiments with SPE solar cell structures, difficulties regarding the characterisation of the unmetallised solar cells with the quasi-steady-state open-circuit voltage method (QSSVOC) were encountered after post-deposition hydrogen treatment. A possible explanation for these difficulties is the contact formation with the metal probes. Furthermore, limiting factors of the QSSVOC method for the characterisation of unmetallised cells with high contact resistance values were investigated and, additionally, the accuracyof the QSSVOC setup was improved in the low light intensity range...|$|R
