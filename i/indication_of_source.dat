We examine the level of noise in the observations as a possible <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> confusion at subarcminute scales. We also derive an upper limit on microwave anisotropy caused by the sources responsible for the Far-Infrared Background radiation detected in FIRAS data. Our upper limit on point source confusion of ∆T/T = 10 − 5 for a 10 ′ beam at 100 GHz would cause severe foreground contamination for CMB anisotropy observations, although the actual contamination level is probably much lower. This upper limit constrains the long-feared possibility of an undetected population of sources with emission peaking near 100 GHz. Source detections closer to 100 GHz are needed to improve our knowledge of galaxy evolution at high redshift and to predict the level of point source confusion.

On the one hand, it activates mechanisms of habituation and refractoriness, which {{are reflected in the}} decrease of response amplitude of evoked responses. On the other hand, the constant sequencing acts as spectral cueing, resulting in tones being detected faster and more accurately. With the present study, by means of magnetoencephalography, we investigated the impact of repeated tone stimulation on the N 1 m auditory evoked fields, while listeners were distracted from the test sounds. We stimulated subjects with trains of either four {{tones of the}} same frequency, or with trains of randomly assigned frequencies. The trains were presented either in a silent or in a noisy background. In silence, the patterns of source strength decline originating from repeated stimulation suggested both, refractoriness as well as habituation as underlying mechanisms.

40|$|High order {{harmonic}} generation (HOHG) from intense laser- solid density interactions {{has emerged as}} a promising route to the generation of attosecond pulses extending to keV energies. With efficiency of the nth harmonic order, jn, scaling as ~ n- 2. 5 -n- 3 in the relativistic limit up to a maximum harmonic order nmax ~ 8 1 / 2 i 3 (where i is the maximum relativistic Lorentz factor of the oscillating plasma surface), the potential for a bright solution to attosecond science is a distinct possibility. Here we present the first demonstration of nmax ¶ i 3 cut off scaling for both 500 fs pulses and, excitingly, ultra short pulses (< 50 fs), giving clear indication that bright soft x-ray pulses can be generated using even modestly sized ‘table-top ’ generation lasers. The angular distribution of the HOHG signal is also investigated.

In the TRIPs Agreement, GI is Intellectual Property Rights (hereafter IPR) regime that is typical of sui generis due to its distinctive features. It is reflected in the elements that are in the definition of GI. Basically, GI has set the use of Geographical names to recognise an object. Previously, the IPR regime had also set them, namely: <b>Indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>Source</b> (IS) and Apellation of Origin (AO), that were set in the Paris Convention in 1883, Madrid Agreement in 1891, and the Lisbon Agreement in 1958.

First, the elements that become the characteristics of GI so that it is typical of sui generis. Second, the similiarities and the differences amongst GI and IS, AO and other trademarks. The findings of the study reveal that GI is typical of sui generis, reflected in the elements that are in the GI definition as it has already been agreed upon in the TRIPs Agreement. There are similiarities amongst GI and AS, AO and other trademarks, namely they can use the geographical names as a label on objects. Meanwhile, the differences are in the elements themselves.

40|$|We discuss {{various aspects}} of {{centimeter}} and millimeter wavelength continuum and line observations of high redshift star forming galaxies. Perhaps {{the most important lesson}} is that sensitive observations at submm through cm wavelengths reveal a population of active star forming galaxies at high redshift which are unseen in deep optical surveys due to dust obscuration. Current models suggest that this population represents the formation of the spheroidal components of galaxies at z between 2 and 5, constituting about half of the total amount of cosmic star formation from the big bang to the present. High resolution imaging at cm wavelengths provides sub-arcsecond astrometry, and can be used to search for gravitational lensing and/or for the presence of an AGN. Radio continuum observations provide unique information on the magnetic fields in early galaxies, and give a gross indication of the star formation rate, while the radio-to-submm spectral index provides a rough <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> redshift. Low J transitions of CO are redshifted into the cm bands for z > 2, allowing for sensitive searches for CO emission over large volumes at high redshift.

40|$|Trademarks and {{certification}} marks increasingly denote sustainability or social responsibility standards. These marks of rectitude are particularly noticeable {{in the context}} of global trade, where market integration is accompanied by relatively uneven integration of environmental, labor and other standards, and where consumers in the so-called global North choose how to empower producers and/or encourage development of markets in the global South. But consumer participation in these transactions is under-explored by reference to criteria such as the quality not to mention accountability and transparency of the standards embedded within the goods or services. Newer stakeholders and meaning-makers such as the largely invisible third party certifier determine whether a product conforms to a standard, which in turn is embodied in a mark. Marks of rectitude {{can be viewed as a}} type of decentralized regulation in response to a felt need for heightened social norms. Trademark law potentially can function to mediate between extremely different local conditions within a global market system, to signal not source of manufacturing origin (as in classic trademark law), or geographic origin (as signified by certification marks to provide geographic indication protection in the U.

40|$|The Reactivity Initiated Accident Scoping Test (RIA-ST) was {{successfully}} completed August 30, 1978. The test was introductory to the RIA Series 1 tests and {{was designed to}} investigate and resolve several anticipated problem areas prior to performance of the first test of the series, Test RIA 1 - 1. The RIA Scoping Test, as performed, consisted of four separate single-rod experiment phases. The first three phases were performed with shrouded fuel rods of 5. 8 wt. % enrichment. They were subjected to power bursts resulting in total fuel surface energies ranging from 205 to 261 cal/q at the axial peak elevation. The fourth phase consisted of a 20 wt. % enriched, shrouded fuel rod which was subjected to a power hurst that deposited a total radially averaged energy of 527 cal/g. The primary objectives of the Scoping Test were defined as follows: (1) Determine the applicability of extrapolating low-power steady state calorimetric measurements and self-powered neutron detector (SPND) output to determine fuel rod energy depositions during a power burst. (2) Determine the enerqy deposition failure threshold for unirradiated fuel rods at BWR hot-startup coolant conditions. (3) Determine the magnitudes of oossible pressure pulses resulting from rod failure. (4) Determine {{the sensitivity of the}} test instrumentation to high transient radiation exposures. In general, the energy deposition values for the Scoping Test derived from the SPND output were 25 % higher than those obtained from the core ion chamber data. Determining which values are correct will require radiochemical analysis of the fuel rods which will take several months. At present, it apoears that the SPND derived energies are in error because of excellent agreement between the calculated and measured power calibration results and the agreement between the predicted failure threshold and that seen using the core ion chamber derived energies. Meeting the second objective was accomplished during the first three test phases by subjecting the fuel rods to energy depositions which bracketed the failure threshold. The failure threshold in terms of total pellet surface energy at the axial flux peak was found to be between 218 cal/g where no rod failure occurred and 256 cal/g where · rod failure did occur. The experiment predictions indicated that the failure threshold would be 262 cal/g at the pellet surface. Only the fourth experiment phase (527 cal/g) resulted in a pressure pulse upon rod failure. The best <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> pressure was the reading from a 69 MPa EG&G pressure transducer at the flow shroud inlet. This pressure transducer indicated a pressure pulse upon rod failure of 28. 2 MPa with a rise time of 1. 6 ms. The source pressure was attenuated considerably outside the shroud region as indicated by pressure transducers in the upper plenum of the in-pile tube and in the flow bypass region. The maximum pressure indicated outside the flow shroud was 2. 1 MPa. In general, instrumentation sensitivity to radiation was minimal. The most significant instrumentation problem during the power bursts was a false flowrate indication by the flow turbines. This problem is being examined. The Kaman and Bell & Howell pressure transducers showed the least sensitivity to radiation of the pressure measurement devices. The EG&G transducers were most sensitive. The locked linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) gave no indication of radiation sensitivity as its response during the burst was a straight line. The strain gages were very sensitive to radiation, indicating a strain increase of 70 % with the second burst of RIA-ST- 1. The Type S thermocouple did not exhibit significant radiation sensitivity. In addition, the RIA Scoping Test has provided data on the consequences of fuel rod failure during a RIA event at BWR hot startup conditions. Posttest examination of the fuel rods from the first two phases of the test revealed large quantities of UO{sub 2 } fuel missing from the cladding. Fuel rod failures for energy depositions near the failure threshold in previous closed capsule tests without forced coolant flow resulted in only a slight amount of fuel loss...|$|E
