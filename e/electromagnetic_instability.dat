40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical linear stability {{analysis of}} a cylindrical Taylor-Couette flow of liquid metal carrying axial electric current in a generally helical external magnetic field. Axially symmetric disturbances are considered in the inductionless approximation corresponding to zero magnetic Prandtl number. Axial symmetry allows us to reveal an entirely new <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability.</b> First, we show that the electric current passing through the liquid can extend the range of helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) indefinitely by transforming it into a purely <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability.</b> Two different <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> mechanisms are identified. The first is an internal pinch-type instability, {{which is due to}} the interaction of the electric current with its own magnetic field. Axisymmetric mode of this instability requires a free-space component of the azimuthal magnetic field. When the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is purely rotational and the axial component is nonzero, a new kind of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> emerges. The latter driven by the interaction of electric current with a weak collinear magnetic field in a quiescent fluid gives rise to a steady meridional circulation coupled with azimuthal rotation.

40|$|Previous {{calculations}} of electrostatic and electromagnetic growth rates for plasma instabilities have neglected the thermal {{spread of the}} distribution function of the planetary ions. We consider the effects of finite temperatures for exospheric ions borne in the solar wind. Specifically, growth rates are calculated for <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the low-frequency case for Alfven waves and the intermediate frequency case for whistlers. Also, electrostatic growth rates are calculated for the intermediate frequency regime. From these growth rates, estimates are derived for the pickup times of the planetary ions. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> are shown to produce the most rapid pickup. In the situation where the angle between the local Venus magnetic field and the plasma flow direction is small, the pickup times for both <b>electromagnetic</b> and electrostatic <b>instabilities</b> become very long. A possible consequence of this effect is to produce regions of enhanced planetary ion density in favorable Venus magnetic field-solar wind flow geometries...|$|R

40|$|Place two {{conducting}} rings, one {{of slightly}} smaller diameter than the other, coaxially in a plane. Spin the inner ring (relativistically) rapidly. If {{it is somewhat}} resistive, while the outer ring is a good conductor, a nontrivially radiating, exponentially growing, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> will set in at a finite rotation velocity, despite the time-invariance of the background system. This table-top configuration models a plausible <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> of a rotating black hole {{in the presence of}} an accretion disk made from the last remnants of a swallowed neutron star. Such a situation would extract pure electromagnetic energy from the hole, building up a stored energy on the order of the gravitational binding energy of the disk material before explosively disassembling. In the resulting electromagnetic explosion, most lines of sight to infinity are uncontaminated by baryons, and thus capable of initiating the ultra-relativistic fireball needed to power gamma-ray bursts.

40|$|Abstract: The {{electrostatic}} and electromagnetic {{low frequency}} waves propagating in azimuthal direction in a Hall thruster channel {{are found to}} be unstable due to the resistive coupling to the electrons ’ closed drift in the presence of collisions. The thermal motion of the electrons and their collisions significantly affect the growth of these waves. With respect to the collision frequency, wave number, electron temperature and plasma density, both the instabilities grow in a similar fashion but they behave oppositely under the effects of magnetic field and electron drift velocity. In both the cases, smaller wavelength oscillations {{are found to be}} most unstable, and magnitude of the growth rate of the electrostatic wave supersedes that of the electromagnetic wave. The electrostatic instability is more sensitive to the electron collisions in comparison with the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability.</b> On the other hand, the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> is suppressed in the presence of larger ion drift velocity...|$|E

Theoretical and exper-imental studies during the past year have indicated that two types of instability may explain our observations.

When the plasma has initially an anisotropic electron distribution, this <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> develops {{from the beginning of}} the expansion. Then it contributes to suppress the anisotropy and eventually saturates. After the saturation, the strength of the magnetic field decreases because of the plasma expansion until it becomes too weak to maintain the distribution isotropic. For this time, the anisotropy rises as electrons give progressively their longitudinal energy to ions, so that a new instability can develop...|$|E

Electromagnetic waves are excited slowly in a field null region after saturation of the lower hybrid drift waves excited in an early time {{on both sides of the}} neutral sheet. This instability is found to be a new instability, independent of the lower hybrid drift instability. Examination of its characteristic properties indicates that the new instability is highly related to the meandering motions of ions in the neutral sheet. The growth of the instability gives rise to anomalous resistivity in the neutral sheet current. ...|$|E

40|$|Auroral kilometric {{radiation}} (AKR) is a high-density {{radio wave}} radiation {{in the frequency}} band from 50 to 750 kHz, with a peak around 250 kHz, that has been observed emanating from the auroral zone.

40|$|AbstractThe back {{reaction}} {{field and}} the self-consistent dynamics of a radiating dipole atom situated near a plane boundary between two isotropic media with different values of complex dielectric constants is studied. It is shown that spontaneous emission of an excited atom is suppressed, and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>instability</b> of the ground state is possible, if an atom {{is located in the}} vicinity of an active medium which amplifies the propagating radiation. The effect is due to the modified and phase-shifted near field of an oscillating atomic dipole, which prevails over the usual radiation reaction field related to the wave zone. The role of the nonradiative energy transfer from the medium to an atom is emphasized. The necessary conditions for the reversal of the total electromagnetic back reaction are found, and possible experimental realizations of the predicted phenomena are discussed.
