5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving into}} politics, {{he worked for}} the Insurance Company of North America from 1948 to 1955. Starting in 1955, he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live well <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> interest from his savings.|$|E

25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted not <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution {{that had already been}} well underway for some time.|$|E

25|$|Some critics {{allege that}} British haste led to {{increased}} cruelties during the Partition. Because independence was declared {{prior to the}} actual Partition, {{it was up to}} the new governments of India and Pakistan to keep public order. No large population movements were contemplated; the plan called for safeguards for minorities {{on both sides of the}} new border. It was a task at which both states failed. There was a complete breakdown of law and order; many died in riots, massacre, or <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hardships of their flight to safety. What ensued was one of the largest population movements in recorded history. According to Richard Symonds, at the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve million became homeless.|$|E
25|$|The Bauhaus at Weimar, Germany {{was founded}} in 1919 by Walter Gropius. The {{philosophy}} underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from {{the ideas of the}} Arts and Crafts movement in England and the Deutscher Werkbund. Among the teachers were Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, Anni Albers, and László Moholy-Nagy. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the Nazi party gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of degenerate art, 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of avant-garde art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.|$|E
25|$|D. sylvestris is {{generally}} not considered a pest {{despite the fact that}} it is widespread in many regions and lives in urban areas nesting in areas such as the ground, in hedges, or hanging from eaves of houses. This is mostly due to the fact that this species of wasp does not like to enter buildings and is not interested in the types of food that are consumed by humans. It normally is not a problem around humans unless it builds a nest where people do not want it or where there is risk of children encountering the nest. The tree wasp is not very aggressive compared to other species of wasps, but can sting if it feels its nest is threatened. On the other hand, many of the reported pest problems for wasps in Scotland have been found to be D. sylvestris suggesting that many people do consider it a pest. Whether this was <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> presence of the nest or aggression of the wasps is unknown.|$|E

500|$|... }} Emission lines usually {{indicate}} that a star is surrounded by gas.

The geometry and kinematics of this gaseous circumstellar environment are therefore best explained by a [...] "Keplerian" [...] diskone that is supported against gravity by rotation rather than gas or radiation pressure. Circumstellar disks like this are sometimes referred to as [...] "decretion disks", which is material being actively ejected by the star as opposed to [...] "accretion disks" [...] which involves material falling toward the star.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{components}} for Little Boy left San Francisco on the cruiser [...] on 16 July and arrived on Tinian on 26 July. Four days later the ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine. The remaining components, which included six uranium-235 rings, were delivered by three C-54 Skymasters of the 509th Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron. Two Fat Man assemblies travelled to Tinian in specially modified 509th Composite Group B-29s. The first plutonium core went in a special C-54. A joint targeting committee of the Manhattan District and USAAF was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets, and recommended Kokura, Hiroshima, Niigata, and Kyoto. At this point, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing {{that he would be}} making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto on the grounds of its historical and religious significance. Groves therefore asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well. One of Kyoto's substitutes was Nagasaki.|$|E
500|$|Groves {{met with}} the Chief of United States Army Air Forces, General Henry H. Arnold, in March 1944 to discuss the {{delivery}} of the finished bombs to their targets. Groves was hoping that the Boeing B-29 Superfortress {{would be able to}} carry the finished bombs. The 509th Composite Group was duly activated on 17 December 1944 at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, under the command of Colonel Paul W. Tibbets. A joint Manhattan District – USAAF targeting committee was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets; it recommended Kokura, Hiroshima, Niigata and Kyoto. At this point, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing that he would be making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto. Groves attempted to get him to change his mind several times and Stimson refused every time. [...] Kyoto had been the capital of Japan for centuries, and was of great cultural and religious significance. [...] In the end, Groves asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well. Nagasaki was substituted for Kyoto as a target.|$|E

Although she read them in her native British accent despite the character being written as American as {{she is in the}} novel, Frankel was interested; Finerman liked her for her sense of humor. After the makers of Eragon cast Sienna Guillory, Frankel called her in the bathroom of [...] "some dive club" [...] in London, where she was consoling herself with her sister. He told her that while he would have cast her <b>just</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tape, the studio wanted to see another audition with her dressed more in character. She insisted on continuing to play the character as British; Both Hathaway and Emily Blunt lost weight for their roles, with Hathaway later recounting that [...] " [...] and I would clutch at each other and cry because we were so hungry." [...] Blunt later denied rumors she did this at the filmmakers' request.|$|E
