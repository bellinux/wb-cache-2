30|$|When {{the amount}} of water that is {{required}} to replenish water lost through ET deviate below normal, the rangeland WRSI will decline. As a result, the vegetation cover, the size of rangeland, and net removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere might be reduced (Wise et al. 2009). A higher carbon stock was stored in the soils than in the aboveground vegetation (Bikila et al. 2016), indicating the importance of vegetation cover in preventing the release of carbon dioxide that could have great influence on climate variability and change. Therefore, any below normal rangeland WRSI distribution to rangeland ecosystem will have a significant implication in decreasing net carbon dioxide capture and vegetation degradation that will eventually interfere with the reduction in feed supply to livestock. Moreover, increasing temperature is thought to increase ET, which reduces water availability to rangelands. Ayalew et al. (2012) concluded that a slight increase in average surface temperature increased the likelihood of extreme weather. Similar findings were observed in this paper. According to IPCC (2007) report, an increasing surface temperature by about 0.2 – 0.3  °C over the last 25  years result in reduction of rainfall and a lot of plant species from the earth. Hence, mean annual rainfall variability and increasing temperatures will have impacts on {{the quality and quantity of}} pastures (Thornton et al. 2009) also reduce the <b>grazing</b> <b>capacities</b> of most rangelands (Shine and Dunford 2016), which is a critical constraints on livestock performance in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWorldwide, local {{anthropogenic}} extinctions {{have recently}} been reported to induce trophic cascades, defined as perturbations of top consumers that propagate along food chains down to primary producers. This focus {{on the effects of}} top-consumer extinction (i. e. of species presence) ignores potential cascading effects of the rapid morphological changes that may precede extinction. Here, we show in an experimental, three-level food chain including medaka fish, herbivorous zooplankton and unicellular algae that varying body length of a single fish from large (36. 3 mm) to small (11. 5 mm) induced a stronger trophic cascade than varying an average-sized (23. 8 mm) fish from being present to absent. The strength of fish predation on zooplankton scaled quasi linearly (not with a power exponent) with fish body length and associated gape width, suggesting that the resultant trophic cascade was morphology (not metabolism) -dependent. The effect of fish body length was stronger on phyto-than on zooplankton, because large-sized fish had the unique ability to suppress large-sized herbivores, which in turn had high <b>grazing</b> <b>capacities.</b> Hence, our results show that consumer body size, by setting diet breadth, can both drive and magnify the strength of trophic cascades. In contrast, fish body shape had no significant effect on fish predatory performances when its allometric component (the effect of size on shape) was removed. In the wild, human-induced body downsizing of top consumers is widespread, and mitigating the resultant perturbations to ecosystem function and services will require a paradigm shift from preserving species presence towards preserving species size structure...|$|R

Therefore, we suggested using our findings as an early warning planning to minimize potential livestock feed insecurity, and the severity of drought condition. Accordingly, conservation of rangelands, use of appropriate <b>grazing</b> management, <b>capacity</b> building on rangeland management systems, and enhancing rangeland productivity through enclosure management should be practiced to reduce atmospheric CO 2 and sustain rangeland productivity under the changing climate in the eastern part of Ethiopia.|$|R

One of the factors affecting the richness and diversity is animals' utilization of the vegetation. Therefore, this research was done to study the plant richness and diversity response to different treatments of animals. To this end, four sites with none, half, equal and twice as much <b>grazing</b> <b>capacity</b> were selected. Treatments were identified due to vegetation cover changes, distance from water, distance from the village and grazing times.

Firstly, to survey and analyse {{the condition of the}} natural resource. base in the Hewu district with particular reference to water, soil, vegetation and land use. Secondly, to investigate the relationship between scientific approaches to assessing land use degradation and to compare these to the results obtained using a participatory approach of the rural environment of the Hewu district of the Eastern Cape. Random quadrats (4 m 2) were sampled and corresponding line transects were done with increasing distances from the villages. The Braun-Blanquet method was used to find the cover and abundance of the various species of plants. Data obtained from point sampling along 100 metre line transects was used to assess the condition of the veld using Trollope's technique. Six communities were defined using TWINSP AN, and <b>grazing</b> <b>capacities</b> and veld condition scores of the respective sites were calculated. It was concluded that the six communities were distributed along a gradient of palatable to non palatable grass and grasslike species. Rangelands close to the villages had low veld condition scores and percentage plant cover as opposed to those farther away from the villages. The null hypothesis of {{no significant difference between the}} percentage plant cover and condition of the veld close to the villages and farther away from the villages was rejected. Whilst it is urgent to resolve political disputes around land through land distribution, a key issue for the future is sustainability of the natural resource base of South Africa. To attain this, the old traditional methods of research must be supplemented with the participatory method, where the local community becomes fully involved. The central theme of the participatory approach was to investigate the possibility of promoting local management of the natural resources. Workshops were conducted to involve the local community in the project. The community formed six discussion groups that met regularly to discuss environmental issues. The six groups that were formed were: Firewood or woodlot collectors, shepherds / livestock raisers, crop fanners / agriculturists, water collectors, building material / soil collectors and medicinal plant users. The results obtained from the meeting of the discussion groups were used to compare the scientific results obtained from Braun-Blanquet method. Perceptions about their environment, which came out of the results of the discussion groups showed that the local knowledge of the rural community of Mceula was sufficient to train them to manage their environment sustainably. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out within the project ImGoats, a project led by ILRI and {{implemented}} by CARE in Mozambique, aiming at increasing the incomes and food security of poor smallholders through innovations in the meat goat value chain. From a bottom-up approach, the project developed different interventions and this thesis was focusing on one of them, the implementation of communal grazing land for goats, land that was not currently in use. From a literature review, it was defined that communal grazing lands were prone to land degradation and even more if goat was an actor, mainly due to its feeding behaviour. Furthermore, sociologists and economists explained this resource degradation by involving the communities of livestock smallholders and their ways of managing the grazing land. From this outlook, the main research question was defined as “What are the future perspectives of the newly designated communal grazing areas for goats in the ImGoats project communities?”. Perspectives that had two views: a more technical one {{that focused on the}} inventory of the pastures’ natural resources and the calculation of their different grazing capacities; and a more social part that implied interviews of the communities on their ideas about the future management of these pastures. For the field work, 6 communities and therefore 6 different pastures were visited. Concerning the pastures’ characteristics, it was found that there were differences among the different grazing land, especially in their sizes as it was going from 265 to more than 5. 000 ha. The average grazing land was a savannah woodland, composed of a vegetation of grasses with a shrub/tree coverage of 35 %. The average primary grass production was of 1. 400 kg DM. ha- 1. It were wide differences for the <b>grazing</b> <b>capacities</b> of the whole pastures, from less than 400 goats to 23. 600 animals. From the interviews, two different themes were defined: the natural resources management (NRM) and issues on labour. From the NRM part, the topics that were developed were: the grazing pattern, the animal keeping system, the grazing dynamics, the mix cattle/goats, the burning practices, the water sources and the implementation of a maximum number of goats on the pastures. Concerning the labour, three different management types were found: the first system was described as a maximal intervention of producers, the second as the intervention of producers and paid labour and the third one as the minimal intervention of producers. From the obtained results, perspectives could be drawn on the future of these different pastures. Part of the perspectives were the main constraints that could hamper the success of the pastures’ implementation. These limits were identified as the herd mobility, the water and labour availability. It was therefore recommended that these three topics should be further discussed with the communities and that from the data collected for this thesis individual pasture management plans could be developed for the project communities. Recommendations concerning topics to be discussed with the communities were favoured over giving direct use rules that should be blindly followed. The pastures’ organisational charts should come from communities’ brainstorming with the help of experts, as one of the ImGoats project’s core principle was to adopt a bottom-up approach...|$|R

Herbaceous monitoring: This monitoring system provides information on the economic and ecological <b>grazing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the individual vegetation communities in terms of Grazing Units. The herbivore monitoring provides an estimation of the actual Grazing Units occurring in a vegetation community. The total stocking rate should be less than the economic <b>grazing</b> <b>capacity</b> (70 % of the ecological <b>grazing</b> <b>capacity).</b> Woody monitoring: This monitoring system provides information on the economic and ecological browsing capacity of the individual vegetation communities in terms of Browser Units. The herbivore monitoring provides an estimation of the stocking rate of browsers occurring in a vegetation community, which should be less than the economic <b>grazing</b> <b>capacity</b> (70 % of the cological <b>grazing</b> <b>capacity).</b> The combination of all the results from the three survey methods provided information on the stocking rates for the different types of herbivores, which will ensure optimal wildlife production without diminishing the condition of the vegetation on the reserve. Long-term monitoring will enable the establishment of a large database which can be used to assess the ecological dynamics of the components covered in the holistic monitoring system over time. Changes in habitat selection of the large herbivore can be observed and patterns can be determined in relation to environmental variables such as rainfall. The long-term monitoring of the vegetations layers will provide information on changes in the plant species composition and the structure of the vegetation communities. This information can then be compared to the habitat selection of the large herbivore species and other environmental influence to gain information to help in the determining the cause of any observed changes.

40|$|Grassland {{ecosystem}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} ecosystems, which naturally occurs on all continents excluding Antarctica and provides both ecological and economic functions. The deterioration of natural grassland has been attracting many grassland researchers to monitor the grassland condition and dynamics for decades. Remote sensing techniques, which are advanced in dealing with the scale constraints of ecological research and provide temporal information, become a powerful approach of grassland ecosystem monitoring. So far, grassland health monitoring studies have mostly focused on different areas, for example, productivity evaluation, classification, vegetation dynamics, livestock carrying <b>capacity,</b> <b>grazing</b> intensity, natural disaster detecting, fire, climate change, coverage assessment and soil erosion. However, the grassland ecosystem is a complex system which is formed by soil, vegetation, wildlife and atmosphere. Thus, it is time to consider the grassland ecosystem as an entity synthetically and establish an integrated grassland health monitoring system to combine different aspects of the complex grassland ecosystem. In this review, current grassland health monitoring methods, including rangeland health assessment, ecosystem health assessment and grassland monitoring by remote sensing from different aspects, are discussed along with the future directions of grassland health assessment...|$|R
40|$|Rangelands which {{consist of}} grasslands, shrublands and savannahs {{are used by}} {{wildlife}} for habitat and are {{the main source of}} forage for livestock. The assessment and monitoring of rangeland condition {{is one of the most}} important factors for rangeland scientists in order to calculate the carrying capacity of livestock with consideration for coexisting wildlife. This study assessed the potential of Landsat 8 multispectral bands and broadband vegetation indices to model woody vegetation parameters such as tree equivalents (TE) and total leaf mass (LMASS) for the Thanda Private Game Reserve using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The PLSR model predicted TE with an R 2 value of 0. 76 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1411  TE/ha using an independent test dataset. LMASS was predicted with an R 2 value of 0. 67 and a RMSE of 853  kg/ha on an independent test dataset. The predictive models were then inverted to map TE and LMASS over the study area. The modelled TE and LMASS layers were integrated with conventional <b>grazing</b> and browse <b>capacity</b> models to map carrying capacity for the Game Reserve. The study indicates the potential of Landsat 8 multispectral data in carrying capacity modelling. The result is significant for rangeland monitoring in Southern Africa using remote sensing technologies...|$|R
40|$|Data-limitations {{increase}} {{the uncertainty of}} quantitative ecosystem models and {{have the potential to}} slow the progress of Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management. However, the most important finding of perturbation analysis for managers is arguably simple trends in community abundance. Qualitative models can be used to predict trends following perturbation and require only the signs (+, -, 0) of interactions between variables. To further {{increase the}} utility of qualitative models in ecosystem analysis, complementary alternative models, with differing uncertainties and assumptions can be used to assess the robustness of conclusions. Qualitative models and an Ecopath with Ecosim model were produced to investigate the inshore reef ecosystem of eastern Tasmania, Australia. The impact of fisheries, competition between fish species, and increasing urchin abundance on ecosystem dynamics were investigated. Qualitative models highlighted the need to decrease fisheries catches, the potential for cascading effects due to urchin <b>grazing,</b> and the <b>capacity</b> for large rock lobster to allow the regeneration of foliose algae. Ecopath with Ecosim produced consistent conclusions for the majority of qualitative predictions. Inconsistent conclusions were discussed with regard to differences in model calculation and behavior. The process undertaken in this study may allow progress in ecosystem analyses in data-poor situations, which may aid {{the development and implementation of}} Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management...|$|R
