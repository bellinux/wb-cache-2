40|$|Abstract — A formal {{methodology}} {{for the analysis}} of a closed loop clock distribution and active <b>deskewing</b> network is proposed. In this paper an active clock distribution and <b>deskewing</b> network is modeled as a closed loop feedback system using state space equations. State space analysis allows systematic analysis of any clock distribution and <b>deskewing</b> systems to determine various conditions under which a system can over-compensate and become potentially unstable. Such an analysis can be very useful to designers as {{they will be able to}} determine analytically as to how the clock <b>deskewing</b> system behaves. By using the proposed approach, repeated simulations can be greatly limited and maybe entirely avoided. We applied the proposed method to an experimental clock <b>deskewing</b> system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed approach can be further extended to determine performance of such systems under different configurations. I...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of signal <b>deskewing</b> systems in standard CMOS technologies. The objective of this work is to understand the limitations of <b>deskewing</b> systems as they are applied to modern systems and present new architectures to overcome past limitations. Traditional methods for signal <b>deskewing</b> are explored and the general limitations of these methods are identified. Several new architectures are proposed to address the limitations of previous techniques. The systems will be investigated with regard to minimum resolution, programming time, delay, maximum data rate, full scale range, and duty cycle distortion. Several other effects that are critical to the operation of <b>deskewing</b> systems will also be investigated. These effects include overshoot caused by parasitic package inductance, the impact of capacitive terminations, {{and the effect of}} mutual inductance between traces. To fulfill the requirements of this study, two <b>deskewing</b> systems are implemented in a 0. 25 um process. An open-loop system for <b>deskewing</b> wide data busses and a closed-loop system for <b>deskewing</b> a differential pair of lines are both fabricated. Both systems are found to meet the expected performance metrics, providing validation of the proposed techniques. Use of the proposed architectures allows the limitations of previous methods to be overcome. The remaining work is validated through either analytical techniques, simulations, or both where appropriate. Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an injection-locked clock (ILC) distribution {{system with a}} new active <b>deskew</b> mechanism based on the built-in phase tuning of injection-locked oscillators (ILO). The proposed technique removes the required <b>deskew</b> delay lines and associated power dissipation, clock latency and jitter accumulation in conventional active <b>deskew</b> schemes.

40|$|As the CMOS {{technology}} {{continues to}} scale {{into the deep}} sub-micron regime, the demand for higher frequencies {{and higher levels of}} integration poses a significant challenge for the clock generation and distribution design of microprocessors. Hence, skew optimization schemes are necessary to limit clock inaccuracies to {{a small fraction of the}} clock period. In this thesis, a crude deskew buffer (CDB) is designed to facilitate an adaptive <b>deskewing</b> scheme that reduces the clock skew in an ASIC clock network under manufacturing process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. The crude deskew buffer adopts a DLL structure and functions on a 1 GHz nominal clock frequency with an operating frequency range of 800 MHz to 1. 2 GHz. An approximate 91. 6 ps phase resolution is achieved for all simulation conditions including various process corners and temperature variation. When the crude deskew buffer is applied to seven ASIC clock networks with each under various PVT variations, a maximum of 67. 1 % reduction in absolute maximum clock skew has been achieved. Furthermore, the maximum phase difference between all the clock signals in the seven networks have been reduced from 957. 1 ps to 311. 9 ps, a reduction of 67. 4 %. Overall, the CDB serves two important purposes in the proposed <b>deskewing</b> methodology: reducing the absolute maximum clock skew and synchronizes all the clock signals to a certain limit for the fine <b>deskewing</b> scheme. By generating various clock phases, the CDB can also be potentially useful in high speed debugging and testing where the clock duty cycle can be adjusted accordingly. Various positive and negative duty cycle values can be generated based on the phase resolution and the number of clock phases being “hot swapped”. For a 500 ps duty cycle, the following values can be achieved for both the positive and negative duty cycle: 224 ps, 316 ps, 408 ps, 592 ps, 684 ps, and 776 ps...|$|E
