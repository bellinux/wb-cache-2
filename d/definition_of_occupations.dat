30|$|To {{consider}} how immigration and wages {{have changed in}} each occupation one needs a consistent <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> over time. One challenge is that the British Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) changed from SOC 1990 to SOC 2000 {{at the turn of}} the century. The aim of this change was to better measures the tasks done in each occupation, but it created a discontinuity for the study of changes across occupations in the last few decades. We deal with this discontinuity by transforming, or converting, the old SOC 1990 classification into the new SOC 2000 classification — that is by creating a consistent <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> throughout our dataset. Details of the methodology used are set out in the Appendix 1.|$|E

The number of people working in an occupation and their characteristics (age,sex, qualifications, and so on) can changeover time. Such changes can be monitored using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. However,changes in the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> when the SOC is revised can raise issues of comparability. This article uses datafrom the Labour Force Survey to examine changes in the care workforce from the late 1990 s to 2005. The care workforceis defined in the article using the SOC.

40|$|Background 2 ̆ 6 Rationale: The concept <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> {{is defined}} in the {{occupational}} science and occupational therapy literature in many different definitions which appear {{to be based on}} different worldviews. Some <b>definitions</b> suggest categories <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> (formism), others describe doing or performing occupations (organicism) and still others describe the context or environmental conditions for doing occupation (contextualism). Finally, some definitions combine two or three different worldviews. Statement of Intent: The purpose is to use the technique of concept analyze to explore the themes within the <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> based on the worldview or worldviews attributable in the definitions, to compare the results to <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> found in dictionaries over the last three centuries and synthesize similarities and differences (Walker 2 ̆ 6 Avant, 2005; Pepper, 1942). Argument: Occupation is the central organizing concept for occupational science and occupational therapy. Many definitions exist in the literature. The focus of this presentation is to analyze the common themes in relationship to worldviews and philosophical constructs and examine the congruity to dictionary definitions. Conclusions: Worldviews included in the definitions include formism, organicism and contextualism. Twenty-eight concepts were identified from dictionaries published from 1897 to present. OS and OT <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> contained 68 concepts. Only six concepts overlapped between the two groups <b>of</b> <b>definitions</b> Importance to OS: Clarity of concepts is considered important in theory construction. At present the concept <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as stated in OS and OT literature fails to communicate a clearly articulated concept although the elements can be identified. In addition, <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> in standard English dictionaries do not convey the essence <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as a concept in the OS and OT literature. Professional communication is a responsibility of a discipline and should be considered in future publication...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a case-control study in 12 European study centers {{to evaluate the}} role of occupational risk factors among nonsmokers. We obtained detailed occupational histories from 650 nonsmoking cases (509 females/ 141 males) and 1, 542 nonsmoking controls (1, 011 females/ 531 males). On {{the basis of an}} a priori <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> and industries that are known (list A) or suspected (list B) to be associated with lung carcinogenesis, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for these occupations, using unconditional logistic regression models and adjusting for sex, age, and center effects. Among nonsmoking men, an excess relative risk was observed among those who had worked in list-A occupations [OR = 1. 52; 95 % confidence interval (C) = 0. 78 - 2. 97] but not in list-B occupations (OR = 1. 05; 95 %), CI = 0. 60 - 1. 83). Among nonsmoking women, there was an elevation of risk for list-A occupations (OR = 1. 50; 95 % CI = 0. 49 - 4. 53), although this estimate was imprecise, given that less than 1 % of cases and controls were exposed. Exposure to list-B occupations was associated with an increase in relative risk (OR = 1. 69; 95 % CI = 1. 09 - 2. 63) in females, but not in males. Women who had been laundry workers or dry cleaners had an OR of 1. 83 (95 % CI = 0. 98 - 3. 40). Our findings confirm that certain occupational exposures are associated with an increased risk for lung cancer among both female and male nonsmokers; however, knowledge on occupational lung carcinogens is biased toward agents to which mainly men are exposed...|$|E
30|$|The first {{outcomes}} that we consider are occupational upgrading and downgrading. Our data has a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> {{that can be}} easily organized (as we illustrate in the next section) into four “tiers” with a clear ranking. These tiers, in fact, are associated with different levels of wage, education, use of cognitive and complex skills. Ranking those tiers with respect to any of those variables would provide the same ordering. Namely, from the lowest to the highest tier, we grouped occupations into “Elementary”, “Clerical and Craft”, “Technical and Associates” and “Managers and Professionals”. Occupational upgrading is coded with a dummy equal to 1 if an individual changes occupation moving from a lower to a higher tier between t and t+r and is equal to 0 otherwise. For this outcome we only selected those individuals who can actually perform upgrade, i.e excluding those who already are at the top tier at time t. Occupational downgrading is coded with a dummy equal to 1 if an individual changes occupation moving from a higher to a lower tier between t and t+r and is equal to 0 otherwise. Those who are at the bottom tier at time t are excluded from this sample. The second type of outcome that we consider is the transition of individual i into non-employment. This is a dummy equal to 1 if the individual exits employment (either joining the group of unemployed or quitting the labor force) between t and t+r and 0 if his/her employment status remains unchanged. The third outcome is geographical mobility of native workers, computed as a dummy equal to 1 if the individual changes location within the country between t and t+r and 0 otherwise. The fourth outcome is the change in logarithmic wage and salary earnings for individual i between t and t+r. Finally, focusing on the probability of upgrading to higher-tier occupations in a two-year interval, we also test whether the transition probabilities are affected by national institutions and policies. In particular we divide countries into groups with relatively high and low level of public social expenditures, between countries with low and high employment protection legislation (EPL) and between countries with high and low product market regulation (PMR). These indices capture the intensity of the protective social net in a country, which can affect the willingness of an individual to take risks in changing occupation. They capture the degree of sluggishness of the labor markets, that may affect speed and probability of occupational transitions. They finally measure the degree of overall competition on the goods market, that may affect market structure and the bargaining power of employers and hence the possibility of workers to participate to profit sharing, which may also be affected by immigration if capital is complement to immigrant workers. Before moving to results, we provide some additional details on the identification strategy adopted in the next section.|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{science is}} of {{importance}} to multiple disciplines due to its potential to contribute to understandings of complex social issues. “Occupation”, as a key concept of occupational science, is recognised as being highly complex, making it challenging for students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the concept.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the article, the author {{presents}} the modern <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as defined in the ISCO- 88 standard, and consecutively in the Slovenian Standard Classification <b>of</b> Occupations; <b>occupations</b> in the field of library and information science are then placed in a wider frame <b>of</b> information <b>occupations</b> which are present in ali spheres of activities.

40|$|Key words: Definition, Globalization, Collaboration Background: Many <b>definitions</b> and {{constructs}} <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> {{have been}} conceptualized by advocators of Occupational Therapy, {{and with the}} inception of Occupational Science these discussions have continued to advance. While, some <b>of</b> the <b>definitions</b> and their implications have been contested by other scholars in the field {{it is important to}} acknowledge the differences and biases that have been witnessed. Many have debated on aspects such as activity vs. occupation, individualism vs. transactionalism, or hierarchy of occupational engagement. Such debates have helped to acknowledge the importance of an agreed upon definition or a construct. Rationale and argument: Defining a construct provides basis for identifying epistemology, knowledge production, and facilitating inter-disciplinary collaboration. Collaborative research, conceptualized as advancement of scientific inquiry through a process of working with other professionals, can promote globalization of knowledge. Also, collaborative or interdisciplinary research potentially involves innovative methodologies which require epistemological and/or philosophical harmony between the constructs or phenomena being studied. A clear understanding of the construct and/or <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> might require lesser compromise from the occupational science researchers. Having an agreed-upon construct will give occupational scientists and occupational therapy practitioners a tool to work with, a framework to work under and a construct to research upon. All these aspects are integral for both professional and educational progress. Experimentation, emphasizing causal relationships or generalizations, is one of the primary aspects of science. While carving our identity as occupational scientists {{it is important to note}} that science becomes a major responsibility. Therefore, this paper argues that having an agreed upon conceptual construct and/or a definition can further scientific research and facilitate globalization of occupational science. Statement of Intent and Implications for Occupational Science: Having different <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> and related debates have contributed to knowledge growth; however this leads to confusion when viewing it from larger (global and inter-disciplinary) perspectives. Occupational science, as a field of inquiry, can benefit from having an agreed upon definition and/or a conceptual construct. Especially for globalization, inter-disciplinary collaboration can be as beneficial as intra-disciplinary debates. This paper suggests forming an agreed upon construct including concepts which are widely accepted in the field with further research advancing the construct. Strategies such as survey research and card sorting can be used to formally form a construct under the guidance of experts from the field...|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} the paper is to compare and {{contrast}} the meaning <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> during the past century by using selected criteria from the literature to examine the five original conditions {{that contributed to the}} development of occupational therapy literature with the five most common conditions seen today. The purpose is to explore whether significant changes have occurred in the selected criteria in relation to the meaning and application of the core ideas about occupation. The five original conditions reported in the literature from 1900 - 1917 were tuberculosis, mental illness and retardation, cripples (orthopedic and cardiac), war injured, and immigrants. The five most common conditions appearing in current occupational therapy literature (2000 - 2007) in all categories of professional literature are stroke, brain injury, cerebral palsy, dementia, and schizophrenia. Argument Occupation is a dynamic concept that has multiple meanings to persons that may change over time within a given social system, political climate, and evolving technology. If the concept is dynamic, the application may be dynamic as well. Question one: To what extent have the original meanings <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> been maintained through the years? Question two: If changes have occurred, are the changes significant (lost, added, reformulated) to theory and application in occupational science and therapy? Methodology included describing the conditions and contexts, summarizing the problems persons faced in daily life, dictionary <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> both positive and negative, and solutions (strategies, media and methods) adopted within occupational therapy practice. The context, problems, <b>definitions,</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> and solutions were then compared to present situations as identified in the literature. Conclusions: Changes can be documented in the conditions, contexts, problems, definitions, meanings, and solutions between the time period associated with the developmental years of the profession and the current time period. These changes will be reported. The significance of the changes to the meaning <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> effect on occupational science, and application to occupational therapy practice will be put to audience for discussion.

The Questions from the Hat address such broad concepts as the meaning of science and social science, the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> the limits or boundaries of occupational science, the potential structure of an OS community, the relations of models to theories, useful methodologies, occupational form and performance, occupatio-temporality, proto-occupations, systems and taxonomies <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> and important gaps in our understanding <b>of</b> <b>occupation.</b> In this forum, we will use The Questions from the Hat as a time capsule to reflect on how our thinking has changed within the discipline of occupational science.

40|$|Key words: metacognition, meta-emotion, {{feeling about}} feeling while doing with meaning Intent: The {{purpose of this}} paper is to pose a series of {{question}} for participants to consider: (1) What is the concept <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> (adapted from metacognition) and (2) How may the concept be useful for contributing to the theoretical foundations of occupational science? Argument: In 2001 Royeen, Duncan, and McCormack, published a short <b>definition</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation.</b> This was approximately at the same time a poster presentation on the concept (Royeen and Duncan, 2001) was presented. And, a short summary of it was presented for a major lecture (Royeen, 2003). Meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> as presented in these pieces will be summarized for this presentation. Doing with meaning is but one operational <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> in the published literature (Royeen, 2002). Meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> constitutes feeling about feeling while doing with meaning. Meta-emotion has been seen in the literature from 1996 through 2014 (Norman 2 ̆ 6 Furnes, 2014), mostly pertaining to family systems. Metacognition, from which meta-emotion is adapted, refers to thinking about thinking in a global sense, but not necessarily linked to thinking about thinking while doing at any level. In fact, due to the complex interplay of cognition and emotion, it is truly impossible to separate them. Thus, meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is not just feeling about feeling while doing with meaning, but may also intertwine with cognition. That is to say, meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is a holistic concept, related to the psychobiology of man as expressed by Meyer (1982). Emotion and reflection upon emotions are not just feelings based but also includes some degree of cognition. However, the concept <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is distinctly different from metacognition for two reasons: metacognition excludes the emotional subsystems and does not relate thinking to occupational engagement. Importance to occupational science: The essential concept <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is an innovative conceptualization to bring to occupational science. There is an emerging knowledge in occupational science, but the field has not adequately or sufficiently linked occupational science to the field of emotional systems of the human brain. It is speculated that meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is one dimension or the process that underpins the restorative, pleasurable and productive qualities (or perceptions thereof) of occupational engagement. Further, it is speculated that almost any aspect of occupational engagement and its unique meaning for that instance, is directly related to the valence (positive or negative feelings) brought forth by reflection on participation in occupation. Conclusion: This theoretical presentation will explore the realm <b>of</b> participating in <b>occupation</b> and the feelings about feelings (meta-emotion) manifest during engagement in occupation. Questions to facilitate discussion importance to mission of SSO: USA: Given understanding <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as a concept, how and why is might it important for occupational science?

40|$|Intent: The {{intent of}} this {{presentation}} {{is to continue}} the dialogue {{in the field of}} occupational science regarding the use of photographs in the study <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> and occupational implications. Photographs can be regarded as arts personifying the photographer-artist or as records displaying reality, but meaning-making is a dynamic interaction between the photographer, viewer, and the photograph whereby meaning is actively constructed and not passively received (Schwartz, 1989). Photographs could be used as an adjunct for other methods of data collection, such as interviews, surveys, or questionnaires as a resource for eliciting more information through language, which in turn serve as data to be analyzed and reported or could be used as data in their own right (Harrison, 2002). Based on a review of three research methods that use photographs, namely Photoelicitation Interview, Photovoice, and Layered analysis of photographic content in addition to author’s preliminary experience, use of photographs in studying mundane occupations, studying the properties <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> in their own right, and addressing occupational injustice will be discussed. Argument: Noting the struggle in the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> Fox (2015) suggested scholarship to understand the fundamental properties <b>of</b> <b>occupation.</b> Hocking (2009) called for the study <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> in their own right. With their ability to stimulate deeper discussions about taken-for- granted daily occupations, photographs are especially valuable in the study of various properties <b>of</b> daily <b>occupations</b> and explore meanings associated with their implications. (Hartman, Mandich, Magalhães, 2 ̆ 6 Orchard, 2011). The concept of occupational injustice, which originated in occupational science and accepted as a domain of occupational therapists is closely associated with social injustice and Photovoice method, which positions itself as the apt method to address social injustice can be used effectively to address occupational injustice. Importance to occupational science: Occupational science concerns itself with the study <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> and addressing issues resulting from the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupations.</b> Photographs can be a valuable tool in research of occupational science concepts. Conclusion: Analysis of three visual research methods that use photographs and the nature <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> provides insights regarding the usefulness of photographs in understanding the properties <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> that are mundane and uniquely meaningful to the individual, to address occupational injustice, and to understand occupations in their own right.

By the establishment of MBR in 1967 we got {{a unique opportunity to}} study birth outcomes related to occupational exposure during a long time period and within groups. It is a virtue that MBR has registered information on all births, however, a disadvantage is that information on early spontaneous abortions and waiting time to pregnancy are missing. MBR data were linked to occupational data from other sources in published epidemiological studies related to occupation. Such sources are occupational cohorts, lists from labour unions and public registries as agricultural and horticultural censuses and population censuses.

40|$|If {{occupation}} {{is indeed}} some “chunk” or {{other form of}} activity that is meaningful to individuals and society (Yerxa et al., 1989), then action must be a central part <b>of</b> understanding <b>occupation.</b> We believe {{it is fair to}} suggest that the edifice of occupational science is unstable until an adequate foundation of action theory is constructed. That is the challenge we seek to take up in this paper ˜the beginning of a rigorous development of that foundation of occupational science thought and thereby an essential part of occupational science’s continuing development. Because action theory is a diffuse area of knowledge crossing many centuries and disciplines, our coverage is by necessity selective. We utilize works by philosophers and social theorists primarily, and focus more on the work of John Dewey and Pierre Bourdieu than others. This bias is based on the compatible and complementary nature of the two theorists‚ work and the realization that their combined action theories provide a metatheoretical basis for usefully understanding and investigating occupation. Our focus also allows us to build on recent attempts to re-theorize occupation from a less individual-based orientation (Dickie, Cutchin, 2 ̆ 6 Humphry, 2006) and extend and deepen that understanding with additional theoretical material. We begin the analysis with a summary assessment of occupational science’s position on action and related concepts. In that section, we suggest where weakness in occupational science exists vis-à-vis action and why those weaknesses need addressing now. From there, we begin the discussion on action theory. We structure our analysis into three phases, each focusing on a different key element of action theory: habit, context, and creativity. We conclude the argument with an example <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> viewed through action theory, and we aim to explain in summary form what potential these particular action theories hold for occupational science. In the end a new <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is offered: occupation is a type of relational action through which habit, context, and creativity are coordinated toward a provisional yet particular meaningful outcome; the type <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is defined by the particular combination of habit, context, creativity, and provisional outcome...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this note}} is to {{describe}} preliminary results on assessment of land use by cattle, obtained in a pilot study using Geographic Information System (GIS). The research was carried out on a semi-natural pasture in Sweden, where the geographic positions of one cow were recorded during 25 consecutive days during summer. The cow, wearing a GPS collar, was integrated in a herd of 53 Hereford cattle. Each location point registered for the animal was considered as a sampling unit (N= 3, 097). The spatial distribution of ground declivity, water sources, cattle tracks, and classes of woody vegetation cover (forest, grassland with trees and open grassland) were recorded. The storage, processing and data analysis were carried out using the Idrisi and GS+ softwares. Three occupation zones were identified in function {{of the variation in}} the space used by the animal, which were occupied in a cyclical pattern; with the animal moving from one zone to another in cycles of five days.

Furthermore, expanding the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>occupations</b> to include “technical and trades” together with managers and professionals (not reported here) produces treatment effects that are highly significant and of comparable magnitudes to the effects reported for employment rates. This sensitivity to the inclusion of technical and trades occupations is to be expected given the statistics reported in Table  1.

The kitchen is a familiar space in occupational therapy and forms a key environment for meeting nutritional and social needs in the domestic setting.

The paper first refines the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> white-collar <b>occupations</b> at-risk to offshoring. Applying this definition to the national job base shows that close to 15 million people, or 11. 7 % of the em-ployed labor force, are in white-collar occupations at-risk to offshoring. While {{not all of these}} jobs will be offshored, the number of jobs is of similar order of magnitude to the manufacturing sector, and the proportions offshored could be similar as well. For metropolitan areas, the analysis shows that places with high shares of the labor force employed in at-risk white-collar occupations tend to have larger populations, a more highly educated workforce, and higher earn-ings. Despite these advantages, between 2001 and 2003 these places had slower employment growth, in both at-risk occupations and overall, and to some extent lower wage growth than places with fewer at-risk jobs. A more detailed look at the San Jose metropolitan area—Silicon Valley—shows that the occupatio...|$|R

The argument develops a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> guilt from George Bataille’s Le Coupable (1944) and proposes {{a reading of the}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>Occupation</b> guilt through the trope of narrative confession. The three narratives examined, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Le Corbeau (1943), Henri Razcymow’s Un cri sans voix (1985) and Philippe Grimbert’s Un secret (2004), differently explore the confession <b>of</b> <b>Occupation</b> guilt and span the 70 -year period of cultural production.

40|$|Dynamic Mapping of the UK’s Creative Industries, by Hasan Bakhshi, Peter Higgs and Alan Freeman of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation (CCI), {{adopts a}} <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> {{creative}} <b>occupation</b> as ones with “a role within {{the creative process}} that brings cognitive skills to bear to bring about differentiation to yield either novel, or significantly enhanced products whose final form is not fully specified in advance”. •This paper argues that, despite its strengths, the UK Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) classification of the creative industries contains inconsistencies which {{need to be addressed}} to make it fully fit for purpose. It presents an improved methodology which retains the strengths of the DCMS’s approach while addressing its deficiencies. The authors focus on creative intensity: the proportion of total employment within an industry that is engaged in creative occupations. This analysis brings to light inconsistencies that undermine the strengths <b>of</b> the DCMS <b>definition</b> as a de facto world standard, and will detract from the understanding which it has brought {{to the study of the}} creative economy, above all under conditions of structural economic change, such as digitisation. Using the list <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> which DCMS treats as ‘creative’, the intensity of the industries it defines as creative falls within a narrow range – with only minor exceptions – that is on average over 25 times greater than in the rest of the economy. This is a defining characteristic of such industries. However, DCMS’s choice of industries excludes important codes with high creative intensity that account for large amounts of employment. In addition, DCMS’s choice <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> is itself open to question, because the criteria by which they are classified as ‘creative’ are not clear. The authors propose a rigorous method for determining which occupations are creative, scoring all occupations against a ‘grid’ of five theoretically grounded criteria. The grid score <b>of</b> those <b>occupations</b> that DCMS considers as creative also lies in a range significantly above the grid scores <b>of</b> other, non-creative <b>occupations.</b> However, as with its choice of industries, DCMS’s choice <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> excludes codes that account for significant employment and which, on the strength of a rigorous classification, should be included. It also includes a small minority of codes which should be excluded. The authors then propose a fully consistent classification by using these occupations to identify, on grounds of creative intensity, those industries that appear inappropriately included and excluded in the DCMS industrial classification (our ‘baseline’). They conduct a sensitivity analysis to show that this classification lays the basis for a robust and consistent selection of industry codes. This accords with the reality, which should be squarely faced, that uncertainty is a defining feature of emergent areas subject to persistent structural change like the creative industries, and should be dealt with in a systematic way...|$|R

40|$|Medisinsk fødselsregister (MFR) har både helseforskning og helseforvaltning som formål. Ved etableringen av MFR i 1967 fikk vi i Norge en unik mulighet til å studere fødselsutfall knyttet til yrket, over lang tid og i spesielt eksponerte grupper. Det er en styrke at MFR inneholder informasjon om alle fødte, men en ulempe at blant annet opplysninger om spontanaborter og ventetid til graviditet mangler. Tidligere yrkesepidemiologiske studier har vært gjennomført ved å koble MFR-data til yrkesdata fra andre kilder som yrkeskohorter, fagforeningslister, og offentlige {{registre}} som Landbrukstellinger og Folke- og boligtellinger. Vi har gitt en oversikt over studier med fokus på definisjon av yrke- og yrkeseksponering. Vi avslutter med å se på utfordringer ved fremtidige yrkesepidemiologiske studier, muligheter for å øke kvalitet og validitet, samt å peke på fremtidsmuligheter som ligger i yrkesepidemiologi ved bruk av MFR. Vi fokuserer spesielt på kilder der yrkes- og yrkeseksponerings-data kan finnes, men også på studier der opplysninger om genetikk kobles mot arbeidsmiljø, samt studier med opplysninger fra bestemødrenes arbeidsmiljø. Til tross for problemer knyttet til slike studier, har vi i Norge gode muligheter til å gjennomføre dem siden norske overvåkningssystemer er i stadig utvikling og bioteknologisk kunnskap internasjonalt er økende. Dette i tillegg til et utstrakt samarbeid mellom de nordiske land, kan være veien å gå. The {{aims of the}} Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBR) are {{research as}} well as health management. By the establishment of MBR in 1967 we got {{a unique opportunity to}} study birth outcomes related to occupational exposure during a long time period and within groups. It is a virtue that MBR has registered information on all births, however, a disadvantage is that information on early spontaneous abortions and waiting time to pregnancy are missing. MBR data were linked to occupational data from other sources in published epidemiological studies related to occupation. Such sources are occupational cohorts, lists from labour unions and public registries as agricultural and horticultural censuses and population censuses. The former studies are reviewed, focusing on the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> and occupational exposure. We discuss challenges in future occupational epidemiological studies and point out some future challenges and ways to improve quality and validity. We have further emphasised on potentials in occupational epidemiology using MBR, as well as on sources where occupation and occupational exposures can be found, geneworking environment interaction studies and studies where we allow for grandmothers’ working environment as well. In spite of problems attached, in Norway we have the possibilities to carry out such studies due to expansion of Norwegian systems of surveillance, and since the knowledge in biotechnology internationally is growing.

40|$|An Investigation of Parent and Infant Occupational Performance in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit The {{earliest}} {{of occupational}} therapy interventions often commence in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where {{mothers and fathers}} begin learning how to parent in unexpected surroundings and with unexpected complications. Worry about the infant’s health, the unfamiliar setting, technology, medicine, and constant monitoring can interrupt normal family functioning and bonding. It is within this hyper-technical and complex environment that occupational therapists have the unique opportunity to harness the power <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> and to support parents’ engagement in their infant’s care {{in order to achieve}} positive family outcomes (Altimier 2 ̆ 6 Phillips, 2013). Family life in the NICU exists; however, it may look and feel very different from parents’ expectations and dreams. Recognition of the existence of NICU-based family life is fueling recommendations for a shift in neonatal occupational therapy practice. Although {{there will always be a}} need for specialized medical care and technology, occupational therapy has the opportunity to introduce and support family occupations in the NICU. In an effort to bridge the gap between the infant’s medical fragility and emerging family life, neonatal occupational therapists look beyond the infant’s person factors to address interrupted family engagement and participation, which in turn may affect family health and well-being. This shift in thinking about infants as occupational beings and active participants in their environment coincides with the profession’s transformation back to a “discipline focused on occupation” (Polatajko, 1994, p. 591). However, a limitation of occupation-based practice may be the lack of clarity surrounding what infant and family occupations exist in NICU. Without clear <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> these constructs, occupational therapists may not recognize or value them as part of practice. While recommendations for neonatal occupational therapists’ skill level, knowledge base, and practice have been established (AOTA, 2006), there is paucity of literature describing parent and infant occupations in the NICU. Thus, the innovative purpose of this presentation is twofold: to both inform and transform neonatal occupational therapy practice. First, in an effort to inform, a qualitative research project was undertaken to provide occupational therapists, multidisciplinary NICU professionals, family members, and other stakeholders with rich <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> parent <b>occupations,</b> infant occupations, and parent-infant co-occupations experienced in the NICU. Using a phenomenological approach, examples <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> and themes emerged from inductive analysis of parent interviews conducted in a Level III NICU. Second, in order to transform practice and encourage a shift from a biomedical, sensory, or purely environmental view of the NICU infant toward one that assesses the infant and family in concert, this project employed a strong occupational focus and outlined the process guiding occupational therapist and client interaction in the NICU. The interactional process was framed using the Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) Model (Baum, Christiansen, 2 ̆ 6 Bass, 2015) and the Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) Occupational Therapy Process (Bass, Baum, 2 ̆ 6 Christiansen, 2015) as theoretical foundations for neonatal practice. keywords: neonatal, infant, occupatio...|$|R
