50|$|A <b>delustrant</b> is a {{substance}} that reduces the lustre (sheen) of synthetic fibres. The most common <b>delustrant</b> is anatase titanium dioxide.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic fibres such as nylon are {{normally}} extremely shiny and transparent when extruded. Adding powdered titanium dioxide causes {{the surface of}} the fibres to be rougher, reducing the sheen, at the same time, being opaque, it reduces the transparency of the fibre. To be effective as a <b>delustrant,</b> titanium dioxide must be powdered 0.1-1.0 µm, {{depending on the size of}} the fibre, and varying amounts (up to about 2%) can be used depending on the level of lustre required.|$|E
40|$|Fibres were {{transferred}} to the bare arms of living subjects and their persistence determined at intervals up to 24  h, during which normal daily activity was undertaken. Decay curves showed an initial rapid loss followed by an apparently exponential decay. No target fibres were found to remain after 24  h. The length distribution showed a shift towards shorter fibre lengths and the differential shedding results for a polyester/cotton mixture showed a small bias towards the retention of cotton. The population of coloured fibres on bare skin was classified according to perceived colour, length, generic class and {{the presence or absence}} of <b>delustrant...</b>|$|E
3000|$|White Pigments Chalk (White Lime), White {{lead and}} Zinc White. Chalk {{is one of}} the forms of calcium {{carbonate}} (CaCO 3). It has been extensively used in paintings. Chalk is found with limestone deposits and has been used as pigment from very early times. In India, conch shell white was favoured by artists and is believed to have special properties. White lead (PbCO 3) is a complex salt containing both carbonate and hydroxide. It was formerly used as an ingredient in lead paint. It occurs in nature as the mineral Cerussite. However, normally white lead is prepared artificially. Zinc white (ZnO) (Safeda in Hindi) is another important pigment used in painting. Archaeological evidence dates back to the use of zinc white as pigments in India before it was introduced in Europe. Other white pigments are Talc, Barium White and Titanium White. Titanium White is titanium dioxide (TiO 2), used in textiles as <b>delustrants.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{additives}} and contaminants which {{occur in}} textile fibers vary widely, {{depending on the}} type of fiber and the pretreatment which it has received. Synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester contain trace amounts of contaminants such as catalysts and catalyst deactivators which remain after the synthesis of the basic polymers. In addition, there are frequently a number of materials which are added to perform specific functions in almost all man-made fibers. Examples of these would include traces of metals or metal salts used as tracers for identification of specific lots of fiber, TiO 2 or similar materials added as <b>delustrants,</b> and a host of organic species added for such special purposes as antistatic agents or flame retardants. There may also be considerable quantities of residual monomer or small oligomers dissolved in the polymer matrix. The situation becomes even more complex after the fibers are converted into fabric form. Numerous materials are applied at various stages of fabric preparation to act as lubricants, sizing agents, antistats, bleaches, and wetting agents to facilitate the processing, but these are normally removed before the fabric reaches the cutters of the ultimate consumers and therefore usually do not constitute potential hazards. However, there are many other chemical agents which are frequently added during the later stages of fabric preparation and which are not designed to be removed. Aside from dyes and printing pigments, the most common additive for apparel fabrics is a durable press treatment. This generally involves the use of materials capable of crosslinking cellulosics by reacting through such functions as N-methylolated amides or related compounds such as ureas and carbamates. These materials pose some potential hazards due to both the nitrogenous bases and the formaldehyde which they usually release. There is usually also some residual catalyst in fabrics which have received such treatments. Other types of chemical treatments which are often applied to fabrics to achieve special effects include flame retardants, soil release agents, antistatic agents, softeners, water and/or oil repellents, ultraviolet absorbers, bacteriostats, and fungistats...|$|R

40|$|Textile Technology: The sun-blocking {{properties}} of a textile are enhanced when a dye, pigment, <b>delustrant,</b> or ultraviolet absorber finish is present that absorbs ultraviolet radiation and blocks its transmission through a fabric to the skin. For this reason, dyed fabrics provide better sun protection than bleached fabrics. Since naturally-colored cottons contain pigments that produce shades ranging from light green to tan and brown, it seemed reasonable to postulate {{that they would}} provide better sun protection than conventional bleached cotton, and that natural pigments might prove more durable to laundering and light exposure than dyes, {{but there is no}} published research on the ultraviolet transmission values for naturally-pigmented cottons. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the ultraviolet protection (UPF) values of naturally-pigmented cotton in three shades (green, tan, and brown), and the effect of light exposure and laundering on the sun-blocking {{properties of}} naturally-pigmented cotton. Naturally-pigmented cotton specimens were exposed to xenon light and accelerated laundering, ultraviolet transmission values measured, and UPF values calculated following light exposure and laundering. The naturally-pigmented cottons exhibited significantly higher UPF values than conventional cotton (bleached or unbleached). Although xenon light exposure and laundering caused some fading, the UPF values of naturally-pigmented cotton continue to be sufficiently high so that all three shades continue to provide good sun protection after the equivalent of 5 home launderings and 80 American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists fading units (AFUs) of xenon light exposure...|$|E
