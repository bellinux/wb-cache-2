The homozygous rad 18 - 2 /rad 18 - 2 strain was highly sensitive to killing by UV light, showed greatly elevated frequencies of spontaneous and induced mitotic recombination and was {{more sensitive to}} trimethoprim than the wild-type diploid.

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} shown {{that most of the}} genome is {{transcribed}} and that transcription frequently occurs concurrently on both DNA strands. In diploid genomes, the expression level of each allele conditions the degree to which sequence polymorphisms affect the phenotype. It is thus essential to quantify expression in an allele- and strand-specific manner. Using a custom-designed tiling array and a new computational approach, we piloted measuring allele- and strand-specific expression in yeast. Confident quantitative estimates of allele-specific expression were obtained for about half of the coding and non-coding transcripts of a heterozygous yeast strain, of which 371 transcripts (13 %) showed significant allelic differential expression greater than 1. 5 -fold. The data revealed complex allelic differential expression on opposite strands. Furthermore, combining allele-specific expression with linkage mapping enabled identifying allelic variants that act in cis and in trans to regulate allelic expression in the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain.</b> Our results provide the first high-resolution analysis of differential expression on all four strands of an eukaryotic genome...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 43 - 50). Candida albicans is a pathogenic yeast {{that causes}} mucosal and systemic infections. C. albicans pathogenicity {{is attributed to}} its ability to exist in different morphological states and to respond to stress by up regulating several genes. Many genes involved in stress response have been partially characterized. DDR 48 is a stress associated gene involved in DNA repair {{and in response to}} antifungal drug exposure. The aim of the present study is to investigate any possible role of DDR 48 in vitro filamentation and in vivo virulence in a mouse systemic infection model by generating a homozygous null mutant strain. Furthermore, this study attempts to assess the antifungal drug susceptibilities of the mutant strain against azoles, amphotericin B, and caspofungin drugs in vitro. It was observed that DDR 48 was haploid insufficient and essential, SInce only a heterozygote, but not a homozygous null mutant was generated. On corn meal agar, the heterozygote strain caused a delay of chlamydospore and hyphae formation with respect to the parental BWP 17 strain. However, the heterozygote DDR 48 /ddr 48 strain, unlike the parental strain, was non filamentous on potato dextrose agar plus 50 % fetal bovine serum, and on 50 % fetal bovine serum medium. Furthermore, the heterozygote mutant showed additional defects in filamentation formation on Lee's medium, and on M 199 pH 7. 5 as BWP 17 formed an extensive network of filaments whereby the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> exhibited defective filamentation formation. When cultured in fetal bovine serum, the heterozygote strain formed short aberrant germ tubes within 12 hours whereas the parental strain formed an extensive hyphal network within 6 hours. In vivo, the mice survival rate was 66 % after 33 days of post infection with the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain,</b> as opposed to rapid death within 10 days with the parental strain. DDR 48 /ddr 48 was also susceptible dose dependent to itraconazoles and fluoconazoles compared with the wildtype parental strain and susceptible to ketoconazoles. However, both the heterozygote and parental strain were sensitive to caspofungin, voriconazoles, and resistant to amphotericin B. In sum, the diminished virulence phenotype of the heterozygous mutant reflects the essential role of the DDR 48 in filamentation and pathogenesis. 1 bound copy: xv, 54 leaves; ill.

40|$|The {{presence}} of delta is always {{accompanied by a}} sensitive second chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster or vice versa. The separability of delta and the chromosome line was investigated in experiments designed to eliminate delta or to suppress its multiplication {{for a number of}} generations. Cy/Sb- 5 males which transmit a minute amount of delta b (retained by chromosome Sb, kills Sb/Sb and Sb/Sr zygotes) to their progeny were backcrossed for 61 generations to Cy/Pm females which carried no delta. After backcrossing 465 Cy/Sb- 5 males were individually examined for retention of delta, and all were found to retain delta b in its latent state. A homozygous strain for the Sr- 20 B chromosome which retained a minute amount of delta r (retained by chromosome Sr, kills Sr/Sr zygotes) was obtained. 1, 252 Cy/Sr- 20 B females derived from the homozygous strains at the 21 st generation were tested individually for delta retention. All females tested were found to retain delta r in its latent state. The delta retention in Sb- 5 chromosome lines isolated from Sr-Cy/Sb- 5 <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> which carried delta r but not delta b was examined. The descendant Cy/Sb- 5 lines from the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> had accumulated their specific delta, delta b.

40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{mutations in}} telomere-associated factors elicit a disease known as dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), and patients suffer proliferative abnormalities associated with telomere erosion. Mice that are heterozygous for telomerase genes (Tert or Terc, hereafter {{referred to as}} mTert and mTerc) are useful models of telomerase haploinsufficiency, but do not strictly mimic DKC. In strains with long telomeres (> 60 kbp), animals that are heterozygous for mTert undergo telomere erosion for nine generations and remain phenotypically normal. In an mTerc <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> with short telomeres (< 15 kbp), early mortality arises after five to six generations, but dyskeratosis occurs only upon the further loss of mPot 1 b. We show that prolonged mTert heterozygosity (for greater than ten generations) did not elicit disease, even upon heterozygote interbreeding, and that telomeres reset to wild-type lengths. This lengthening did not occur in nullizygotes, and short telomeres inherited from mTert null parents were rescued only in heterozygous progeny. In the bone marrow, nullizygotes remained competent for radioprotection for three generations. Thus, gradual telomere erosion {{in the presence of}} telomerase may enable subsequent telomere extension, similar to that described in budding yeast. We speculate whether such adaptation occurs in normal human cells (or whether it could be induced in DKC-derived cells), and whether it might mitigate the impact of telomerase inhibition upon stem cells during cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Loss of DNA {{mismatch}} repair due to mutation or diminished {{expression of the}} MLH 1 gene is associated with genome instability and cancer. In this study, we used a yeast model system to examine three circumstances relevant to modulation of MLH 1 function. First, overexpression of wild-type MLH 1 was found to cause a strong elevation of mutation rates at three different loci, similar to the mutator effect of MLH 1 gene inactivation. Second, haploid yeast strains with any of six mlh 1 missense mutations that mimic germ line mutations found in human cancer patients displayed a strong mutator phenotype consistent with loss of {{mismatch repair}} function. Five of these mutations affect amino acids that are homologous to residues suggested by recent crystal structure and biochemical analysis of Escherichia coli MutL to participate in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Finally, using a highly sensitive reporter gene, we detected a mutator phenotype of diploid yeast strains that are heterozygous for mlh 1 mutations. Evidence suggesting that this mutator effect results not from reduced mismatch repair in the MLH 1 /mlh 1 cells but rather from loss of the wild-type MLH 1 allele in a fraction of cells is presented. Exposure to bleomycin or to UV irradiation strongly enhanced mutagenesis in the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> but {{had little effect on}} the mutation rate in the wild-type strain. This damage-induced hypermutability may be relevant to cancer in humans with germ line mutations in only one MLH 1 allele...|$|E

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a major pest of cruciferous crops {{throughout}} the world, has demonstrated {{an ability to}} develop resistance to many different classes of insecticides, including proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis that are expressed in plants (Bt plants). The ovipositional preferences and larval survival of strains (resistant strain, RR; <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain,</b> RS; susceptible strain, SS) of P. xylostella to Cry 1 Ac-expressing broccoli or broccoli plants treated with lambda-cyhalothrin or spinosad were studied under greenhouse condition. Numbers of eggs per plant did not differ between Bt broccoli and non-Bt broccoli for Bt-RR, Bt-RS, and Bt-SS adults. Ovipositing adults (spinosad-RR, spinosad-RS, and spinosad-SS) also could not discriminate between spinosad-treated and untreated plants, and oviposition did not increase over the 13 d after spinosad treatment. For broccoli treated with lambda-cyhalothrin at the diagnostic dose of 20 ppm, all three insect strains (lc-RR, lc-RS, and lc-SS) had constant oviposition over time based on linear regressions. At the field dose of 80 ppm, the lc-RR strain had constant oviposition over time. The lc-SS susceptible strain had increasing oviposition over time, but the oviposition pattern on the nonsprayed broccoli also increased over time. Susceptible females layed fewer eggs on plants sprayed with lambda-cyhalothrin than on unsprayed plants. A residue-persistence test showed that spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin could effectively control SS P. xylostella larvae for 7 - 9 d after application.

Nevertheless, strain LY-S {{has been found to be}} uniformly less mutable than strain LY-R at the hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) locus following treatment with x-radiation, UV radiation, or alkylating agents. In the present work we have isolated subclones of strains LY-R and LY-S that are heterozygous at the thymidine kinase (Tk) locus (chromosome 11). We have found that a <b>heterozygous</b> LY-S Tk+/Tk- <b>strain</b> shows as high or higher mutability at the Tk locus than do <b>heterozygous</b> LY-R <b>strains</b> following treatment with x-radiation, UV radiation, or ethyl methanesulfonate. Mutability of all <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> at the Tk locus is much higher than at the Hprt locus following treatment with these mutagenic agents, with the exception of one <b>heterozygous</b> LY-R <b>strain</b> that possesses only one chromosome 11 and that is poorly mutable at the Tk locus by x-radiation. On the basis of these results, we have suggested that because of a repair deficiency, multilocus lesions are formed in the DNA of LY-S strains following treatment with radiation or alkylating agents; multilocus lesions lead to poor recovery of viable mutants when the target locus is closely linked to essential genes and situated on a hemizygous chromosomal region (e. g., the Hprt locus on the X chromosome or the Tk locus in strains monosomic for chromosome 11); and x-radiation is a relatively poor mutagen at loci situated on hemizygous chromosomal regions, in repair-efficient and repair-deficient cells, because of its tendency to form multilocus lesions...|$|R

Molecular typing methods inter-RTL fingerprint and mtDNA RFLPs, as well as, sequence diversity and heterozygosity in the intergenic region between KmSSB 1 and KmRIO 2 genes {{and analysis of}} the mating locus were applied to 54 K. marxianus strains. Inter-RTL fingerprint revealed a large degree of genetic heterogeneity and clustering allowed differentiation of K. marxianus strains from different geographical origins. In general, inter-LTR profiles were more discriminating than RFLPs of mtDNA; however our results also indicate that both techniques could be complementary unveiling different degrees of genetic diversity. Sequence analysis of the intergenic region between KmSSB 1 and KmRIO 2 genes revealed 26 variable positions in which a double peak could be observed in the sequence chromatogram. Further analysis revealed the presence of <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> in the K. marxianus population isolated from Parmigiano Reggiano. On the other hand, all strains isolated from Pecorino di Farindola were homozygous. Two very different groups of haplotypes could be observed as well as mixtures between them. Phylogenetic reconstruction divided K. marxianus dairy strains into two separate populations. A few <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> in an intermediate position between them could also be observed. Mating type locus analysis revealed a large population of diploid strains containing both MATa and MATα alleles and few haploid strains, most of them presenting the MATα allele. Different scenarios explaining the presence and maintaining of homozygous and heterozygous diploids as well as hybrids between them in the Parmigiano Reggiano K. marxianus population are proposed.

40|$|Discovering {{the genes}} {{underlying}} fundamental processes that enable cells {{to live and}} reproduce is a technical challenge, because loss of gene function in mutants results in organisms that cannot survive. This study describes a forward genetics method to identify essential genes in fungi, based on the propensity for Agrobacterium tumefaciens to insert T-DNA molecules into the promoters or 5 ′ untranslated regions of genes and by placing a conditional promoter within the T-DNA. Insertions of the promoter of the GAL 7 gene {{were made in the}} human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Nine strains of 960 T-DNA insertional mutants screened grew on media containing galactose, but had impaired growth on media containing glucose, which suppresses expression from GAL 7. T-DNA insertions were found in the homologs of IDI 1, MRPL 37, NOC 3, NOP 56, PRE 3 and RPL 17, all of which are essential in ascomycete yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Altering the carbon source in the medium provided a system to identify phenotypes in response to stress agents. The pre 3 proteasome subunit mutant was further characterized. The T-DNA insertion and phenotype co-segregate in progeny from a cross, and the growth defect is complemented by the reintroduction of the wild type gene into the insertional mutant. A deletion allele was generated in a diploid strain, this <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> was sporulated, and analysis of the progeny provided additional genetic evidence that PRE 3 is essential. The experimental design is applicable to other fungi and has other forward genetic applications such as to isolate over-expression suppressors or enhance the production of traits of interest...|$|E
40|$|Transposon {{elements}} are important tools for gene function analysis, for example {{they can be}} used to easily create genome-wide collections of insertion mutants. Transposons may also carry sequences coding for an epitope or fluorescent marker useful for protein expression and localization analysis. We have developed three new Tn 5 -based transposons that incorporate a GFP (green fluorescent protein) coding sequence to generate fusion proteins in the important fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Each transposon also contains the URA 3 and Kan(R) genes for yeast and bacterial selection, respectively. After in vitro transposition, the insertional allele is transferred to the chromosomal locus by homologous recombination. Transposons Tn 5 -CaGFP and Tn 5 -CaGFP-URA 3 :FLIP can generate C-terminal truncated GFP fusions. A URA 3 flipper recycling cassette was incorporated into the transposon Th 5 -CaGFP-UFRA 3 :FLIP. After the induction of Flip recombinase to excise the marker, the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> is transformed again in order to obtain a GFP-tagged homozygous strains. In the Tn 5 -CaGFP-FL transposon the markers are flanked by a rare-cutting enzyme. After in vitro transposition into a plasmid-borne target gene, the markers are eliminated by restriction digestion and religation, resulting in a construct coding for full-length GFP-fusion proteins. This transposon can generate plasmid libraries of GFP insertions in proteins where N- or C-terminal tagging may alter localization. We tested our transposon system by mutagenizing the essential septin CDC 3 gene. The results indicate that the Cdc 3 C-terminal extension is important for correct septin filament assembly.

40|$|BUF/Mna rats develop thymomas spontaneously, which histologically mimic human thymomas. Although {{neoplasms}} in this rat strain {{contain a}} large number of immature lymphocytes, the phenotype has not been sufficiently assessed. We characterized T cell phenotypes in tumors from BUF/Mna rats in the present study. We also analyzed BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rats, a <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> with suppressive thymomagenesis, and compared the histology and T cell maturation with those from the BUF/Mna rats. A total of 11 BUF/Mna and 10 BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rats were used. Three-color flow cytometry was performed with anti-CD 3, CD 4, and CD 8 antibodies to identify infiltrated lymphocytes, while tumor histology was evaluated with hematoxylin-eosin staining. The weight ratios of the entire thymic tissue including thymoma as compared to the BUF/Mna and BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rat bodies were 0. 8 ± 0. 8 % and 1. 2 ± 1. 8 %, respectively. Histological findings for both rat congenic strains showed abundant lymphocytes surrounding large polygonal neoplastic thymic epithelia, which was compatible with the type B 1 classification of the World Health Organization for human thymoma. CD 4 +CD 8 + T cells accounted for 73. 7 ± 8. 0 % of the cells in tumors from BUF/Mna and 67. 2 ± 9. 4 % in those from BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rats. Further, CD 3 -CD 4 -CD 8 + T cells, intermediate between CD 4 -CD 8 -and CD 4 +CD 8 + cells, accounted for 47. 7 ± 17. 5 % and 38. 0 ± 14. 0 % of the cells in tumors from the BUF/Mna and BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ strains, respectively. Thus, the proportion of developing thymic lymphocytes in and histology of thymomas from BUF/Mna and BUF/Mna-Rnu/+ rats were similar. These results suggest that both BUF/Mna and BUF/ Mna-Rnu/+ strains are suitable animal models for human thymoma to understand the development of immature thymic lymphocytes...|$|E

40|$|The role of sterol {{mutations}} in {{the resistance of}} Candida albicans to antifungal agents has not been thoroughly investigated. Previous work reported that clinical C. albicans strains resistant to both azole antifungals and amphotericin B were defective in ERG 3, a gene encoding sterol Delta(5, 6) -desaturase. It is also believed that a deletion of the lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase gene, ERG 11, is possible only under aerobic conditions when ERG 3 is not functional. We tested these hypotheses by creating mutants by targeted deletion of the ERG 3 and ERG 11 genes and subjecting those mutants to antifungal susceptibility testing and sterol analysis. The homozygous erg 3 /erg 3 mutant created, DSY 1751, was resistant to azole derivatives, as expected. This mutant was, however, slightly more susceptible to amphotericin B than the parent wild type. It was possible to generate erg 11 /erg 11 mutants in the DSY 1751 background but also, surprisingly, {{in the background of}} a wild-type isolate with functional ERG 3 alleles under aerobic conditions. This mutant (DSY 1769) was obtained by exposure of an ERG 11 /erg 11 <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> in a medium containing 10 micro g of amphotericin B per ml. Amphotericin B-resistant strains were obtained only from ERG 11 /erg 11 heterozygotes at a frequency of approximately 5 x 10 (- 5) to 7 x 10 (- 5), which was consistent with mitotic recombination between the first disrupted erg 11 allele and the other remaining functional ERG 11 allele. DSY 1769 was also resistant to azole derivatives. The main sterol fraction in DSY 1769 contained lanosterol and eburicol. These studies showed that erg 11 /erg 11 mutants of a C. albicans strain harboring a defective erg 11 allele can be obtained in vitro in the presence of amphotericin B. Amphotericin B-resistant strains could therefore be selected by similar mechanisms during antifungal therapy...|$|E
40|$|Gene HWP 1 encodes a major Candida albicans hyphae {{cell wall}} protein {{which is a}} {{substrate}} of mammalian transglutaminases, promoting the cross-link of the fungus to epithelial cells. Here, we describe a novel HWP 1 allele, isolated from C. albicans blood isolates. Analysis of the translated sequence shows that three important regions are absent in the novel allele, HWP 1 - 2, relative to the previously described allele, HWP 1 - 1. Regions 1 and 2 consist of 10 amino acid repeats important for functional conformation of peptide chains and attachment of C. albicans cells to the mammalian epithelia. Region 3 consists of 34 amino acid residues rich in threonine and serine, with O-glycosylation sites that promote the cross-linking with other proteins on C. albicans surface. the HWP 1 - 2 homozygous strain L 757 and the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strain</b> L 296 (HWP 1 - 1 /HWP 1 - 2) have significantly lower levels of HWP 1 expression during hyphal growth and biofilm formation compared to strain SC 5314 (HWP 1 - 1 /HWP 1 - 1). However, strain L 296 properly forms hyphae and biofilms in vitro while strain L 757 has reduced hyphal growth (40. 4 %) and biofilm formation (90. 8 %).

40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} human opportunistic fungal pathogen, causing superficial as well as life-threatening systemic infections. It lives commensally in the gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity, on the skin and the reproductive tract of most healthy individuals. Even small changes in the physical or chemical composition of its environment can lead to C. albicans causing infection. Immunocompromised patients are vulnerable to oral candidiasis, as well as disseminated infections, while vulvovaginal candidiasis strikes {{a high percentage of}} women at least once in their lifetime. The oral cavity, the internal organs and the reproductive tract are all clearly different in terms of pH and nutrient availability. Therefore, {{it is important for the}} fungus to adequately sense its environment and respond to it by expressing the right metabolic enzymes and virulence attributes. The most important virulence factor for C. albicans is the yeast-to-hyphae transition. The fungus can grow as spheric budding yeast cells, as well as filaments. These filaments play a role in invasion of internal organs, as well as escape from macrophages from the immune system, while yeast cells are ideally suited for dissemination of the infection through the bloodstream. The switch from yeast to hyphae can be induced by many environmental cues, such as alkaline pH, high temperature, high CO 2 levels, serum and certain amino acids. One of the amino acids known to induce morphogenesis is methionine. We identified an important part of the mechanism by which methionine induces filamentation in C. albicans. In earlier work, the G-protein coupled receptor, Gpr 1, was shown to function in this morphogenesis. We tried to identify the ligand of this receptor in methionine-induced morphogenesis by site-directed mutagenesis of specific domains. The Gpr 1 N-terminal domain shows homology with the N-terminal domains of certain human amino acid sensing GPCRs, especially residues known to be required for amino acid sensing were conserved. Mutation of these conserved amino acids into alanine did not affect morphogenesis. Gpr 1 is an ortholog of the sugar sensing GPCR in S. cerevisiae, ScGpr 1. Several residues in and near the sixth transmembrane domain were identified to be a part of the binding pocket of ScGpr 1. Mutation of one of these amino acids did result in a defect in morphogenesis, we still have to determine whether this is due to misfolding of the receptor or a defect in signaling. The amino acid also needs to be taken up through the high affinity methionine permease, Mup 1. This transporter is required for survival inside macrophages, as well as virulence in a mouse model for disseminated infection. Upon uptake, part of the methionine is converted into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a cofactor in a wide variety of biosynthesis reactions inside the cell. SAM is not only the main methylating agent, it can also be decarboxylated by Spe 2, the SAM decarboxylase of C. albicans. Upon decarboxylation it is the aminopropyl donor in the biosynthesis of the polyamines. The polyamines, spermidine and spermine, are important for growth of all eukaryotic cells. Their fully protonated state makes them interact with many different molecules in the cell. Next to methionine, we showed that also SAM and the polyamines could induce morphogenesis. We linked this induction to the cAMP-PKA pathway, as methionine, SAM and spermine induce a transient cAMP increase in C. albicans. This methionine-induced cAMP peak is dependent on the presence of Mup 1 and the expression of Spe 2. As SAM also induces morphogenesis, we identified general amino acid permease 4, Gap 4, to be a high affinity SAM transporter. Deletion of GAP 4 resulted in a defect in SAM induced morphogenesis, as well as in SAM-induced cAMP production. When studying a pathogen, the results need to be confirmed in vivo. Therefore, we contributed to the incorporation of two different animal models in our lab. First, we assisted in the optimization of an infection model in the mini-host, Galleria mellonela. Larvae of the wax moth were injected with several mutants in order to study their virulence. However, rodents still remain the gold standard for in vivo studies with pathogens, as they are mammals, and as such much more like humans. We optimized the tail vein injection model for disseminated infection in mice in our lab, testing different conditions of pregrowth.

40|$|Chromatin {{modifications}} affect {{gene regulation}} {{in response to}} environmental stimuli in numerous biological processes. For example, N-acetyl-glucosamine and CO 2 induce a morphogenetic conversion between white (W) and opaque (O) cells in MTL (mating-type locus) homozygous and <b>heterozygous</b> (a/α) <b>strains</b> of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Here, we identify 8 histone-modifying enzymes playing distinct roles in the regulation of W/O switching in MTL homozygous and <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains.</b> Most strikingly, genetic removal of the paralogous genes RPD 3 and RPD 31, both of which encode almost identical orthologues of the yeast histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd 3, reveals opposing roles in W/O switching of MTLa/α strains. We show that Rpd 3 and Rpd 31 functions depend on MTL genotypes. Strikingly, we demonstrate that Rpd 3 and Rpd 31, which are almost identical except for a divergent C-terminal extension present in Rpd 31, exert their functions in distinct regulatory complexes referred to as CaRpd 3 L and CaRpd 31 S complexes. Moreover, we identify the Candida orf 19. 7185 product Ume 1, the orthologue of yeast Ume 1, as a shared core subunit of CaRpd 3 L and CaRpd 31 S. Mechanistically, we show that the opposing roles of Rpd 3 and Rpd 31 require their deacetylase activities. Importantly, CaRpd 3 L interacts with the heterodimeric transcriptional repressor a 1 /α 2, thus controlling expression of WOR 1 encoding the master regulator of W/O switching. Thus, our work provides novel insight about regulation mechanisms of W/O switching in MTLa/α strains. This is the first example of two highly conserved HDACs exerting opposing regulatory functions in the same process in a eukaryotic cell...|$|R
40|$|In genetic {{studies of}} Leishmania parasites, co-dominant markers are chosen {{for their ability}} to detect {{heterozygous}} polymorphisms, to infer the occurrence of inbreeding and to resolve genetic variability. The majority of DNA sequence based reports perform conventional dye terminator cycle sequencing where perfectly ambiguous sites or double peaks in the chromatogram are interpreted as <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains.</b> However, molecular peculiarities of the parasite such as aneuploidy, mixed populations and homologous recombination advise that data from regular DNA sequence analysis should be carefully evaluated. We report here a closer look at ambiguous sites observed in 6 pgd DNA sequences obtained for a multilocus sequence analysis project on Leishmania (Viannia) strains. After comparing 286 DNA sequences from biological and molecular clones of six L. (Viannia) strains we could distinguish events that contribute to genetic variation in Leishmania (recombination, mutation, chromosomal mosaics). Also, the results suggest how diversity might not be completely revealed through regular DNA sequence analysis and demonstrate the importance for molecular epidemiology research to be aware of such possibilities while choosing samples for studies...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, small RNAs {{homologous}} to transposable elements (TEs) are of two types: piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) with size 23 - 29 nt and siRNA (small interfering RNA) with size 19 - 22 nt. The siRNA pathway {{is suggested}} to silence TE activities in somatic tissues based on TE expression profiles, but direct evidence of transposition is lacking. Here we developed an efficient FISH (fluorescence in Situ hybridization) based method for polytene chromosomes from larval salivary glands to reveal new TE insertions. Analysis of the LTR-retrotransposon 297 and the non-LTR retroposon DOC {{shows that in}} the argonaut 2 (Ago 2) and Dicer 2 (Dcr 2) mutant strains, new transposition events are much more frequent than in <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> or wild type strains. The data demonstrate that the siRNA pathway represses TE transposition in somatic cells. Nevertheless, we found that loss of one functional copy of Ago 2 or Dcr 2 increases somatic transpositions of the elements at a lower level depending on the genetic background, suggesting a quantitative role for RNAi core components on mutation frequency...|$|R
40|$|The genus Oenothera has an {{outstanding}} scientific tradition. It {{has been a}} model for studying aspects of chromosome evolution and speciation, including the impact of plastid nuclear co-evolution. A large collection of strains analyzed during a century of experimental work and unique genetic possibilities allow the exchange of genetically definable plastids, individual or multiple chromosomes, and/or entire haploid genomes (Renner complexes) between species. However, molecular genetic approaches for the genus are largely lacking. In this study, we describe the development of efficient PCR-based marker systems for both the nuclear genome and the plastome. They allow distinguishing individual chromosomes, Renner complexes, plastomes, and subplastomes. We demonstrate their application by monitoring interspecific exchanges of genomes, chromosome pairs, and/or plastids during crossing programs, e. g., to produce plastome–genome incompatible hybrids. Using an appropriate partial permanent translocation heterozygous hybrid, linkage group 7 of the molecular map could be assigned to chromosome 9 · 8 of the classical Oenothera map. Finally, we provide the first direct molecular evidence that homologous recombination and free segregation of chromosomes in permanent translocation <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> is suppressed...|$|R

In several cases, we identified previously known interactions; furthermore, in each case, our analysis revealed novel cellular interactions, even when {{the relationship between a}} compound and its cellular target had been well established. In addition, we identified a chemical core structure shared among three therapeutically distinct compounds that inhibit the ERG 24 <b>heterozygous</b> deletion <b>strain,</b> demonstrating that cells may respond similarly to compounds of related structure.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the ancestral fungus was mating competent and homothallic. However, many mating-competent fungi were initially classified as asexual because their mating capacity was hidden behind layers of regulation. For efficient in vitro mating, the essentially obligate diploid ascomycete pathogen Candida albicans has to change its mating type locus from heterozygous MTLa/α to homozygous MTLa/a or MTLα/α and then undergo an environmentally controlled epigenetic switch to the mating-competent opaque form. These requirements greatly reduce the potential for C.  albicans mating. Deletion of the Yci 1 domain gene OFR 1 bypasses the need for C.  albicans cells to change the mating type locus from heterozygous to homozygous prior to switching to the opaque form and mating and allows homothallic mating of MTL <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains.</b> This bypass is carbon source dependent and does not occur when cells are grown on glucose. Transcriptional profiling of ofr 1 mutant cells shows {{that in addition to}} regulating cell type and mating circuitry, Ofr 1 is needed for proper regulation of histone and chitin biosynthesis gene expression. It appears that OFR 1 is a key regulator in C.  albicans and functions in part to maintain the cryptic mating phenotype of the pathogen...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we used genetic {{interaction}} (GI) and gene-chemical interaction (GCI) data {{to compare}} mutations with different dominance phenotypes. Our analysis {{focused primarily on}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where haploinsufficient genes (HI; genes with dominant loss-of-function mutations) {{were found to be}} participating in gene expression processes, namely, the translation and regulation of gene transcription. Non-ribosomal HI genes (mainly regulators of gene transcription) were found to have more GIs and GCIs than haplosufficient (HS) genes. Several properties seem to lead to the enrichment of interactions, most notably, the following: importance, pleiotropy, gene expression level and gene expression variation. Importantly, after these properties were appropriately considered in the analysis, the correlation between dominance and GI/GCI degrees was still observed. Strikingly, for the GCIs of <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains,</b> haploinsufficiency was the only property significantly correlated with the number of GCIs. We found ribosomal HI genes to be depleted in GIs/GCIs. This finding can be explained by their high variation in gene expression under different genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. We observed the same distributions of GIs among non-ribosomal HI, ribosomal HI and HS genes in three other species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. One potentially interesting exception was the lack of significant differences in the degree of GIs between non-ribosomal HI and HS genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of antifungal resistance {{is on the}} increase worldwide and novel drugs are constantly being developed to counter this trend. One hundred and sixteen clinical isolates of Candida albicans were collected from Lebanese hospitals in order to first determine the degree of resistance of Lebanese isolates to four common azoles: fluconazole (FL), itraconazole (IT), ketoconazole (KE), and voriconazole (VO), in addition to amphotericin B (AP) and caspofungin (CS) through the Epsilometer test method and second, determine any relationship between the allelic compositions of the mating type loci (MTLa, MTL α, MTLa/α) with drug resistance. Results showed that resistance, among C. albicans isolates, was the highest with 12 % for IT, followed by 7. 7 % for VO, 6 % for KE, 5 % for FL, 1. 7 % for AP and 0 % for CS. Three isolates (2. 6 %) were resistant to all azoles tested, including one that was resistant to all drugs used except CS. Eleven isolates were homozygous at the MTL locus (9. 5 %), five of which (45 %) were resistant {{to at least one}} antifungal drug whereas 14 of the 105 <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> (13 %) exhibited similar resistance (P = 0. 02), indicating a strong correlation between MTL locus homozygosity and resistance.

Transformants resistant to geneticin (G 418) were selected. The SFH disruption cassettes were cloned into a bacterial vector. Each cognate gene was also cloned into a yeast centromeric plasmid. Sporulation and tetrad analysis of the disrupted <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> revealed that ORF YLR 153 c (now known as ACS 2) is essential.

The effects of mutation in the polymerase domain of this essential enzyme are unknown. Here, we generated mice harboring an L 604 G or L 604 K substitution in highly conserved motif A in the polymerase active site of Pol δ. Homozygous Pold 1 L 604 G/L 604 G and Pold 1 L 604 K/L 604 K mice died in utero. However, heterozygous animals were viable and displayed no overall increase in disease incidence, indicative of efficient compensation for the defective mutant polymerase. The life spans of wild-type and heterozygous Pold 1 +/L 604 G mice did not differ, while that of Pold 1 +/L 604 K mice was reduced by 18 %. Cultured embryonic fibroblasts from the <b>heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> exhibited comparable increases in both spontaneous mutation rate and chromosome aberrations. We observed no significant increase in cancer incidence; however, Pold 1 +/L 604 K mice bearing histologically diagnosed tumors died at a younger median age than wild-type mice.

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{genetic trait}} in Candida albicans is diploidism, which {{is accompanied by}} a high degree of natural heterozygosity. Here, we describe natural heterozygosity in the promoter of the CaCHS 7 gene in the SC 5314 strain, associated with a GC-rich sequence of 28 nucleotides. Both alleles are expressed in the wild type and contribute to the total levels of the CaCHS 7 mRNA. However, the presence of this region in the promoter (L allele) significantly reduced the transcription of the gene as compared with its absence (S allele). <b>Heterozygous</b> <b>strains</b> containing either allele showed distinct phenotypic characteristics. The HeteroL strain showed reduced levels of chitin, a partial resistance to calcofluor, and a moderate degree of morphogenetic alterations in hypha-inducing media. The HeteroS strain was very similar to the wild type, showing only a modest decrease in chitin that did not appear to confer distinct phenotypic characteristics. This is therefore a new report about allelic heterogeneity in C. albicans, directly translated into differential regulation of both alleles, leading to phenotypic consequences. The allelic heterogeneity reported appears to be strain-specific. However, sequence comparison between strains indicated that this region is prone to genetic divergence, which is probably responsible for the reported allelic heterozygosity of CaCHS 7.

In contrast, overexpression of rfxA caused growth arrest during conidial germination.
