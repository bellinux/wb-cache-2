25|$|Women {{comprised}} {{one-third of}} the EZLN army, and {{a significant portion of}} them held commanding offices. In addition, about half of the EZLN’s support base was women. Initially, the majority of the women insurgents were in the less-organized local militias, but later decided to join the actual EZLN. The women who joined as insurgents had to renounce <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of their own, because it was too difficult to care for children in the conditions they lived in. There was family planning for women insurgents, but for those who did get pregnant, they either went home or left the child with their parents. In the insurgent camps men and women share cooking and cleaning tasks equally.|$|E

He invites her to Hong Kong but she declines, promising to still keep in touch and thanking him for the present. When Sharon tells Gavin that she is ending her marriage to Phil, he visits her, offering his support. She rejects him and the gift he has left for Dennis, saying she does not want liars in her life, but he insists he has never lied to her and reminds her of his offer to join him overseas, insisting that he will have a steady job and that he wants a second chance of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family.</b> Sharon and Dennis later join Gavin.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{completion}} of SAO, Asuna remains unconscious and is instead detained in another virtual reality called Alfheim Online. She is forced {{to play the role}} of «Titania the Queen of Fairies», with Nobuyuki Sugō, the man responsible for imprisoning her, playing as Oberon the Fairy King. This is done so that Sugō could marry Asuna in the real world, while she is unconscious and thus take over RCT Progress Inc. She attempts to escape the World Tree where she is imprisoned and manages to steal a GM card which she throws out of the window when she hears Yui's voice. Upon being released she creates two avatars for Alfheim, Asuna (being the healer of the team) and Erika (a battle-type avatar), and went on to continue living together with Kirito. She enrolls at the SAO Survivor School with Kazuto Kirigaya in the real world after everything ended. In the real world, Asuna's parents want her to follow in their footsteps. However, after living in SAO and meeting Kirito, she gains a different perspective and looks back on her past with disgust. She officially becomes Kazuto's real-life girlfriend and dreams of marrying him and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> with him in the future.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} shipwreck, Ethan discovers a hidden {{laboratory}} inside an abandoned salt mine. There, he learns that Eveline is a bio-organic weapon capable of infecting {{people with a}} psychotropic mold that gives her control over her victims' minds, resulting in insanity, superhuman regenerative abilities, and various mutations. Eveline grew up obsessed with <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> influencing her to infect Mia and the Bakers, {{as well as to}} lure Ethan to the Bakers' home. Lucas is also revealed to have been immunized against Eveline's control by the organization in exchange for providing observations on her. Using the lab equipment and Eveline's genetic material, Ethan synthesizes a toxin to kill her, and proceeds through a series of tunnels that lead back to the Baker house. Eveline assaults Ethan with hallucinations, but he overcomes them. Ethan injects Eveline with the toxin, but instead of killing her it reveals she is the elderly woman in a wheelchair, rapidly aging since her escape. Eveline mutates into a large monster and, aided by the arrival of a military squad, Ethan is able to kill her.|$|E
500|$|Both Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune and Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune {{felt that}} Morgan gave [...] "his {{best and most}} {{believable}} performance of the season" [...] in [...] "Devil's Trap", with the latter adding, [...] "He was really on fire in that scene, and it brought a whole new intensity to his performance." [...] Diana Steenbergen of IGN found him [...] "menacing, with his low voice and the cruel words... trying to tear them apart emotionally before tearing Dean apart literally", and enjoyed the sadistic and [...] "vicious humor" [...] that makes the character [...] "more sinister". However, she believed that Azazel <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> was an unnecessary parallel with the Winchesters that [...] "doesn't quite make sense". After viewing the episode, Brian Tallerico of UGO gave his opinion that the series should follow Buffy the Vampire Slayer format of having a different recurring villain each season. [...] "If the firestarting demon is the Big Bad {{for the first two}} seasons, that's fine", he commented, [...] "but don't drag it out longer than that. Fans will get bored. And there's nothing scarier than that.|$|E
500|$|Republican Congresswoman Barbara Layton (Cherry Jones) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against publicly funded NIH projects into sexual diseases. The attack {{is based on a}} list of seemingly useless projects, but by association, her real target becomes the president's daughter Ellie, who is working on a study into the Human papillomavirus that researched conditions for prostitutes in Puerto Rico. The President is infuriated at <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member dragged into political battles, and Toby tries to discredit the attack by finding its source. At first the list seems to originate from a far-right group called the [...] "Traditional Values Alliance", but Toby's assistant Rena uncovers an updated list that shows it came from within the administration. Toby immediately suspects the Vice President's office. When confronted, Will takes full responsibility, and assures that the list was compiled purely for internal use and not leaked on purpose. Will suspects that his boss might have leaked the material on purpose, however, and Russell in private agrees he has ties to the Republicans on health issues and notes that having some distance from the President isn't a bad thing for him. Will is left utterly disgusted with the VP.|$|E

Nine (19%) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of schizophrenia. Thirty five (60%) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of depression.

500|$|There are {{recurring}} {{themes that}} appear throughout the story. The main theme {{is the value}} of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> as the title of the series implies because the main scenario writer Jun Maeda mistakenly thought the name of the Irish band Clannad meant [...] "clan" [...] or [...] "family" [...] in Irish. Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents are major factors in their stories. Nagisa's story was written to incorporate what Maeda described as a [...] "perfect family" [...] with a focus on mental consciousness. In Nagisa's story, there is a recurring appearance of [...] (a fictional group mascot for children) that Nagisa is fond of. Tomoya's and Nagisa's characters were written in a style to exemplify a [...] "growth to adulthood" [...] {{by the end of the}} story. Fuko's and Kyou's stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo's story is influenced by her entire family. A minor motif of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game, [...] "Mag Mell", which means roughly [...] "plain of joy" [...] and is connected with Irish mythology. The arrange album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was bundled with the original game release was titled Mabinogi, which was a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts.|$|E
500|$|Diana Steenbergen of IGN also praised [...] "Devil's Trap", deeming {{it to be}} {{the episode}} that [...] "moved Supernatural from the list of {{television}} shows that [...] liked to the 'must-see' list". Like Peterson, she cheered the twist ending, and was [...] "completely taken by surprise". Steenbergen also felt that Jim Beaver as hunter Bobby Singer was [...] "an excellent addition to the cast", and applauded Ackles, Padalecki, and Morgan for their performances in the episode's climactic confrontation between Azazel and the brothers. She found the possessed Morgan to be [...] "menacing", and enjoyed his sadistic sense of humor; Padalecki to have done a [...] "good job embodying the newfound strength" [...] Sam develops in defying his father's order to kill him in order to stop the demon; and Ackles' defenselessness to be [...] "affecting". However, she believed that Azazel's reference to <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> [...] " [...] quite make sense", and noted that it seemed implausible for Sam and Deanhaving been raised as huntersto not have known that Meg was a demonically-possessed girl. Brian Tallerico of UGO also had issues with the plot, though mainly with the episode's outcome. He felt that the writers should have followed Buffy the Vampire Slayers pattern of killing off the season's foe, as [...] "fans don't like villains to be strung out for too long". He also would have liked for John Winchester to have died in order to [...] "free the brothers up for a little second season revenge and a little less family angst".|$|E
500|$|While Susie's {{addition}} helps The Fabulous Baker Boys experience success, it also {{results in}} complications {{among the group}} by disturbing some of the original act's traditions and threatening to come between the two brothers when Jack begins {{to fall in love}} with her. Susie and Jack's growing mutual attraction towards each other eventually threatens the stability of the trio. <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of his own, Frank is particularly concerned that if his younger brother Jack pursues Susie he will ultimately disregard her and cause her to leave the group, while Susie insists that she deserves a say in determining what songs the trio will perform, particularly lamenting that she is forced to sing [...] "Feelings" [...] at every scheduled performance. When Frank is pulled away from work for a family emergency around New Year's Eve, Susie and Jack seize the opportunity to make adjustments to their set list and ultimately make love in a late night jazz club after performing alone together. Frank is furious to learn that Susie and Jack have changed the set list without his permission and an argument ensues between Jack and Frank. Susie eventually leaves both the group and Jack due to Jack's refusal to express his true feelings for her, accepting a job singing jingles for television commercials. After mending his relationship with Frank, Susie receives a visit from Jack who apologizes for his behavior towards her; Susie does not clarify if she and Jack will rekindle their romance before walking away.|$|E

500|$|According to Vox writer Lauren Williams, the {{character}} reinforces [...] "that pursuing such a demanding career and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> were not mutually exclusive", seldom hesitating to challenge anyone who doubts {{her ability to}} maintain both. For example, in the season one episode [...] "How Ugly Is He?", Clair responds to a sexist statement made by Denise's then-boyfriend David about Clair's decision to work as opposed to remaining home to raise the children with [...] "Why don’t you ask Dr. Huxtable that question?" [...] This exchange {{would serve as a}} preface to future, more prominent confrontations Clair would have with Sondra's chauvinistic boyfriend Elvin, who is introduced in the following season in the episode [...] "Cliff in Love", during which Elvin wrongly perceives Clair offering him and Cliff a cup of coffee as an act of servitude. Clair promptly corrects Elvin {{in the form of a}} rant that explains the equal roles of a married husband and wife; Jason Bailey of Slate compared Clair's speech to Gloria Stivic arguing about feminist politics with her father Archie Bunker in the sitcom All in the Family. However, when Cliff voices his preference for Daryl, a young man competing for Sondra's affection, over Elvin due to the former's more progressive opinions about women, Clair defends Elvin, reminding Cliff that he once shared Elvin's views and ideas before Clair ultimately changed him for the better. Despite their differences, Clair is willing to accept Elvin with confidence that his primitive opinions about women will eventually change, and is never shown to be mistreating him. Bailey concluded, [...] "If The Cosby Show’s racial politics were merely implied, its gender politics were clear, pointed, and decidedly progressive." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are differing {{views about}} how {{important}} it is to have a family member or relative who also attended a college. It is clear that it is a factor; one report suggested that <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member who is an alumnus gives [...] "a leg up" [...] for applicants. One report suggested that siblings do not count as legacies. In some cases, a parent's attendance at a related graduate school counts as a legacy, but most colleges do not count this. Many selective private colleges have a higher admit rate for alumni children as a way to [...] "keep the larger set of alumni happy and giving", and being a legacy applicant can mean as much as [...] "100 or 200 points on the SAT".|$|E

[...] After the break-up, he said that the song [...] "was about this mythical mix of ex-girlfriends, it's really about her, it's this prophetic thing.
