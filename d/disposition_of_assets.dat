5000|$|In {{light of}} public warnings, Bramly was facing {{increasing}} capital outflows in Kela brand companies {{of not only}} regular interest payments but of investors that exercised their right to withdraw funds {{at the end of}} their investment period instead of rolling them over into a new investment period. In the summer of 2015 Kela fund's payments to investors, which up until that point were performed regularly, became irregular, and investors did not receive their funds in a prompt manner. In October 2015, liquidation proceedings began against Kela. During the proceedings, more than 300 million NIS of unfulfilled debt, mostly from investors, were set before the court. In addition, the court appointed liquidator produced a report claiming that funds in the Kela fund were not actually used for [...] "Capital completion", but rather funneled into Rubicon Business Group, and that in addition that funds were moved from Rubicon to Bramly and his family, due to which a court order prohibiting <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> was placed on Bramly and members of his family. As a result, the Kela fund, Rubicon Business Group, and a number of held companies were placed in permanent liquidation by the Tel-Aviv district court in January 2016 after the court determined that funds were inter-meshed between the companies, and that debts, mainly to investors, exceeded assets.|$|E

50|$|All {{chapters}} active {{prior to}} World War II succeeded in resuming operation after the war. The two in Colorado, however, {{were lost in}} 1948 and 1956. One new chapter was installed in 1949, {{but after a few}} years became weak and was asked for its charter in 1961. Many felt the Commons Club movement lost its relevance and withered in the more liberal climate of student life after World War II. With the withdrawal in 1963 of the Cincinnati Chapter, which had long been active in the Association, the remaining chapters at Denison and Adrian felt it futile to maintain a national organization with just two chapters. Accordingly, at a Special Convention held at Adrian April 4, 1964, the delegates voted unanimously to suspend national operation as of June 15. By 1964 only the founding chapter at Denison University remained, and in 1969 the American Association of Commons Clubs became an organization of only alumni while the active chapter became a member of Delta Chi national fraternity. At the time of the suspension of the Association, the national officers then current were designated as a permanent Executive Committee to act {{in the interests of the}} Association in all matters regarding protection and use of insignia, maintenance of records, <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> and other matters. These officers included the following: Allan M. Dewey (Denison '37), President; Edward G. Voss (Denison '50), General Secretary; R.A. Wiley (Adrian '50) Treasurer; and John N.

A complete file of Association Convention proceedings, bulletins, handbooks, mimeographed documents, and publications, including The American Commoner, is deposited in the archives of the William Howard Doane Library at Denison.|$|E
50|$|In November 1952, Rabbi Douek was {{appointed}} by the chief rabbi of Egypt to join the rabbinical body of Cairo’s chief rabbinate. In 1954, he {{was appointed}} Chairman of the Beit Din (Jewish Rabbinical Court). He was also appointed by the Egyptian Ministry of Justice as a Judge in the Jewish Primary and Appellate courts, which were {{a division of the}} Jewish domestic relations court. King Farouk was removed from power in 1952 during a revolution that placed Gamal Abdel Nasser in power. In January 1956, he abolished the domestic relations court and required all decisions be made in civil court, instead of the religious court. The Egyptian Ministry of Justice appointed Rabbi Douek as a Notary Delegate in charge of all matters affecting the personal relations of Jews. This included authority on issues involving marriage, divorce, wills, children and <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> He was also the rabbinic authority designated to issue all official documents from the chief rabbinate. In September 1956, Rabbi Douek was appointed as deputy to Chief Rabbi Haim Nahoum, who recommended that Rabbi Haim Douek succeed him as Chief Rabbi of Egypt. When Rabbi Haim Nahoum’s died in November 1960, Rabbi Haim Douek assumed responsibility for leading the Jewish community as the nation’s last Chief Rabbi. At the time, the number of Jews in Egypt had dwindled to about 10,000 due to the changing political environment in Egypt. Rabbi Douek continued to preside over a community that was gradually emptying out of Egypt {{as they made their way}} to Israel, the United States and other countries. On June 5, 1967, during the Six Day War with Israel, Rabbi Douek and his family were ordered to go to the offices of the Chief Rabbinate, where they were held under house arrest for two weeks without outside contact. When the Egyptian government allowed Rabbi Douek to reopen the Chief Rabbinate, families of the detained men flooded his office. Rabbi Douek fielded questions from families about where their sons and brothers were detained. Still there was police presence outside and secret police inside his offices. Rabbi Douek helped families with finances, health coverage, and schools. After almost three month he was able with the help of the Red Cross to have family visitation. Rabbi Douek made sure the synagogues remained open, that there was kosher food available and that the children received a Jewish education. Rabbi Douek contacted President Nasser, the Red Cross, members of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior, and other organizations to put pressure on the Egyptian government to make it easier for families to be in touch with their loved ones in detention. The Six Day War had further accelerated the decline of the Jewish community. In 1968 there were about 2,000 Jews in Egypt, down from about 80,000 twenty years earlier. Rabbi Douek met with Egyptian politicians and dignitaries from around the world to obtain relief for the Egyptian Jews so they could leave the country. After three and a half years, all the detainees were released and permitted to leave Egypt with their families. By 1971, there were only 300 members of the community remaining. Many of these were families with young children. Rabbi Douek advised them to leave Egypt, since he saw no future there for the families. Rabbi Douek led Egypt’s Jewish population during a period of political turmoil and instability. Rabbi Douek left Egypt for France in March 1972. Prior to leaving, he made sure that the remaining Jews had their religious needs met. There was a Hazzan (cantor) in the synagogue, a shokhet, as well as someone to assist with Kadish (funeral services). He saw to it that all the active synagogues remained open and maintained and that the cemetery was maintained. In addition, he made sure that kosher wine and matzo was available for Passover. In October 1972, he immigrated to New York with his children.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Challenges to wills on {{the basis}} of lack of {{testamentary}} capacity and/or undue influence are likely to increase over the next generation. Since contemporaneous assessment of testamentary capacity can be a powerful influence on the outcome of such challenges, there will be an associated increase in requests for expert assessment of testamentary capacity. There is a need to provide such potential experts with the knowledge and guidelines necessary to conduct assessments that will be helpful to the judicial system. METHODS: A subcommittee of the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) task force on "Testamentary Capacity and Undue Influence" was formed to establish guidelines for contemporaneous assessment of testamentary capacity. RESULTS: The task-specific criteria for testamentary capacity as outlined by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in the well-known Banks v. Goodfellow case are described. Additional issues are identified for probing and documentation. This is designed to determine whether the testator can formulate a coherent, rational testamentary plan that connects his/her beliefs, values and relationships with the proposed <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> Rules of engagement by the expert assessor are defined as well as an approach to the clinical examination for testamentary capacity resulting in a clear and relevant report. CONCLUSION: Guidelines for experts who are asked to provide a contemporaneous opinion on testamentary capacity should help to inform disputes resulting from challenges to wills. A consistent clinical approach will help the courts to make their determinations...|$|E

However, it appears that selected organizational forms may be preferred for managing some real estate assets. Thus, when the acquisition or <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> a realty <b>asset</b> has {{no change in the}} management structure <b>of</b> the <b>assets,</b> as in this study, no excess return is found.
