50|$|On February 13, 1982 a Car Expo Mercury display {{featuring}} a 130 lb. Leesburg, <b>Florida</b> <b>cougar</b> named Tom Tom mauled a 9 year old Upper St. Clair boy before Pittsburgh Police officers shot the animal dead. The boy survived after being treated at Allegheny General Hospital for several days.|$|E
50|$|The school's mascot is a <b>Florida</b> <b>Cougar</b> named Casey the Cougar. The school {{colors are}} navy blue and vegas gold. In 2004, {{the shade of}} gold was changed from a yellow gold to varsity gold. University's main rivals are Colonial High School and Timber Creek High School. UHS was built as a relief school for CHS in 1990 and Timber Creek was built as a relief school for UHS in 2002. East River was also built as a relief school for both University and Timber Creek in 2009.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of suitable habitat sites for potential reintroduction or natural recolonization {{is an important}} step in the recovery of an endangered species. Since the early 20 th century, there has not been evidence of a breeding population of cougars (Puma concolour) east of the Mississippi River, except an isolated population in southern Florida. During {{the latter half of the}} 20 th and 21 st centuries, cougar presence (photographs, tracks, scat, etc.) has been documented in historic ranges where cougars were thought to be extirpated east of the Mississippi River. Currently, one subspecies of cougar, the <b>Florida</b> <b>cougar</b> (P. c. coryi), is listed as an endangered species and the Florida Panther Recovery Plan has been created to aid conservation efforts. Criteria for delisting the subspecies require the establishment of three viable, self-sustaining breeding populations of at least 240 adult and subadult cougars. There is a pressing need to conserve critical habitat and identify potential reintroduction sites in the face of increasing anthropogenic encroachment. The purpose of this master’s project was to identify suitable sites to reintroduce the cougar in the state of Georgia. I used environmental variables to identify primary cougar habitat zones across the state. As a reintroduced species, cougars would require habitat of considerable size to ensure long-term survival (> 100 years) and genetic health of a source population. For reintroduction, a population of 240 cougars requires about 13, 000 km 2 of habitat (2 - 3 cougars per 100 km 2). My analyses revealed 14 primary habitat zones, grouped geographically into five habitat regions. Two of these regions, one in northeastern and one in southern Georgia (Chattahoochee N. F. and Okefenokee N. W. R. respectively), have networks of connected habitat capable of supporting significant breeding populations of cougars. I identified three additional habitat regions capable of supporting breeding populations of smaller sizes and/or dispersing cougars. Previously estimated deer densities per management unit as well as the wide distribution of feral swine indicate the availability of an ample prey base. Based on the availability of habitat and prey, combined with the relative lack of development surrounding candidate sites, the USFWS could designate these areas as critical habitat and reintroduce the <b>Florida</b> <b>cougar</b> in the state of Georgia...|$|E
50|$|After two {{losses to}} <b>Florida</b> and , the <b>Cougars</b> won eight {{straight}} games, including a perfect 5-0 {{record in the}} Astrodome, in their first bowl game since 1962. The Tigers {{finished third in the}} Southeastern Conference, after losses to #17 Tennessee and #9 LSU. This was their second straight bowl game.|$|R
50|$|The {{women on}} Brigham Young University’s club rugby team made National News on April 16, 2010 when during their quarterfinal match which was {{scheduled}} on Sunday, {{due to an}} oversight by USA Rugby Competitions Committee, decided to forfeit the national college playoff that weekend in <b>Florida.</b> The <b>Cougars</b> advanced that far in last year’s tournament, losing to Penn State, the eventual champion. The team was ranked sixth in Division I and had a good shot. The Cougars defeated Wisconsin-Milwaukee 46-7 on Saturday, however, B.Y.U. did not advance past the Round of 16 that weekend. All 35 team {{members of the team}} are Mormons, and because USA Rugby scheduled that round on Sunday, the team decided to forfeit the Sunday game against Penn State.|$|R
50|$|Traveling to Tampa to face South <b>Florida,</b> the <b>Cougars</b> {{dominated}} play in {{the first}} half, taking a 1-0 lead even with three regulars not playing. After halftime, the Bulls {{came out with a}} helter-skelter, hard pressing attack. While being out-shot, the SIUE defense withstood the assault until again making a careless turnover that helped set up a USF goal to tie the match. When Volesky was taken down in the box while driving toward a second goal, the Cougars objected to no foul being called, and the fourth official took the unusual action of calling a foul on Cougars' head coach Kalish, with the referee then issuing a red card. The game went into overtime, with both teams having opportunities to score in both extra periods, but ended in a 1-1 tie.|$|R
