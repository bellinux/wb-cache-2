40|$|A case of {{prolonged}} muscular paresis {{is reported}} following {{the administration of}} 120 mg of <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> to a patient who developed anuria. The muscular weakness con-tinued for five days, necessitating artificial ventilation; it was finally reversed by haemo-dialysis. It is probable that the neuromuscular weakness was accentuated by {{the effects of a}} low extracellular potassium concentration and by streptomycin. The duration of action of the muscle relaxants depends upon the efficacy of redistribution, excretion and metabolic destruction in lowering the circulating concentration of the drug below that level required to produce a clinical effect. The plasma level of muscle relaxant required to cause a neuromuscular block is influenced by many factors including patient sensitivity,, potassium depletion and the presence of synergistic drugs. The patient described in this case report developed muscular paresis postoperatively, re-quiring assisted ventilation for five days following a single dose of 120 mg <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide.</b> It is probable that the prolonged action of the muscle relaxant was due to a combination of factors: (1) A failure to excrete the drug. (2) A low extracellular potassium. (3) The synergistic effect of an accumulation of streptomycin. (4) A possible altered response by the patient to gallamine.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenously}} administered <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> (0. 5 - 1. 0 mg/kg) on cardiovascular function was estimated in patients anaesthetized with thiopentone, tubo-curarine, nitrous oxide and trichloroethylene and artificially ventilated. A 40 per cent rise in {{heart rate and}} a 35 per cent rise in cardiac output were observed, with no significant change in stroke volume. A modest rise in mean arterial pressure and a similar fall in total peripheral resistance resulted. Stroke work {{was found to be}} increased slightly. The effects of the two different dose levels of gallamine did not differ signi-ficantly. The results do not support the idea of an inotropic action of gallamine and the changes produced in the peripheral circulation are thought to represent passive responses to the increase in cardiac output. The synthetic muscle relaxant gallamine trieth-iodide (Flaxedil) was first described in 1947 (Bovet, Depierre and Lestrange) and introduced into anaesthetic practice in the following year (Huguenard and Bou 6, 1948). Although its primary action at the myoneural junction has been carefully evaluated (Wein, 1948; Unna et al., 1950; Unna and Pelikan, 1951), its other actions, notably on the cardiovascular system, have been less exhaustively examined. The occurrence of circulatory changes follow-ing the use of <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> in anaes-thesia was first reported in 1949 (Lamoureux and Bourgeois-Gavardin). These authors observed that tachycardia was an almost unvarying sequel to its administration, and this finding has been confirmed in many subsequent reports.

Analyses for Qams were developed using ion-pair extraction techniques with bromophenol blue, anthraquinone sulfate and naphthyl sulfate as ion-pair extraction reagents. Bulk extraction experiments were executed to evaluate the dependance of the ion-pair reagent concentration on the extraction efficiency of Qam ion pairs. The pH dependance on extraction efficiency for <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> and decamethonium bromide, bromophenol blue ion pairs was also evaluated. A solvent segmented flow injection analysis system was designed and assembled for the rapid evaluation of ion-pair extraction efficiency of several different Qams with bromophenol blue as the ion-pair extraction reagent. Separations of Qams using ion-pair liquid chromatography were developed using reverse phase columns and both alkyl sulfonic acid and tetramethylammonium salts in the mobile phase as ion-pair liquid chromatography reagents.

Measured at a wide variety of light intensities, however, the amplitudes of the VER after discharge were significantly and very similarly diminished by both peptides, the effect of 7 -l-phe ACTH(4 - 10) being somewhat stronger than that of 7 -d-phe ACTH(4 - 10). These results support the notion, advanced by others, that these peptides have an effect on a CNS vigilance regulating system, yet do not explain the reported opposite effects on active avoidance behavior of the two related peptides.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{characterize}} the response of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) to pulmonary C-fiber activation. Male rats of Wistar strain were anesthetized by urethane (1. 2 g/kg, i. p.). Tracheostomy was performed. Catheter was inserted into the femoral artery and vein. Additional catheter was placed near the entrance of the right atrium via the right jugular vein. The animal was then paralyzed with <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide,</b> ventilated and maintained at normocapnia in hyperoxia. Activities of the phrenic (PNA) and recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNA) were monitored simultaneously. Two experimental protocols were completed. In the first experiment, various doses of capsaicin were delivered into the right atrium to activate pulmonary C-fibers with vagal intact. Low dose of capsaicin (1. 25 µg/kg) produced apnea, a decrease in amplitude of PNA, an enhancement of RLNA during apnea and recovery from apnea, hypotension, and bradycardia. High dose of capsaicin (5 and 20 µg/kg) evoked the same tendency of response for both nerves and biphasic changes in blood pressure. Dose dependency was only seen in the period of apnea but not observable in nerve amplitudes. After bilateral vagotomy, low dose of capsaicin produced an increase in PNA without apnea, no signi-ficant change in RLNA, and hypertension. These results suggest that activation of vagal and nonvagal C-fibers could produce different reflex effects on cardiopulmonary functions. The reflex responses evoked by these two types of afferents might play defensive and protective roles in the airways and lungs...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that acute {{elevation of blood}} pCO 2 {{is accompanied by a}} rise in the renal reabsorption of bicarbonate (1 - 3). The exact mechanism through which this occurs has not been established, but it is thought to result from accelerated tubular hydrogen secretion due either to the lowering of cellular pH or to an increased formation of carbonic acid. The present experiments were undertaken in an attempt to define further the nature of the reabsorptive process during acute respiratory acidosis. The data demonstrate that during an acute sustained increase of carbon dioxide tension, progressive elevation of plasma bicarbonate concentration was accompanied by a curvilinear increase in the rate of bicarbonate reabsorption. The relationship between plasma bicarbonate concentration and the rate of reabsorption was found, by means of the double reciprocal plot, to take the form + The possible significance of this finding has been considered.

Forty-eight units were recorded and the axons had conduction velocities of 22 - 61 ms- 1, averaging 38. 3 ms- 1. Excitatory receptive fields were complex in many units, being made up of clearly defined, separate, low and high threshold areas. The receptive fields were often discontinuous. Only a few units behaved as if they received excitatory input from a single class of mechanoreceptors. A minority (13 %) of units had labile, excitatory receptive fields that expanded in size during the recording period. About 40 % of the units had inhibitory receptive fields. These were of two main types: either small and within or adjacent to the excitatory field, or large and separated from or adjacent to the excitatory field. The great majority of units had resting discharges upon isolation and these consisted of single impulses or bursts of impulses at short intervals separated by longer, irregular periods. The time course of inhibition produced by electrical stimulation of cutaneous nerves suggested presynaptic inhibitory components to the inhibition. Some inhibitory curves were very prolonged with maxima at about 100 ms and total durations of up to 400 ms.

Left atrial receptors were stimulated by distending balloons in two pulmonary vein-left atrial junctions and in this left atrial appendage. The left renal blood flow was measured by an electromagnetic flow meter at a constant systemic (renal) arterial pressure in preparations in which heart rate changes were prevented by administration of propranolol hydrochloride (0. 5 mg kg- 1) and atropine sulphate (0. 4 mg kg- 1). Muscular movement was prevented by <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> (0. 2 mg kg- 1). Stimulation of left atrial receptors resulted in a significant increase (P less than 0. 001) in renal blood flow of 5. 6 +/- 0. 88 ml min- 1 100 g- 1 renal mass from a control of 223 ml min- 1 100 g- 1 renal mass.

In addition, we were simultaneously able to measure methemoglobin (MetHb), which refl ects the local level of nitric oxide (Kelm et al., 1997; González-Mora et al., 2002) and experimentally alter the NO environment by pharmacological manipulation.

40|$|Circulatory {{responses}} to the intravenous injection of accelerating doses of atropine sulphate were studied in ten patients anaesthetized with nitrous oxide, oxygen and <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> and ventilated artificially. Small but significant increases in heart rate and cardiac output were accompanied by lowering of total peripheral resistance and circulation time. Arterial pressures, stroke volumes and stroke work were un-changed. Initial heart rates and pressures were high, due {{to the use of}} gallamine, and it is suggested that the control levels of cardiac output were also high. This would account for the smaller changes seen compared with earlier reports of the effect of atropine in patients artificially ventilated using tubocurarine and in those spontaneously breathing nitrous oxide, oxygen and halothane. Earlier reports from this department (Farman, 1967; Farman and Kenneiy, 1968) dealt with the effect of atropine on the circulation of patients anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and oxygen, both when breathing halothane spontaneously and when paralysed with curare and ventilated artifi-cially. It was shown that atropine caused in-creases not only in heart rate but in cardiac output and mean arterial pressure, accompanied by reduc-tions in stroke volume, peripheral resistance and circulation time. There were significantly greater percentage in-creases in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial pressure in the spontaneously breathing patients, accompanied by greater reductions in circulation time and stroke volume. In view of the positive chronotropic effect of gallamine on the heart and its ability to increase the cardiac output (Kennedy and Farman, 1968) it was decided to study the effect of atropine in the presence of gallamine.

Action potentials (greater than 70 mV) evoked by brief depolarizing current pulses applied intracellularly were never observed to cause re-excitation. Re-excitation could, however, be regularly induced by procedures which increased the delay between the initial segment and soma-dendritic components of these potentials. Re-excitation could be evoked (i) when brief hyperpolarizing pulses were applied before the onset of the soma-dendritic spikes, (ii) when the depolarizing pulses were applied on a background of long hyperpolarizing pulses or (iii) when two action potentials were evoked in a quick succession (by two brief depolarizing pulses). No relationship was found between the presence of re-excitation of motor axons and the presence of the delayed depolarization which follows the soma-dendritic spikes. Neither re-excitation nor delayed depolarization were found to be dependent upon re-excitation of the initial segment. These observations are thus at variance with previous suggestions that the initial segment spikes induce the re-excitation of motor axons and that the initial segment spikes cause the delayed depolarization following soma-dendritic spikes. Since re-excitation of a motor axon occurred without any signs of a second initial segment spike, it is concluded that it is initiated {{at the level of the}} axon, most likely at the first node of Ranvier. Re-excitation of motor axons was also observed during repetitive firing induced by intracellular current injection. However, it occurred then only occasionally, and only under strong depolarizing drive. It is thus not expected to be a common phenomenon under natural conditions of repetitive firing...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported to the}} Society that in cats in which monocular retinal lesions were made in adulthood or adolescence cells in the lesion projection zone (LPZ) of area 17 recovered sensitivity to photic stimuli but the receptive fields (RFs) were now ectopic, i. e. outside the lesion (Burke et al. 2000). When the lesions were made in adult cats (AL), stimuli presented via the lesioned eye gave lower peak discharge rates and lower cut-off velocities than those presented via the non-lesioned eye. By contrast, in kitten-lesioned cats (KL) the cut-off velocities and the peak discharge rates were similar for stimuli presented via the lesioned and the non-lesioned eye. There was, however, {{a difference in the}} time from lesion to experiment between the AL and KL groups, 2 - 24 weeks vs. 28 - 68 weeks. It was, therefore, important to see if this factor could be responsible for the neural effects. Ectopic RFs are believed to be mediated via axon collaterals of pyramidal cells interconnecting mainly in laminae 2 and 3. We, therefore, also investigated the location of the LPZ neurones (supragranular (SG) - laminae 1 - 3 : granular/ infragranular (G/I) - laminae 4 - 6). In addition to the two groups already described (AL 4 cats; KL 5 cats) we prepared a third group in which the lesion was made in the adult cat but the cat then survived 3. 5 - 4. 5 years (AL/L 3 cats). Retinal lesions 8 - 12 deg in diameter were made in cats anaesthetized with xylazine (3 mg kg- 1) and ketamine (30 mg kg- 1). Single neurones in area 17 were studied in cats anaesthetized with 0. 5 - 0. 7 % halothane in 67 / 33 N 2 O/O 2, given <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> 7. 5 mg kg- 1 h- 1 I. V. and artificially respired. EEG, ECG, end-tidal CO 2, lung pressure and deep body temperature were monitored and kept within normal limits. Animals were humanely killed {{at the end of the}} experiments. In the G/I laminae we found no difference between AL and AL/L cats but a significant difference between AL/L and KL cats and between AL and KL cats with regard to peak discharge rates and cut-off velocities (Wilcoxon, P < 0. 05). Thus it seems that the interval between lesion and experiment is not a critical factor. By contrast, in the SG laminae there was no difference between AL and KL cats with respect to peak discharge rates and cut-off velocities. Thus following monocular retinal lesions there appears to be a critical period for the LPZ cells recorded from the G/I layers of area 17, after which the presumed cortical mechanisms underlying establishment of ectopic RFs are not capable of good compensation for the loss of the retinal input...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the {{function}} of the pontine "pneumotaxic center" with special reference to the axonal projections of the medullary respiratory neurons to the pons. Adult cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and immobilized with <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide.</b> The unit discharges of respiratory neurons were extracellulary recorded in the pons and medulla. The effects of electrical stimulation of the pons on the discharges of medullary inspiratory neurons and the phrenic nerve were examined. The pattern of the ascending axonal projections and their branches of medullary respiratory neurons (ventral respiratory group, VRG) were systematically explored by antidromic responses to electrical microstimulation of the rostral pons. In addition, the descending projections of the pontine respiratory neurons were examined. To obtain histological evidence of the axonal connections between the pons and medulla, HRP (horseradish peroxidase) or WGA-HRP (wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated HRP) was injected into the VRG where inspiratory unit discharges were recorded and HRP was injected into the rostral pons. The results were as follows: 1) Unit discharges of the phasic type respiratory neurons were recorded in and around the ambigual nucleus and the retrofacial nucleus in the medulla. In the rostral pons, unit discharges of the phasic type and frequency-modulation type neurons were recorded. There was no obvious difference in the localization between the two types of neurons. Unit discharges of the inspiratory neurons were recorded in and around the medial parabrachial nucleus (Pbm). On the other hand, those of the expiratory and phase-spanning neurons were recorded more medially and ventrally. 2) Train pulse stimulation of the lateral edge of the Pbm inhibited the discharges of the medullary inspiratory neuron and the phrenic nerve, as well as switched-off the in?spiratory phase to the expiratory phase when the stimulation was given {{during the second half of}} the inspiratory phase. 3) Six out of 55 (10. 9 %) medullary respiratory neurons examined were found to project to the rostral pons and were considered to have many axonal branchings. On the other hand, only 4 out of 98 (4. 1 %) pontine respiratory neurons examined had axonal projections to the medulla at the obex level and axonal branching was observed in only one neuron. 4) When HRP was injected into Pbm and its surrounding area in the pons, many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the bilateral ambigual nuclei and their surrounding areas and in the ipsilateral nucleus of the solitary tract. When HRP was injected into VRG, many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the ipsilateral Kolliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) and lateral parabrachial nucleus. When WGA-HRP was injected into VRG, anterogradely labeled axons, terminal fibers and retrogradely labeled neurons were found mainly in the ipsilateral Pbm and KF. The present results strongly suggest that some pontine respiratory neurons receive respiratory rhythmic input from the medullary respiratory neurons and may play a role in respiratory rhythm control...|$|R
30|$|Electroretinogram (ERG) {{recordings}} {{were mainly}} modified from Shao et al. (2014). Fish were anesthetized with 0.025 % buffered MS- 222 (ethyl 3 -aminobenzoate, methanesulfonic acid salt), and then immobilized through an injection of <b>gallamine</b> <b>triethiodide</b> (Flaxedil; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA.), a neuromuscular junction blocking agent, into the dorsal muscle (0.4 – 0.6 μg per gram of body weight). Each fish {{was wrapped in}} wet KimWipes (Kimberley-Clark Taiwan, Taipei) to prevent skin from scraping or drying, and a small tube was inserted into the mouth to deliver well-oxygenated water to the gills. Immobilized fish were kept under dark conditions for at least 1.5 h for dark adaptation before the ERG recording. ERG tests were performed as described previously (Morita et al. 1997; Seeliger et al. 2002; Shao et al. 2014). A 100 -W halogen lamp (Osram 64637 100 W/ 12 V) in a lamp housing device (Nikon C-FI 115, Japan) {{was used as the}} light source for tests of visible spectra (400 – 670 nm). For the shorter wavelengths (≤ 370 nm), a custom-made UV curing device (Great Lighting Corp. 100 W/ 365 nm) was used as the light source. A series of neutral density (ND) filters (Andover, NH, USA) were used to reduce the light intensity in 0.3 log unit steps, from − 0.3 to − 4.8 log units. Peak photon fluxes at each wavelength were determined using a USB 2000 spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, USA), calibrated by LC- 1 -cal (Ocean Optics, USA) with OODBase 32 software (Ocean Optics, USA), at the fish eye surface. A shutter (Sutter Instrument Lambda SC, USA) was used to provide fixed durations of light stimuli: 10 stimuli, each of 20 ms in duration, with an inter-stimuli interval of 5 s. The ERG tests started from the lowest light intensity, and ND filters were adjusted step-by-step to increase stimuli intensity (16 steps to reach the maximum). ERG signals were recorded using Teflon-coated insulated silver electrodes (63.5 μm in diameter), and the Telfon on the tip end (5 mm) was removed and chlorinated to enhance picking up of evoked potentials. The recording electrode was positioned on the cornea, and the reference electrode was placed on the head. The signals from both electrodes were amplified 20 k-fold and filtered with a high–low band pass filter set between 1 and 3000 Hz (ER- 1, Cygnus Technology Inc. USA). The signals were digitized at a 2 -kHz sampling rate with PowerLab 4 / 25 (ADInstruments, Inc. ML 845, Australia) and recorded with Scope 3 data acquisition software (ADInstruments, Inc. Australia). The recorded signals were analyzed using custom-made software (programmed by K. Anraku). Signals recorded at each step (100 to 700 ms after stimuli) were compared to the model ERG trace obtained at maximum light stimuli using the correlation method. The replicates of waveforms from each test were compared using Spearman’s correlation test. Our pilot study revealed that when a correlation coefficient (r) between two replicates was less than 0.7, the two ERG traces showed little resemblance. Hence, ERG traces were considered valid when r was greater than 0.7 and the b-wave latency time delay was less than 100 ms (Seeliger et al. 2002). Deflection of the ERG trace was taken as an indication of the light intensity threshold of the particular wavelength (Morita et al. 1997). Sensitivity was defined as − log 10 of the threshold for each tested wavelength. To remove variations between trials, values for each individual were standardized to a 0 – 100 % scale, where 100 % indicated the maximum sensitivity spectrum (Lisney et al. 2010). After standardization, the sensitivity values of the two bitterlings for each light wavelength stimulus were compared using Tukey’s pairwise comparisons (one-way ANOVA). In this study, eight P. h. himantegus individuals (four males and four females) and nine P. h. chii individuals (six males and three females) were used for recordings.|$|R
