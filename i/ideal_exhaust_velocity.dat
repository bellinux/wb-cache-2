40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} from {{an investigation of}} a pulsed electrothermal (PET) thruster using water propellant. The PET thruster is operated on a calibrated thrust stand, and produces a thrust to power ratio of T/P = 0. 07 + or - 0. 01 N/kW. The discharge conditions are inferred from a numerical model which predicts pressure and temperature levels of 300 - 500 atm and 20, 000 K, respectively. These values in turn correctly predict the measured values of impulse bit and discharge resistance. The inferred <b>ideal</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> from these conditions is 17 km/sec, but the injection of water propellant produces a test tank background pressure of 10 - 20 Torr, which reduces the exhaust velocity to 14 km/sec. This value corresponds to a thrust efficiency of 54 + or - 7 percent when all experimental errors are taken into account...|$|E

40|$|Results {{for three}} {{velocity}} decayer nozzle configurations are {{compared with those}} obtained with a separate flow coannular nozzle tested on the same quieted turbofan engine. Peak sideline noise, which occurred 110 degrees from the inlet, was 2 to 4 db louder than with the coannular nozzle at the same <b>ideal</b> effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> and 8 to 11 db louder at the same thrust level. The decayer nozzles produced an increase in loss equivalent to about 4 percent of the engine thrust and also increased the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> of the engine. The exhaust decayed to 0. 35 of its peak velocity, compared with no decay for the coannular nozzle, within 3 equivalent nozzle diameters of the exit. The peak exhaust gas temperature was 400 K lower for the decayer configuration at the same location. The increase in perceived noise level for the decayer nozzles {{as compared with the}} coannular nozzle was attributed to the increase in <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> and the shift in peak spectrum frequency produced by these nozzles...|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to other}} types of jet engines, rocket engines have the highest thrust, {{are by far the}} lightest, but are the least {{propellant}} efficient (have the lowest specific impulse). The <b>ideal</b> <b>exhaust</b> is hydrogen, the lightest of all gases, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> Rocket engines become more efficient at high velocities (due to greater propulsive efficiency and Oberth effect). Since they do not require an atmosphere, they are well suited for uses at very high altitude and in space.|$|R
50|$|For {{air-breathing}} jet engines, particularly turbofans, {{the actual}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> and the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> are different by orders of magnitude. This is because {{a good deal}} of additional momentum is obtained by using air as reaction mass. This allows a better match between the airspeed and the exhaust speed, which saves energy/propellant and enormously increases the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> while reducing the actual <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|R
50|$|Note that {{effective}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> and actual <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> can be significantly different, for example when a rocket is run within the atmosphere, atmospheric {{pressure on the}} outside of the engine causes a retarding force that reduces the specific impulse, and the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> goes down, whereas the actual <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is largely unaffected. Also, sometimes rocket engines have a separate nozzle for the turbo-pump turbine gas, and then calculating the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> requires averaging the two mass flows as well as accounting for any atmospheric pressure.|$|R
2500|$|The {{effective}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> [...] {{is more or}} {{less the}} speed the exhaust leaves the vehicle, and in the vacuum of space, the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is often equal to the actual average exhaust speed along the thrust axis. However, the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> allows for various losses, and notably, is reduced when operated within an atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the total}} energy for a mission depends on total {{propellant}} use, {{as well as}} how much energy is needed per unit of propellant. For low <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> with respect to the mission delta-v, enormous amounts of reaction mass is needed. In fact a very low <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is not energy efficient at all for this reason; {{but it turns out that}} neither are very high <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ideally, a mixer {{is also a}} {{performance}} benefit to increasing thrust. The exhaust thrust from a jet engine is equal to exhaust mass flow times <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity,</b> ie, Thrust = ·πÅv, while the energy to make that thrust is given by Energy = 1/2mv2. A mixer helps reduce the fastest <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities</b> from {{the core of the}} engine, while making the average <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> faster, producing more thrust with the same energy.|$|R
40|$|The main {{conclusions}} reached are: (1) At low subsonic jet <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities,</b> {{jet noise}} varies as the velocity to the eighth power; (2) at high subsonic <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities,</b> jet noise approaches a variation with velocity {{to the third}} power; (3) use of the jet density squared overcorrects density effects on jet noise; (4) subsonic and supersonic jet noise levels can be predicted; and (6) use of multielement nozzles and acoustically lined ejectors significantly suppress jet noise at intermediate jet <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities...</b>|$|R
25|$|For these drives, at {{the highest}} exhaust speeds, {{energetic}} efficiency and thrust are all inversely proportional to <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> Their very high <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.|$|R
5000|$|The usual {{explanation}} for fuel-rich mixtures is that fuel-richmixtures have lower molecular weight exhaust, which by reducing increases the ratio which is approximately {{equal to the}} theoretical <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> Fuel-richmixtures actually have lower theoretical <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities,</b> because decreases as fast or faster than [...]|$|R
50|$|An {{air-breathing}} {{engine is}} thus much more propellant efficient than a rocket engine, because the actual exhaust speed is much lower, the air provides an oxidizer, and air {{is used as}} reaction mass. Since the physical <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is lower, the kinetic energy the exhaust carries away is lower and thus the jet engine uses far less energy to generate thrust (at subsonic speeds). While the actual <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is lower for air-breathing engines, the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is very high for jet engines. This is because the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> calculation essentially assumes that the propellant is providing all the thrust, and hence is not physically meaningful for air-breathing engines; nevertheless, it is useful for comparison {{with other types of}} engines.|$|R
25|$|Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless plasma thruster) {{actually}} can significantly vary their <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> This {{can help reduce}} propellant usage or improve acceleration {{at different stages of}} the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities</b> enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000m/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4000m/s).|$|R
5000|$|... for all {{jet engines}} the propulsive {{efficiency}} is highest as the <b>exhaust</b> jet <b>velocity</b> gets {{closer to the}} vehicle speed as this gives the smallest residual kinetic energy.

50|$|Increasing <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> {{increases}} {{thrust for}} a given mass flow, but matching the <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> to the air speed provides the best energy efficiency. However, momentum considerations prevent jet aircraft from maintaining velocity while exceeding their exhaust jet speed. The engines of supersonic jet aircraft, {{such as those of}} fighters and SST aircraft (e.g. Concorde) almost always achieve the high exhaust speeds necessary for supersonic flight by using a CD nozzle despite weight and cost penalties; conversely, subsonic jet engines employ relatively low, subsonic, <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocities</b> and therefore employ simple convergent nozzle, or even bypass nozzles at even lower speeds.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{specific}} reaction energy per unit mass of reactants is key, low mean molecular {{weight in the}} reaction products is also important in practice in determining <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> This is because the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors.

This means low atomic mass elements are favoured. Liquid hydrogen (LH2) and oxygen (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.|$|R
