30|$|The {{documentation}} of disputes {{is a process}} through which courts use a series of forms to display disputes in the format appropriate for case files. Among these files, the “Form of Case-filing Approval” includes a case-filing date and a case-filing number, while “Notification of Admission of Cases” confirms plaintiffs’ lawsuit appeals and informs them of their rights and responsibilities. A subpoena and a case arrangement form both mark the trial date of a case. Through the packaging that occurs with the arrangement form, each dispute has a corresponding case file that includes some digital information, such as a case-filing number, a case-filing date, a trial date, a lawsuit appeal, an approval form, a notification, and a subpoena. Then a dispute is maintained digitally {{with the support of}} multiple legal documents. With such elegant packaging of case files, cases also obtain a date of production and an <b>inquiry</b> <b>number.</b> The production of case files displays disputes in a documentation format that has been through as many processes as a well-packaged wine. This concludes the formatting process.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{introduce}} Manuel DeLanda&# 039;s "assemblage theory" to psychology. Based on a select review of this theory, we argue that DeLanda&# 039;s work may allow for new ways of approaching unresolved problems in psychological inquiry, such as the realism-constructivism impasse, and disputes regarding linear and non-linear models of causality. DeLanda&# 039;s systematic treatment of the assemblage, using terms familiar to social scientists and analytic philosophers alike, offers a host of novel concepts and methods for the analysis of social, biological, and/or political systems, while also indicating how this analysis may be deployed in innovative social science <b>inquiry.</b> A <b>number</b> of psychologists have recently begun to explore the concept of assemblage. We add to these efforts in the present paper by assessing how DeLanda&# 039;s assemblage theory may open up a new "image of the psychological" to guide research and practice...|$|R
