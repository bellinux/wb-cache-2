Additionally, before the 1967/68 season, Arsenal only wore team badges on their shirts on special occasions, such as FA Cup Finals. The 1936 cup final was the fourth occasion such a badge was worn. Sheffield United also wore crested red and white shirts, their vertical stripe design.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is split}} into 20 sub-parts each given a title in English written mostly in white where {{a portion of}} the title is {{displayed}} <b>in</b> <b>red,</b> <b>and</b> each covers a single day. There are seven endings to the game: a single true end, two normal ends, and four bad ends. In the original game, a bonus role-playing game became available on the title screen after the game was completed at least once. This was later removed from the full-voice DVD edition of the game. There are scenes in Moon with sexual CGs depicting a given heroine having sex.|$|E

5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition. The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with the gesture of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> has been handed down since 1365.

Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, which corresponds to The Fellowship of the Ring {{and part of}} The Two Towers, Saruman is voiced by Fraser Kerr. He has only one major scene—his attempt to persuade Gandalf to join him. He appears again briefly before the battle of Helm's Deep, speaking to his army. The character is dressed <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> is called 'Saruman' and 'Aruman' at different points. Smith and Matthews suggest {{that the use of}} 'Aruman' was intended to avoid confusion with 'Sauron'. The 1980 Rankin/Bass TV animated version of The Return of the King begins roughly where Bakshi's film ends but does not include Saruman's character.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr is {{the fifth}} highest non-imperial office (eighth overall), coming after the megas doux and before the megas logothetes. Its {{insignia}} of office {{were similar to those}} of the megas doux, i.e. a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapoton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> gold and decorated with golden wire, with a portrait of the emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear. Only his staff of office (dikanikion) differed, with only the topmost carved knots in gold, and the rest in silver. The knobs in the staff remained gold, bordered with silver braid. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr retained some functions, mostly ceremonial, echoing his origin as a stable master: he carried the emperor's sword, he led the emperor's horse when he left the palace, although the actual responsibility for the emperor's horses now rested with the komēs tōn basilikōn hippōn ("count of the imperial horses"). In war, the prōtostratōr was responsible for the irregulars ("those who have neither order nor their own banner") and scouts who preceded the army.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's home colours are {{sky blue}} and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, {{in recent years}} several {{different}} colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but {{there is evidence that}} the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side. The red and black away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison, who believed that adopting the colours of A.C. Milan would inspire City to glory. Allison's theory worked, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup Final, 1970 League Cup Final and the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.|$|E

5|$|Scherzinger {{performed}} the {{song for the}} first time in Stratford, London at Westfield Stratford City on September 13, 2011. The performance was included in a set of multiple songs off of Killer Love, and was sung in order to celebrate the shopping centre's opening. Scherzinger began her performance with a fringed leather coat <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> black, the colours of the Westfield logo, a cutaway black bodycon dress and purple platform heels which she whipped off to reveal an even racier outfit underneath. She than wore a black leather number covered in tassels and chains. Scherzinger's performance was accompanied onstage by several dancers, whom were wearing shiny metallic trousers, as she performed in front of thousands of fans. The song was also performed in 2012 on her first solo tour, the Killer Love Tour.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after returning, Heather {{slips into}} a trance so John makes his excuses and quickly leaves.

Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> this time pursues it. He corners the elusive figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches it, believing it to be a child. Instead, it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf, and while John is frozen in terror the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. As the life drains from him, John realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own murder and funeral.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual rectangle untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle r1-by-r0, which we attempt to tile using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown <b>in</b> <b>red),</b> <b>and</b> 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).|$|E

5|$|The fort {{with seven}} gates {{contains}} several palaces, pavilions and many temples of Hindu and Jain religions - the earliest dated to the 16th century. A major {{feature of the}} fort is the stone carving done <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> gold coloured sandstones. The interiors of the palaces are decorated and painted in traditional Rajasthani style. The Junagarh palaces have {{a large number of}} rooms, as every king built his own separate set of rooms, not wanting to live in his predecessors’ rooms. These structures were considered as “at par with those of Louis’s France or of Imperial Russia”. Several types of architectural style are discerned in the fort complex and hence it is called a true depiction of composite culture. The earliest style is of Rajput architecture, defined by Gujarati and Mughal architectural influence reflecting the association with Mughal rulers, the second type is of semi-western architecture reflecting British influence, and finally the revivalists Rajput architecture that evolved particularly during the rule of Maharaja Ganga Singh. Only the most representative of all these architectural styles are on display for visitors. Thus, the unique monuments on display in the Junagarh Fort represent sixteen successive generations of the rulers of Bikaner, starting {{from the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Windows on {{the east}} façade are {{rectangular}} with eight windows at ground floor and five at first floor, all with gothic frames. On the south façade, the ground floor windows are taller with a number being two- and three-lighted and stone framed. A chamfered two-storey bay is located slightly {{to the right of}} centre. Windows on the first floor are simpler and less tall. The 1819 works also included the demolition and replacement of the north and west ranges and substantial rebuilding of the south range. The north range is built up <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> grey brick from the stone walls of the demolished range. The west range is surmounted by a 17th-century clock turret relocated from the south range when that was rebuilt. The bell is dated 1647.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E

5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds changed {{affiliates}} in 2005, {{welcoming the}} Milwaukee Brewers as their sixth different major league franchise. Coincidentally, the major/minor league sports connection between Nashville and Milwaukee was duplicated from 2005 to 2014, but with reverse roles, in ice hockey, as the Milwaukee Admirals were the top-level minor league affiliate of the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators. The Sounds also debuted a new oval-shaped logo {{with a baseball}} player silhouetted against a yellow background hitting a ball toward the Nashville skyline with the city's name written above within a red border and the team name written <b>in</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> black script below. The new Brewers affiliate was managed by Frank Kremblas and featured top prospects such as Rickie Weeks, Prince Fielder, Nelson Cruz, and Corey Hart. The affiliation started well as the club won the American Conference Northern Division title on the second-to-last {{day of the season}} with a 75–69 record. The team {{went on to win the}} American Conference title against the Oklahoma RedHawks, three games to two, before sweeping the Tacoma Rainiers in three straight games in the finals to win the 2005 Pacific Coast League championship. Outfielder Nelson Cruz clinched the title with a three-run home run with two outs in the 13th inning. This was Nashville's first title since their previous league crown in 1982 and their first championship as a Triple-A team.|$|E
