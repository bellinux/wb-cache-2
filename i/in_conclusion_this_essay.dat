40|$|This study {{examines}} four Filipino children’s books {{that deal with}} child sexual abuse. To evaluate the published works, studies by Bruno Bettelheim, Masha Rudman, and Howard Gardner on how stories and narratives for children can reinforce education, empowerment, and protection are used as guides. The four books aim to raise consciousness and provide a suitable strategy to solve the prevailing problem of child sexual abuse. The study shows the books’ significant attempts at educating children {{on how to deal}} with the problem through concrete solutions. These books delve into the sensitive subject of abuse while also instructing children on how to seek help from the authorities. The books introduce children to the touching rules, the concept of private parts of the body, and how to say no to malicious touching. The study also examines the weaknesses of the books like the superficial discussion of the subject matter, the convenient and quick resolution of the story, homophobia, sexism and stereotyping of sex offenders. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> analyzes the representation of the experience, the physical aspects of the text, and the distribution of these alternative publications for children...|$|E
40|$|C-paper Abstract Title: Fluidity and Solidity in Marilynne Robinson’s Housekeeping Author: Linda Lindqvist The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to show that}} {{fluidity}} and solidity constitute a central tension on all levels in Housekeeping, and how this tension leads to a choice of either a fluid or a solid lifestyle and view of the world. I focus on fluidity and solidity in gender roles, in memories, in dreams, in nature, and in different perceptions of reality. By taking a closer look at Ruth’s first-person narration (seeing fluidity as not resisting deformation, while solidity resists deformation), we find that the characters in Housekeeping have fluid and solid traits, but that there is no reality that allows mixed manifestations of these. This results in repression of either fluidity or solidity, which creates tension and feelings of loss. Ruth chooses a fluid lifestyle, thus her memories and dreams become mixed with her present, and this also leads her to become a transient, outside gender roles and traditional small town society. Transience in this novel questions all distinctions conventionally made between dream and reality; male and female. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> highlights how tension between fluidity and solidity is generated on all levels in Housekeeping, and how this leads to either fluid or solid lifestyles since the characters follow a cultural code that dictates a choice between them...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} context of {{constructing}} the Australian Curriculum: English and how it represents and responds to the diversity of students. It starts with the brief genealogy of neoliberal standards-based reforms {{as a way of}} managing differences. In doing so, the chapter situates the national agenda of curriculum reforms in the semiotic order of ‘risk societies’ (Beck, 1992) through which various risks are both manufactured and managed. The semiotic order of managing educational risks through reforms is presented as a discursive force-field that both creates ‘moral panics’ and provides solutions, thereby appealing to the broader public and securing its consent. This discussion prepares the ground for the reading of texts produced in the lead-up to the actual release of the national curriculum for English and statements about diversity in these documents {{as well as in the}} curriculum itself. The chapter then goes on to explore what might be possible in the process of the curriculum implementation, by drawing on ideas of hospitality, responsibility and dialogism. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> argues that no national curriculum can be successfully implemented unless it is sensitive to the textual and cultural practices of other groups and unless it wins their political consent. Equally, no national curriculum can be ethically implemented unless it recognises and responds to difference and unless it creates a possibility of transcending the logic of the Same. <br /...|$|E
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay,</b> I have {{demonstrated}} that while gynaecological laparoscopic surgery may entail {{a higher risk of}} death than staying at home, the risk is not unacceptably high compared to open surgery. New technological developments may reduce risk of such surgery; however, many of them have not been fully evaluated with proper trials to date. I have highlighted the crucial importance of recognising surgical complications at an early stage by a senior doctor in an expedient manner in order to avoid serious morbidity or mortality. It is becoming increasingly difficult to adequately inform patients fully about all risks of a specific procedure; however, national guidance from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists may help standardise information on risk given to patients in the future.|$|R
40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Publicitat i Relacions Públiques. Codi: PU 0932. Curs 2014 - 2015 Social {{media is}} still a really recent and quite unknown {{communication}} channel. It can affect people’s global image, {{and in terms of}} the music industry, it is a perfect channel to complete a promotion campaign. Surveys and metrics have supported the main assumption, in a non-totally defined way, social media helps to complete the image people have of musicians. Music industry has been dealing with some issues, due to the birth of internet and the peer-to-peer platforms. These fact has caused much harm in the musical businesses and the reinvention has been unavoidable, companies, such as Spotify have born to save it. On the other hand, internet has also made musicians more exposed to the public opinion. That’s why a good management can improve their image, complementing their offline exposure. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion</b> of <b>this</b> <b>essay,</b> and supported by people’s opinion in the surveys, musicians who add value and are active users on social network, are more likely to change their image for the better, and that may be reflected in the sales of their work...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis essay explores {{selected}} Indian characters {{depicted in}} Mulk Raj Anand's Untouchable (1935) and Kiran Desai's The Inheritance of Loss (2006). This study finds that these characters {{are struggling with}} an identity dilemma which induces their inner-conflicts: double-consciousness, resistance and othering, due to {{the dominance of the}} caste and colonial systems. This study observes that both of these hegemonic influences have created the privileged and less-privileged status of the Indian individuals, which have concealed their true natures. Thus, these Indian individuals are confined and recognised through their essentialised identity, as connoted by the caste and colonial systems. Therefore, the objective of <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> is to de-contextualise the selected characters from their essentialised identity, exposing their true nature without the influence of their privileged and less-privileged status. To achieve the targeted objective, <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> discusses the identity dilemma of the selected characters through a Strategic Essentialist reading, a term coined by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1987). This is to detach the Indian individuals from their identity which is defined and structured by the caste system which segregates them under the formation of social hierarchy, as well as detaching them from their post-colonial condition. <b>In</b> the <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> discloses the ability of the term Strategic Essentialism to unveil the disguised nature of the privileged members and the hidden nature of the less-privileged members, conveying their identity dilemma which fails their assimilation in their own homeland and foreign land...|$|R
40|$|The Emancipation of Celie: The Color Purple as a womanist Bildungsroman The {{purpose of}} this essay is to study The Color Purple as a Bildungsroman, {{focusing}} {{on the development of}} the protagonist, Celie. The Color Purple is related to both the traditional Bildungsroman and to the female Bildungsroman, but the essay shows that it can also be seen as a womanist Bildungsroman. Initially, Celie believes that being a woman inescapably means that she has to serve and obey men and she is oppressed by patriarchy. She is eventually introduced to another way of living by the strong female characters of Sofia and Shug who embrace her in a kind of sisterhood, which is vital for Celie as she has nothing else to help her liberate herself from the patriarchal values that keep her down. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> shows how Celie has developed from being a young girl, forced to act in an adult way, into a woman who displays signs of all the criteria for having achieved a womanist development: she is grown up (not just acting as though she is), she is in charge of a business, a house and, in short, her life. She is serious, she has a universalist perspective, and most importantly, she loves. Furthermore, the essay highlights which characteristics of her development can be linked to the traditional and the female Bildungsroman and which characteristics can be seen as typical of a womanist Bildungsroman...|$|E
40|$|The {{introductory}} personal remarks {{refer to}} my motivations for choosing research projects, and for moving from physics to molecular biology {{and then to}} development, with Hydra as a model system. Historically, Trembley’s discovery of Hydra regeneration in 1744 was the begin¬ning of developmental biology as we understand it, with passionate debates about preformation versus de novo generation, mechanisms versus organisms. In fact, seemingly conflicting bottom-up and top-down concepts are both required in combination to understand development. In modern terms, this means analysing the molecules involved, as well as searching for physical principles underlying development within systems of molecules, cells and tissues. During the last decade, molecular biology has provided surprising and impressive evidence that {{the same types of}} mol¬ecules and molecular systems are involved in pattern formation {{in a wide range of}} organisms, including coelenterates like Hydra, and thus appear to have been “invented” early in evolution. Likewise, the features of certain systems, especially those of developmental regulation, are found in many different organisms. This includes the generation of spatial structures by the interplay of self-enhancing activation and “lateral” inhibitory effects of wider range, which is a main topic of my essay. Hydra regeneration is a particularly clear model for the formation of defined patterns within initially near-uniform tissues. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> emphasizes the analysis of development in terms of physical laws, including the application of mathematics, and insists that Hydra was, and will continue to be, a rewarding model for understanding general features of embryogenesis and regeneration...|$|E
40|$|A Queer Reading of Charles Bukowskiʼs Women and Love is a dog {{from hell}} This thesis {{aims to examine}} how the {{representation}} of gender is portrayed in relation to sex and power in Charles Bukowski’s novel Women and poetry collection Love is a dog from hell. The theoretical frame of the analysis is based on Judith Butlerʼs queer theory regarding the heterosexual matrix and gender performativity. The analysis consists of a textual comparison where a specific selection of poems is analysed parallel to the novel {{to see how they}} interact and how they oppose each other, through a queer reading. The analysis is divided in three parts where the first one discusses the construction of masculinity in Charles Bukowskiʼs protagonist Henry Chinaski and how this is presented differently in the two literary genres. The second part reveals how sex is presented in relation to power and how active and passive women are considered as sexually acceptable. The final part of the analysis discusses how women are portrayed in the novel and in the poetry. Further it demonstrates the consequences for women who do not act as expected in relation to their gender roles. In addition to this, the thesis investigates how the poetry functions as a tool to apply depth to the characters in the novel. It also points out how the sexual relationships work as a way of maintaining the masculine superiority over women. The repetitive way in which the protagonist fails to fulfil his sexual performance points towards an image of Chinaski as queer, something that previous scholarship has failed to notice. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> shows how a queer reading can work as an instrument to read a text that is generally interpreted as heteronormative, macho and misogynistic. The queer reading in the thesis demonstrates a different interpretation of predetermined gender roles in two of Bukowski’s literary works...|$|E

Our primary question formulation is: ”Which are the significant features of the youth’s internet language on a morphological, lexical, syntactical and orthographical level?” In order to answer this question we have analyzed 45 text ex-amples which is brought from two different internet forums, Bilddagboken. se and Un-gdomar. se, forums which are widely used by youths. The analysis has been made on a morphological, lexical, orthographical and syntactical level.

40|$|Images are {{powerful}} means of communicating scientific results; a strong image can underscore an experimental result {{more effectively than}} any words, whereas a poor image can readily undermine a result or conclusion. Developmental biologists rely extensively on images to compare normal versus abnormal development and communicate their results.

To meet this need, we developed a series of image portfolio assignments and imaging workshops in our Developmental Biology course {{to encourage students to}} develop communi-cation skills using images.

40|$|For {{years the}} {{northern}} parts of Sweden, Norrland (translated: North land) {{has been considered}} mystified and exotified by the southern, more urban parts of the country. The rural Norrland – though 60 percent of Sweden – is seldom {{a part of the}} common conversation, meaning {{that most of the people}} living in the southern parts simply have no idea what is happening in the north. The one million people living in Norrland, on the other hand, every day gets to know what happens in the south on the evening news. The question about this possible structural relation between the urban and the rural became a large matter of cultural debate in the spring of 2015, If this thesis is true, we have a problem on our hands; can the national news be considered national if half the country is misrepresented? That question is what this essay is trying to find out by analyzing two of Swedens largest national newspapers. This essay has, with critical discourse analyzis as method, read articles from the largest daily newspaper in Sweden, Dagens Nyheter, and the largest tabloid in Sweden, Aftonbladet. The articles all refer to the county of Jämtland – one of the counties in Norrland – in some way. The conclusions are grounded in medial theories such as the agenda setting-theory, theorys of priming and framing and new values. Recent research regarding areas in medial periphery and the social construction of Norrland also supports the final conclusions. In reading the articles found from 1994, 2004 and 2014 it has come clear that the language being used by the press can be considered producing and reproducing hierarchies between the north and the south. For instance, the three by this essay presented discourse themes – “the village”, “the nature” and “the people” – can be interpreted as three existing, and co-existing, discourse themes producing and reproducing an image of Norrland as inferior to the rest of the country. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> states that the press examined actually takes part in constructing a structural relation between the urban and the rural areas of Sweden and that the county of Jämtland is being presented as a distant ”internal other” in comparison with the normal cities in the south of Sweden. ...|$|E
40|$|This Essay {{will first}} review and then analyze the {{characteristics}} of each of three possible routes of convergence in light of three features. The first is stability and predictability of the legal environment. It is the main benefit that private investors look for before investing in a country. The second is the scope of influence and lobbying of interest groups. This feature is extracted from {{an analysis of the}} adoption of uniform laws proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (2 ̆ 2 NCCUSL 2 ̆ 2) by Professors Ribstein and Kobayashi. These authors find evidence of enactment by states of NCCUSL 2 ̆ 7 s proposals despite a cost-benefit analysis suggesting that these proposals are not efficient. This inefficiency results from the influence of interest groups and NCCUSL 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on ill-informed generalists. The third feature is the respect for, or promotion of, public interest considerations. This analysis may reveal a tension between the economic efficiency and the social desirability of these routes, between market-driven policy and public interest concerns. This tension plays out in different ways. The more commonly addressed conflicts of interests are between public players and private investors; between (1) the interests of the host country in obtaining adequate financial and technical safeguards and assurances from the private participants that the project will be carried out safely, on time, and in the public interest and (2) the interests of private participants in limiting the type and number of guarantees that they give. The less explored tension addresses the respect for standards, such as human rights standards, that the host country itself may be reluctant to promote, but that affect private investment in terms of reputation or expense. This Essay disregards the tension between economic efficiency and social desirability, and rather focuses on the goal of reconciling private and public interest concerns. It will seek to determine whether one of these routes is better than the others, or whether a combination of the three {{is the best way to}} achieve convergence in international project finance. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>Essay</b> will show that all three routes to convergence are necessary to both foster and control international project finance. The twin goals of balancing private and public interests are best fulfilled at the international level, since this level can generate clear, balanced, and uniform rules by promulgating a suitable model law yet to be prepared. State initiative is then required to enact these rules and adapt them to domestic specificities. The establishment of a legal framework at the state level should be general and flexible enough not to suffocate private initiative since the latter brings innovation and evolution of norms in project finance. No one route can therefore be preferred over any other. If one is used alone, it is more likely to be inefficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} that is seen in schools is that {{teachers}} sometimes don not reflect {{on what kind of}} pupils they have in the class and therefore do not adapt their way of communicate, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings from the pupils side. In <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> I have study a teacher’s way to communicate with her pupils depending of what kind of class she has. The main question is How the dialogue between teacher and pupils looks like, and after that there are two more questions that are answered.

A solution to keep the compensation level constant is to make individuals retire later from the labor force. In order to understand what actions need to be implemented, {{there is a need}} of more knowledge about the characteristics of individuals who chose to remain in the labor force after the normal age of retirement. <b>This</b> <b>essay</b> investigates how senior workers’ that are above the normal retirement age responds to {{an increase of}} non-labor income and how it affects labor supply. The results show that around 66 % of individuals will continue to work to the same extent, around 15 % will choose to reduce hours of work, and near 19 % will chose to retire. Also the results show that a person that will not change anything in hours of work after an increase in non-labor income will most likely be a male that is self-employed, who really likes his job and has a postgraduate degree. One <b>conclusion</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> is that to only focus on compensation levels in different social insurance systems to increase senior workers’ labor force participation will not be as effective as if also focus would be on social norms and cultural beliefs to increase engagement towards work. ...|$|R

The <b>conclusions</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> are that the problematic aspects dealt with features, such as unwillingness to speak as well as that the students did not understand the learning materials and that the teacher was not supportive. The solutions for these problems dealt mostly with triggering motivation by presenting problem-solving tasks, working with interaction and metacognition and planning the tasks in accordance with the students’ zone of proximal development. Furthermore, the teacher should work as a guide in the classroom to help the students along the way.

40|$|<b>This</b> is an <b>essay</b> {{about the}} textual idiosyncrasies of London, Lincoln's Inn MS 150 (L). The scribal {{interference}} with the texts transmitted by L provides a fascinating insight into their intended use, {{as well as their}} appeal and interest for a particular early fifteenth-century readership. Contrary to previous editors and literary critics, who have inevitably dismissed the texts transmitted by L as 'bad' and 'corrupt', our goal is to demonstrate that they are of intense and compelling interest and value for literary, cultural, and manuscript studies. The manuscript presents an early, self-conscious, and focused response to the A text of Piers Plowman Piers Plowman: see Langland, William. and to the series of romances it contains. Furthermore, it is our particular contention that the nature of the revisions would have enhanced the impact of these texts for a listening audience. The theme and direction of the revisions [...] which highlight dialogues and turn-taking; introduce facial expressions, gestures, and movements; emphasize visual cues; elaborate comic episodes; and enhance the auditory effects of the language [...] suggest a consistent interest in the dramatic features of these texts. Added to this is the (previously unnoticed) sequence of marginal annotations by the scribescribe (skrīb), Jewish scholar and teacher (called in Hebrew, Soferim) of law as based upon the Old Testament and accumulated traditions. The work of the scribes laid the basis for the Oral Law, as distinct from the Written Law of the Torah that appear directly to mark up the written text of Merlyn for use in performance. This combination of features strongly suggests the possibility that the scribe was preparing these texts for reading aloud and was interested in their potential for animated oral presentation. As such, our findings offer a positive and constructive response to David Benson's recent suggestion regarding Piers Plowman that 'In light of the many dialogues in the poem, perhaps we should look more closely at the surviving manuscripts (and the text itself) for indications of oral performance'. (1) The implications of this hypothesis are discussed <b>in</b> the <b>conclusions</b> to <b>this</b> <b>essay...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gaston Bachelard’s incursions {{into the}} beaten tracks of image {{creation}} inaugurate a new conception of imagination. By departing from {{a criticism of}} what is called reproductive imagination, which is based on the contemplation of things, he shows instead that true imagination is creative because it instantiates a surreal world. The purpose of this work is to understand the process of image production, as well as the creative act inherent to imagination. In order to accomplish this, we revisit the notion of ‘material imagination’, which we consider an essential pressuposition in the more poetic side of Bachelard. Even though {{it is well known that}} Bachelard privileges poetry and literature over other art forms, we turn our attention to the philosophical texts in which he talks about the plastic arts, such as painting and sculpture, in order to demonstrate the salutary action of the dreams of the will on the subject, as well as the importance of the manual work of the artist which has been made dynamic by his creative work. Our study will take the analysis of the work of Eduardo Chillida made by Bachelard, in order to show in what sense a sculptor, who becomes a metalworker, succeeds at plunging into the dreams of iron and, by perceiving the metal propagating its force, creates artistic works which present themselves as materialized echoes of the beating of the hammer on iron. It will become obvious <b>in</b> the <b>conclusion</b> of <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> that true imagination cannot simply be a copy of reality. By distancing itself from sensible reality, the artist’s imagination succeeds in constructing images that are fundamentally material ones. On their turn, these make possible for the artist to surpass, by means of a struggle between his hands and the matter of the world, the level of everyday life, thus reaching out to what can be taken as a true aesthetic revolution. </p...|$|R

The main part of this work {{is focused on the}} era called “The Folk Music Vogue”, which was the era when my informants were in the limelight on the Swedish fiddler scene of the 70 s. Our music culture is constantly lying under the change of progress and I find it interesting to reflect how these kinds of changes are affecting the role of the musician. In <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> I am reflecting on the different perspectives of the musicianship according to my informants and how they both are referring to their role as musicians. The purpose is further on to see how they have been relating to the change of progress on the field of the Swedish folk music during the 70 s and up to this date. Throughout interviews with the informants I am analyzing their personal relationship to their life as folk musicians. I am focusing on their personal relationship to the Swedish folk music climate of today, {{as well as to the}} Folk Music Vogue of the 70 s. The essay also focuses on the interpretation of traditional folk tunes, which leads us further on into the folk music tradition itself. During the 70 s there was a young generation of fiddlers, which my informants was a strong part of, who was questioning the old values of the traditional folk music. With new kinds of perspectives and with different values this young generation changed the values in the tradition and through this, the folk musical climate became more open minded than before. One of my main <b>conclusions</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> is that my informants have been changing their relationship to the style of folk music as well as to the field of folk music. They have been changing their point of view, and these changes is mainly a result of the developments that have occurred in the style and on the field of folk music, after the era of the Folk Music Vogue, and further on up to this very date. These changes have also been affecting their personal relationship to their own musicianship. The history chapter of <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> will give the reader relevant information about the Swedish folk music history.

40|$|Interpretativne izjave uz međunarodne ugovore u praksi je katkad teško razlikovati od rezervi uz međunarodne ugovore, pa se te dvije vrste jednostranih akata često miješaju, a nerijetko i izjednačavaju. Premda korištenje interpretativnih izjava kod sklapanja međunarodnih ugovora nije novina, one, za razliku od rezervi, nisu uređene bečkom kodifikacijom prava međunarodnih ugovora. Stoga se s pravom očekivalo da će Komisija Ujedinjenih naroda za međunarodno pravo u Vodiču za praksu glede rezervi uz međunarodne ugovore, koji je usvojen 2011. nakon dugogodišnjeg rada na toj temi, dati jasne smjernice za razlikovanje interpretativnih izjava i rezervi te utvrditi eventualno postojeća specifična pravna pravila. S tih polazišta se u ovom radu, u svjetlu rješenja koja donosi Komisijin Vodič za praksu, najprije analizira pravna priroda i pojam interpretativne izjave u usporedbi s rezervom, a zatim se naznačuju temeljne odrednice mogućeg pravnog režima za interpretativne izjave. In 2011, {{after many}} years of work and study, the International Law Commission (ILC) adopted the {{comprehensive}} Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties. This paper aims to revisit the issue of interpretative declarations to treaties {{in the light of the}} relevant guidelines contained in the Guide to Practice. Although interpretative declarations have been used by states in treaty practice for a long time, the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) remained entirely silent on the matter. On the other hand, a fair number of the VCLT’s provisions were dedicated to reservations, with which interpretative declarations are often confounded. In the first part the VCLT’s definition of reservations is analysed and used as a point of reference for the ensuing discussion on the legal nature of interpretative declarations. In that respect, the definition of interpretative declarations as enunciated in the ILC’s Guide to Practice is of particular interest. Thereafter, the most important aspects of the legal regime for interpretative declarations, as propounded by the ILC, are tackled in some detail. Thus, the specific notion of “conditional interpretative declarations” is explained, whose regime, according to the ILC, is to be assimilated to the one in place for reservations. Conversely, “simple interpretative declarations”, considering that they constitute a proposed interpretation of a treaty, albeit a unilateral one, should essentially be subject to the VCLT’s rules regarding the interpretation of treaties. Given that states, for various reasons, often use the concept of interpretative declarations in order to disguise statements, which in fact amount to reservations, special attention is devoted to the method of determining the distinction between reservations and interpretative declarations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> {{is to examine}} how public {{libraries}} work with children's books, in other languages thanSwedish, regarding acquisitions. The purpose is also to describe what the libraries assignments are in regard tochildren with non-Swedish backgrounds. This is then put in a relation to the libraries democratic assignment. The main questions are: What are the libraries' assignments, {{as described in the}} libraries regulations? How do thelibraries work to fulfil their assignments? To answer these questions a survey in two parts has been carried out. The first is a study of the libraries'regulations, and various handbooks that serve as an inspiration for librarians. The other is a qualitative interviewsurvey which took place at three libraries in Uppsala and one in Märsta. The survey of the documents shows that the libraries are expected to give special attention to the needs ofchildren with non-Swedish backgrounds. Among other things, this means keeping a varied book stock of goodquality, on all the different languages represented in the area. In Sweden, the leading supplier of media servicesserving libraries, are BTJ. The libraries in the survey turn to BTJ's selection when acquiring books. The librarians however find BTJ's selection of books limited and non-satisfactory when it comes to children's booksin other languages than Swedish. On account of this, the librarians are forced to turn to alternative solutions. The alternative channels for acquisitions they mention are the children's bookshop Bokspindeln in Stockholm,retailers who visit the libraries, and acquisitions during their own travels abroad. The International Library in Stockholm is a valuable resource, in administering book deposits to the local libraries and aiding them withadvice regarding acqusitions. The essay's theoretical frames are built upon three main concepts: identity, ethnicity and language. The theories discussed, suggest that a person's language and ethnicity is of great importance when it comes to theperson's process of forming an identity. The identity is continuously constructed in the interaction and dialoguewith others. The libraries can play an important role for this process, as a source of language and culture. Furthermore, the survey notices the libraries' role as a democratic force in society. The libraries areexpected to act {{in order to maintain the}} human rights. The libraries can serve as an open room for democraticdiscussions. The libraries should offer everyone free and unlimited access to knowledge, thoughts, culture andinformation. They can also contribute to increasing the status of minority languages and stress the value ofmultilingualism. The libraries are also seen as a place where cultural exchange is possible, which is meant tohelp create a base for greater understanding and openness towards different cultures in the minds of the people. The main <b>conclusion</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> regards whether the libraries can or cannot do enough to fulfill theirassignments. The main source for acquisitions mentioned, BTJ, being the leading supplier of media services tolibraries, does not seem to have enough resources to serve the libraries in a satisfying way, when it comes tochildren's books on other languages than Swedish. Whether the libraries can meet the special needs ofmultilingual children, is therefore a question of the librarians own resourcefulness and networking...|$|R

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>essay</b> is a {{critical}} synthesis of recent researches in the sociology of organizations. While inspired by neo-institutionalism, they have made some propositions to overcome some of its limits and flaws, {{in order to be}} able to apprehend simultaneously change and reproduction processes. On one hand, organizational fields tend to be considered as more ambiguous and heterogeneous than in the seminal texts of neo-institutionalism and, on the other hand, these works have tried to “bring actors back in” their analyses, and especially the role of change entrepreneurs. Some of their conclusions remind of “old” institutionalism’s ones; however, their conceptualizations of power and meso order are less robust than in the seminal texts of organizational sociology. As a <b>conclusion,</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> calls for studies that would identify and specify the social mechanisms that may explain the sources of power and reflexivity, as well as their uneven distribution in the social spaces...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{establish}} whether In Cold Blood could {{be considered to be}} the true account Truman Capote intended it to be. Capote spent many years researching the murder in Kansas with the aim of writing a news story in the style of fiction. Even so, <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> argues {{that it is not a}} completely true account. In order to reach a <b>conclusion</b> <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> studies the concept of new journalism and answers the following questions: •What are the problems of depicting reality in writing? •What narrative techniques are found in In Cold Blood? •Is In Cold Blood subjective or objective in its portrayal of the story and its characters? The conclusion also shows that In Cold Blood is too manipulated and subjective in order to be seen as a completely true account that can be read as a news story. It is merely one view of the murder and In Cold Blood is therefore best read as a fiction novel...|$|R

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>essay</b> {{is about}} sexual {{interaction}} and fondness between individuals in different Western and Eastern civilizations from Antiquity to Contemporaneity. It has aimed {{to describe and}} articulate some elements which would describe the ways interaction, in terms of affection, and the ways which sexuality are displayed and expressed among people throughout different historical times. Also, <b>this</b> <b>essay</b> intended to underline the expression of these sexual and interactional ways according to cultural, societal and political influences upon the subjectivity of the contemporary individuals.
