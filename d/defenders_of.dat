5|$|Courbet and Paris {{formed a}} Fifth Squadron at the {{beginning}} of the war. They were transferred to the Atlantic to continue their training duties without interference. Both ships were ordered restored to operational status on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and their light anti-aircraft outfits were augmented at Cherbourg. Courbet was ordered to provide gunfire support to the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Cherbourg against the advancing 7th Panzer Division and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies while Paris supported the <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Le Havre. Lack of spotting aircraft meant that neither ship was particularly effective in that role.|$|E

5|$|<b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> Ardania is {{a hybrid}} tower defense and {{real-time}} strategy video {{game for the}} Windows PC, iOS, Xbox Live Arcade, and PlayStation Network. It was developed by Most Wanted Entertainment and published by Deep Silver and Paradox Interactive. The game was released December 6, 2011 for the iOS and on March 14, 2012 on all other platforms. <b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> Ardania has an ESRB rating of Teen, a PEGI rating of 12, and a USK rating of 12. The game's iOS release was well received by some critics and poorly received by others. A subsequent release on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 was significantly less well received.|$|E
5|$|<b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> Ardania is a tower defense {{game that}} also has {{offensive}} real-time strategy elements. As with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building {{several types of}} static tower units that fire at weak offensive units spawned by the opponent. In <b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> Ardania, however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player. The game is won if units spawned by the player get past the opponent's towers and destroy the opponent's base before the opponent's units get past the player's towers and destroy the player's base.|$|E

A temporary pacification of relations followed in the early 17th century, when the many wars fought by the Commonwealth necessitated greater involvement by registered Cossacks.

5|$|The German {{breakthrough}} at Sedan, {{which had}} been thought impassable, meant that <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> the K-W Line risked being outflanked, and had to withdraw on 16 May.

By 11 May, the roads leading westwards, away from the fighting, were blocked by refugees, hampering the eastward advance of French and British forces. It is estimated that around two million civilians fled their homes during the campaign.|$|E

Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active in this campaign, capturing a second French frigate, Niémen, at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E
