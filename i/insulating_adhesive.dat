Insulating SU- 8 micro-patterns created on a transparent indium tin oxide electrode by photolithography allowed for the local control over the electrochemical dissolution of polyelectrolyte mono- and multilayers, with polyelectrolytes shielded from the electrochemical treatment by the underlying photoresist stencil. The platform allowed {{for the creation of}} micro-patterned cell co-cultures through the electrochemical removal of a non-fouling polyelectrolyte coating and the localized adsorption of a cell adhesive one after attachment of the first cell population. In addition, the use of weak adhesive polyelectrolyte coatings on the photoresist domains allowed for the detachment of a contiguous heterotypic cell sheet upon electrochemical trigger. Cells grown on the ITO domains peeled off upon electrochemical dissolution of the sacrificial polyelectrolyte substrate, whereas adjacent cell areas on the <b>insulated</b> weakly <b>adhesive</b> substrate easily detached through the contractile force generated by neighboring cells.

40|$|Laser {{technique}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important for space applications. Complex laser systems are used both for earth observation and for planetary exploration. For long-term operation optical components have to satisfy high requirements concerning precision and reliability. Before being used in space all optical components have to be tested extensively. For standardized determination of laser damage threshold ISO 21254 should be applied. For characterization of optics for space applications corresponding tests should be performed under vacuum conditions. But beside laser damage threshold a different topic should be noted: laser-induced molecular contamination (LIMC). LIMC denotes the interaction of laser radiation, especially in case of high fluences and short wavelengths with volatile molecules and the resulting formation of deposits on optical components. LIMC proved to be particular critical, if the laser system is operated under vacuum conditions and could considerably reduce the functionality of the whole laser system. It {{should be noted that}} LIMC is primarily induced by molecular and to a much lesser extent by particle contamination. Particle contamination and its impacts on performance are described in ISO 14644 - 9 : 2012. Molecular contamination is mainly caused by organic materials and silicones, e. g. glues, <b>adhesives,</b> <b>insulating</b> material, or circuit boards due to stronger outgassing rates compared to inorganic materials. The outgassing can be reduced but not totally prevented by selection of suitable materials and preconditioning e. g. bake-out at elevated temperature well above the planned operating temperature. The outgassing behavior of materials is generally characterized by the parameters CVCM (collected volatile condensable material), TML (total mass loss), RML (recovered mass loss), VCM (volatile condensable material) and WVR (water vapour regained). Definitions and corresponding measuring specifications for these quantities can be found in ECSS-Standard Q-ST- 70 - 02 C, ASTM-E 595 - 07 and ASTM-E 1559. This document outlines the test procedure for investigations of laser-induced molecular contamination in order to compare the growth of laser induced depositions on optical surfaces for different molecular contamination materials...|$|R
40|$|Rail joints {{have been}} in {{existence}} {{for a long time}} of which their design has remained primarily unchanged over this period. Rail joints are a typical example of bolted joints. Like other bolted joints, their integrity depends on the quantitative representation of the contact pressure distribution at the interface during design. In service, rail joints are subjected to complex operating stresses, and they demand high maintenance cost because they are safety critical and have the lowest service life of the components on the rail tracks. In this study, non-intrusive ultrasonic techniques have been employed to investigate the parameter relevant to their design, operation and condition monitoring. The effect of variation in plate thickness and diameter of the bearing surface of the bolt head on the contact pressure distribution at bolted interfaces under varying axial loads was investigated. While it was observed that the contact pressure at the interface increases as the applied load increases, the distance {{from the edge of the}} bolt hole at which the distribution becomes stable is independent of the applied load on the bolted joint. However, the contact pressure distribution was observed to vary with the plate thickness. Although the variation in the peak value of average contact pressure distribution in bolted joints does not depend on the plate thickness, the distance from the edge of bolt hole at which the value of the distribution becomes stable increases as the plate thickness is increased. It was revealed that the peak value of the contact pressure distribution decreases as bearing diameter of the bolt head increases, and that the distance at which the normalised average contact pressure distributions become fairly constant also increases as the bearing diameter of the bolt head increases. In the majority of the cases, the distance falls between 3 and 4 of the bolt radius from the edge of the bolt hole. It was also observed that the edge of the bolt head has a pronounced effect on the position of the peak value of the contact pressure distribution at the interface. Furthermore, a model based on a Weibull distribution has been proposed to fit the experimental data, and a good correlation was observed. Non-intrusive experimental techniques were simultaneously used to investigate the relaxation of contact pressure and loosening of bolted joints subjected to cyclic shear loading. Three critical areas: the contact interface of bolted component, the bolt length and the rotation of the bolt head, were monitored during loosening of the joints. The results show that loosening of bolted joints can be grouped into four stages. The early stage of the loosening of bolted joints is characterised by cyclic strain ratcheting- loosening of the bolted joint during vibration without rotation of the bolt head. The higher the rate of relaxation at this early stage the lower is the resistance of the bolted joint to vibration induced loosening of bolted joints. Furthermore, the rate of loosening at the bolted joint interface is not the same but increases away from the bolt hole. While the rate of loosening of bolted joints largely depends on the amplitude and the number of cycles of the applied dynamic shear load, it is independent of the frequency of the applied load. In addition, increasing the bolt torque was found to increase the loosening resistance of the bolted joint. When joints are subjected to a constant shear load in addition to the dynamic shear load, the loosening rate increase, and this rate depend on the magnitude of this constant shear load. A normal incidence pulse-echo ultrasonic technique was used to monitor de-bonding at the interface of <b>adhesive</b> bonded <b>insulated</b> lap joints and insulated block joints, subjected to a shear load induced failure. The results revealed that the insulated joint exhibited elastic behaviour before a sudden failure (rupture) of the joint. The de-bonding of adhesive/insulating layer on the web sides of IBJs was found to occur earlier than at any other parts of the joint when the applied load was only a fraction of the peak of the shear load. However, the de-bonding at the top and foot of the rail occurred almost at the peak of the shear load. This same technique was used to monitor the degradation, and eventual failure of IBJs subjected to cyclic shear loading. The results showed that the degradation of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>insulating</b> layer has commenced, and was in progress when the joint was virtually intact and displayed elastic behaviours. The failure at the adhesive interface is indicated by a sudden change in the value of the measured reflection coefficient. After this, the failure of the joint is preceded by plastic behaviour of the joint. In addition, the change in the length of the bolts can also be monitored directly, as a complete failure at the interface of the bolted joints can be highlighted before the failure occurred. The results of this study have shown that, with further development, ultrasound can be used to monitor the condition of IBJs while in service...|$|R
