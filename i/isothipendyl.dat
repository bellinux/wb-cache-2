50|$|<b>Isothipendyl</b> is a 1st {{generation}} H1 antagonist (antihistamine) and anticholinergic {{used as an}} antipruritic. It is nowadays scarcely used in the 1st line {{relief of}} allergies due to the anticholinergic side effect of somnolence but does have some limited use through topical application in the relief of insect bites and related itching (pruritus).|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{fast and}} precise reverse phase {{high-performance}} liq. chromatog. method (RP-HPLC) {{has been developed}} for the detn. of pipazethate hydrochloride (PPH) and thioproperazine mesylate (TPPM) in pure and in dosage forms. A Bondclone C 18 contg. ODS column with mobile phase of methanol:water (60 : 40) and <b>isothipendyl</b> hydrochloride as internal std. were used. The flow rate was 1 ml/min and effluent was monitored at 276 and 265 nm for PPH and TPPM, resp. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{complexes}} of palladium with diphenylpyraline (DPH) and <b>isothipendyl</b> (IPH) of the formulae [Pd(DPH) 2 Cl 2] and [Pd(IPH) Cl 2] {{have been}} synthesised and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, NMR, electronic, magnetic susceptibility, TGA and XRD data. The IR data suggests that while DPH acts as monodentate ligand, IPH acts as bidentate ligand. On {{the basis of}} spectral data, a square planar structure is proposed. These complexes {{are found to be}} more potent as antibacterial and antifungal agents that the free ligands...|$|E
40|$|A new {{spectrophotometric}} method for the detn. of <b>isothipendyl</b> hydrochloride (Andantol), {{based on its}} color reaction with ferric chloride, is reported. Effects of time, temp. and reagent concn. have been investigated. Beer's law range and optimum range for effective spectrophotometric detn. have also been evaluated. A study {{of the effect of}} the commonly assocd. excipients revealed that they did not cause interference. The new method has been applied for the assay of Andantol in pure and dosage forms. Results of the present method are comparable with those of official method. The new method offers the advantages of simplicity and rapidity. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|New {{complexes}} of Mn(II), Cr(III), UO 2 (VI), Zn(II) and Cd(II) with <b>isothipendyl</b> hydrochloride (IPH. HCl) {{were prepared}} and their structures {{were determined by}} elemental analyses, IR, H- 1 NMR and reflectance spectra as well as magnetic susceptibility and conductivity measurements. The spectral data suggest the bidentate nature of IPH in the complexes. An octahedral structure is proposed for the Mn(II), Cr(III) and UO 2 (VI) complexes, while a tetrahedral structure is suggested for the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes. Thermal studies (TGA/DTA) {{have been used to}} evaluate kinetic properties such as order of thermal reaction (n) and activation energy (Ea). The results of the antibacterial activity studies show that the complexes strongly inhibit Eschearichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella...|$|E
40|$|Thin-layer chromatog. {{systems of}} silica gel sprayed with 0. 1 N NaOH, dried and run {{using one of}} the {{following}} solvents: chloroform-methanol (9 : 1), chloroform-Et acetate (7 : 2), cyclohexane-benzene-diethylamine (50 : 40 : 10), acetone, or a combination of these, have been developed for the identification of phenothiazine drug substances and formulations. The method has been applied to phenothiazine drugs such as triflupromazine hydrochloride, prochlorperazine maleate, pipazethate hydrochloride, fluphenazine hydrochloride and <b>isothipendyl</b> hydrochloride. It has also been applied to pharmaceutical formulations such as Siquil, Stemetil and Selvigon. The RF values of ref. compds. and test compds. have been ascertained and the graphically cor. RF values have been measured. The method is simple and rapid for the identification of phenothiazine drug substances and formulations. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} <b>isothipendyl</b> hydrochloride (IPH) was investigated at bare and multiwalled-carbon-nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode (MWCNT-GCE). IPH (55 [*]μM) showed two oxidation peaks in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer of pH 7. 0. The oxidation process of IPH was observed to be irreversible over the pH range of 2. 5 – 9. 0. The influence of pH, scan rate, and {{concentration of the}} drug on anodic peak was studied. A differential pulse voltammetric method with good precision and accuracy was developed for the determination of IPH in pure and biological fluids. The peak current {{was found to be}} linearly dependent on the concentration of IPH in the range of 1. 25 – 55 [*]μM. The values of limit of detection and limit of quantification were noticed to be 0. 284 and 0. 949 [*]μM, respectively...|$|E
