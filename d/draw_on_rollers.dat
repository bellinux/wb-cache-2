50|$|This {{cross of}} Gaspé was {{commissioned}} {{by the federal government}} at a cost of $7,000 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the French explorer Jacques Cartier in the Bay of Gaspé on July 24, 1534. It was unveiled on August 25, 1934.The cross was carved in 1934 from a single block of gray granite, extracted from the Auguste Dumas quarry in Rivière-à-Pierre, Quebec. The cross weighs more than 42 tons and was transported to Quebec City on two cars by rail from Rivière-à-Pierre. The cross was then carried on a coaster to the Gaspé dock. From the dock, the cross was <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>rollers</b> using hoists by one of the first tractors to be used in Gaspé and erected using a rail system of pulleys and cables, driven by the strength of many horses and a tractor.A commemorative plaque located {{at the foot of the}} cross of Gaspé was inaugurated on August 23, 2009 (75 years after the erection of the granite cross), in memory of artisans of Rivière-à-Pierre, Quebec who extracted and cut this block of granite which become the monolithic cross.|$|R

5000|$|Systems {{which require}} the torque {{of the system}} under test to be {{measured}} typically use a strain gauge mounted on a torque arm that {{is attached to the}} housing perpendicular to the input shaft. The housing/stator is mounted <b>on</b> <b>roller</b> bearings and the rotor is mounted <b>on</b> <b>roller</b> bearings within the housing/stator so that it can turn independently of the rotor and frame. The strain gauge connects the torque arm to the frame assembly and keeps the housing from spinning as housing tries to turn in the same direction of the turbine. (Newton’s third law).|$|R
