5|$|Faber {{was born}} in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on January 13, 1903, and {{attended}} Central High School in Washington, D.C. He {{then went on to}} college at the University of Maryland, where he played on the Maryland lacrosse team, earning letters in 1926 and 1927, and the basketball team, earning letters from 1924 to 1927. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) named Faber an honorable mention All-American as an inside attackman in 1926 and a third-team All-American at the out <b>home</b> <b>position</b> in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|Lalonde {{would pay}} off Jones by helping lead Vancouver to three Minto Cup pro championships – in 1911, 1918, and 1920. He played what was back {{then called the}} inside <b>home</b> <b>position</b> – {{basically}} an attacking forward who played on the crease as the primary threat against the opposing goaltender – and his goal-scoring prowess was critically important {{to the success of}} his Vancouver team as Lalonde constantly went up against some of the finest New Westminster goaltenders of the day, stalwarts such as Alex [...] "Sandy" [...] Gray and then later the legendary Alban [...] "Bun" [...] Clark.|$|E
2500|$|A {{servo system}} differs from some stepper motor {{applications}} {{in that the}} position feedback is continuous while the motor is running; a stepper system relies on the motor not to [...] "miss steps" [...] for short term accuracy, although a stepper system may include a [...] "home" [...] switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control. For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines <b>home</b> <b>position</b> and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 90’s Dr. Willard further {{explored}} existing work opportunities {{for individuals with}} physical disabilities who wanted to work within their home. In her quest, Dr. Willard discovered {{that there was little}} done within the field. At the time, work at <b>home</b> <b>positions</b> were scarce and she was able to place individuals on a one on one basis. The original work at <b>home</b> <b>positions</b> consisted of appointment reminder calls for medical practices and hospitals, data entry, book indexing and medical or legal transcription services. However, Dr. Willard was faced with a dilemma having too many individuals with disabilities to place and not enough positions in the workforce that were at <b>home</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R
500|$|The game {{board is}} made up of the Central Hub and six two-sided Provinces which fit {{together}} creating a hexagon. The Central Hub {{is made up}} of the Well of Fears, the <b>home</b> <b>positions</b> and the Ring Road. The Well of Fears is a cup with a lid that fits inside the hole {{in the middle of the}} Central Hub. Located around the Well of Fears are six numbered grooves, called [...] "Home"; players must start from and return to <b>Home.</b> The <b>Home</b> <b>positions</b> are connected to the Ring Road, a path that runs around the Central Hub. The Ring Road give players access to all the Provinces.|$|R

2500|$|One reason riders {{can become}} hung up {{is due to}} {{improper}} stirrup sizing. [...] If the stirrup is too large, the foot can go through the stirrup opening and be caught. If the stirrup is too small, the foot can become trapped more easily as the foot cannot free itself. The main reason for a rider to become hung up in the irons {{is due to the}} 'closing door effect' of a lost stirrup trying to return to lie flat {{against the side of the}} horse. [...] When the rider falls and the stirrup is free, it tends to return to its <b>home</b> <b>position</b> flat against the horse's side. As the stirrup returns to the horse, the opening for the foot gets smaller and smaller and can catch a falling rider's boot in that smaller opening.(see Fitting the stirrup, below). Proper stirrup placement, on the ball of the foot, instead of jammed [...] "home" [...] clear up to the arch, also lowers the risk of a rider being dragged.|$|E
50|$|Levitation is {{accomplished}} by providing an upward force that counteracts the pull of gravity (in relation to gravity on earth), plus a smaller stabilizing force that pushes the object toward a <b>home</b> <b>position</b> whenever {{it is a small}} distance away from that <b>home</b> <b>position.</b> The force can be a fundamental force such as magnetic or electrostatic, or it can be a reactive force such as optical, buoyant, aerodynamic, or hydrodynamic.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{stepping}} switches {{rotate the}} wipers {{in only one}} direction, but some are bidirectional; the latter have a second magnet to rotate the wipers the other way. A third variety [...] "winds" [...] a spring as the wiper steps progressively, and a ratchet holds the wipers from returning to <b>home</b> <b>position.</b> When the circuit is no longer needed, another electromagnet releases the holding pawl; the spring then returns the wipers to their <b>home</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

HSN also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when HSN is broadcasting shows with highly popular items.|$|R
50|$|Houses in Cumberland Estates consist {{primarily}} of ranch, basement ranch and split-level <b>homes</b> <b>positioned</b> {{in the neighborhood}} hills typical of East Tennessee topography. Home designs are largely consistent with the mid-century modern design movement. McCarty’s residential designs were influenced by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. House sizes generally range between 1,000 and 2,000 square feet with lots in size from approximately 1/4 acre to 1/2 acre.|$|R

50|$|The {{museum is}} housed in the Villa Doyle, a mansion built in the 1860s as the home to first Chief Justice in The Bahamas. After the {{addition}} of a new wing in the 1920s, it became one of Nassau’s prized stately <b>homes.</b> <b>Positioned</b> on the rise overlooking the top of West Street, Villa Doyle is typical of great houses of earlier centuries with surrounding verandahs that offer a commanding view of both the city and the sea.|$|R
50|$|The Strowger switch uses two telegraph-type keys on a {{telephone}} set for dialing. Each key requires a separate wire to the exchange. The keys are tapped to step the switch in two stages. The {{first set of}} incoming pulses raises the {{armature of an electromagnet}} to move a shaft which selects the desired level of contacts, by engaging a pawl with the upper ratchet. Another pawl, pivoting on the frame, holds the shaft at that height as it rotates. The second set of pulses, from the second key, operates another electromagnet. Its pawl engages the (hidden) vertical teeth in the lower ratchet to rotate the shaft to the required position. It is kept there against spring tension by a pawl pivoted on the frame. When the switch returns to its <b>home</b> <b>position,</b> typically when a call is complete, a release magnet disengages the pawls that hold the shaft in position. An interlock ensures that the spring on the shaft rotates it to angular <b>home</b> <b>position</b> before it drops to its <b>home</b> <b>position</b> by gravity.|$|E
5000|$|As the cam {{continues}} to rotate, the spring-loaded lever pushes on the pin {{to move it}} toward <b>home</b> <b>position,</b> but if the key is still down, the cam (now out of contact with the power roll) stalls because the projection on the cam catches on {{another part of the}} release lever. The cam stalls until the key is released. When released, the lever catches the projection so the cam is now in <b>home</b> <b>position.</b> This is like a simple clock escapement, and prevents repeated typing. (The [...] "key-down" [...] anti-repeat stop can be removed, so that fast repetitive typing can be done, but this change is difficult to undo.) ...|$|E
50|$|For example, {{take the}} <b>home</b> <b>position</b> {{of the right}} index finger (letter 'j' in QWERTY). Without thumb action, it is 'to' (と). It is 'o' (お) with the right thumb shift and 'do' (ど) with the left thumb shift.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{the fields}} such as indexing, medical billing, legal and medical transcription, proofreading, and {{appointment}} reminder services were amenable to telecommuting. However, over the past 14 years most of these positions have faded away due {{to the evolution of}} cloud based services and technology such as Dragon Dictate that have revolutionized transcription. Now, the greatest opportunity to employ individuals with disabilities in at <b>home</b> <b>positions</b> exists within the fields of Customer Service, Sales, and Technology Services; such as Tier I and Tier II support.

5000|$|Animation {{historian}} Christopher P. Lehman {{considers that}} the series draws its humor {{in part from}} creative uses of anachronisms. The main one is the placing of a [...] "modern", 20th-century society in prehistory. This society takes inspiration from the suburban sprawl developed {{in the first two}} decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals. They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them. Finally, the stone houses of this society are cookie-cutter <b>homes</b> <b>positioned</b> into typical neighborhoods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Odometry {{calibration}} is a {{first and}} essential step {{to do for a}} successful navigation because most of control algorithms are based on odomety information. Odometry error can be categorized as systematic and non-systematic error. In this paper, we suggest a novel method to calibrate systematic error using inherent <b>home</b> <b>positioning</b> capability of <b>home</b> cleaning robot. The method is designed for a differential drive type and take advantage of Augmented extended Kalman Fil-ter(AKF) Algorithm to estimates systematic error parameters. Our approach has both characteristics of on-line and off-line. By simulation and experiment, we evaluate the method and the result shows that the proposed method gives odometry error reduction by several times. I...|$|R
