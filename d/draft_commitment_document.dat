The problem of battered women only came into the limelight in the early 1970 's in the United States, its progression into public awareness corresponding with the growth of the women's movement.

In undertaking this research, the intention is to learn from battered women about the context of their daily lives, exploring their educational and employment statuses, to describe the development and nature of their relationships with men who abuse them, establish the type of abuse they experience, and most importantly, to find out why they stay in such relationships.

I believe that both parts of Bolesław Jerzy II’s monarchy maintained state sovereignty under the scepter of one ruler. Even though the Masovian Piast took over the Galician-Volhynian Ruthenia being a heir of his uncles and grandfather, Wolhynia was a part of the state which had just been incorporated to Jerzy Lwowic’s monarchy, i. e. about 1304, after Mścisław II’s consent.

INTERVENTION: A three-workshop series {{was presented to}} 102 providers working in CHCs.

EVALUATION METHODS: A retrospective pre-post evaluation measured self-perceived change in content knowledge in all four areas. Participants <b>documented</b> <b>commitments</b> to change behaviors across workshops, which were analyzed for recurring themes. RESULTS: Paired t-tests documented improvement in all four content areas. Content analysis of commitments yielded four themes: empowering patients, structuring care, understanding patients, and reflecting purposefully.

40|$|Policy {{making is}} {{not only about the}} cut and thrust of politics. It is also a bureaucratic activity. Long before laws are <b>drafted,</b> policy <b>commitments</b> made, or groups {{consulted}} on government proposals, officials will have been working away to shape the policy into a form in which it can be presented to ministers and the outside world. Policy bureaucracies - parts of government organizations with specific responsibility for maintaining and developing policy - have to be mobilized before most significant policy initiatives are launched. This book describes the range of work policy officials do. The 140 civil servants interviewed for this study included officials who helped originate policies which were subsequently taken over as manifesto commitments by the Labour Party; officials who helped devise the formula by which billions of pounds are allocated to local government in grants; and also officials who recommended to the Secretary of State that a controversial publisher be allowed to take over a national newspaper. The background and career paths of middle-ranking officials show them to be a diverse group who do not tend to develop long-term subject specialisms. The instructions to which these officials work - whether coming from ministers or senior officials - are often very broad and leave much to personal interpretation. Policy Bureaucracy goes on to examine how ministers and senior officials affect the work of middle ranking officials and the cues policy bureaucrats use to develop policy. The analytical approach adopted in the book is derived from Alvin Gouldner's Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy and hiselaboration of Max Weber's notion that hierarchy and expertise place a fundamental tension at the heart of modern bureaucracies. In the UK this tension is handled by combining 'invited authority' with 'improvised expertise'. The book also explores other models of handling this tension in political systems in Europe and the USA...|$|R
