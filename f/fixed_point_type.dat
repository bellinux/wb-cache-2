50|$|To {{convert a}} number from a <b>fixed</b> <b>point</b> <b>type</b> with scaling factor R to another type with scaling factor S, the {{underlying}} integer must be multiplied by R and divided by S; that is, {{multiplied by the}} ratio R/S. Thus, for example, to convert the value 1.23 = 123/100 from a type with scaling factor R=1/100 to one with scaling factor S=1/1000, the underlying integer 123 must be multiplied by (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10, yielding the representation 1230/1000. If S does not divide R (in particular, if the new scaling factor S {{is greater than the}} original R), the new integer will have to be rounded. The rounding rules and methods are usually part of the language's specification.|$|E

More generally, this applies to other non-orientable spaces, including the projective plane and the Klein bottle. However, since those models have a closed boundary, we rely on a version of the PPA that states it as to find another fixed point giving a fixed point.
