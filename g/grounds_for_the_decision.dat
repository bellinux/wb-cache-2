40|$|This thesis investigates {{what good}} {{accounting}} practice {{in terms of}} service contracts is according to the Supreme Administrative Court and whether the arguments in <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> still are sustainable compared to current standards. Furthermore, it investigates how the accounting solutions approved by the Supreme Administrative Court relate {{to the quality of}} information investors are provided with, which is of relevance since the precedents are used as guidance by firms and the Swedish Tax Agency. To analyze the legal cases an argumentation analysis is used. After analyzing the results from the argumentation analysis, some guidelines <b>for</b> what <b>the</b> court considered good accounting practice were observable. Firstly, expenditures for acquisition of future profitable contracts are allowed to be expensed immediately, even though revenue from the contracts is recognized as linear during the entire contract period. Secondly, recording of accruals of income is approved in cases when the future commitment has a greater as well as a limited extent. However, the court found that for recording accruals to be allowed, the amount must be material. Further, our conclusion is that the arguments in the Supreme Administrative Court’s <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> in each of the reviewed legal cases still are sustainable compared to current standards, with one exception where no conclusion could be made. In addition, half of the accounting solutions approved by the Supreme Administrative Court provide investors with high quality information in accordance with the definition of quality in this thesis. In the other cases, the approved accounting solutions are not providing investors with high quality information...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{applicability}} of Possibilistic Stable Models (PSM) for Logic Programming to decision making {{through the use of}} several extensions to the PSM formalism that are chosen to enhance the realism in the resulting decision making model. The selected extensions to PSMs are unified through their incorporation into an argumentation framework designed to represent the combined formalism. A PSM for a logic program is initially mapped to a Possibilistic preferred extension of the argumentation framework. This is first used as the basis for a particular type of strength comparison between arguments where the rule weights are interpreted as utilities. The framework is then extended to a value-based system incorporating context dependent utilities, and uncertainty in its domain knowledge. The strengths of arguments are assessed using an aggregation function combining all the significant magnitude information present in the argument. The concept of value projection rules are introduced that serve to provide domain context sensitivity for the mapping of circumstances onto values. Together with the aggregation function, this constitutes a method for realizing dynamic decision framing: the determination of the basis or <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> An example of some realism is identified from Psychology literature based on an ethical dilemma familiar to contemporary moral philosophers. This example is presented to the system using a standard axiomatization for knowledge representation. Through the choice of a very general aggregation function, the dilemma exemplifies how the defined system capabilities may act together to realize a meaningful decision function, which is later independently characterized...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the rights}} {{and the status of}} probationers in the context of Malaysian employment relations. A probationer is someone who is on trial to give proof of certain qualifications for a place or status in employment. The term “probation” however, is not found in any of the employment legislation in Malaysia. This means a probationer is an employee in the context of Employment Act 1955 (EA 1955) and a workman in the context of Industrial Relations Act 1955 (IRA 1967). In the employment relations, the probationary period is also an opportunity for both employer and employee to decide whether they are suited for each other. The Industrial Court and the superior courts in Malaysia have over the years ruled that an employee (also refers to workman) on probation enjoys the same rights as a permanent employee. As a result the services of a probationer cannot be terminated without just cause or excuse (Section 20, IRA 1967). Although an employer retains the right to confirm or not to confirm an employee on probation, this prerogative must be exercised in a bona fide manner not arbitrarily or capriciously and there must also be <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> In this paper, the authors analyses some of key issues on {{the rights and}} status of probationers which also include the employers right to confirm, extend or terminate the services of a probationer. The methodology employed in this paper is the analysis of industrial case laws on probation using criterion based sampling of Industrial Court and superior court awards. Findings from the analysis reveals that many termination awards on probation were made against the employers as the employers have failed or violated the principles of natural justice in the termination of probationers. The basic principle of industrial jurisprudence in Malaysia is that it is the employer who must prove the employee (probationer) guilty, and not the employee (probationer) who must prove himself (herself) not guilty. As such, the burden of prove is on the employer and not on the employee (probationer) for termination cases referred to the Industrial Court. In this paper the authors also provide some recommendation in the management probationers besides other guidelines to improve and create a harmonious employment relationship...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An extragalactic {{origin of}} the {{dominant}} part of all extrasolar hadronic cosmic rays above about 10 MeV/nucleon has long been considered unlikely due to energy considerations. In order to circumvent such arguments, the hypothesis that “flux trapping ” of extragalactic cosmic rays occurs in the Galactic confinement volume is advanced in this paper. This hypothesis {{is based on a}} number of speculative assumptions about the properties of Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The intergalactic cosmic-ray density expected under conservative assumptions about its extragalactic origins is then shown to be of the right order of magnitude to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> locally observed cosmic radiation. It is demonstrated that an extragalactic scenario of cosmic-ray origin that is consistent with the observed cosmic-ray energy spectrum and preserves the successes of Galactic propagation theory can be constructed. The position of the “ankle ” in the cosmic-ray energy spectrum follows as a natural consequence from this explanation. The γ-ray flux from the Magellanic clouds is shown to provide no suitable testing <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>for</b> or against an extragalactical origin in this scenario. It is argued that recent observational evidence seems to be in favour of a dual origin of cosmic-rays.

[...] But there are two reasons why the jury did not reach that issue in this case. In the first place, North Carolina does not seek to sustain the judgment below on that ground. Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered 'to have been actually domiciled in Nevada.' In the second place, the verdict against petitioners was a general one. “It was there held that a divorce granted by Nevada, on a finding that one spouse was domiciled in Nevada, must be respected in North Carolina, where Nevada's finding of domicile was not questioned though the other spouse had neither appeared nor been served with process in Nevada and though recognition of such a divorce offended the policy of North Carolina.” [...] The ruling: both Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix were “convicted of bigamous cohabitation” [...] and were sentenced to a term of years in a state prison.|$|R

With the eventual Communist takeover of China increasingly anticipated, by the late 1940 s, the Institute of Pacific Relations, the US-based foreign policy think tank that had focused upon Asia, became the subject of ferocious McCarthyite charges that it was a Communist front. US Foreign Service officers who had predicted Mao Zedong’s victory were likewise accused of being Communist agents. With the subject of China policy close to politically radioactive from 1950, in the 1950 s and 1960 s the CFR became a forum for discreet, private discussions of developments in China among China specialists, including academics, journalists, businessmen, and government officials from the State and Defense Departments and the CIA. Existing China specialists regrouped on the CFR, and new ones were brought into these deliberations.

40|$|Tutkimuksessa kysytään, miten viranomaiset käsittelevät huoltoriitaprosessissa esiin tuotuja väitteitä perhesuhteissa tapahtuvasta väkivallasta. Miten mahdollista väkivaltaa suhteutetaan vanhemmuuteen ja lapsia koskeviin asumis-, huolto- ja tapaamisratkaisuihin? Aineisto koostuu 158 oikeuteen viedyn huoltoriidan oikeudenkäyntiasiakirjoista vuosilta 2001 - 2003. Kaikissa aineiston tapauksissa on esitetty väite toisen tai molempien vanhempien väkivaltaisuudesta tai lapsen seksuaalisesta hyväksikäytöstä. Eniten on esitetty väitteitä isien väkivallan käytöstä. Tulosten mukaan oikeustapauksissa esitetyt väkivaltaväitteet eivät sinänsä yhdenmukaista tuomareiden päätöksiä. Yksinhuoltoja, yhteishuoltoja, lasten asumista ja tavallisia tapaamisia määrätään myös sellaisille vanhemmille, joiden esitettiin käyttäytyneen väkivaltaisesti joko parisuhteessa tai lapsia kohtaan. Vaikka väkivallasta olisi näyttöä ja sen olisi kuvattu olleen vakavaa ja/tai toistuvaa, se ei aina näytä vaikuttavan tehtyihin päätöksiin. Esimerkiksi parisuhdeväkivallasta tuomarit voivat ilmaista, että se ei ole oleellinen asia vanhemmuuden arvioinnissa. Osassa tapauksia tuomarit kuitenkin kertovat, että parisuhdeväkivalta tai lapsiin kohdistuva väkivalta vaikuttavat heidän päätöksentekoonsa. Tällöin ratkaisuina voidaan käyttää muun muassa yksinhuoltoja ja tapaamisten rajoittamista. Sosiaalityöntekijöiden tekemillä selvityksillä on keskeinen rooli asiantuntijatiedon tarjoajina oikeuteen menneissä huoltoriidoissa. Esitettyjä väkivaltaepäilyjä ei kuitenkaan aina kirjoiteta selvityksiin näkyviin. Kun väkivallasta sitten kirjoitetaan, se tehdään usein epätarkasti, kiertoilmauksin ja kannanottoja välttäen. Toisaalta osa sosiaalitoimen selvityksistä tarjoaa oikeuden käyttöön hyvinkin tarkkaa informaatiota mahdollisesta väkivallasta. Tuomioistuinten ja sosiaalitoimen tapa käsitellä väkivaltaväitteitä suhteessa lapsen etuun näyttää asiakirja-aineiston valossa epäjärjestelmälliseltä ja osin väkivaltaa vähättelevältä. Väkivaltaa ei kirjata systemaattisesti asiakirjoihin eikä sitä arvioida ja tulkita selkeästi tai yhdenmukaisesti. Tilanne lapsen seksuaalisen hyväksikäytön suhteen on samansuuntainen tutkimusaineistoon kuuluvissa tapauksissa. Tutkimus tukee kansainvälisissä tutkimuksissa esiin tuotua havaintoa väkivallan ongelmallisesta käsittelystä perheoikeudellisten huolto- ja tapaamiskäytäntöjen viranomaistoiminnassa. Domestic Violence and Child Custody Disputes In this {{research}} it is asked {{how do the}} authorities involved in child custody disputes handle the issues of alleged violence in families during litigation. What kinds of decisions are made in child custody dispute cases during which the potential violent behaviour of one parent or both parents has been raised {{and what kinds of}} conceptions of violence do judges and social workers present in case documents´ Additionally, it is analysed how is potential child sexual abuse dealt with in the custody dispute process. The data consist of the case files on 158 child custody dispute cases collected from three district courts and four courts of appeal in various places around Finland in the period 2001 - 2003. The cases have been selected on the basis that in them allegations of physical violence inflicted by one parent or both parents, threats of violence or child sexual abuse have been entered into the case files. Fathers are most commonly said to have acted violently but there are also several cases where mothers´ use of violence is brought up. The analysis shows that the alleged violence does not itself equalise <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> made by <b>the</b> judges. Joint and sole custodies were also awarded to parents alleged of using violence, and children were also ordered to live with them or visit the parents without supervision. Violence convictions or restraining orders do not prevent the court from ordering children to live with parents having been convicted for a crime either or make it impossible to award sole custody to them. In <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions,</b> violence rarely lies in the focus of assessment. It is common <b>for</b> written <b>grounds</b> not to take any stand on violence. As judges assess the truthfulness of allegations of violence, the written information produced by the authori-ties or other professionals on violence is of great significance. Among <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>decisions</b> there are different kinds of ways of explaining how the impact of violence as-sessed as having occurred is admitted or denied. When violence is not a decisive factor, the most used explanations are that violence has not been used against children and that it is in past. Violence can be also defined as an issue related to parents´ intimate relationship, which is not connected to the assessment of parenthood. Of <b>the</b> written <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions,</b> three different violence discourses can be identified. By the interaction discourse it is referred to how violence in the family is in-terpreted to be about unsuccessful interaction and about a difficult intimate relationship. The risk discourse in turn includes an understanding of violence both as a physical and psychological risk factor and endangerment of safety. The third identified discourse is named the child-rearing discourse which means dealing with violence against children {{from the point of view}} of discipline. Social workers´ reports play a central role as providers of expert knowledge in child custody dispute cases taken to court. It seems to be fairly common to leave descriptions of violence out of the reports. When violence is eventually written about in the reports, it is often done inaccurately, by using euphemisms and avoiding taking a stand. The assessment is often based on whether also other authorities are aware of occurred violence. In the assessment process, social workers´ own observations about parents and children are used as well. Regarding child sexual abuse, the analysed case documents demonstrate that the attitudes of professionals in social services and health care and judges vary between two standpoints that deviate from each other. From the "criticism of suspicion" point of view, suspicion of sexual abuse raised in child custody disputes can be suspected to be fabricated to serve a purpose. At the same time it might be emphasized how just a sus-picion already hurts the accused parent and burdens the allegedly victimized child. When the situation is looked at from <b>the</b> ´concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> child´ perspective, it is em-phasized that sexual abuse of children endangers and erodes seriously their possibilities to a safe life and balanced development. In summary, the handling of physical violence and child sexual abuse in child cus-tody disputes is unsystematic, inaccurate and even belittling. Other researchers have reminded us that, in the context of family law, violence is basically a marginal problem. This research supports the idea of a marginal position of violence in the activities of au-thorities concerning custody and visitation practices. Problems in encountering violence can also be placed in a larger context, the context of the welfare state. According to studies, the Finnish welfare state has not taken clear responsibility for domestic violence but rather tolerated it for long...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY During {{the last}} few years {{activity}} in <b>the</b> market <b>for</b> mergers and acquisitions has reached unprecedented levels. Corporations are creating ever larger entities with operations which are truly global in nature. The ten largest mergers in history were announced in 1998 and 1999 alone. Examples include the merger between Daimler/Chrysler and Vodafone/Airtouch. As transactions reach ever increasing sizes companies are facing greater opposition from regulators in relation to the potential negative effect on competition in the markets where they operate. The European Commission has decided to block a number of high profile transactions in recent times for this very reason. Some of the most notable examples include General Electrics proposed acquisition of Honeywell, the merger between SEB and Föreningssparbanken and the merger between Volvo and Scania. <b>The</b> basis <b>for</b> merger analysis in EU competition policy is Council Regulation No. 4064 / 89 which came into force on September 21, 1990 and created the Merger Task Force. It refers to concentrations with a Union dimension, which are assessed in combination with their compatibility with the Common Market. EC Merger Regulation is designed to prevent the negative effects, which are related to changes in the competitive structure of the market. A transaction is prohibited when it has sufficiently negative effect on competition. If there is no increase in the market share {{as a result of the}} concentration, there will accordingly be no significant impact on the market and the merger will most likely be approved. This essay will describe the Merger Process from a theoretical perspective, as well as from a practical perspective, including an extensive description of the process of defining the relevant markets and all of the stages in the market investigation of the Volvo/Scania merger case. The study is an attempt to highlight the different types of aspects of the arguments presented in the Volvo/Scania merger case, and will conclude that the legal arguments in the presentation of the merger analysis are in a great extent based on economical facts and assessments. This conclusion goes well with the tendency that competition law arguments indeed differ from traditional legal argumentations. Following <b>the</b> Volvo/Scania merger <b>decision,</b> a wide discussion was initiated regarding the outcome of the case. It has been argued which type of criteria laid <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision,</b> how these criteria were assessed by the Commission and further which type of criteria ought to be assessed in a merger investigation. The fact that only a certain type of arguments are accepted as being part of a merger process, relates to the assumption that arguments featured in legal arguments, such as in the EC Merger Process must meet certain criteria in order to be approved of and allowed to form <b>the</b> basis <b>for</b> a <b>decision.</b> <b>The</b> standards presumed to be met in order to be accepted as part of the legal discussion in this study are: comprehension, sustainability, relevance and objectivity. The study concludes that the arguments used by the Commission in its final <b>decision,</b> do meet <b>the</b> above listed standards and accordingly seem to contribute to <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> having been made on fair conditions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{estimation}} of several biomarkers in differentiation diagnostics of tumour diseases in osseous system. Material and methods. 160 patients with benign (115) and malignant (45) osseous neoformations were investigated. Neopterine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-а), interleukin- 6, adhesion molecules of vessel endothe-lium (sVCAM- 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were identified by ELISA solid-phase test and compared with the levels of 20 apparently healthy individuals. Tumor verification was fulfilled by X-ray, CT, MRI and histomorphological essay. Results. Both benign and malignant osseous tumour patients showed increased levels of neopterine, TNF-а and interleukin- 6 being more significant with malignant processes. The level of sVCAM was decreased in patients of both groups and VEGF level corresponded to the control, these indexes did not show any differences between the groups. The assessment of diagnostic value of these cytokines indicates that positive results for TNF and neopterine give <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final diagnostic <b>decision</b> while <b>the</b> same results <b>for</b> interleukin- 6 give moderate basement for diagnostic decision. Conclusion. Increased TNF-а and neopterine levels allow substantiating the difference between benign and malignant osseous tumours and improving diagnostic quality...|$|R
