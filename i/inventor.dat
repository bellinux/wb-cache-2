We analyse patents issued by the U. S.

40|$|Within firms {{innovation}} is largely dependent on individual-level innovativeness by employed <b>inventors</b> working in R&D. In contradiction to Dutch employed <b>inventors,</b> German employed <b>inventors</b> receive financial rewards for patented inventions according to strict guidelines in national patent law. Scholars {{have stated that}} motivational factors such as financial rewards affect the inventive output of employed <b>inventors.</b> In this study the effect of individual remuneration guidelines in national patent on the inventive output of German and Dutch employed <b>inventors</b> has been assessed. In order to obtain data, R&D employees in high-tech sectors filled out online questionnaires. The data was statistically analysed using a multivariate regression model. By applying this method the effect of multiple factors on the inventive output of employed <b>inventors</b> could be analysed. Contrary to the expected effect of motivational factors on the actual output of employed <b>inventors</b> it is mainly the employee’s position in the firm that positively affects the innovativeness of employed <b>inventors.</b> Remuneration guidelines were demonstrated {{to have an effect}} on the intentional output of employed <b>inventors</b> but do not affect the actual inventive output...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{the seminal}} work of Allen (1977), we {{contribute}} to the emerging micro-level theory of knowledge recombination by examining how individual-level characteristics of <b>inventors</b> affect the breadth of their technological recombinations. Our data set combines information from 30, 550 European patents with matched survey data obtained from 1, 880 <b>inventors.</b> The analysis supports the view that <b>inventors</b> with a scientific education {{are more likely to}} generate patents that span technological boundaries (in our case, 30 broad, top-level technological domains) than <b>inventors</b> with an engineering degree. A doctoral degree is associated with increased recombination breadth for all groups of <b>inventors.</b> The breadth of an <b>inventor’s</b> technological recombinations diminishes with increasing temporal distance to his education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. Our findings provide several new insights for research on <b>inventors,</b> the literature on organizational learning and innovation, and for strategy research...|$|R
40|$|Academic <b>inventors</b> are {{university}} {{scientists who}} appear as designated <b>inventors</b> of patents owned either by business companies, academic institutions or individuals. We analyse {{their relationships with}} co-inventors, who may be either academic colleagues, students, or, very often, industrial researchers. Gould and Fernandez's (1989) taxonomy of 'brokerage' roles is adjusted to patent data, and complemented with information drawn from both academic inventors' publications and replies to a short questionnaire. Only very few academic <b>inventors</b> are found to hold brokerage positions. Such <b>inventors</b> have {{a large number of}} patents, a strong publication record and a higher-than-average share of patents held by companies, rather than universities. Relationships of academic <b>inventors</b> with co-inventors from industry are weaker and less likely to be maintained than those with co-inventors from academia. Academic <b>inventors</b> in gatekeeping positions (between university and industry) maintain the strongest ties with all types of co-inventors.
