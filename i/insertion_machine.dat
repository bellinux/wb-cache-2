The control system is divided into 2 subsystems viz. pin sorting and pin insertion. The detailed design of the control system and its components is discussed, along with the programming of the Programmable Logic Controller for both subsystems. The development of the machine vision application used to sort the right pin types is described, with an emphasis on the image processing tools used. Applicability and robustness of these tools {{in the context of the}} pin <b>insertion</b> <b>machine</b> is described. The developed application can capture images and process them in 92 ms, significantly lower than the maximum allowable time of 500 ms. The vision system could totally eliminate the incidence of a wrong pin being passed on to the insertion head. Among the right pins, 98 % of the right pins in the right orientation and 100 % the pins in the wrong orientation were detected. by Rejin Isaac. Thesis (M.

40|$|A {{belt driven}} system is more cost {{attractive}} than a screw-driven system, {{but the problem}} with elasticity makes the positioning of a belt driven table inaccurate. An FL controller with frictional and elasticity compensator was proposed to be a better controller than a conventional PID. An existing conveyor system complete with the motor driver was used in this project. Using PRBS input, the input output data was gathered and the parametric model of the conveyor was identified by MATLAB SID Toolbox. The model was then used to develop the conventional PID controller, the proposed FL controller and also frictional and elasticity compensator, in Simulink environment by simulation. The developed controllers were then implemented physically to control the conveyor. Data was gathered and compared for the evaluation of positional tracking and end-point controlling performances. For positional tracking, a conventional PID controller shows the best performance in hardware implementation, but for end-point positioning, the FL controller with compensator showed the better performance in both simulation and hardware implementation than the conventional PID controller. The FL controller with compensator could improve the performance of equipment which requires only the end-point positioning control such as vision inspection machine, <b>insertion</b> <b>machine</b> and cutting machine significantly...|$|E

The internal environment of intelligent cognitive agent creates and develops its own model and the model of external environment.

50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil <b>insertion</b> <b>machines</b> insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Productivity {{gains in}} the {{manufacturing}} sector have generally been credited to investments in production facilities that supplemented or replaced manual labor. Insertion of circuit boards is a key activity in the electronics industry. Improvements in productivity of circuit board manufacture may be achieved by replacing manual component <b>insertion</b> with automatic <b>machine</b> <b>insertion.</b> However, automatic insertion requires high capital expenditure; the capital must be invested in production alternatives {{that will result in}} the largest productivity improvement for every dollar invested. A critical decision regarding capital investment in component insertion is centralized versus decentralized insertion. This study is primarily concerned with the problem of evaluating the economic feasibility of three production alternatives for circuit board manufacture [...] centralized production, in which all manufacturing operations are performed at one location; decentralized production, in which each business unit has an independent production cell; and satellite production, which uses a mixed production strategy whereby <b>machine</b> <b>insertion</b> is centralized but all other operations involved are decentralized. The approach used in this study is to examine the different cost parameters involved in circuit board manufacture and identify those factors which will differ significantly for the three production alternatives. Procedures are developed to estimate these cost parameters. The dollar values so obtained are then reduced to an annual worth basis for comparison purposes. The methodology developed is then applied to analyze this problem at Tektronix, Incorporated. Based on the cost factors quantified in this study, the analysis showed that centralized circuit board manufacture results in the least capital expenditure, smaller operating and maintenance costs, and higher machine and manpower utilization...|$|R

40|$|The {{just-in-time}} concept decrees not {{to accept}} ordered goods before their due dates {{in order to avoid}} inventory cost. This bounces the inventory cost back to the manufacturer: products that are completed before their due dates have to be stored. Reducing this type of storage cost by preclusion of early completion conflicts with the traditional policy of keeping work-in-process inventories down. This paper addresses a single-machine scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing total inventory cost, comprising cost associated with work-in-process inventories and storage cost as a result of early completion. The cost components are measured by the sum of the job completion times and the sum of the job earlinesses. This problem differs from more traditional scheduling problems, since the <b>insertion</b> of <b>machine</b> idle time may reduce total cost. The search for an optimal schedule, however, can be limited to the set of job sequences, since for any sequence there is a clear-cut way to insert machine idle time in order to minimize total inventory cost. We apply branch-and-bound to identify an optimal schedule. We present five approaches for lower bound calculation, based upon relaxation of the objective function, of the state space, and upon Lagrangian relaxation.

40|$|Alternating timed automata are a {{powerful}} extension of classical Alur-Dill timed automata that are closed under all Boolean operations. They {{have played a}} key role, among others, in providing verification algorithms for prominent specification formalisms such as Metric Temporal Logic. Unfortunately, when interpreted over an infinite dense time domain (such as the reals), alternating timed automata have an undecidable language emptiness problem. In this thesis we consider restrictions on this model that restore the decidability of the language emptiness problem. We consider the restricted class of safety alternating timed automata, which can encode a corresponding Safety fragment of Metric Temporal Logic. This thesis connects these two formalisms with <b>insertion</b> channel <b>machines,</b> a model of faulty communication, and demonstrates that the three formalisms are interreducible. We thus prove a non-elementary lower bound for the language emptiness problem for 1 -clock safety alternating timed automata and further obtain a new proof of decidability for this problem. Complementing the restriction to safety properties, we consider interpreting the automata over bounded dense time domains. We prove that the time-bounded language emptiness problem is decidable but non-elementary for unrestricted alternating timed automata. The language emptiness problem for alternating timed automata is a special case of a much more general and abstract logical problem: Church's synthesis problem. Given a logical specification S(I,O), Church's problem is {{to determine whether there}} exists an operator F that implements the specification in the sense that S(I,F(I)) holds for all inputs I. It is a classical result that the synthesis problem is decidable in the case that the specification and implementation are given in monadic second-order logic over the naturals. We prove that this decidability extends to MSO over the reals with order and furthermore to MSO over every fixed bounded interval of the reals with order and the + 1 relation.

Critical to improving efficiency of such applications is to elucidate the patterns and preferences of insertion sites selection. We here focus on understanding target site selection of transposon Ac/Ds, one of the best-characterized transposon systems in plants, by exploring various DNA features and predicting insertion sites. A package named DnaFVP (DNA Feature Calculation, Visualization and Vector Preparation) was first developed for calculation, visualization and analysis of various DNA features, including nucleotide sequence features and a broad list of structural/physical properties. In addition, this package allows data preparation prior to calculating features and/or preparation of feature vectors for machine learning. It is developed for building a semi-automatic pipeline to explore various DNA features of any collection of genomic DNA sequences of interest and to prepare feature vectors for further machine learning.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} alignment {{method is}} commonly used in many industries today because it is cheaper and easier to operate than other alignment methods. However, very little systematic research and study has been conducted in this area so far, {{and there are still}} some fundamental questions which remain unanswered. In this thesis, we investigated the precision level and established the baseline achieved by a mechanical alignment system using datums and reference surfaces. The factors which affect the accuracy of mechanical alignment system were studied and methodology was developed to suppress these factors so as to reach its full potential precision. In order to characterize the mechanical alignment system quantitatively, a new optical position monitoring system by using quadrant detectors has been developed in this thesis, it can monitor multi-dimensional degrees of mechanical workpieces in real time with high precision, which conventional measurement methods (such as interferometer) can not realize. We studied the noise factors inside the system and optimized the optical system. Based on the fact that one of the major limiting noise factors is the shifting of the laser beam, a noise cancellation technique has been developed successfully to suppress this noise, the feasibility of an ultra high resolution (< 20 angstrom) for displacement monitoring has been demonstrated. Using the optical position monitoring system, repeatability experiment of the mechanical alignment system has been conducted on different kinds of samples including steel, aluminum, glass and plastics with the same size 100 mmx 130 mm. The alignment accuracy was studied quantitatively rather than qualitatively before. In a controlled environment, we found that common practice of preparation of datum by <b>insertion</b> of precision <b>machined</b> rod into tightly fitted hole may not be adequate. The alignment precision can be improved 5 folds by securing the datum without other means of help. The roughness of reference surface of the samples can affect the alignment precision, the alignment accuracy of an aluminum workpiece having reference surface by milling is about 3 times better than by shearing. Also we have found that sample material can have fairly significant effect on the alignment precision of the system. Contamination trapped between the datum and reference surfaces in mechanical alignment system can cause errors of registration or reduce the level of manufacturing precision. In comparison with the results in a controlled environment above, we {{want to find out what}} will happen in the practice of industries where there is contamination and how much room there is in the system accuracy for improvement. In the thesis, artificial and natural dust particles were used to simulate the real situations and their effects on system precision have been investigated. In this experiment, we discovered two effective cleaning processes, one is the self-cleaning process, and another is the cleaning method by an air gun and a vacuum cleaner which is more efficient. We also studied how other factors (surface roughness, sample material) interacted with different types of contamination, and found that dust particles had less effect on the steel sample than on other samples...|$|R
