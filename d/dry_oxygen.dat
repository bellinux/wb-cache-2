50|$|When impure (cast) iron is {{in contact}} with water, oxygen, other strong oxidants, or acids, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in {{seawater}} or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, {{as a result of}} electrochemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by <b>dry</b> <b>oxygen.</b> As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating ferrous oxide layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water.|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{system was}} constructed with an oxygen tank, RQ- 02 ozone generator (Ruiqing, China), 200 -mL quartz column reactor, flow meter, and an exhaust gas collector. An aliquot of 100  mL of PRW-ROC and 0.5  g of catalyst were {{added in the}} reactor at 30  °C. The gaseous ozone was then introduced through a porous diffuser {{at the bottom of}} the reactor with a flow rate of 5  mg/min. The experiments were carried out under varying the initial pH values (adjusted with 1  N NaOH or HCl) and reaction times. After treatment, <b>dried</b> <b>oxygen</b> was blown into the PRW-ROC at a rate of 3.0  L/min to quench the reaction and eliminate the residual ozone. The resulting suspension was filtered (Whatman Qualitative No. 5) to separate catalyst particles prior to further analysis at various intervals. The ·OH quenching experiments were performed to determine the oxidation mechanism. The ·OH scavengers, tert-butanol (tBA), and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) were added into PRW-ROC (0.5 and 1.0  g/L, respectively) prior to experiments.

40|$|Phenomena {{related to}} the {{volatilization}} of polonium and its compounds are critical issues for the safety assessment of the innovative lead–bismuth cooled type of nuclear reactor or accelerator driven systems. The formation and volatilization of different species of polonium and their interaction with fused silica was studied by thermochromatography using carrier gases with varied redox potential. The obtained results show that under inert and reducing conditions {{in the absence of}} moisture, elemental polonium is formed. Polonium compounds more volatile than elemental polonium can be formed if traces of moisture are present in both inert and reducing carrier gas. The use of <b>dried</b> <b>oxygen</b> as carrier gas leads to the formation of polonium oxides, which are less volatile than elemental polonium. It was also found that the volatility of polonium oxides increases with increasing oxidation state. In the presence of moisture in an oxidizing carrier gas, species are formed that are more volatile than the oxides and less volatile than the elemental polonium. Considering the redox potential of the carrier gas those species are likely oxyhydroxides...|$|R

In air it burns spontaneously with a greyish green flame, producing solid white fumes. With <b>dry</b> <b>oxygen</b> combustion may not be spontaneous and the flame is yellow.

50|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{oxidation}}: dry oxidation and wet oxidation. During dry oxidation, <b>dry</b> <b>oxygen</b> is {{introduced into the}} process tube where it reacts with silicon. Dry oxidation is a slow process that grows films at a rate between 140 and 250 Ǻ/hour. It is typically only used to grow thin oxides (<1000 Å).During wet oxidation, water vapor is introduced into the heated oxidation tube. Because water molecules form hydroxyl structures, they diffuse faster in silicon dioxide and the oxide growth rate increases. The wet oxidation growth rate is 1000 to 1200 Ǻ/hour, so wet oxidation is the preferred method to grow thick oxides. The growth rate slows with increasing thickness, according to the Deal-Grove model.|$|E

The {{oxidation kinetics}} for AlN in <b>dry</b> <b>oxygen</b> were parabolic and of {{approximately the same}} magnitude and temperature dependence as other alumina forming materials. In this case, diffusion of oxygen and/or aluminum through the alumina scale is the rate limiting mechanism.
