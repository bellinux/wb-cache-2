5|$|Evra {{developed}} {{an interest in}} football {{at a young age}} and was fascinated by the play of former Brazilian international Romário, though <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> had an idol. He also earned good grades in school. Evra is married to Sandra with whom he has a son, Lenny and a daughter, Maona. He speaks five languages: his native French, English, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. He also attempted to learn Korean in order to better communicate with Park Ji-sung, his former South Korean teammate at Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|Bede {{implies that}} Oswiu {{decided to take}} further action because Wilfrid was away for longer than expected. It is unclear whether Oswiu {{changed his mind about}} Wilfrid, or whether he despaired of his return, or whether <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> {{intended}} him to become bishop but used this opportunity {{to get him out of}} the country.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, his {{performances}} were improving. He managed {{to win his}} first 250cc Grand Prix at Sachsenring, Germany. However, it was his only win in 2001. Despite managing {{to appear on the}} podium on 9 occasions, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> challenged for the championship. He finished the season in 3rd position behind champion Daijiro Kato and runner-up Tetsuya Harada.|$|E

60|$|All {{the while}} <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> <b>really</b> left San Gaudenzio. I asked him, 'Used {{you to think}} of it, the lake, the Monte Baldo, the laurel trees down the slope?' He tried to see what I wanted to know. Yes, he said--but uncertainly. I could see that <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> been <b>really</b> homesick. It had been very wretched on the ship going from Havre to New York. That {{he told me about}}. And he told me about the gold-mines, the galleries, the valley, the huts in the valley. But <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> <b>really</b> fretted for San Gaudenzio whilst he was in California.|$|R
5000|$|I {{stopped going}} round to his Pierce'shouse and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> came round to mine either. <b>He</b> was <b>never</b> <b>really</b> bothered with the {{business}} side. [...] Peter Kember - interview, Sounds, 09/02/1991.|$|R
25|$|In the 1987 Cricket World Cup Veletta {{played a}} pivotal role for Australia. In the final against England he slammed 45 off only 31 balls, an innings that was {{ultimately}} decisive as Australia edged out England by the narrow margin of seven runs. However at Test level <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> performed to his potential. The dogged opener got numerous starts, but failed to reach a half-century, his highest score being 39. He toured India in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Morricone {{never left}} Rome to compose his music and {{never learned to}} speak English. But given that the {{composer}} has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, {{and then as a}} composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|Despite his ODI success, Bevan's Test {{career was}} not nearly as successful. Thought to be {{susceptible}} to short-pitched deliveries, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> succeeded in the longer form of the game, with an average of only 29. His problems with short pitched bowling are more myth than reality – he continued to perform consistently in ODIs, despite a rule change which allowed short pitch bowling in ODIs. He also scored heavily in domestic first-class cricket for New South Wales during this time averaging almost 60 with the bat. He performed well during his limited time as a bowler in Test matches, with his bowling style of unorthodox left-arm chinaman spin, including taking ten wickets in a Test match against the West Indies touring side in 1996.|$|E

6000|$|When {{it came to}} this, Ellen was a {{long time}} silent, so long a time that her mother was {{beginning}} restively to doubt whether she was going to speak at all. Then she drew a long, silent breath. [...] "I suppose I ought to despise myself, momma, for caring for him, when <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> said that <b>he</b> cared for me." ...|$|R

25|$|The stocky, redheaded Cosier was a middle-order batsman {{who often}} {{attacked}} the bowling when a more judicious method was {{the order of}} the day. Given an extended trial at international level over four seasons, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> established himself as a Test batsman, although he was vice-captain of Australia for a brief period. He had two major highlights at Test level – a hundred on his Test debut at Melbourne against the West Indies in 1975–76, and a 168 against Pakistan the following season. Test bowlers were quick to exploit his technical deficiencies, in particular a very short backlift and abbreviated footwork. Cosier was all brute force with little finesse, but he did try to modify his technique somewhat during the 1978–79 Ashes series, when he was incongruously used as an opener.|$|E
25|$|Akira Yamanaka {{was born}} in Yokohama, Japan, on September 2, 1946. He {{grew up in a}} family of seven children, though the only one of mixed descent as his father was a US Army soldier of Caribbean descent. In his autobiography, he {{mentions}} that he never met his biological father and that he came from a poor family in ruined Yokohama; being born in a brothel as his mother was a prostitute for the Recreation and Amusement Association. The only knowledge of his father was that he was a US soldier from either Cuba or Jamaica. Joe grew up in an orphanage after his mother and stepfather died. During an interview with Mainichi Shimbun, Akira stated that he was born with tuberculosis and that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> thought about his biological father, believing those who raise you are your real parents.|$|E
500|$|Byne was {{convinced}} that butyric acid was present together with calcium acetate in the affected shells, although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> described the methods he used in the so-called [...] "extensive chemical tests" [...] he claimed to [...] have applied to these specimens. Among other conclusions, he assumed that the butyric acid originated from bacterial activity. He also concluded that the decaying effect 'travelled from shell to shell and drawer to drawer', and thus the condition {{came to be called}} a [...] "disease".|$|E

500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of 1923, Harding did two acts that were later said to {{indicate}} foreknowledge of death: he sold the Star (though undertaking to remain as a contributing editor for ten years after his presidency), and made a new will. Harding had long suffered occasional health problems, but when he was not experiencing symptoms he tended to eat, drink, and smoke too much. By 1919, he was aware he had a heart condition. Stress caused by the presidency and by Florence Harding's ill-health (she had a chronic kidney condition) debilitated him, and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> recovered from an episode of influenza in January 1923. After that, Harding, an avid golfer, had difficulty completing a round. In June 1923, Ohio Senator Willis met with Harding, but brought to the president's attention only two of the five items he intended to discuss. When asked why, Willis responded, [...] "Warren seemed so tired".|$|E
500|$|Matt Bozon {{has refused}} to blame Capcom, the {{publisher}} of the game, for responsibility in the game's failure. This was despite Capcom holding it for 8 months after completion, with the game finally releasing when the Game Boy Advance was already in its first year of existence. He says he went in [...] "very naive", believing that if the game was good, it would sell anyway. Bozon believed that from a creative standpoint, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> settled on a target audience, with the character being [...] "iconoclastic", [...] "too sexy to be a kid's brand, and too girly for a male gamer brand". Also, before the game was even released, Bozon claims that he had come to understand anyway that the game [...] "would probably not sell", as during WayForward's search for a publisher, many market analysts were skeptical at {{the idea of having a}} female lead character, and Bozon ultimately acknowledged that they probably [...] "genuinely knew their markets". He still didn't give up, as he felt that Shantae had to exist, [...] "even if it was just to reach out and see if there was an audience reaching back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Always immaculately turned out, he and Cary Grant {{were called}} [...] "the best dressed actor in American movies." [...] Astaire {{remained}} a male fashion icon even into his later years, eschewing his trademark top hat, white tie, and tails (for which <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> cared) {{in favor of}} a breezy casual style of tailored sports jackets, colored shirts, cravats, and slacks—the latter usually held up by the idiosyncratic use of an old tie or silk scarf in place of a belt.|$|E
2500|$|<b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> {{turned off}} the {{computational}} portion of his mind, {{even when he was}} absorbed in other work. One evening found him deep in conversation at the officers club, planning the engineering aspects of an upcoming test series with the project pilot for the XF-91 rocket-assisted fighter program. Four master's degree hopefuls from MIT were seated at a nearby table, fretting at their inability to solve a complex problem which they had been assigned. Never breaking the thread of his own conversation, Ridley abruptly handed the students a notepad he had been scribbling on: [...] "Would this help you any?" [...] Cries of joy followed by hearty thumps on his back acknowledged his ingenious solution to their dilemma.|$|E

2500|$|Released {{from his}} Yamaha {{contract}} after the 2004 season, Melandri was the surprise choice of boss Fausto Gresini to join Sete Gibernau in the Movistar Honda {{team for the}} 2005 MotoGP campaign. Melandri was remarkably successful with Movistar Honda in 2005, with a consistent run of podium finishes early in the season, ultimately taking his first two wins {{in the final two}} races of 2005 to clinch second place in the championship. In doing so, he was the first Honda rider to win back-to-back races for nearly two years, winning the final two rounds of the MotoGP Championship at Istanbul, Turkey, and in Valencia.

2500|$|In 1995 and 1996 {{they went}} on two European tours.

For at least one show in Germany, long time friend Dave Ingram stood in. Martin Kearns also decided to leave the band. The position at the drum kit is now taken by Alex Thomas. Karl Willetts temporarily rejoined the band to do vocal duties on their next album. The band switched record labels from Earache to Metal Blade Records, because since the U.S. ...For Victory tour they had seen a lack of success with Earache.

2500|$|A close {{associate}} {{of the army}} chief of staff Conrad Hötzendorf, Krobatin was appointed Imperial Minister for War in 1912 and as an integral member of the [...] "war party" [...] gave his full backing to the hawkish element in the military in their calls for an immediate attack on Serbia following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and the July Ultimatum. With the outbreak of war, Krobatin was responsible for the task of harnessing the economies of industrial Austria and agrarian Hungary to ensure the now mobilised military was supplied with vital arms and munitions as well as increasing industrial efficiency {{to meet the needs of}} a state with a large cohort of its industrial population no longer available for industrial and food production given their enlistment for war. According to a number of sources, Krobatin struggled in his task for the first two years of the war, and although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> threatened to harness the economy efficiently, he succeeded in tripling the level of artillery available at divisional level.|$|E
5000|$|Although his meddling {{with her}} {{personal}} affairs and insatiable curiosity frustrates Thirteen, House comes to respect {{her as a}} talented doctor and the two build a relationship of mutual trust and understanding of each other's personalities (and, occasionally, shared cynicism and/or sarcasm).
