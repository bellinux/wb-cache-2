5|$|New York won the {{following}} week against Minnesota before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding a significant advantage in time of possession, they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound New York's problems, Phil Simms went <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injury that would sideline him {{for the rest of}} the year. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, was an unproven career backup, who had thrown a mere 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E
5|$|She worked {{steadily}} for {{the next}} two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong came <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee {{attempted}} to answer Tech's score in its following possession. The Hokies' kickoff {{resulted in a}} touchback, so the Volunteers began from their 20-yard line. Montario Hardesty gained a first down with a 10-yard run, then Crompton gained another first <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 11-yard pass. Tennessee continued to advance on running plays and a 14-yard pass by Crompton, pushing the ball inside the Tech 30-yard line. Once there, however, the Hokies rallied by sacking Crompton for a seven-yard loss. A two-yard run and an incomplete pass kept Tennessee from gaining another first down, setting up a fourth down. Rather than try an offensive play and possibly gain a first down or turn the ball over on downs, Tennessee punted, forcing Virginia Tech's offense to start from its 11-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{entered the}} Triple-A playing level in 1985 as an {{affiliate}} of the Detroit Tigers playing in the American Association. They played their first Triple-A game on April 11, a 3–1win, against the Buffalo Bisons at Greer Stadium. The next day, Nashville competed in an exhibition game against their major league affiliate. The Tigers outlasted the Sounds, winning by a score of 9–3 in the tenth inning. Seven games into the season, manager Lee Walls came <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> illness, and Nashville outfielder Leon Roberts became the acting manager for seven games until Gordon Mackenzie was brought on to lead the club {{for the rest of}} year. On July 17, Bryan Kelly pitched the club's second no-hitter against the Oklahoma City 89ers, in which the Sounds won, 6–0. Nashville ended the season with a 71–70 record and in second place in the Eastern Division, two-and-a-half games out of first behind the eventual league champion Louisville Redbirds.|$|E

5|$|The {{next two}} seasons {{would be a}} {{regression}} for both the team and Sanchez as they failed to reach the playoffs. Fans and media critics called for a struggling Sanchez to be benched. He eventually was replaced {{towards the end of}} the 2012 season by Greg McElroy. Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury during the preseason in 2013; he was released after the season concluded and was subsequently signed by the Philadelphia Eagles. When Philadelphia's starter Nick Foles went <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injury, Sanchez started the second half of the season for the Eagles, where he set career highs in completion percentage and passer rating, while also passing for 2,418 yards despite only starting 8 games.|$|E
5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature {{had given him a}} sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E
5|$|Three former Sounds {{players have}} also managed the Sounds. Seven games into the 1985 season, Leon Roberts, {{who started the}} season as a Nashville outfielder, became the acting manager for seven games due to manager Lee Walls coming <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> illness. Roberts was {{replaced}} by Gordon Mackenzie and returned to playing for the Sounds. After later retiring from playing, Roberts was hired to manage the 1986 team. Wayne Garland, who pitched for the Sounds in 1982, managed the team briefly during the 1988 managerial shuffle. Marty Brown managed the Sounds from 2001 to 2002 after having played for Nashville in 1988 and 1989.|$|E

5|$|While {{repairing}} one of {{the heat}} generators, Humphreys catches an eco-terrorist named Doug Spinney. He tells the group that there's a deadly swarm of insects in the forest and that they must avoid darkness to stay alive. The next morning, they find an old-growth tree cut <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unexplained band of green contained within its growth rings. Spinney suspects that an organism that was dormant in the tree for centuries was disturbed when the tree was illegally cut down. Humphreys hikes down to Moore's truck, but is killed by the swarm at nightfall. In the cabin, everyone else is kept safe by the light. The next morning, Spinney convinces Mulder to let him hike to his colleagues with gasoline so he can return with a Jeep to pick them up. Scully and Moore confront Mulder, since this will leave them with little fuel for the generator.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kick}} {{and a short}} return, Florida State began a drive at the Tech 34-yard line, {{seemingly}} in excellent field position. But on the first play of the State drive, the Seminoles were stopped for a loss. State was {{able to pick up}} a short gain on the second play, but on the third, Weinke was sacked {{for the third time in}} the game. After the Seminole punt and a touchback, Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> option run to Stith, then Vick ran for a long gain and another first down at the Florida State 20-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush up the middle of the field, then Vick completed a first-down pass to Derek Carter inside the Seminole 10-yard line. Kendrick advanced the ball to the Seminole three-yard line, then Vick ran the remaining yardage for a touchdown. Following the extra point, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 2814 with 37 seconds remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats' kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, and the Hokies began the first drive of the third quarter. Evans rushed for four yards, but Oglesby lost four yards on a run during the next play. Facing third and ten, Taylor picked up the first <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 11-yard run, but fumbled the ball {{at the end of}} the play. The loose ball was scooped up by Boone, who kept the Hokies' drive going at the Tech 30-yard line. After the fumble, Evans ran for seven yards and Taylor completed a 10-yard pass to Roberts for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Coale then rushed for seven yards on an end-around, and his run was followed by one by Boone, who ran for 16yards and a first down at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. Two more rushes by Roberts and Evans resulted in another first down, but once the Hokies passed the Cincinnati 20-yard line, the Bearcats' defense stiffened and denied the Hokies another first down. Facing fourth down, Tech again sent in Keys, who kicked a 35-yard field goal. The kick extended Tech's lead to 13–7 with 8:32 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Tolliver was {{slated to}} compete with Tommy Maddox for the backup quarterback spot at Atlanta as {{training}} camp rolled around. Halfway through August, Maddox was released, and Tolliver was made the primary backup behind Chris Chandler. Tolliver played his first NFL game since 1994 on September 7, 1997 against the Carolina Panthers. He completed 7 of 17 passes for 79 yards. After relieving Chandler again the following week, Tolliver was slated to start the next game against the 49ers, in what became his only starting appearance of the season. He was slated to start again against the Denver Broncos, but instead came in late in the game. He was almost able to lead the Falcons to a comeback victory over the Broncos, completing six of nine passes for 85 yards and a touchdown, but he instead lost to the then-undefeated Broncos as the team remained winless. When Chandler went <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injury in late October, coach Dan Reeves chose to start Tony Graziani. Shortly afterwards, Tolliver was released by the Falcons. In early November, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac was lost for the season due to a broken collarbone. As a result, the Chiefs signed Tolliver to a two-year contract as the third-string quarterback to replace him. Tolliver finished the season having completed 64 passes in 116 attempts for 677 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception. Only one of the 116 attempts came as a Kansas City quarterback. The 1998 preseason began with Tolliver competing with Pat Barnes for the third-string quarterback job, but this ended when Tolliver was released by the Chiefs in August.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall had no {{intentions}} to retire. He continued onto the early 1955 {{tour of the}} West Indies, the first by an Australian team to the Caribbean. Lindwall was determined to enjoy himself, having recovered from his recent illness. By day, he and Miller battled with the three W's but at night they socialised. However, Lindwall needed respite and dietary discipline in order to completely ward off his hepatitis. He {{was no longer the}} reveller that Miller once knew. After Australia had made 9/515, Lindwall took a match total of 6/124, as the hosts were forced to follow on in the First Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica. Australia went on to win by nine wickets. The team's travelled to Queen's Park in Trinidad for the Second Test, where the West Indies batted first and made 382. This time Lindwall bowled a long spell of 24.5 overs, and eventually prized out six of the West Indians for the cost of 95 runs. The culmination of this was a spell of 4/16. Australia replied with 9/600, with Lindwall contributing an unbeaten 37 with the bat. Lindwall's match soured in the second innings when he broke <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> achilles tendon problem as the match ended in a draw. Lindwall recovered {{for the start of the}} Third Test at Bourda in Georgetown, Guyana. Lindwall had a quiet time in a spin dominated game, taking two wickets in an eight-wicket Australian victory. Australia won the toss and batted in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados. Australia had already reached 6/439 when Lindwall came to the crease. In a highly aggressive innings, he reached his fifty in 69 minutes and was unbeaten on 80 at stumps. The next morning, he went on the make his second Test century, scoring 118 with two sixes and 16 fours. It was his second century at Test level, eight years after his first, but showed the same counter-attacking aggression. Lindwall had another quiet match with two wickets in another high scoring draw with both teams amassing more than 500 in the first innings. Lindwall finished the series with four wickets in the Fifth Test in Jamaica as Australia completed a 3–0 series win with another innings triumph. In a high scoring series, Lindwall had taken 20 wicket at 31.85 while also scoring 187 runs at 37.40, a strong all round performance.|$|E
