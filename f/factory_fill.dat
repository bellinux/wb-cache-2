50|$|Through {{the late}} 1970s, Ford {{transmissions}} were factory {{filled with a}} fluid identified as ESW M2C33-F. To provide a fluid that {{would be available to}} the general public for service fill, oil companies and other than <b>factory</b> <b>fill</b> suppliers were allowed to develop fluids meeting the ESW M2C33-F specification and market these fluids under their own brand names but identified as Type F. A second generation of transmission fluid was released in 1974 as the <b>factory</b> <b>fill</b> specification, ESW M2C138-CJ. This fluid was developed to modify the vehicle shifting characteristics and to provide considerable improvement in the oxidation resistance and anti-wear performance. No service fluids were developed and for a short time, DEXRON fluids approved by General Motors were considered acceptable.With continuing changes and improvements in transmission design, a centrifugal lock-up torque converter clutch was introduced into the C5 transmission to smooth engine vibrations sensed by the occupant of the vehicle. An associated shudder problem forced the introduction of the <b>factory</b> <b>fill</b> specification ESP M2C166-H. Servicing transmissions with DEXRON fluids was unacceptable since not all DEXRON fluids were capable of eliminating the shudder phenomenon. The fluids that could be used were a subset of the DEXRON fluids.The advent of Type H as <b>factory</b> <b>fill</b> necessitated the development of a service fluid specification to match the performance expected from Type H. This resulted in the release of the MERCON specification in 1987.|$|E
50|$|The island {{became a}} {{peninsula}} {{in the early}} 20th century when the Gallaudet Aircraft Company constructed America's first seaplane-only factory at Chepiwanoxet cc. 1916. For truck access to the <b>factory,</b> <b>fill</b> was dumped into the marsh, making a causeway from Alger Avenue that still remains. As a result of blocking water circulation around the island, Arnold Cove lost its boat channel from silt deposits in the tidal marsh located on the North side of the island. With the island made of sand deposits it was subject to shore erosion. The Gallaudet Company built wood bulkheads around the North, East and South shores with rock rip-rap on the waterside and fill behind. With many factory workers living north of the old cove, a narrow wood plank bridge was built across the marsh to allow quicker access to/from work.|$|E

This conduct to conclude, that the socalled egg-shell effect is more related to coatings having a weak adhesion and process chain. It was experimentally shown, that a-C and ta-C thin film coatings can be slip-rolling resistant at RT at least up to ten million of cycles under a Hertzian contact pressures P 0 mean of up to 1. 94 GPa.

50|$|Risley Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) was a <b>filling</b> <b>factory.</b> It {{received}} the explosives in bulk, usually by rail, from other ROFs {{where they were}} manufactured. Risley specialised in filling them into the various casings to produce the finished munitions. There were 16 <b>filling</b> <b>factories</b> {{around the country and}} Risley was known as <b>Filling</b> <b>Factory</b> No. 6. Others in the north west included Chorley (No. 1) and Kirkby (No. 7). One of the features common to all of the <b>filling</b> <b>factories</b> was an area of storage bunkers where the finished munitions were stored awaiting dispatch. The areas within the <b>filling</b> <b>factories</b> were all numbered in the same way. Storage bunkers were designated Area 9. Risley had 20 such bunkers and Area 9 is roughly {{in the area of the}} main field in Birchwood Forest Park today. When the new town area of Birchwood was created, most of the bunkers were demolished, but 4 of them were left in place and can still be seen today.|$|R

It was decommissioned in 1945, became a storage area for ex-military vehicles which were then auctioned-off onsite, and was closed in 1985.
