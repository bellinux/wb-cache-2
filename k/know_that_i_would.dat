500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} has been some fault; but Flo, dearest, listen to me. You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask you to do nothing from which a woman should shrink." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{not your}} fault <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't take a hint," [...] he {{answered}} quietly. [...] "But you are very young; and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never change." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not abandon}} you! Did you not <b>know</b> it? say <b>that</b> you <b>knew</b> it?" [...] said Clara, {{and then she}} insisted on having an answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "True {{to myself}}," [...] {{repeated}} Nostromo. [...] "How do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not be true}} to myself if I told {{you to go to}} the devil with your propositions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, sire, what reasons {{can there}} be for such questions? They touch my honor very nearly. You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> part with Calais only when I parted with my soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] he said. [...] "There is {{only one}} reason {{in the world that}} I would admit--I don't even <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> accept that. The other things don't count. They don't exist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Gambart, [...] "isn't this vexing? <b>I</b> {{thought it}} <b>would</b> please him so much, for {{of course he}} <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never press him for the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know!</b> <b>I</b> always <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>know,</b> if <b>I</b> {{only thought}} hard enough. It is a club for {{fighting}} with. When {{the white men}} go to war they always use these things." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{elderly woman}} once wrote Knudsen to ask which numbers she should {{play in the}} lottery. Knudsen replied, “If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{personally}} buy the number, instead of living as a poor man.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{should have}} told you not. Good gracious! has it come to this, that you {{correspond}} with a young gentleman without my leave, and when you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have given it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} about that," [...] said Mr. Grey. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go simply to do him an injury; but I think that I would go to see that justice is properly done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, Mrs. Bowen, to do anything--say anything--that {{is painful}} to you," [...] Colville began. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give {{the world to}} please you----" [...] The words escaped him and left him staring at her, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thy taunts and effrontery {{will not}} avail thee, knave," [...] he cried. [...] "Thou <b>knowest</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have engaged thee {{as the leader}} of a chosen band, to favor the flight of one dear from Venice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You darling!" [...] he said; [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{surprise}} you. <b>I</b> {{came right}} up from Plymouth by the night train. And I have long leave, {{and plenty of}} time to get married. Isn't it jolly, dear Laura?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} I was {{entitled}} to the shot, though as the bird headed slightly toward me there was some doubt about the matter. Allinson gave me the full benefit, though I think he must have <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> miss." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{trace of}} color {{crept into the}} man's face, and his voice was a trifle hoarse as he said, [...] "Do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask {{nothing better than to}} take every care you had, and bear it for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! {{when you}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do {{anything}} on earth for your love. Why, you make any one think that loving {{is a thing}} {{that can be done}} and undone, and put on and put off at a mere whim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} {{the right thing to}} do, Dave," [...] was Ben's comment. [...] "But I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have thought of it. You are a quick thinker, and I guess we have you to thank for saving our lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once DarkComet {{was linked}} to the Syrian regime, Lesueur stopped {{developing}} the tool stating that, “I never imagined it would be used by a government for spying,” he said. “If <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never have created such a tool.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Child, child," [...] {{said the}} Queen, really moved, [...] "Heaven <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> gladly {{practise}} clemency if my people would suffer it, but they fear for my life, {{and still more}} for themselves, were I removed, nor can I blame them." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{they told}} me that Casios were used by Al Qaeda and the watch was for explosives, I was shocked... If <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have thrown it away. I'm not stupid. We have four chaplains Guantanamo; all of them wear this watch.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so fast, sir; {{how do you}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not rather defer our {{marriage}} for some years? That would leave you time to misbehave, and then if I liked some one else better, I should have an excuse for jilting you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My darling girl, it is {{for your}} own good, {{for the good of}} us all, that you should marry this man. Do you not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not tell you so, if it were not true? I cannot be more good to you than that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Certainly I would,” Stephen said. “I don’t <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fight a big man, because evidently I {{should have}} very little chance with him; but if I quarrelled with a fellow my own age, we should of course pitch into each other without any {{question}} of rank.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{followed}} you," [...] he answered. [...] "I think you <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> tried not to," [...] he went on, after a moment's pause. [...] "I fought against it {{as hard as}} I could; {{but in the end}} I had to give in." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS RAMSDEN. What {{is the use}} {{of saying}} no, Roebuck? Octavius <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not turn any truly contrite and repentant woman from your doors. But when a woman is not only wicked, but intends to go on being wicked, she and I part company.|$|R
6000|$|Ashley: [...] "Thank you. Now I {{will tell}} you what I was really going to ask. Why did you wish to drive me back to Miss Fray when you <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be false to her a {{thousand}} times if I could only once be true to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Arthur," [...] she persisted, in a {{voice of}} keen pain, [...] "is there any {{difference}} between conscience and what you call fear? I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sometimes do wrong, and that fear prevents me. We have all good and bad in us, and--the good overcame the bad in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a cook o’ mine put ashore {{like that}} once," [...] said Captain Trimblett, in a {{reminiscent}} voice; [...] "only I don’t <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have called it}} ’wafting,’ and, so far as my memory goes, he didn’t either. He {{had a lot to}} say about it, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not. For a time {{it might}} serve him perhaps. Here is the cab. Here they are. Yes; {{you had better}} go down and let your mother know that I am here. They will perhaps take him up to bed, so that I need not see him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Ned said, [...] "Charlie <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not tell}} a lie to save my life, though he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might {{possibly}} kill any one when I am {{in one of my}} horrible tempers; and I did think I was getting over them, Mr. Porson!" [...] he broke out with a half sob. [...] "I have really tried hard." ...|$|R
50|$|Gerald B. Tonkens {{was born}} in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1919 where he was exposed to many {{examples}} of Frank Lloyd Wright’s architecture from a young age. This had a lasting effect on Tonkens, who later stated “I always admired Mr Wright’s work. <b>I</b> always <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never build a house on my own unless it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright”.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{went against}} the grain to have {{dealings}} with such a man, for I was born of honest people, but if the ould gentleman himself had offered {{me a couple of}} saws, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to give him a thousand years extra of purgatory, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have closed with the bargain. Those two saws cost me another louis, and cheap enough, too.|$|R
