40|$|Abstract. The {{continuous}} processing {{technology of}} wool slenderizing integrated with biologic enzyme modification is introduced in this paper. Fiber fineness is obviously reduced by this technology, {{at the same}} time, wool scales are efficiently removed. Thus, wool quality is also largely enhanced. This provides favorable raw materials {{for the development of}} high added value products. Demand bloom of slenderized wool With the development of wool fabrics and knitting garments towards frivolity, the yarn count of wool tends to be thinning. In 2006 ”Weierjia CUP ” appraisal through comparison of excellent new product, yarn counts of worsted fabrics equal to or under 11. 11 tex account for 46 % in total. And the weight of worsted wool fabrics 6. 25 tex/ 2 is under 130 g/m 2. Furthermore, the independently developed 12. 5 tex single warp and single weft products are only 69 g/m 2 in weight. Yarn counts of wollen fabrics are mainly <b>fine</b> <b>count</b> wollen yarns of 45. 45 tex. The light and thin products enhance the demand of <b>fine</b> <b>count</b> wools. <b>Fine</b> <b>count</b> wools mainly come from Australia. In recent years, China becomes the main importer of Australia on <b>fine</b> <b>count</b> wools (19 µm and even thinner) and super <b>fine</b> <b>count</b> wools (15. 6 - 18. 5 µm).

50|$|Ring frame (1929) {{developed}} {{out of the}} Throstle frame (19th century) {{an improvement}} on the Arkwright's Water frame. Originally rings were only suitable for coarse counts, they were lower and heavier than mules so needed stronger floors but lower rooms. Over time, rings became suitable for <b>finer</b> <b>counts</b> and because of cheaper labour costs they replaced mules. By 1950 all mills had converted to the Ring frame. The Hawk mill in Shaw near Oldham was still operating cotton mule frames in 1964/65.|$|R
50|$|As the 18th century progressed each town {{developed}} a different specialism. Oldham was a <b>spinning</b> town producing <b>fine</b> <b>counts</b> while Wigan did coarse. Burnley became a weaving town, producing plain calicos for printing, while but Blackburn did fancies using Jacquard looms. In the 20th century there was consolidation into larger units of production. To the north-east thousand-loom sheds were built while {{to the south}} we saw the {{quarter of a million}} spindles Edwardian ring spinning mills. Ring spinners were usually paid by the hour not the piece.|$|R
50|$|The {{new method}} was {{compared}} with the self-acting spinning mule which was developed by Richard Roberts using the more advanced engineering techniques in Manchester. The ring frame was reliable for coarser <b>counts</b> while Lancashire <b>spun</b> <b>fine</b> <b>counts</b> as well. The ring frame was heavier, requiring structural alteration in the mills and needed more power. These were not problems in the antebellum cotton industry in New England. It fulfilled New England's difficulty in finding skilled spinners: skilled spinners were plentiful in Lancashire. In the main the requirements on the two continents were different, and the ring frame was not the method of choice for Europe at that moment. Mr Samuel Brooks of Brooks & Doxey Manchester was convinced of {{the viability of the}} method. After a fact-finding tour to the States by his agent Blakey, he started to work on improving the frame. It was still too primitive to compete with the highly developed mule frames, let alone supersede them. He first started on improving the doubling frame, constructing the necessary tooling needed to improve the precision of manufacture. This was profitable and machines offering 180,000 spindle were purchased by a sewing thread manufacturer.|$|R

Aida cloth is sold in precut sheets or in bolts of 40" [...] - 60" [...] width at most craft stores.|$|R
5000|$|Originally it was {{designed}} to spin best Egyptian cottons, in what was technically termed [...] "combed" [...] and [...] "super carded yarns." [...] However, in 1913 it started spinning mediums, 34s to 78s from American, Brazilian and Egyptian. By 1916 it had dropped Brazilian and did 40s to 90s, it then in 1917 purchased combing equipment and produced up to 120s then by 1929 it purchased Egyptian solely and ran 140s. They employed 300 people. The cotton count {{is a measure of the}} fineness if the yarn- the higher number being the finer.

On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on <b>fine</b> <b>count</b> it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|R
50|$|The 1834 mill {{consisted}} of an engine house with detached chimney, a five storey spinning mill and a two storey 60m by 11m weaving shed.
