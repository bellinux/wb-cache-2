This paper describes multiresolution concepts for 3 D maps and their texture-based design. In our approach, 3 D maps {{are based on}} a hybrid, multiresolution terrain model composed of data sets having different topological structure, for example a coarse regular grid combined with by triangulated microstructures. Any number of texture layers can be associated with the terrain model. For each texture layer, the multiresolution structure builds a texture tree which is linked to geometry patches of the multiresolution terrain model. The terrain model together with multiple texture layers can be rendered in real-time, in particular if multitexturing is available. Texture layers can be combined by high-level operations such as blending and masking, and can be rebuilt at run-time. This mechanism simplifies the implementation of visual exploration tools and of procedural, automated map designs. 3 D maps facilitate the visual simulation of environmental issues in spatial support systems, virtual reality applications, real-time GIS, and <b>interactive</b> <b>cartography.</b> 1...|$|E

One {{of the most}} discussed issues {{is the definition of}} data collection districts or analytical spatial units. As for census data, the boundaries of the collection districts have to be constant, but the population may vary heavily; thus it is difficult to achieve homogeneity regarding population numbers or equality (King 2001; Fekete 2012), though some (theoretical) approaches have been proposed to overcome this difficulty (Openshaw 1984; Madelin et al. 2009). The arbitrariness of the analytical units’ definition is mostly pragmatically motivated, but may sometimes be politically motivated also. However, it almost inevitably leads to a statistical bias called “modifiable areal unit problem” (MAUP). The issue was described in detail by Openshaw (1984, p. 4): “Whereas census data are collected for essentially non-modifiable entities (people, households) they are reported for arbitrary and modifiable areal units (enumeration districts, wards, local authorities).” Recognition of the MAUP has resulted in a number of proposed solutions, such as interpolation and smoothing, the visualization of size effects in cartograms, gridding-methods, and <b>interactive</b> <b>cartography</b> (Madelin et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Working from {{assumptions}} that inequality is often spatially informed, {{a set of}} <b>interactive</b> <b>cartographies</b> has recently proliferated on Google Earth. In this essay, I analyze one of those interactive cartographies: The World is Witness produced by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). I read the map as an organizational rhetoric that frames place as 2 ̆ 2 embedded injustice. 2 ̆ 2 I also argue that thorough analysis of the framing of local place on Google Earth must inherently question whether the map can create a disruption in the viewing subject. While the map presents vital information on excruciatingly despicable acts of injustice, and the USHMM should be praised for its actions, it reinforces and {{is reinforced by the}} politics of viewing on Google Earth...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we seek to}} {{interrogate}} the methods and assumptions underpinning geocriticism by engaging with and reframing dominant ways of analysing mediated representations of Australian space in cultural narratives, specifically film, literature, and theatre. What, we ask, might geocriticism contribute {{to the analysis of}} Australian texts in which location figures prominently? We argue a geocritical approach may provide an interdisciplinary framework that offers a way of identifying tropes across geographic regions and across media representations. Drawing on scholarship spanning Australian cinematic, literary and theatrical narratives, this chapter surveys published work in the field and posits that a refined geocritical mapping and analysis of the cultural terrain foregrounds the significance of geography to culture and draws different traditions of spatial enquiry into dialogue without privileging any particular textual form. We conclude by scoping possibilities for future research emerging from recent technological developments in <b>interactive</b> online <b>cartography...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the current state of science regarding cartographic interaction, a complement to the traditional focus within cartography on cartographic representation. Cartographic interaction is defined as the dialog between a human and map, mediated through a computing device, and is essential to the research into <b>interactive</b> <b>cartography,</b> geovisualization, and geovisual analytics. The review is structured around six fundamental questions facing a science of cartographic interaction: (1) what is cartographic interaction (e. g., digital versus analog interactions, interaction versus interfaces, stages of interaction, interactive maps versus mapping systems versus map mash-ups); (2) why provide cartographic interaction (e. g., visual thinking, geographic insight, the stages of science, the cartographic problematic); (3) when should cartographic interaction be provided (e. g., static versus interactive maps, interface complexity, the productivity paradox, flexibility versus constraint, work versus enabling interactions); (4) who should be provided with cartographic interaction (e. g., user-centered design, user ability, expertise, and motivation, adaptive cartography and geocollaboration); (5) where should cartographic interaction be provided (e. g., input capabilities, bandwidth and processing power, display capabilities, mobile mapping and location-based services); and (6) how should cartographic interaction be provided (e. g., interaction primitives, objective-based versus operator-based versus operand-based taxonomies, interface styles, interface design) ? The article concludes with a summary of research questions facing cartographic interaction and offers an outlook for cartography as a field of study moving forward...|$|E
40|$|Cubic Reflections is a {{participatory}} arts-based {{research project}} that explores the sensory, spatial and ontological dimensions of learning environments through mapping and creative reflection. The project was initiated at Southern Cross University in 2013, when twelve site-specific cubes were created and installed in locations across the disciplinary domains of the Lismore campus in Northern NSW. The cubes {{were designed to}} form a network of reflexive objects that could connect both human and non-human modes of existence within an <b>interactive</b> <b>cartography.</b> Participants were invited to both activate and modify this network, by mapping and reflecting on their own movements within and between the twelve learning environments. The arts-based methodology developed for this project was informed by recent work in the anthropology and geography of the senses, as well as ecological philosophies associated with speculative realism. The research began with the siting, creation and installation of cubes in specific locations, {{taking into account the}} sensory and spatial dimensions of each site. Photographs were taken from the five faces of the cubes in each location, then reversed, printed in high resolution, and adhered to the respective faces of each cube. In this way, the cubes were literally used as surveying instruments for reflecting the non-human elements of different learning spaces. The cubes were then re-installed at each of the twelve sites, and a campus map was modified to illustrate the cubes’ locations. Following this, staff and students from the university were {{invited to participate in the}} project by navigating between each of the cubes, reflecting on each site through words, drawings and photographs, and transcribing their movements across the campus on the map provided. Participants were not primed in any way as to the implied meaning or significance of the work, but were rather encouraged to reflect creatively on their own experiences of the spaces through which they traveled. As a result, each participant interpreted and modified the project in a different way, providing responses that were personal and authentic rather than predetermined by research questions. One participant wrote a poem for each of the twelve locations, tying together observations of the surrounding flora and fauna with snippets of conversation overheard through classroom windows. Another created a virtual map of the project using a smartphone, replete with GPS coordinates, photographs and reflections on each cube and location. Yet another participant produced a complex drawing of her movements around the campus without lifting her pencil from the paper. In this way, the project successfully generated a multi-layered cartography of learning environments across the campus, as well as a deeper awareness of the relationships between humans and non-humans within those spaces...|$|E

The virtual environment and survey a lso contained propositions for future acoustic design interventions, particularly for sites-of-respite. The second project describes a recently completed pilot study, seeking suitable Locations in Melboume&# 039;s CBO for actual Sites-of-Respite, using a combination of sound recordings, studio analysis and spatial analysis. While research approaches have been informed by listener-centered interactive representational mapping, speculations are made on ft 1 ture research to be informed by performative mapping, particularly emotional mapping, to augment sound design interventions to recompose the homogeneity of the striated soundscape...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{must begin}} with a statement about the bias of the author. It is written {{from the perspective of}} a cartographer, designing and producing maps and map-related objects as artefacts in the representation of geography. These artefacts have progressed from very early in my career as hand-drawn maps, to computer-assisted <b>cartography,</b> <b>interactive</b> multimedia products and maps on the web, to mobile mapping. Each of these media applications appropriating cartography has resulted in my development of artefacts that, intially, conformed to conventions and specifications dictated by the &# 039;academy&# 039; of the cartographic profession. Evolving media allowed for the exploration of different approaches and, subsequently, a questioning of the &# 039;tried-and-true&# 039; conventional ways of developing representations of geography and their appropriateness for being the optimum medium for demonstrating and communicating information about geography. Therefore, it is indeed opportune to be invited to reflect on cartography; to appreciate Leon van Schaik&# 039;s ideograms, and to consider their effectiveness in communicating information about geography and the assumptions that both individuals and nations make about &# 039;their&# 039; geography, from the respective positions of aspect and prospect. The contribution defines maps and their usage. It reflects on how they have been employed to depict Australia over time, and finally, it considers Leon van Schaik&# 039;s ideogram and whether it can be considered to be a &# 039;map. &# 039...|$|R
