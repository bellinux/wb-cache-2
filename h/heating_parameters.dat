40|$|Purpose: Induction {{heating process}} {{is often used}} as {{the first stage of}} {{quenching}} process. Computer simulation of the induction heating make it possible to eliminate expensive and time-consuming experimental selection of parameters. The selection of appropriate <b>heating</b> <b>parameters</b> is particularly difficult for the irregularly shaped parts. Gears are an example of such elements. In the case of surface quenching / heating a uniform distribution of temperature field is necessary on the surface and expected temperature gradient inside the heated gear. The following parameters: inductor frequency, inductor power, heating time, inductor geometry, distance between inductor and heating gear and relative shift between inductor and gear {{have a significant effect on}} the temperature distribution. Obtaining the correct temperature distribution requires proper selection of the above mentioned parameters. Numerical optimization or multi-variant calculations are the best way to achieve the goal. Design/methodology/approach: This work presents numerical simulation of induction heating. Such simulation consists of an analysis of coupled electromagnetic and thermal fields. Commercial program Flux 3 D, was used to perform the calculations. Findings: Execution of 10 variants of calculation enables to obtain the optimal values of the parameters influencing the heating process. Practical implications: During the test quenching of the gear a problem of non uniform temperature distribution appears. The attempts of experimental selection of <b>heating</b> <b>parameters</b> failed, and the problem was solved by multi-variant calculations. The results obtained from the calculations were successfully applied in the quenching process. Originality/value: This paper shows an application of numerical simulation in gear quenching.
