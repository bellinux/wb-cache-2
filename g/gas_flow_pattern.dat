Using the taper type nozzle (AN 52 -nozzle) having the taper in the constrictor entrance region and the no-taper type nozzle (AN 50 -nozzle), experiments were made at the arc current 20 ∿ 73 A, the total gas flow rate 10 ∿ 20 l/min and the three kinds of <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> which were the cross flow pattern, vortex flow pattern and mixed flow pattern mixed the cross flow with vortex flow.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{analysis of the}} influence of the liquid rheology on the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> in a bubble column reactor. Aqueous solutions of xanthan are selected as an example of non-Newtonian shear thinning fluid. Averaged gas holdup is determined by two experimental techniques: parietal pressure probes and electrical resistance tomography (ERT). ERT is also used to provide 2 D images of the gas phase distribution in a column cross-section. Bubble size distributions are evaluated by a gas disengagement technique using the parietal pressure probes. All these techniques clearly show the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> is different in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Gas holdup values decrease when increasing the liquid viscosity and reach a minimum or a plateau. Homogeneous flow regime, observed in water at low gas velocities, tends to disappear when viscosity increases. This evolution is visualized by a much less isotropic distribution of the gas phase within cross-section of the column and by the appearance of much larger bubbles due to an increased coalescence phenomenon.

40|$|Gas {{injection}} into saturated porous {{media has}} a high practical relevance. It is applied in groundwater remediation (air sparging), in CO 2 sequestration into saline aquifers, and in enhanced oil recovery of petroleum reservoirs. This wide range of application necessitates a comprehensive understanding of gas flow patterns that may develop within the porous media and required modeling of multi-phase flow. There is an ongoing controversy in literature, if continuum models are able to describe the complex flow pattern observed in heterogeneous porous media, especially the channelized stochastic flow pattern. Based on Selker’s stochastic hypothesis, a gas channel {{is caused by a}} Brownian-motion process during gas injection. Therefore, the pore-scale heterogeneity will determine the shape of the single stochastic gas channels. On the other hand there are many studies on air sparging, which are based on continuum modeling. Up to date it is not clear under which conditions a continuum model can describe the essential features of the complex <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> on bench-scale and field scale using the continuum model TOUGH 2. Based on a comprehensive data set of bench-scale experiments and field-scale experiments, we conduct for the first time a systematic study and evaluate the prediction ability of the continuum model. A second focus of this study is the development of a “real world”-continuum model, since on all scales – pore-scale, bench scale, field scale – heterogeneity is a key driver for the stochastic <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern.</b> Therefore, we use different geostatistical programs to include stochastic conditioned and unconditioned parameter fields. Our main conclusion from bench-scale experiments is that a continuum model, which is calibrated by different independent measurements, has excellent prediction ability for the average flow behavior (e. g. the gas volume-injection rate relation). Moreover, we investigate the impact of both weak and strong heterogeneous parameter fields (permeability and capillary pressure) on <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern.</b> The results show that a continuum model with weak stochastic heterogeneity cannot represent the essential features of the experimental <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> (e. g., the single stochastic gas channels). Contrary, applying a strong heterogeneity the continuum model can represent the channelized flow. This observation supports Stauffer’s statement that a so-called subscale continuum model with strong heterogeneity is able to describe the channelized flow behavior. On the other hand, we compare the theoretical integral gas volumes with our experiments and found that strong heterogeneity always yields too large gas volumes. At field-scale the 3 D continuum model is used to design and optimize the direct gas injection technology. The field-scale study is based on the working hypotheses that the key parameters are the same as at bench-scale. Therefore, we assume that grain size and injection rate will determine whether coherent channelized flow or incoherent bubbly flow will develop at field-scale. The results of four different injection regimes were compared with the data of the corresponding field experiments. The main conclusion is that because of the buoyancy driven gas flow the vertical permeability has a crucial impact. Hence, the vertical and horizontal permeability should be implemented independently in numerical modeling by conditioned parameter fields...|$|E

Heated parts are taken out of the furnace and quenched at ambient pressure, casually using a blower to increase the heat exchange. Technical developments in the metal industry, over the last decades, have seen a constant improvement of the ratio of heat exchange, e. g. by using pressured chambers, specific blowers, and a variety of gases and gas mixtures. The current gas quenching technologies are adapted to heat treatable metals found in the automotive industry, requesting a minimum heat exchange ratio, also depending on the part geometry. Little has been however investigated concerning the quenched batch, defined as the arrangement of the heated parts onto a single- or multiple-layer charge carrier. The present work, through a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, provides guidelines to adapt the batch to a specific <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> (spatial fitting), and to adapt the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> to the batch structure (temporal fitting). Measurement techniques have been developed to assess the flow patterns inside industrial quenching chambers. Evaluated flow structures have been converted to numerical boundary conditions for extended simulations tools. Simulations have helped implementing technical solutions for flow correction in industrial gas quenching chambers. Furthermore, simulations have served the design of batches of various geometries, to improve both quenching homogeneity and intensity. Both experimental and numerical results confirmed the advantages of gas quenching for the homogeneous heat treatment of automotive steel grades, and demonstrated the potential of various flow correcting devices, such as perforated plates and cylindrical flow ducts.

Darcy’s law describes the flow pattern that the permeability has a linear relationship with the flow velocity. However, the stress induced deformation and damage can significantly influence the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> and permeability of coal. Coals from Songzao coalfield in Chongqing, southwest China were collected for the study. The gas flow velocities under different injection gas pressures and effective stresses in the intact coal and damaged coal were tested using helium, incorporating the role of <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> on the permeability of coal. The relationships between the flow velocity and square of gas pressure gradient were discussed, which can help us to investigate the transformation conditions of gas linear flow and gas nonlinear flow in the coal.

The low-velocity non-Darcy gas flow gradually occurred and the start-up pressure gradient increased in the coal as the effective stress increased. The gas flow rate in the damaged coal increased nonlinearly as the square of pressure gradient increased under low effective stress. The instability of gas flow caused by high ratio of injection gas pressure over effective stress in the damaged coal contributed to the increase of the gas flow rate. As the effective stress increased, the increase of gas flow rate in coal turned to be linear. The mechanisms of the phenomena were explored according to the experimental results. The permeability of coal was corrected based on the relationships between the flow velocity and square of gas pressure gradient, which showed advantages in accurately estimating the performance of coal reservoirs...|$|E

The BRAGFLO computer program which solves a system of nonlinear partial differential equations for two-phase flow, was used to investigate brine and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} repository for the 1996 WIPP performance assessment (PA). The present study examines the implications of modeling assumptions used in conjunction with BRAGFLO in the 1996 WIPP PA that affect brine and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> involving two waste regions in the repository (i. e., a single waste panel and the remaining nine waste panels), a disturbed rock zone (DRZ) that lies just above and below these two regions, and a borehole that penetrates the single waste panel and a brine pocket below this panel. The two waste regions are separated by a panel closure. The following insights were obtained from this study. First, the impediment to flow between the two waste regions provided by the panel closure model is reduced due to the permeable and areally extensive nature of the DRZ adopted in the 1996 WIPP PA, which results in the DRZ becoming an effective pathway for gas and brine movement around the panel closures and thus between the two waste regions. Brine and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> between the two waste regions via the DRZ causes pressures between the two to equilibrate rapidly, with the result that processes in the intruded waste panel are not isolated from the rest of the repository. Second, the connection between intruded and unintruded waste panels provided by the DRZ increases the time required for repository pressures to equilibrate with the overlying and/or underlying units subsequent to a drilling intrusion. Third, the large and areally extensive DRZ void volumes is a significant source of brine to the repository, which is consumed in the corrosion of iron and thus contributes to increased repository pressures. Fourth, the DRZ itself lowers repository pressures by providing storage for gas and access to additional gas storage in areas of the repository. Fifth, given the pathway that the DRZ provides for gas and brine to flow around the panel closures, isolation of the waste panels by the panel closures was not essential to compliance with the U. S.

40|$|M. Sc. (Physics) Amorhous silicon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} materials for large area solar cells for terestrial photovoltaic applications. Unfortunately these cells suffer from two serious problems: the efficiencies drop when laboratory processes are scaled up and the cells degrade after some exposure to sunlight. The exact causes of these two problems are still unknown. In this project some aspects of the above two problems where investigated. The drop in efficiency due to scaling up of laboratory processes can be ascribed to macroscopic inhomogeneities in the film. An investigation was done by changing the chamber geometry and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> to establish empirical conditions to obtain films with maximum macroscopic homogeneity. It was found that a uniform electric field above the substrate was the most important factor determining the macroscopic homogeneity of the film. The hydronamic <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> was of secondary importance. Some techniques to obtain a uniform electric field has been devised. The photo-degradation was investigated by illuminating films of o-Si. H with simulated sunlight for different lenghts of time. The change in the electrical and optical properties of the intrinsic films were determined as function of total photon flux. No change in the optical properties could be detected. The effect of the photo-degradation manifests itself in a drop in the the dark conductivity and photoconductivity. The observed phenomena is explained in terms of photo-induced deep levels in the gap. The Fermi level shifts to the middle of the gap due to these defect states, causing a drop in the free carrier concentration and conductivity. These defect levels increase the absorptiom coefficient in the long wavelength region, but they also decrease the lifetime of the photo-generated carriers. The photo-induced defects were investigated with the CPM-technique. A large part of this project involved the construction and commissioning of the CPM-apparatus. It was found that the light introduced two types of defects at energies 0. 5 eV and 0. 75 eV below the conduction band edge. The concentration of the defects increases with illumination, but saturates after about 24 hours of illumination. The defects could almost completely be annealed at ISOaC.

This technology is currently under development in a partnership of European companies and academia, with financial support from the EC and Swiss Government. The mathematical model developed for heat transfer and flow maldistribution has been used for counter-current checkerboard channelarrangement. Pressure drop has been analyzed both experimentally and numerically (computation fluid dynamics, CFD). Power density has been shown to depend on various reactor parameters. Channel geometry, inlet gas temperature difference and channel wall thickness have been calculated to find the influence on power density...|$|E
40|$|Both powder {{particle}} size control and {{efficient use of}} <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> energy are highly prized goals for gas atomization of metal and alloy powder to minimize off-size powder inventory (or 'reverb') and excessive gas consumption. Recent progress {{in the design of}} close-coupled gas atomization nozzles and the water model simulation of melt feed tubes were coupled with previous results from several types of <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> characterization methods, e. g., aspiration measurements and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> visualization, to make progress toward these goals. Size distribution analysis and high speed video recordings of gas atomization reaction synthesis (GARS) experiments on special ferritic stainless steel alloy powders with an Ar+O{sub 2 } gas mixture were performed to investigate the operating mechanisms and possible advantages of several melt flow tube modifications with one specific gas atomization nozzle. In this study, close-coupled gas atomization under closed wake <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> conditions was demonstrated to produce large yields of ultrafine (dia. < 20 {mu}m) powders (up to 32 %) with moderate standard deviations (1. 62 to 1. 99). The increased yield of fine powders is consistent with the dual atomization mechanisms of closed wake <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> in the near-field of the melt orifice. Enhanced size control by stabilized pre-filming of the melt with a slotted trumpet bell pour tube was not clearly demonstrated in the current experiments, perhaps confounded by the influence of the melt oxidation reaction that occurred simultaneously with the atomization process. For this GARS variation of close-coupled gas atomization, it may be best to utilize the straight cylindrical pour tube and closed wake operation of an atomization nozzle with higher <b>gas</b> mass <b>flow</b> to promote the maximum yields of ultrafine powders that are preferred for the oxide dispersion strengthened alloys made from these powders...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Suspended fly-ash {{particles}} in industrial emission gasses {{have a major}} degrading effect on the whole environment. Electrostatic precipitation {{is one of the}} oldest and most effective gas-cleaning processes used today. Electrostatic precipitators use electrostatic forces to clean the flue gas of ash particles. Stricter emission control laws force industries (like SASOL) to improve their electrostatic precipitators. This study consists of a comprehensive literature survey and the development of a numerical fluid flow model. The proper <b>flow</b> of the <b>gas</b> through an electrostatic precipitator is one of the most important factors to ensure high collection efficiencies. The <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> must be distributed over the whole flow domain in order to utilize the entire collecting area. The three-dimensional numerical model only considers the fluid dynamics of a precipitator. The finite volume method together with the SIMPLE algorithm is used to solve the fluid dynamic equations. The computer resources available are not sufficient to simulate the full detail of the structures inside a full-scale precipitator. Thus the precipitator flow domain was simplified by making certain assumptions and approximations. The distribution plates in the precipitator inlet ensure good gas distribution through the entire precipitator. Porous baffles are used to approximate the distribution plates and the electrical fields are approximated by porous mediums. The effect of the distribution plates and the electrical fields on the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> through the precipitator was investigated. The results have shown that the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> was expanded over the whole flow domain and the maximum velocity inside the precipitator was significantly reduced because of the effect of the distribution plates. The simulated <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> velocity profiles are in relative good agreement with measured velocity profiles. The methodology followed in this study can be used to predict <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> inside a precipitator but further research is necessary. Master...|$|R
40|$|Complex thermal-fluid {{systems may}} consist of many {{interacting}} components such as pipes, heat exchangers, turbines and boilers. The {{first of two}} major design challenges is to predict the performance of all the thermal-fluid components on the system level {{and the second is}} to predict the performance of the integrated plant consisting of all its sub-systems. The solution to both is an integrated Systems CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) approach that deals with various levels of complexity between individual models. To account for the interaction between components on system level a progressive approach can be followed by first using lumped models for all components and then refining individual models where necessary. To illustrate the application of a progressive analysis, this paper presents the practical example of a coal-fired boiler at a power station. A one-dimensional pipe network was used to determine the quality of the steam mixture and the heat transfer in the boiler riser tubes and these were linked to the detailed three-dimensional CFD model of the furnace. Results from the CFD model showed <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> and heat distributions inside the furnace. From the network model the temperatures and steam quality inside the riser tubes were obtained and it illustrated the process of steam generation inside the riser tubes...|$|R
