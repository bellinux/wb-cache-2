Post-mortem obtained wear volumes and volumetric wear rates were correlated to real-time recorded penetration depth curves versus sliding distance. Consecutive execution of gradually finer EDM regimes onto the WC-Co alloys was found to considerably enhance the wear performance.

The individual particle displacements were probed, providing insight into the behaviour of particles adjacent to the boundaries. In addition, the porosity and force distribution inside the sample were observed, allowing for estimates of the width of a boundary region to be made. This region, non-representative of far-field material behaviour, will affect the behaviour of a granular sample in DEM or laboratory tests, with local porosity differences leading to a change in the transport properties of the sample, and force distribution changes leading to a bias in the location of <b>grain</b> <b>cracking</b> or crushing events for sufficiently high stress levels.

The focus of this project was to systematically investigate the friction and sliding wear characteristics of three grades of WC-Co alloys to which refractory carbides TiC, TaC and NbC were added. The wear behaviour was characterized by sliding the carbide alloys against two grades of steel in a pin-on-disc configuration and determining the associated wear mechanisms. The influence of applied load and sliding velocity on the friction and wear response was also analyzed. The 304 stainless steel sliding pairs experienced 50 % more friction than the bright mild steel sliding pairs under all operating conditions. An increase in load caused a non-linear decrease in friction while an increase in sliding velocity did not have a significant effect. The WC-Co alloy to which small amounts of TaC and NbC were added was found to have the highest wear resistance under all the operating conditions tested. The wear mechanisms for the steels were predominantly smearing and groove formation caused by ploughing of the wear particles.

The role of grain orientation on the formation of sub-critical <b>grain</b> boundary <b>cracks</b> during creep of a conventionally cast nickel-based superalloy has been analyzed in this study. The crystallographic orientations of grain pairs adjacent to grain boundaries normal to the tensile axis were measured using Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD). The difference in the Schmid factor for the 1113 ̆c 1123 ̆e slip system between the grains was compared to the occurrence of sub-critical <b>grain</b> boundary <b>cracking.</b> In addition, {{the difference in the}} amount of potential primary creep strain between the grains (for unconstrained state) was analyzed. The uncracked grain boundaries were found to have small Schmid factor mismatch, as well as small potential primary creep strain mismatch, than those of the <b>cracked</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries. Larger mismatches in Schmid factor and potential primary creep strain indicate possible development of large enough stress concentration at the grain boundary sufficient to initiate sub-critical cracks. The experimental results suggest correlations between crystallographic orientation of the <b>grains</b> and sub-critical <b>cracking</b> at the <b>grain</b> boundary with a critical value for Schmid factor mismatch and potential primary creep strain mismatch in the creep tested alloy.

An {{investigation}} {{involving the}} erosion of WC-Co alloys by solid particle impact erosion was undertaken to determine the mechanism by which material is removed. For this purpose a simple particle-gas stream erosion apparatus was employed. The nineteen different WC-Co alloys studied were initially characterised according to mi crostructural and mechanical properties. An investigation {{of the influence of}} various parameters on erosion was conducted to establish the manner by which the WC-Co alloys were eroded. A limit in erosion rate occurred with increasing particle size for all samples, which is associated with ductile erosion. The variation of erosion rate with the angle of impact was found to be dependent on the binder content. A maximum in erosion occurred at a 90 u angle of incidence for the low cobalt content alloys and in the region of a SOU angle of incidence for high cobalt content alloys. Thus suggesting a predominantly brittle mode of erosion, with a ductile mode becoming more important with increasing binder content. The erosion rate was found to increase with decreasing hardness. For impact angles of 45 u and greater, the hardness effect was masked by microstructural influences. Examination of the steady state eroded surface and the single particle impact event, using the scanning electron microscope revealed three modes of material removal. These may occur simultaneously, the predominant mode, however, changes with binder content. For WC-Co alloys containing less than 10 wt-% cobalt, cobalt extrusion was observed as being the controlling mode of material removal. Maximum carbide <b>grain</b> <b>cracking</b> was associated with a cobalt content of 10 wt-%. Above this binder level ductile cutting of the matrix became an increasingly important mode of material removal...|$|E
40|$|As a {{major group}} of {{agricultural}} commodities, legume grains are widely grown and consumed globally, but are often utilised {{in the whole}} form. With increasing evidence of nutritional benefits, these grains are potentially sources of novel ingredients including starches. Accordingly {{the objective of this}} study has been to investigate legume starches, particularly their isolation, characterisation and incorporation into selected food products. Using chickpea, faba bean, lentil and mung bean, extraction procedures for the practical isolation of legume starches have been evaluated. A relatively simple method has been established, involving <b>grain</b> <b>cracking,</b> steeping in a mildly alkaline solution, followed by washing, double blending, double sieving and sedimentation. The starches collected for the four legumes were oven dried and the recoveries ranged between 29 and 38 %. Compositional analyses confirming that the isolation procedure gave relatively pure starches and scanning electron microscopy showed that the granules were typically ellipsoidal. Laser particle size analysis showed mono-modal distributions with mean diameters between 19. 6 and 23. 9 µm. X-ray diffractograms of legume starches were of the typical C-type, with variations in the intensities and peak distribution indicating some differences in the crystallinity of the starches. Suitable conditions for the measurement of starch gelatinisation characteristics by differential scanning calorimetry were investigated. When optimised conditions were applied, the temperature of gelatinisation ranged from 58. 9 for lentil to 65. 7 °C for mung bean with corresponding enthalpy values of 9. 2 and 5. 7 Jg- 1. Hot-stage optical microscopy confirmed gelatinisation patterns. The starch pastes demonstrated opalescence with some variation in the degree of clarity. The pasting and viscosity properties measured by the Rapid Visco-Analyser showed some variation in pasting temperatures and considerable differences in peak readings with faba bean starch having lowest and mung bean the highest with values of 307 and 676 RVA units, respectively. In order to study the incorporation of the legume starches, two Asian food products having starch as an ingredient, were selected and adapted as model foods. In this context, vermicelli represented a savoury product and coconut cake a sweet product. Vermicelli and coconut cake samples that incorporated chickpea starch were both preferred by most of the panellists over those containing the other legume starches. The overall conclusions are that the starch extraction method adapted in this investigation was a practical approach, producing relatively pure, white starches. The characteristics of the four legume starches showed many similarities, but there were some variations in the properties, indicating that there may be different applications for their incorporation into food formulations. Sensory evaluations confirmed the usefulness of the starches as food ingredients that provide attractive mouthfeel and textural characteristics. Therefore legume starches offer potential as novel food ingredients warranting further evaluation and larger scale feasibility studies...|$|E

The model is solved numerically using dislocation dipole boundary elements. The nonuniform propagation kinetics of short cracks is considered by defining grain boundaries as obstacles to plastic slip and crack propagation.

Microstructure influenced the S-N curves in long-life range. Thesubsurface crack initiation site was a facet or its aggregate which originated from the α <b>grain</b> transgranular <b>cracking</b> in each material. The size of subsurface crack initiation site highly depended on the maximum cyclic stress range...|$|R
