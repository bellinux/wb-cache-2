25|$|As {{mandated}} by law, {{and in order}} to establish the fuel category for each biofuel, EPA included in its modeling direct emissions and significant <b>indirect</b> <b>emissions</b> such as emissions from land use changes related to the full lifecycle. EPA's modeling of specific fuel pathways incorporated comments received through the third-party peer review process, and data and information from new studies and public comments. EPA's analysis determined that both ethanol produced from corn starch and biobutanol from corn starch comply with the 20% GHG emission reduction threshold required to classify as a renewable fuel. EISA grandfathered existing U.S. corn ethanol plants, and only requires the 20% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions for any renewable fuel produced at new facilities that commenced construction after December 19, 2007.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in quantifying the direct and indirect energy and carbon emission embodied in construction materials and building component production. By understanding how energy is consumed, designers can significantly reduce environmental impact by selecting materials with low embodied energy and carbon emission intensity. Previous research showed that <b>indirect</b> <b>emission</b> could be higher than direct emission for energy-intensive materials such as cement and reinforcement steel. It is argued that quantifying direct emission alone could underestimate {{the total amount of}} energy and carbon emission and subsequently its impact to the environment. However, <b>indirect</b> energy and <b>emission</b> assessment is a challenging task involving upstream process of construction materials production. To address this issue, this paper demonstrates the application of hybrid life cycle assessment to assess <b>indirect</b> carbon <b>emission</b> variation embodied in precast concrete structures.

40|$|Spatial {{interactions}} {{within a}} landscape {{may lead to}} large inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) transferred from cultivated areas and farms to oligotrophic ecosystems and induce environmental threats such as acidification, nitric pollution or eutrophication of protected areas. The paper presents a new methodology to estimate Nr fluxes at the landscape scale by taking into account spatial interactions between landscape elements. This methodology includes estimates of <b>indirect</b> Nr <b>emissions</b> due to short-range atmospheric and hydrological transfers. We used the NitroScape model which integrates processes of Nr transformation and short-range transfer in a dynamic and spatially distributed way to simulate Nr fluxes and budgets at the landscape scale. Four configurations of NitroScape were implemented by taking into account or not the atmospheric, hydrological or both pathways of Nr transfer. We simulated Nr fluxes, especially direct and <b>indirect</b> Nr <b>emissions,</b> within a test landscape including pig farms, croplands and unmanaged ecosystems. Simulation results showed the ability of NitroScape to simulate patterns of Nr emissions and recapture for each landscape element and the whole landscape. NitroScape {{made it possible to}} quantify the contribution of both atmospheric and hydrological transfers to Nr fluxes, budgets and <b>indirect</b> Nr <b>emissions.</b> For instance, <b>indirect</b> N 2 O emissions were estimated at around 21 % of the total N 2 O emissions. They varied within the landscape according to land use, meteorological and soil conditions as well as topography. This first attempt proved that the NitroScape model is a useful tool to estimate the effect of spatial interactions on Nr fluxes and budgets as well as <b>indirect</b> Nr <b>emissions</b> within landscapes. Our approach needs to be further tested by applying NitroScape to several spatial arrangements of agro-ecosystems within the landscape and to real and larger landscapes...|$|R

Direct measurements of N₂O yields and fluxes in aquatic river environments are sparse and more data are required to determine the role that rivers play in the global N₂O budget.

Gas bubble ebullition was observed at the river source with bubbles containing 7. 9 µL N₂O L⁻¹. River NO₃–N and dissolved N₂O concentrations ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 3 mg L⁻¹ and 0. 4 to 1. 9 µg N₂O-N L⁻¹ respectively with N₂O saturation reaching 404 %. Floating headspace chambers were used to sample N₂O fluxes. N₂O–N fluxes were significantly related to dissolved N₂O–N concentrations (r² = 30. 6) but not to NO₃–N concentrations. The N₂O–N fluxes ranged from 38 - 501 µg m⁻² h⁻¹, averaging 171 µg m⁻² h⁻¹ (± Std. Dev. 85) overall. The measured N₂O–N fluxes equated to an EF 5 -r of only 6. 6 % of that calculated using the IPCC methodology, and this itself was considered to be an over-estimate due to the degassing of antecedent dissolved N₂O present in the groundwater that fed the river...|$|R

40|$|Processes {{in which}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation is produced {{directly or indirectly}} via intermediate waves are reviewed. It is shown that strict theoretical constraints exist for electrons to produce nonthermal levels of radiation directly by the Cerenkov or cyclotron resonances. In contrast, <b>indirect</b> <b>emission</b> processes in which intermediary plasma waves are converted into radiation are often favored on general and specific grounds. Four classes of mechanisms involving the conversion of electrostatic waves into radiation are linear mode conversion, hybrid linear/nonlinear mechanisms, nonlinear wave-wave and wave-particle processes, and radiation from localized wave packets. These processes are reviewed theoretically and observational evidence summarized for their occurrence. Strong evidence exists that specific nonlinear wave processes and mode conversion can explain quantitatively phenomena involving type III solar radio bursts and ionospheric emissions. On the other hand, no convincing evidence exists that magnetospheric continuum radiation is produced by mode conversion instead of nonlinear wave processes. Further research on these processes is needed...|$|R
