5|$|After being {{questioned}} sharply, Đính quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International {{asked him to}} name the country that he was referring to, but Đính dodged the question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero {{should be able to}} identify the national enemy, and asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Madame Nhu, the de facto First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, Đính stormed out of the conference.|$|E
5|$|Doggett soon attacks Mulder {{for looking}} into his son's case, but Reyes {{explains}} {{why they are}} investigating. She reveals that Bob Harvey, a suspect in Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption. He asks her what made her start to believe in the paranormal. She says she realized she was “afraid to believe.” Scully later tells Mulder to keep trying to help Doggett.|$|E

Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another.

After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible.

5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in the glare of search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Black finds a {{group of}} obelisks in the woods. He is about to examine one when Beebe appears, chased by dogs. The Old Man also arrives, and Black asks <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> off his dogs. The Old Man denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless. Black then sees that the obelisks all bear an ouroboros, {{the symbol of the}} Millennium Group. He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. The Old Man then brings Black to a {{clearing}} full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are embodiments of the evil in the world. He approaches them as stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. The Old Man then explains that the world's balance between good and evil is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, {{is one of the many}} small things upsetting this balance.|$|E
5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

25|$|Spurrier was Science Hill's {{starting}} quarterback for two years, {{during which time}} Coach Kermit Tipton installed a passing offense {{to take advantage of}} Spurrier's talents and occasionally allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> plays.

25|$|Gálvez {{immediately}} began planning a counterattack. On 25 November his forces began besieging the fort, now under Dalrymple's control, engaging in regular exchanges of cannon fire. Gálvez, whose force {{was smaller than}} Dalrymple's, magnified its apparent size by setting extra campfires around the fort. He then attempted an assault on 29 November but difficulties with his artillery caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it off. Still, Dalrymple, whose forces were significantly reduced by tropical diseases, withdrew his men from the fort and evacuated them that same day.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1770s, the Tây Sơn revolt broke out and quickly {{occupied}} {{a large part}} of the Nguyễn Lords’ territory, in the southern half of modern-day Vietnam. Moreover, the Trịnh lords, who ruled the northern half of the country, sent a large army to attack, which forced Lord Nguyễn Phúc Thuần to flee to Trấn Biên (present-day Đồng Nai). The Tây Sơn kept pursuing Nguyễn Phúc Thuần and forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for reinforcements from the Nguyễn garrison in Saigon, but the Nguyễn governor of Saigon could not send his reinforcements in time. This situation gave Đỗ Thanh Nhơn the chance to aid the Nguyễn lord.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1936 {{elections}} Bau {{advocated the}} strategy of a broad Right-wing alliance, an option which has never materialized; himself he competed {{on the list of}} Front Català d’Ordre and was elected from Tarragona.

Once Lorenzo Maria Alier resigned as Carlist Catalan jefe in February 1936 one of the options considered was a triumvirate including Bau, but eventually it was Tomàs Caylà appointed the new regional leader.|$|E

Dubinsky, by his own account, thought that Sigman was too rash and appears to have urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a truce after the left wing-led unions led a campaign to reject a proposed agreement that Sigman had negotiated with the industry in 1925, bringing more than 30,000 members to a rally at Yankee Stadium {{to call for a}} one-day stoppage on August 10, 1925.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell {{became the}} Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in the Parliament of 1628–1629, {{as a client}} of the Montagu family of Hinchingbrooke House. He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the Arminian Bishop Richard Neile), which was poorly received. After {{dissolving}} this Parliament, Charles I ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the Bishops' Wars, shortage of funds forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for Cambridge, but it lasted for only three weeks and {{became known as the}} Short Parliament.
