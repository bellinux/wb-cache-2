Following the recapture of Constantinople and the restoration of the Byzantine Empire in 1261, one of the chief priorities of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (ruled 1259–1282) was the defence of his capital from a Venetian attack. Consequently, he sought an alliance with Venice's major antagonist, the Republic of Genoa, while he began building up his own navy.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} the forces ranged against L.Ron Hubbard, {{in this war}} he never started, {{it is necessary to}} gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned.

25|$|As {{a result}} of severe supply problems, {{as well as the}} lack of textile {{factories}} in the Confederacy and the successful Union naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, homespun uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as butternut (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a <b>hodgepodge</b> <b>of</b> civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure Union Army uniform parts from captured supplies and dead Union soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.|$|E
25|$|While {{the earlier}} {{years of the}} IHSA saw a <b>hodgepodge</b> <b>of</b> systems for {{organizing}} each event's state playoff series, there exists today a more uniform system. The IHSA attempts to organize state championship events geographically, so that {{different regions of the}} state are represented in state finals competition. Though not every competition uses it, the Regional (R) tournament is generally the lowest level of competition, and is open to every team that is eligible to enter. This is followed by Sectional (S) competition, and is followed by the State (F) level. In some sports, there is a single game Super-Sectional (SS), which follows the Sectional, and determines the state qualifier. In some regions where teams are further from one another, the sectionals are divided into sub-sectionals for seeding purposes. The following is an overview of the state series. Unless noted, boys and girls sports use identical systems. In all cases, seeding is either conducted by a conclave of coaches, or is made by criterion of best scores or times (as in track & field).|$|E
25|$|The early Manchukuo Imperial Army {{inherited}} a <b>hodgepodge</b> <b>of</b> weapons {{from the former}} Kuomintang arsenals of the Young Marshal, which created tremendous problems with maintenance and supply. For example, there were 26 kinds of rifles and over 20 kinds of pistols in use in 1932. A priority was made to unify weaponry around the Arisaka Type 38 Rifle as a standard, along with the Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun and Type 11 Light Machine Gun. Artillery units were to be equipped with the Type 38 Field Gun and Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun. By 1935, 50,000 Type 38 cavalry rifles had been imported from Japan and the machine guns were replaced {{over the next two}} or three years. By the start of the Pacific War, the weaponry of the Manchukuo Imperial Army was the almost same as the Japanese Army. Mauser pistols were used by soldiers and Browning and Colt pistols were used by the officers. The rear-line defense units and militias were given captured Chinese and out-dated Japanese rifles. Some ZB-30 machine guns, popular among the Nationalists, found their way into Manchukuoan service, along with Japanese copies of German and French models. IN 1936 some of the ZBs were replaced by Type 11 light machine guns. By 1933, the number of guns in service was 77,268 rifles, 441 light machine guns and 329 heavy machine guns.|$|E
40|$|Functionality of {{software}} systems has exploded {{in part because}} of advances in programming-language support for packaging reusable functionality as libraries. Developers benefit from the uniformity that comes of exposing many interfaces in the same language, as opposed to stringing together <b>hodgepodges</b> <b>of</b> command-line tools. Domain-specific languages may be viewed as an evolution of the power of reusable interfaces, when those interfaces become so flexible as to deserve to be called programming languages. However, common approaches to domain-specific languages give up many of the hard-won advantages of library-building in a rich common language, and even the traditional approach poses significant challenges in learning new APIs. We suggest that instead of continuing to develop new domain-specific languages, our community should embrace library-based ecosystems within very expressive languages that mix programming and theorem proving. Our prototype framework Fiat, a library for the Coq proof assistant, turns languages into easily comprehensible libraries via the key idea of modularizing functionality and performance away from each other, the former via macros that desugar into higher-order logic and the latter via optimization scripts that derive efficient code from logical programs...|$|R

500|$|The form {{of private}} or {{personalized}} ritual characterized as [...] "magic" [...] might {{be conducted in}} a <b>hodgepodge</b> <b>of</b> languages. Magic, and even some therapies for illnesses, almost always involved incantation or the reciting of spells (carmina), often accompanied by the ritualized creation of inscribed tablets (lamellae) or amulets. These are known from both archaeological artifacts and written texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri, a collection of spells dating variously from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. Although Augustus attempted to suppress magic by burning some 2,000 esoteric books early in his reign, magical practices were disseminated widely throughout the Greco-Roman world, and attest to an awareness of multilingualism among {{the peoples of the}} Empire. Spells were not translated, because their efficacy was thought to reside in their precise wording; a language such as Gaulish thus may have persisted for private ritual purposes when it no longer had everyday currency.|$|E
