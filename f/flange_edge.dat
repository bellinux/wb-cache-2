40|$|Abstract: To replace full {{penetration}} weld {{with twin}} fillet weld for the design and construction of joint of beam to CFST (concrete-filled steel tube) column with interior strengthening ring, six specimens were tested by incremental loading and cyclic loading. The finite element package ANSYS was used to study the nonlinear behavior of such specimens. The finite element model was validated by comparing the computed values with experimental results. The failure mode was local buckling in the <b>flange</b> <b>edge</b> between beam flange and steel tube because of local stress concentration. When the joint was damaged, the stress of weld (including full penetration, partial penetration, and twin fillet weld) between steel tube and interior strengthening ring is smaller than yield strength.

40|$|The design, fabrication, testing, and {{analysis}} of stiffened wing cover panels to assess damage tolerance criteria are discussed. The damage tolerance improvements were demonstrated in a test program using full-sized cover panel subcomponents. The panels utilized a hard skin concept with identical laminates of 44 -percent 0 -degree, 44 -percent plus or minus 45 -degree, and 12 -percent 90 -degree plies in the skins and stiffeners. The panel skins were impacted at midbay between the stiffeners, directly over the stiffener, and over the stiffener <b>flange</b> <b>edge.</b> The stiffener blades were impacted laterally. Impact energy levels of 100 ft-lb and 200 ft-lb were used. NASTRAN finite-element analyses were performed to simulate the nonvisible damage that was detected in the panels by nondestructive inspection. A closed-form solution for generalized loading was developed to evaluate the peel stresses in the bonded structure. Two-dimensional delamination growth analysis was developed using the principle of minimum potential energy in terms of closed-form solution for critical strain. An analysis was conducted to determine the residual compressive stress in the panels after impact damage, and the analytical predictions were verified by compression testing of the damaged panels...|$|E

In the experimental investigation, thin strips {{consisting of a}} skin and single stiffener were cut {{from a range of}} various fuselage-representative panels. There were seven panel designs, which involved changes in geometry, lay-up, material, stiffener shape and the use of co-curing or secondary bonding to join the skin and stiffener. A total of 203 thin strip sections were cut from these panels and tested to failure. The sections were loaded in two test rigs that aimed to simulate the various symmetric and antisymmetric loads on skin-stiffener interfaces in a postbuckling panel. Five failure modes were observed, corresponding to the first damage event occurring at different locations: stiffener bend, stiffener blade, core region under the stiffener, <b>flange</b> <b>edge,</b> and skin. In general, there was good repeatability of the experimental results, particularly when classified according to failure mode, though there was a significant degree of variability in some results. For the numerical analysis, two-dimensional finite element models were analysed, and strength criteria applied in order to predict the initiation of interlaminar damage. In general, the numerical predictions gave good comparison with the experiment in terms of the critical damage locations and initiation loads, which were within the experimental scatter. Discussion is given on the sensitivity of the specimen designs, and how the twodimensional analysis approach has been applied to large fuselage-representative structures...|$|E

This paper presents a single-step, non-iterative, numerical procedure for determining the effects of heat-curving on residual stress and strain based on a previously developed simplified analysis. Thermal equilibrium equations for idealized heating profiles are first recast in a general parametric form and then solved numerically for standard heating width and temperature using modern technical computing.

40|$|Cold {{roll forming}} is a bending process where the bending occurs {{gradually}} in several forming steps from an undeformed strip to a finished profile. The process {{is very interesting}} for the sheet metal industry due to the high speed in which the profile can be produced. High strength steel has, in recent years, become more common in cold roll forming. These materials have advantages but also disadvantages that affect {{the design of the}} process. Simple models in literature [K. F. Chiang, Cold roll forming, ME Thesis, University of Auckland, August 1984] predict that the longitudinal peak membrane strain in the flange of a profile is independent of the material properties. However, Ingvarsson [L. Ingvarsson, Förenklad teori för rullforming av elementär v-profil, jämförelse mellan normalt och höghållfast stål, VAMP 15 - rullforming 23 april 2001] compared mild and ultra high strength in a roll forming experiment and the conclusion was that the material properties will affect the finished profile. This paper is a fundamental study performed {{in order to understand the}} observation by Ingvarsson [L. Ingvarsson, Förenklad teori för rullforming av elementär v-profil, jämförelse mellan normalt och höghållfast stål, VAMP 15 - rullforming 23 april 2001]. The objectives of this study are to investigate the change in the longitudinal peak membrane strain at the <b>flange</b> <b>edge</b> and the deformation length when the yield strength increases. These are important since they can be used to determine the number of forming steps and the distance between them when designing the cold roll forming machine. The result from the simulations show that the longitudinal peak membrane strain decreases and the deformation length increases when the yield strength is increased.

40|$|AbstractThe Volvo XC 60 {{car body}} {{contains}} numerous parts in Ultra High Strength Steels (UHSS) {{in order to}} guarantee the structural integrity of {{the car in the}} event of a crash situation. Most of the parts are manufactured in a hot-forming process, so called presshardening, resulting in component tensile strength in the range of 1, 500  MPa. As this type of material also presents fairly high carbon content (∼ 0. 22 %) it brings a challenge when it comes to welding. The Volvo XC 60 car body is at the same time to a large extent assembled by laser welding technology. In early development stages of the project (Y 413), it was observed that laser welding of hot-formed components presented a number of challenges due to the unique conditions offered by this welding method. The presentation will thoroughly describe the modes of procedure how to avoid crack inducement during the welding operation. A variable analysis approach was used based on the present circumstances at the production facility in the Gent plant. Crucial variables at laser welding such as gap between sheets, focal point position, welding speed and laser weld position relative to the <b>flange</b> <b>edge</b> were included in a test matrix and welding trials were carried out accordingly in the Pilot Plant in Gothenburg. The paper will discuss those welding results, the subsequent analysis and plausible theoretic explanations. From the lessons learnt in this research, the optimum laser welding parameters were then transferred to the laser welding stations in the Gent plant. There it has been proven, that also at high volume automotive manufacturing, it is possible to provide an outstanding weld quality also at such difficult pre-conditions. The presentation ends with some facts and figures and experiences from high volume series production, which also includes aspects on quality assurance...|$|E
40|$|New {{demands for}} {{passenger}} safety, vehicle performance and fuel economy {{have led to}} an increase in the use of advanced high strength steel. An increase in strength decreases the formability of the material and increases the spring back behaviour. Recently the development of high strength steel has rapidly advanced, requiring verification of earlier material models suitable for describing the plasticity behaviour in sheet metal forming. The aim of the here conducted numerical simulations is to verify the deep drawing process and the shape of the final component of a simple hat profile geometry for studying spring-back of high strength steels. Four advanced high strength steels were selected for detailed investigation, namely the dual phase steels DP 600 and DP 750, the triple phase steel TRIP 700 and the stainless steel HYTENS 800. The plastic properties of these steels have been assessed through intrinsic and simulative tests, leading to verification and comparison at different levels. The hat profile serves as a simple test geometry for deep drawing due to elimination of the lateral dimension in first order. The corresponding simpler plasticity behaviour in space facilitates systematic analysis Experiments and simulations were carried out, leading to comparison of the resulting draw in, strain, thinning, final shape and spring-back. The verification and analysis concerns the friction coefficient, two software codes, Finite Element properties and the two material models Hill 48 and Hill 90. The simulation provides a good qualitative coincidence with experimental results, which enables to develop a process theory and to study the individual mechanisms involved. The friction coefficient, varied from 0 to 0. 1, shows very low sensitivity on the process. The simulation underestimates the spring-back by 8 - 12 ° at the <b>flange</b> <b>edge.</b> Among the four materials studied basically the stainless steel HYTENS 800 shows the largest deviations during comparison. In general the results partially reveal distinct quantitative discrepancies, in particular in the critical bending regions, demanding for improved material models and better knowledge of the boundary conditions.

40|$|Cold {{rotary forging}} is an {{innovative}} incremental metal forming process whose main characteristic {{is that the}} workpiece is only partially in contact with a conical tool, reducing therefore the required forging loads. However, in spite of many benefits of such a process, wide industrial implementation of rotary forging is not possible without proper understanding of material behaviour. In the present work, the capability of rotary forging process was explored for the manufacturing of flared cylindrical parts by cold forming. Another main aim {{was to assess the}} cold formability of high-strength materials for aerospace applications (martensitic stainless steels) under incremental processes. In order to understand the impact of rotary forging on the final properties of formed components, microstructural and mechanical analysis were performed. Microstructural and hardness analysis were conducted on both axial and transverse sections along the cold formed flange in order to study the grain flow orientation and strain distribution. In a similar fashion, mechanical test specimens were machined from different positions and orientations along the rotary forged component. Further analysis was performed on the components in the as-treated condition {{in order to understand the}} response of cold-worked Jethete M 152 components to subsequent heat treatments. Microstructural and hardness analysis clearly reveals a strong grain reorientation and strain localization around “pickup” defects (material attached to the upper tool) observed on the flange top surface, close to the <b>flange</b> <b>edge.</b> These results suggest that an excessive deformation is localized during the early stages of the flange formation. Another characteristic feature found in the rotary forged parts is the presence of a buckling phenomenon which appears in later stages of the rotary forging process. Strain hardening along with the increasing flange length requires higher levels of forging loads to keep forming the flange. This results into a significant accumulation of compressive stresses in the transition region between the flange and the straight region. Gradually the resultant compressive force exceeds the critical buckling load, leading to the occurrence of the buckling phenomenon. This latter issue determines the limit of the cold flaring process. This can help to determine the maximum length of the flange part, achievable in this process, which is of great importance for the design of these manufacturing technologies. From the mechanical testing results, large differences were found as a function of both position and orientation (axial, transverse) throughout the rotary forged components (anisotropic properties). Concerning the impact of heat treatments on cold-worked components, no differences were found in the as-treated condition, in terms of microstructural and mechanical properties between regions with a large difference in strain distribution. These results denote the normalizing effect of conventional hardening treatments on cold-worked Jethete M 152 components, restoring the homogenous and isotropic properties across the whole componen...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{high-strength}} steel is increasingly {{being used in}} automotive structural components due to its excellent strength-to-weight ratios. However, the variations of residual stresses magnitude in AHSS products are usually very complex and unpredictable due to the fabrication process and the material’s high strength. Consequently, unbalanced residual stresses are responsible {{for a series of}} product defects. Chain-die forming is a novel AHSS fabrication method which has the characteristics of preserving the material’s ductility maximally and also reducing the residual stresses in the product. In this study, the finite element method is employed to investigate the equivalent residual stresses (Von Mises) in Chain-die formed AHSS U-channels. Finite element simulation of roll forming of the same type as AHSS U-channel forming is performed to make a comparison of the residual stresses distribution characterizations in AHSS U-channels which are fabricated by roll forming and by Chain-die forming. The results indicate that the residual stresses in Chain-die formed U-channels stay at a very low level and are almost negligible. In the meanwhile, due to the bending, reverse bending and other unpredictable redundant deformation types in the roll forming process, the residual stresses are more significant than those of Chain-die formed AHSS channels. The comparison of the longitudinal strain developments of <b>flange</b> <b>edges</b> of roll formed and Chain-die formed U-channels is given to explain the differences between the residual stress distributions in the roll formed and Chain-die formed U-channels.

A critical aspect of this pursuit {{is the development of}} a lighter, more robust airframe that will enable the introduction of unconventional aircraft configurations. NASA and The Boeing Company are working together to develop a structural concept that is lightweight and an advancement beyond state-of-the-art composites. The Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) is an integrally stiffened panel design where elements are stitched together and designed to maintain residual load-carrying capabilities under a variety of damage scenarios. With the PRSEUS concept, through-the-thickness stitches are applied through dry fabric prior to resin infusion, and replace fasteners throughout each integral panel. Through-the-thickness reinforcement at discontinuities, such as along <b>flange</b> <b>edges,</b> has been shown to suppress delamination and turn cracks, which expands the design space and leads to lighter designs. The pultruded rod provides stiffening away from the more vulnerable skin surface and improves bending stiffness. A series of building blocks were evaluated to explore the fundamental assumptions related to the capability and advantages of PRSEUS panels. These building blocks addressed tension, compression, and pressure loading conditions. The emphasis of the development work has been to assess the loading capability, damage arrestment features, repairability, post-buckling behavior, and response of PRSEUS flat panels to out-of plane pressure loading. The results of this building-block program from coupons through an 80 %-scale pressure box have demonstrated the viability of a PRSEUS center body for the Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) transport aircraft.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the usefulness of}} monolithic millimeter-wave integrated circuit (MMIC) components at submillimeter-wave frequencies, a chip has been designed that incorporates two integrated, radial E-plane probes with an MMIC amplifier in between, thus creating a fully integrated waveguide module. The integrated amplifier chip has been fabricated in 35 -nm gate length InP high-electron-mobility-transistor (HEMT) technology. The radial probes were mated to grounded coplanar waveguide input and output lines in the internal amplifier. The total length of the internal HEMT amplifier is 550 m, while the total integrated chip length is 1, 085 m. The chip thickness is 50 m with the chip width being 320 m. The internal MMIC amplifier is biased through wire-bond connections to the gates and drains of the chip. The chip has 3 stages, employing 35 -nm gate length transistors in each stage. Wire bonds from the DC drain and gate pads are connected to off-chip shunt 51 -pF capacitors, and additional off-chip capacitors and resistors {{are added to the}} gate and drain bias lines for low-frequency stability of the amplifier. Additionally, bond wires to the grounded coplanar waveguide pads at the RF input and output of the internal amplifier are added to ensure good ground connections to the waveguide package. The S-parameters of the module, not corrected for input or output waveguide loss, are measured at the waveguide <b>flange</b> <b>edges.</b> The amplifier module has over 10 dB of gain from 290 to 330 GHz, with a peak gain of over 14 dB at 307 GHz.
