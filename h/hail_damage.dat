5|$|Most {{end users}} of {{forecasts}} {{are members of}} the general public. Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths, power outages, and widespread <b>hail</b> <b>damage.</b> Heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still, as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas. Excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities, and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{aircraft was}} de Havilland DH.89A Dragon Rapide G-ACPM, c/n 6251. This aircraft {{was the first}} production Dragon Rapide.

25|$|The {{landscape}} of the region is much more agrarian than other parts of Burgundy with pastures and orchards interspersed among vineyards. The soft rolling hills of the area reach altitudes between 750-1,050 feet (230–320 metres). These hills provide some protection from frost and <b>hail</b> <b>damage.</b> The soil is predominately limestone mixed with sand and clay and the occasional iron deposit. Around the city of Mercurey, the soil has {{a high concentration of}} iron-enriched marl. The diversity in slopes and soils creates a myriad of microclimates that can greatly influence the varying quality of wine from the Côte Chalonnaise, even among vineyards labeled as premier cru.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the strong tornadoes, Oklahoma was affected by high winds and large hail. The hail, measuring up to [...] in diameter, caused significant damage in Okesa. Numerous cars were hit and several houses sustained roof damage; {{the cost of the}} <b>hail</b> <b>damage</b> was estimated at $100,000 in the town. Heavy rains produced by the storms also caused isolated flooding, inundating numerous streets with several feet of water. Lightning also produced damage in the state, with one bolt striking an oil tank, igniting a fire. The fire severely damaged the tank, leaving $13,000 in damages. Throughout the state, an estimated 61,000 people lost power: 29,000 lost power due to thunderstorms [...] and 32,000 due to tornadoes. In Mississippi, strong winds on the backside of the cold front blew a metal roof off a power company building, bringing down several trees and power lines.

The city is an area which frequently experiences severe thunderstorms, <b>hail,</b> <b>damaging</b> winds, and tornadoes.|$|R

2500|$|The Barolo zone {{is located}} [...] {{southwest}} of the Barbaresco zone with only the vineyards of Diano d'Alba planted with Dolcetto between the two Nebbiolo strongholds. Compared to the Barbaresco zone, the Barolo zone is cooler and located on higher elevations, rising nearly [...] above Barbaresco. The harvest of the late ripening Nebbiolo grape usually takes place in early to mid-October though some producers are experimenting with viticultural techniques that allow for an earlier harvest in late September. At harvest time, rains and downy mildew {{are two of the}} main hazards to worry about, along with early spring <b>hail</b> <b>damage</b> earlier in the growing season. Like most of south central and southeastern Piedmont, the zone experiences a continental climate tempered by the Tanaro river and its tributaries- the Tallòria dell'Annunziata and Tallòria di Castiglione- that split the region into three main zones. To the west of the Tallòria dell'Annunziata is the commune of Barolo and La Morra. To the east of the Tallòria di Castiglione is the commune of Serralunga d'Alba located on one of the highest hilltops in the Barolo zone. Separated by a narrow valley to the west is the commune Monforte d'Alba located in the Monforte hills. Further upstream north, located in the v-shape spur between the two tributaries is the commune of Castiglione Falletto.|$|E

The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|R
50|$|The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) had stated {{as early}} as February 8 that a few supercells may develop on the 10th and could result in large <b>hail,</b> <b>damaging</b> winds, and a few tornadoes.

Most of the severe activity was expected to develop along the cold front {{in the form of a}} squall line. A 10 percent chance of isolated tornadoes was introduced as the instability remained marginal for the event.|$|R
