5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

25|$|The Trident {{emerged in}} {{response}} to a call by the state-owned British European Airways Corporation (BEA) for a jet airliner for its premier West European routes. BEA had been induced by the government to issue this call despite its unwillingness to buy a large jet fleet. The airline's requirements fluctuated greatly in the 1950s and a decade later evolved radically away <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Trident could offer. Adherence to BEA's changing specification was widely seen as limiting the Trident's appeal to other airlines and delaying its service entry.|$|E

25|$|Panel {{data that}} track the same {{individuals}} {{over time are}} much more informative than statistical categories that do not correspond to specific people. The Treasury did a study in 2007 that tracked the same individual taxpayers {{over the age of}} 25 from 1996 to 2005 and found differing results <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> graph above shows. The results showed that during those years, half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile, with half of those in the bottom quintile moving to a higher one. About 60% of taxpayers in the top 1% in 1996 no longer stayed in that category by 2005.|$|E

25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} apparent wind speed and direction is different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail {{twist in the}} design of the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, {{published}} in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only. Those were not sold, however, but {{at the expense of}} Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland. In that way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature. These stories and poems were in fact something entirely different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> readers were used to, not only as to what language they were witten in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. The copies of the booklet often were shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and not seldom the stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.|$|E

Even though the written notice was slightly different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Road Traffic Act required, it was enough to have warned him of the possibility that his license could be disqualified. The police had also advised him that his license would be disqualified if he failed to attend court a second time. The appellant had also been informed of his right to be heard in court and the date, place and time of the hearing; a right which he knowingly and willingly forfeited by his non-attendance.|$|E

25|$|With the League {{introducing}} two relegation places from Division Three {{the next}} season {{it was obvious that}} Rovers would have to improve quickly, and Thompson was duly sacked and replaced by former player Ray Graydon. While Graydon had experienced promotion success twice with Walsall, he failed to significantly improve Rovers' form, and the next two seasons were also spent fighting relegation to the Conference. Soon, Graydon was gone, and Ian Atkins took the hotseat. A slight improvement resulted, resulting in Rovers hovering in mid-table; this was far <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> board and fans wanted however, and after just over a season in charge Atkins was dismissed, and in his place the club appointed Paul Trollope as player-manager, aided by director of football Lennie Lawrence. Trollope's first season in full charge (2005–06) saw the club briefly contend for the play-offs, but eventually resulted in another mid-table (12th place) finish.|$|E
25|$|Project Socrates, {{under the}} Reagan administration, {{determined}} that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition {{of science and technology}} in a manner that was radically different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> US was using. In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors. In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology, while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, in addition, the Soviet Union's technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. It was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, Native Americans groups {{had not yet}} formed the large {{political}} “tribes” known from the historical era during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, and many tribal names used in historical literature do not apply in the seventeenth century. Many tribal names were actually amalgamations of earlier groups that had been decimated by wars and disease and banded together for mutual safety. Groups were also known by many different names, which also made identifying specific groups difficult. Group names were often recorded before the group met Europeans, and was frequently the name that enemies knew them by and in a different language family <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> group themselves spoke. These names were then transliterated into several European written languages, particularly French, English, Dutch, and Spanish. These European languages often had different phonetic stylings for the foreign languages of the Native Americans, and this translation and transliteration was conducted in an era before many modern writing conventions, resulting in inconsistent spelling, grammar and alphabetic characters.|$|E

500|$|To {{distinguish}} itself <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Reactionaries {{perceived as}} the [...] "unruly" [...] Liberals, sometime around 1843 (and certainly by 1844), the Reactionary Party {{became known as the}} Partido da Ordem (Party of Order) and its members as saquaremas. Caxias increasingly identified himself with the saquarema ideology: liberalism, preservation of the authority of the state, and support for representative parliamentary monarchy. Although his move toward the saquarema camp was not clear at the time he accepted the appointment to put down the rebellion in Maranhão in 1839, his victory over the Liberal rebels in 1842 further solidified his allegiance to the Party of Order.|$|E
