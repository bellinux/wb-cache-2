50|$|Cross slope, {{cross fall}} or camber is a {{geometric}} feature of pavement surfaces: the transverse slope {{with respect to}} the horizon. It is a very important safety factor. Cross slope is provided to provide a drainage gradient so that water will run off the surface to a drainage system such as a street gutter or ditch. Inadequate cross slope will contribute to aquaplaning. On straight sections of normal two-lane roads, the pavement cross section is usually highest in the center and drains to both sides. In <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves,</b> the cross slope is banked into superelevation to reduce steering effort and lateral force required to go around the curve.

30|$|The {{developed}} speed prediction models {{indicate that}} the curve length has {{a significant effect on}} the 85 th percentile speed of cars and SUVs at locations 50  m prior to PC, PC and MC. At the tangent section prior to a <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve,</b> drivers possibly perceive the <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve</b> based on the curve length. A longer <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve</b> provides a smoother transition from one tangent section to another and encourage drivers to choose higher speed. On the other hand, two tangent sections connected by a shorter curve may appear as a kink to the driver and influence them to choose comparatively lower speed. Till PC, curve length is the only geometric feature that affects car and SUV speed. The effect of curvature (i.e., 1 /R) on the 85 th percentile speed is observed only at MC. It indicates that drivers experience the effect of curvature only after entering the curve and start adjusting speed accordingly. Highway designers can use these findings in deciding appropriate curve radius and length for consistent geometric design with reasonable speed harmony along a <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve.</b> Further, the developed models can be used in estimating the 85 th percentile speed and compare it with the design speed to assess the consistency of a designed highway at various locations along a <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|R

RysDriver {{workload}} increases on <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> due to {{more complicated}} navigation compared to navigation on straight roadway sections. Although {{only a small}} portion of roadways are horizontal curve sections, approximately 25 % of all fatal highway crashes occur at horizontal curve sections. According to the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database, fatalities associated with <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> were more than 25 % during last years from 2008 to 2014, reinforcing that investigation of horizontal curve crashes and corresponding safety improvements are crucial study topics within the field of transportation safety. Improved safety of horizontal curve sections of rural transportation networks can contribute to reduced crash severities and frequencies. Statistical methods can be utilized to develop crash prediction models in order to estimate crashes at <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> and identify contributing factors to crash occurrences, thereby correlating to the primary objectives of this research project. Primary data analysis for 221 randomly selected <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> on undivided two-lane two-way highways with Poisson regression method revealed that annual average daily traffic (AADT), heavy vehicle percentage, degree of curvature, and difference between posted and advisory speeds affect crash occurrence at <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves.</b> The data, however, were relatively overdispersed, so the negative binomial (NB) regression method was utilized. Results indicated that AADT, heavy vehicle percentage, degree of curvature, and long tangent length significantly affect crash occurrence at horizontal curve sections. A new dataset consisted of geometric and traffic data of 5, 334 <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> on the entire state transportation network including undivided and divided highways provided by Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) Traffic Safety Section as well as crash data from the Kansas Crash and Analysis Reporting System (KCARS) database were used to analyze the single vehicle (SV) crashes. An R software package was used to write a code and combine required information from aforementioned databases and create the dataset for 5, 334 <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> on the entire state transportation network. Eighty percent of crashes including 4, 267 <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> were randomly selected for data analysis and remaining 20 % <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> (1, 067 curves) were used for data validation. Since the results of the Poisson regression model showed overdispersion of crash data and many <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> had zero crashes during the study period from 2010 to 2014, NB, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) methods were used for data analysis. Total number of crashes and severe crashes were analyzed with the selected methods. Results of data analysis revealed that AADT, heavy vehicle percentage, curve length, degree of curvature, posted speed, difference between posted and advisory speed, and international roughness index influenced single vehicle crashes at 4, 267 randomly selected <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> for data analysis. Also, AADT, degree of curvature, heavy vehicle percentage, posted speed, being a divided roadway, difference between posted and advisory speeds, and shoulder width significantly influenced severe crash occurrence at selected <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves.</b> The goodness-of-fit criteria showed that the ZINB model more accurately predicted crash numbers for all crash groups at the selected horizontal curve sections. A total of 1, 067 <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> were used for data validation, and the observed and predicted crashes were compared for all crash groups and data analysis methods. Results of data validation showed that ZINB models for total crashes and severe crashes more accurately predicted crashes at <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves.</b> This study also investigated the effect of speed limit change on horizontal curve crashes on K- 5 highway in Leavenworth County, Kansas. A statistical t-test proved that crash data from years 2006 to 2012 showed only significant reduction in equivalent property damage only (EPDO) crash rate for adverse weather condition at 5 % significance level due to speed limit reduction in June 2009. However, the changes in vehicles speeds after speed limit change and other information such as changes in surface pavement condition were not available. According to the results of data analysis for 221 selected <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> on undivided two-lane highways, tangent section length significantly influenced total number of crashes. Therefore, providing more information about upcoming changes in horizontal alignment of the roadway via doubling up warning sings, using bigger sings, using materials with higher retroreflectivity, or flashing beacons were recommended for <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> with long tangent section lengths and high number of crashes. Also, presence of rumble strips and wider shoulders significantly and negatively influenced severe SV crashes at horizontal curve sections; therefore, implementing rumble strips and widening shoulders for <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> with high number of severe SV crashes were recommended...|$|E
