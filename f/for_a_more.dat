5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|Dubček's reforms {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} the press, and political commentary was allowed {{for the first time}} in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complete theory.|$|E
5|$|Even {{accounting}} measures {{intended to}} recognize gender disparities are criticized for ignoring unpaid work. Two such examples are the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), {{neither of which}} include much unpaid work.

The facilities there could only provide emergency repairs, enough {{to allow her to}} reach the bigger dockyard in Sydney. Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> thorough replenishment period and Illustrious transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May. She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later, bound for Rosyth for permanent repairs. 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney, but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June.|$|E
