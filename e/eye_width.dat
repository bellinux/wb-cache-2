50|$|The eye of {{a silver}} bream is very large by {{comparison}} with its head, and this character also distinguishes it from the bronze bream {{as well as from}} all other European cyprinids apart from the bleak.

Head length from tip of snout to far extent of gill plate is about 4 times as large as the eye diameter, and head depth is 2.5 times as large, irrespective of the age of the fish. In bronze bream the relationship between eye size and head length changes considerably over the lifetime of the fish, being initially similar to the ratios in silver bream, but in full-grown fish the head length can be as much as 6-7 times <b>eye</b> <b>width</b> and head depth 4-5 times.

50|$|The {{study of}} zero-acquaintance {{personality}} judgments developed from Cleeton and Knight's (1924) intent {{to demonstrate the}} futility of using physical criteria to predict unobservable individual traits. In order to accomplish this, Cleeton and Knight (1924) recruited 30 target participants from national fraternities and sororities, so that {{a large group of}} close acqutaintances from these organizations could rate eight traits (i.e. individual traits included sound judgment, intellectual capacity, frankness, willpower, ability to make friends, leadership, originality, and impulsiveness) of the target participants. Cleeton and Knight (1924) then asked a group of strangers to rate these eight traits of each target participant after viewing the target participant from a distance for only a few minutes. After measuring several objective physical traits of the target participants, such as cranium size and <b>eye</b> <b>width,</b> Cleeton and Knight (1924) found that these physical traits were unrelated to close acquaintances' ratings of unobservable individual traits. However, they found that strangers' rating of an unfamiliar individual's traits were reliable; strangers tended to rate a target's personality similarly. Although these ratings were inaccurate, it became apparent that raters must be using similar indicators to make judgements about individual traits.|$|E

The literature is replete with numerous related studies, few of which are about the Iranian population. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the average facial proportions of Iranians and compare it with that of Caucasians. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenient sample of 212 Iranians (male= 108, female= 104) aged 18 - 30 years who did not have any previous major facial surgery or trauma and their past two generations were Iranian. Measurements between facial landmarks were determined and compared with Caucasians with Student and one sample t-tests (P< 0. 05, 95 % CI). Results: The intercanthal (en-en) and <b>eye</b> <b>widths</b> (ex-en/R), forehead height 2 (tr-n), trichion-endocanthion (tr-en) and nasofacial and nasofrontal angles were not significantly different between the participating men and women but other facial measurements were significantly different (Р< 0. 05). The head (ft-ft), eye (ex-en/R/L) and nose widths (al-al) and upper face height (n-sto), nasofrontal angle and nasal tip protrusion in the study population were not significantly different from Caucasians. The upper lip (sn-sto), lower face (sn-gn) and forehead heights (tr-n) and nasofacial angle of the female participants were not significantly different from Caucasian women but other facial measurements were significantly different (Р< 0. 05). Conclusion: Most facial anthropometric measurements of Iranian subjects were significantly different from those of Caucasians.

FaceIt can pick out someone’s face in a crowd and compare it to databases worldwide to recognize and put a name to a face. The software is written to detect multiple features on the human face. It can detect the distance between the <b>eyes,</b> <b>width</b> of the nose, shape of cheekbones, length of jawlines and many more facial features. The software does this by putting the image of the face on a faceprint, a numerical code that represents the human face. Face recognition software used to have to rely on a 2D image with the person almost directly facing the camera. Now, with FaceIt, a 3D image can be compared to a 2D image by choosing 3 specific points off of the 3D image and converting it into a 2D image using a special algorithm that can be scanned through almost all databases.  In 2006, the performance of the latest face recognition algorithms were evaluated in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC). High-resolution face images, 3-D face scans, and iris images were used in the tests. The results indicated that the new algorithms are 10 times more accurate than the face recognition algorithms of 2002 and 100 times more accurate than those of 1995. Some of the algorithms were able to outperform human participants in recognizing faces and could uniquely identify identical twins.|$|R

The structure parameters represent structural individuality of the eye, including size and color of the iris, width and boldness of the double-fold eyelid, width of the bulge below the <b>eye</b> and <b>width</b> of the illumination reflection on the bulge. The motion parameters represent movements of the eye, including up-down position of the upper and lower eyelids and 2 D position of the iris. The system first registers the eye model to the input in a particular frame and individualizes the model by adjusting the structure parameters. Then, it tracks motion of the eye by estimating the motion parameters across the entire image sequence. Combined with image stabilization to compensate the head motion, the registration and motion recovery of the eye are guaranteed to be robust...|$|R
