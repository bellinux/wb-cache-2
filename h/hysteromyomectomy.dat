40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} serum pain {{mediators}} and immune response {{of patients with}} uterine fibroids surgery after parecoxib sodium preemptive analgesia. Methods: A total of 150 cases of patients who underwent <b>hysteromyomectomy</b> in Huizhou First Women and Children's Hospital between May 2013 and August 2016 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups, observation group received preoperative parecoxib sodium preemptive analgesia combined with general anesthesia, and control group received routine general anesthesia. Serum was collected before and after operation, and the contents of pain mediators, stress hormones, humoral immune response and cellular immune response indexes were determined. Results: Serum PGE 2, β-EP, SP, Cor, Ins, Ang-II, ALD, IFN-γ and IL- 17 contents of both groups 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h after surgery {{were significantly higher than}} those before surgery while IgG, IgM, IgA, IL- 4 and IL 10 contents were significantly lower than those before surgery; serum PGE 2, β-EP, SP, Cor, Ins, Ang-II, ALD, IFN-γ and IL- 17 contents of observation group 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h after surgery were significantly lower than those of control group while IgG, IgM, IgA, IL- 4 and IL 10 contents were significantly higher than those of control group. Conclusion: Parecoxib sodium preemptive analgesia can relieve pain, inhibit the stress response and improve immune response in patients with uterine fibroids surgery...|$|E
