40|$|I {{determined}} {{differences in}} yellow perch gill-net catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) at two depths (10 and 15 m) in the Indiana waters of Lake Michigan during June, July, and August from 1989 to 2006. I evaluated the abiotic factors of water temperature, water clarity, wave height, and wind direction {{to determine whether}} they influence the differences in yellow perch CPUE. This study suggests that yellow perch in southern Lake Michigan may select habitat based on water temperature during the summer, moving in response to thermocline changes. We also evaluated mortality rates for two distinct periods (1984 - 1994 and 2000 - 2007) in order to identify the response of the population to changes in exploitation. Yellow perch during 1984 - 1994 (high exploitation) and 2000 - 2007 (low exploitation) displayed an increase in mortality for fish of harvestable size. In addition, during 2000 - 2007 (low exploitation) we identified that female yellow perch reached <b>exploitable</b> <b>size</b> earlier in life than males. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{intertidal}} {{population structure}} of the large edible gastropod Turbo sarmaticus was examined at four sites along the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. One site was free from exploitation, two were subjected to low levels of exploitation and one was heavily exploited. Within the intertidal zone at all sites there was a size-related distribution, with smaller animals being found towards the upper mid-shore and larger animals occurring in a downshore direction. The mean shore densities (1. 2 –animals/m 2) and biomass (4. 4 – 9. 4 g/m 2) of T. sarmaticus at the sites where there was no, or minimal,  exploitation of animals {{were not significantly different}} (P the unexploited site, an offshore island. The lowest density (0. 2 animals/m 2) and biomass  (0. 4 g/m 2) of T. sarmaticus was recorded at the site where the exploitation of this gastropod was intense.

40|$|We {{verified}} the age {{and growth}} of swordfish (Xiphias gla-dius) by comparing ages determined from annuli in fin ray sections with daily growth increments in otoliths. Growth of swordfish of <b>exploitable</b> <b>sizes</b> is described {{on the basis of}} annuli present in cross sections of the second ray of the first anal fins of 1292 specimens (60 − 260 cm eye-to-fork length, EFL) caught in the region of the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery. The position of the initial fin ray annulus of swordfish was verified {{for the first time with}} the use of scanning electron micrographs of presumed daily growth increments present in the otoliths of juveniles. Fish growth through age 7 was validated by marginal increment analysis. Faster growth of females was confirmed, and the standard von Bertalanffy growth model was identified as the most parsimonious for describing growth in length for fish greater than 60 cm EFL. The observed growth of three fish, a year-old in size when first caught and then recaptured from 364 to 1490 days later, is consistent with modeled growth for fish of this size range. Our novel approach to verifying age and growth should increase confidence in conducting an age-structured stock assessment for swordfish in the North Pacific Ocean. ...|$|R

The programme was carried out in the Southern Hemisphere Whaling Areas (for baleen whales) IV (70 °- 130 °E), III (0 °- 70 °E) and V (130 °E- 170 °W) during the Antarctic summer season in 1978 / 79, 1979 / 80 and 1980 / 81,respectively. The total numbers of minke whales sighted were 5322, 4357 and 5213,and 728, 703 and 474 whales were marked with. 410 "Discovery" whale marks in the 1978 / 79 (Area IV), 1979 / 80 (Area III) and 1980 / 81 (Area V) seasons, respectively. The systematic data of whale sightings and markings obtained from the IDCR cruises contributed not only to stock asseessment but also to development of methodology of estimation technique of whale population. At the 33 rd IWC/Scientific Committee (SC) annual meeting held at Cambridge in June 1981,the <b>exploitable</b> stock <b>size</b> of minke whales was estimated from the data obtained by the IDCR cruises to be 71644, 57951 and 79847 whales by whale sighting based upon the line transect theory, and 71644, 57951 and 79847 whales by the markrecapture method in Areas III, IV and V, respectively.

40|$|At DLR-DFD a {{synergetic}} aerosol retrieval method SYNAER {{was developed}} which delivers aerosol optical thickness and type from simultaneous measurements of a radiometer (ATSR- 2, AATSR, AVHRR) and a spectrometer (GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME- 2). The methodology and a first case study validation and application {{are described in}} 2 papers in JGR (T. Holzer-Popp, et al., JGR, 107, 2002). Exploiting measurements of GOME and ATSR- 2 (ERS- 2) of 3 days per month in the period July 1997 to August 1998 over Europe and Africa, a first climatological dataset was derived. The restriction to 3 days per month {{is due to the}} fact that GOME measures small pixels (80 x 40 km 2) only every 4 th/ 5 th, 14 th/ 15 th, and 24 th/ 25 th for 24 hours each month. The climatological dataset thus suffers from a low number of available (cloud fraction below 35 %) observations. However, it already shows the distribution of the major components of tropospheric aerosols: sulfate/ nitrate, soot, sea salt, and mineral dust. Equivalent sensor combinations onboard ENVISAT (AATSR, SCIAMACHY) and METOP (AVHRR, GOME- 2) will deliver daily measurements with <b>exploitable</b> pixel <b>size</b> and thus provide the potential for a 20 year period of global data collecting for the compilation of an annual aerosol component climatology...|$|R

40|$|The blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, {{represents}} an ecologically and economically {{important component of}} marine and estuarine ecosystems. In Florida, blue crab landings accounted for 9. 6 million dollars during the 2010 fishing season. Accurate stock assessments for this valuable fishery are essential. Age is a critical biological component of accurate stock assessments; however, blue crabs and other crustaceans are especially difficult to age because of the complex nature of discrete growth. Biochemical extraction of an aging pigment, lipofuscin, was developed using blue crab eyestalks. The current study investigated the effects of freezing preservation on lipofuscin extracts and examined whether the extraction methodology, developed by Chesapeake Bay researchers, was useful for aging Tampa Bay blue crabs populations. Significant differences in lipofuscin index were found between samples frozen (2 weeks at - 80 °C) prior to analysis and those processed and assayed immediately (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Quarterly assays of the cohort of known-age individuals revealed a negative linear trend (y = - 0. 12 x + 0. 49, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) in lipofuscin index over a 12 -month period. This result suggests that extraction of lipofuscin is not appropriate for age determination of Florida blue crabs. Investigations into possible causes of the negative trend in lipofuscin suggest this method deserves further examination and refinement before it is acceptable as a reliable method for age determination in Florida blue crabs. Growth data of the known-age population collected during this study revealed that blue crabs in Tampa Bay can reach <b>exploitable</b> <b>size</b> in under sixth months and female crabs can reach sexual maturity within seven months of hatching. These growth patterns {{have the potential to}} enhance future Florida stock assessments...|$|E
40|$|This paper applies both {{parametric}} and non-parametric {{approaches to}} evaluate Economies of Size and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Alberta cow-calf production {{based on the}} unbalanced panel data from 196 farmers during the time period from 1995 to 2002. Under the parametric approach, a random parameter translog cost system and a translog cost frontier are constructed and estimated respectively. The results from the cost system estimation suggest that on average, cow-calf production in Alberta exhibits Economies of Size, technical progress and positive TFP. However, <b>exploitable</b> Economies of <b>Size</b> decrease over time, technical change rate and TFP even become negative at 2002. The critical problem, therefore, is how to reverse the trend and maintain good growth pattern. The translog cost frontier is also estimated but the results are unreliable. Therefore, the Non-parametric approach (Malmquist TFP index) is adopted. The results suggest that inefficiency exists in Alberta cow-calf production. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|This project {{aimed to}} {{establish}} performance requirements for 3 D displays (minimum display <b>size,</b> <b>exploitable</b> range of stereoscopic depth, tradeoff between flipping and cross-talk (ghost image) in multiview-displays) by experimental research based on subjective assessment procedures. Moreover, basic parameters of human perception were investigated {{with regard to}} efficient data compression by source coding of 3 D image signals. In this context, certain properties of visual perception (spatio-temporal cut-off frequencies of binocular depth perception, binocular masking effects, visual resolving power for half-occluded regions in stereoscopic images) were investigated and evaluated with regard to irrelevance reduction techniques. Another section {{of the project was}} concerned with the development of techniques for 3 D image analysis and synthesis. These techniques served to compute intermediate views for multiview 3 D systems (to establish motion parallax). The same approach was applied in an experimental multipoint video conferencing setup for the interpolation of images of virtual cameras which coincided with the displayed conferees' eye position. This method was successfully tested for its suitability to provide individual eye-contact among the conferees. (orig.)

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out on aspects of the biology of the vetigastropod Turbo sarmaticus. Studies included: 1) the {{distribution}} and standing stock of this animal at four sites {{along the coast of}} the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa; 2) the growth rate of animals on a wave-cut platform; 3) the reproductive cycle of an intertidal population; and 4) aspects of the feeding biology examining the ability of this mollusc to consume and digest six macroalgae, the influence of algal diet on growth rate and reproductive fitness and the polysaccharolytic activity of the digestive enzymes. On eastern Cape shores, T. sarmaticus had a size related distribution, with smaller animals being found towards the upper mid-shore and larger animals being found in a downshore direction. The mean shore densities of T. sarmaticus at three sites where exploitation of animals was minimal, were very similar (1. 2 - 1. 7 individuals/m²). The largest animals (up to 110 mm shell length) were found on an offshore island. This may have been a result of animals not being exploited, as well as a possible increase in primary productivity and food availability. The lowest density (0. 2 individuals/m²) and animal size (< 70 mm shell length) was recorded at a site (Kelly's beach - Port Alfred) where exploitation was more intense. It is probable that intense overexploitation was threatening the populations at this site. The growth rate of T. sarmaticus was determined by means of the von Bertalanffy growth model and expressed by the equation L[subscript]t = 81. 07 (l-e⁻°·⁵⁴⁴[superscript](t)). The initial growth rate of T. sarmaticus (up to ≈ 80 mm shell length) was similar on shores with different geomorphologies (i. e. boulder shores and wave-cut platforms). Growth rates of individuals were variable, which means that individuals within a population reached <b>exploitable</b> <b>size</b> (3 - 6 years old) and sexual maturity (1. 5 - 2 years old) at different ages. Seasonality of reproduction of T. sarmaticus was determined using gonad index, egg diameters and spermatozoa content within the gonad. Turbo sarmaticus was dioecious and had a sex ratio in favour of males (1. 2 : 1). Animals attained sexual maturity at a size of about 52. 5 mm shell length. There was little variation in the reproductive cycle over time with gametogenesis occurring from March/April until August/September, whilst maturity (Gonad Index = 15 %) was maintained until the spawning event from December to March. After spawning the gonad regressed. Field and laboratory observations of the feeding biology of T. sarmaticus confirmed that this mollusc was a generalist grazer capable of consuming and digesting algae from the Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta and Phaeophyta. The consumption rates (juveniles: 1. 45 - 9. 50 % body weight/day, adults: 1. 06 - 6. 08 %) and digestibility (9 - 75 % apparent dry matter) of six macroalgae was found to vary. For most algae, juvenile T. sarmaticus had higher consumption rates (1. 6 - 2. 8 times higher) and digestibility values (12 - 24 % higher) than adults. It is suggested that consumption rates were dependent on the digestibility of the algae. In addition, it is suggested that the consumption rates of the different algae were not related to the nutritional content, but rather the energetic content of the algae. In both juvenile and adult animals, temperature had a positive influence on consumption rates, resulting in an increase at higher temperatures. However, in both juvenile and adult T. sarmaticus, algal digestibility was not affected by temperature. Finally, it was proposed that Viva rigida, Codium extricatum, Ecklonia radiata and Gelidium pristoides would provide the best nutritional value for growth and reproductive fitness in T. sarmaticus, whilst Jyengaria stellata and Corallina spp. would provide the poorest. Experiments on the effects of four algal diets on the biology of T. sarmaticus showed that the best growth rate (up to 13. 8 mm shell length increase per annum), reproductive fitness (Gonad Index up to 33 %) and energy levels (up to 4. 76 % glycogen in the foot) were achieved when T. sarmaticus was fed G. pristoides, U. rigid a or a mixed diet. Turbo sarmaticus fed Corallina spp. showed reduced growth (2. 4 mm shell length increase), reproductive fitness (Gonad Index up to 4. 4 %) and energy levels (up to 3. 42 % glycogen in the foot). A study of the polysaccharolytic enzyme activity of T. sarmaticus indicated that this mollusc possesses enzymes that can, at least partially, digest most of the storage and structural polysaccharides found in the Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and Phaeophyta. This further supported the findings that T. sarmaticus was a generalist grazer. Two levels of activity were detected: 1) high levels of enzyme activity (up to 328. 2 Ilglmglmllhr) occurred on the storage polysaccharides that occur in the Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta, and 2) lower levels of activity were detected on the storage polysaccharides (up to 44. 8 μg/mg/ml/hr) of the Phaeophyta and on all the structural polysaccharides tested (< 45. 5 μg/mg/ml/hr). It was suggested that T. sarmaticus did not rely heavily on structural carbohydrates as a source of carbon. Finally, {{the results of this study}} were discussed in relation to the future management of T. sarmaticus stocks, the possible role of this macro algal grazer in the intertidal zone and the effects of over-exploitation of this animal. The potential aquaculture of this mollusc was also addressed briefly...|$|E
