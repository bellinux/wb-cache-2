2500|$|Nina Arkadyevna Shatskaya {{was born}} in Rybinsk to the jazz musician, singer and {{conductor}} Arkady Shatsky. It was in his band Raduga (Радуга, Rainbow) that she has made her singing debut. A strict disciplinarian (who for many years was unwilling to support her ambition to become a professional singer), he proved in retrospect to be a perfect mentor and a major inspiration. [...] "I {{was kind of a}} homely girl; I liked to knit and sew. Besides, I was overweight. All this irritated him immensely: he was sure this way I'd turn out fat, lazy and stupid. He criticized me mercilessly but somehow managed to help me shape up with this criticism. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> prove I was worthy of his praise," [...] she later remembered.|$|E
2500|$|For reasons I never understood, some {{friction}} {{developed between}} President Hoover and my friend, Governor Landon, {{who had a}} summer place in Evergreen, Colorado....I {{was in and out}} of Colorado during the summers and visited frequently with Governor Landon. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> get him and the President together in hopes of bringing about a reconciliation that would benefit them personally and the Republican Party. All of us were at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs for a meeting, which I saw as an opportunity to get them together ... for dinner, but whatever undercurrent existed remained, and they continued to be cool toward each other. President Hoover was one of the great Americans of this century. He was competent, compassionate, and a man of unequaled qualifications. The country paid an awful price when he was sacrificed by political caprice.|$|E
2500|$|Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and {{the family}} moved to Mountain View, California in 1961. It was during this time that Paul built a {{workbench}} in his garage for his son in order to [...] "pass along his love of mechanics." [...] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship [...] "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> hang out with my dad." [...] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a [...] "loner." ...|$|E

60|$|Myself, I was amazed. For {{here was}} a Lord Giovanni I seemed never to have known, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> behold the sequel to so fine a prologue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> persuade {{you to come}} {{to church}} to hear me; will you think it strange if I ask you not to come on this occasion?" ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{without a}} severe mental {{struggle}} did I decide to smother my pride and follow Paul's advice; but once having settled upon {{a course of}} action, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> pursue it.|$|E
60|$|Jerry and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> land, and, {{without even}} {{stopping}} to thank Jim {{for the news}} he brought, we went over the rail into our canoe, pulling in hot haste for the shore.|$|R
6000|$|With instant {{perception}} of my {{wish to have}} him know my future wife, he replied, [...] "My dear fellow, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> meet her. Perhaps my gray hairs will excuse your bringing her to call upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm {{afraid for}} daddy. I'm sure he wounded one of them, {{and if he}} did they may follow us. You are very good and brave, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> reach the train. I want to get away." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> make my {{way toward}} {{that part of the}} village where the horses of Simcoe's Rangers were stabled, hoping I might get a glimpse of poor little Silver Heels, and, therefore, not averse to {{following}} the old negro's advice.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not take}} me long to dress after Captain Flagg made the {{announcement}} that the jolly-boat had been sighted. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{find out how the}} occupants had fared, and what Mr. Henshaw, the government officer, would do with them.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have stopped him, for he was off before I had time to so much as open my mouth, and there I stood leaning against the canoe, giving the people of Benedict to believe <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> be {{fighting}} for my country.|$|E
5000|$|Is it a sin that I don’t want, {{under any}} circumstances, to get {{involved}} in security and military activities? ... I have just turned 30 years old after spending two years in prison, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> pursue scientific research.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Sir Patrick. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{more than}} ready, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> go on. No words can say how anxious <b>I</b> feel to <b>be</b> of some use to you, if I can. It rests entirely with your {{experience}} {{to show me}} how." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do my eyes deceive me, or is {{this the}} Jagson whose name in its inanity is so {{appropriate}} <b>to</b> the bearer? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> know if you still devote upon the ungrateful arts talents which were more profitably employed upon haberdashery.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{be alone}} with Mary; yet it was not till after supper, and then but for a short while, that I could {{have a word with}} her. I lost no time beating about the bush, but spoke out plainly what was on my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said he, [...] "here {{is a fine}} soldier lost to glory." [...] And as he spoke, he half {{turned to}} a young man who sat beside him, a man at whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> take a fuller look, for his face was most strangely {{familiar}} to me.|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} room abruptly, as if he dare not trust himself to say more. It is better not to dwell on what I felt after this last repulse. I ordered the {{carriage}} at once. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> find a refuge from my own thoughts in movement and change.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, because I {{would have}} it known that through a scheme of his, two boys, living {{on the shore of}} Chesapeake bay, succeeded in doing what {{experienced}} men might have failed at, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> have others realize my friend's worth.|$|R
60|$|I ran {{forward with}} my companions; {{but it was}} {{impossible}} to use the musket, even had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> shoot, because of the darkness, and as I swung the weapon from side to side, striving to feel my way, some one clutched me by the throat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lads, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{get back}} into Fauquier County. If it so be you have no stomach for layin' around here eatin' the bread of idleness suppose we start to-morrow mornin'?

60|$|There was {{no reason}} why we should linger under the old wharf, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> be alone {{despite the fact that}} I craved Hiram's companionship, for it seemed as if I must work out some scheme by which it would be {{possible}} to prevent Seth Jepson from playing us false.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Draper {{had heard}} of the circumstance. [...] "Bad news travel quick, Mr. Warrington," [...] he said; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> offer my humble {{services}} as soon as ever you should require them. Your friends, your family, will be much pained that a gentleman of your rank should be in such a position." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{order that}} Seth should not believe <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> leave him, I loitered in the {{vicinity}} a full half hour talking of this and that which was of no particular importance, except that all the while I strove to trap the lad into betraying his traitorous desire, if so be he had one, by some hasty word.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the first}} episode, The Guardians Sam Wollaston {{concluded}} that: [...] "In The Dark {{is by no}} means a trope-free zone...But once you have accepted that, it's a crisp opener (of four) - pacy, thoughtful and skilfully constructed, with multiple strands <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> see twisted together again." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} rich tourists, {{and we all}} took lodgings in a small hotel to which we had been recommended.

6000|$|... "Miss Roseberry," [...] she said, [...] "I have borne {{without a}} murmur the bitterest words {{you could say}} to me. Spare me any more insults.

6000|$|... "Among {{them was}} a {{collection}} of celebrated Trials. I thought of my grandfather; consulted the index; and, finding his name there, bought the work. The shopman (as I could guess from his actions and looks) proposed sending the parcel to me. I insisted on taking it away. The sky had cleared; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> read the details of my grandfather's crime.|$|E
60|$|There {{was in my}} soul a {{perfectly}} genuine horror of Strickland, and {{side by side with}} it a cold curiosity to discover his motives. I was puzzled by him, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> see how he regarded the tragedy he had caused in the lives of people who had used him with so much kindness. I applied the scalpel boldly.|$|E
60|$|This {{was just}} the {{suggestion}} we needed, {{and then came the}} question as to who would go to the commandant. I flatly refused, because it would look too much as if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> hold my rank as captain, and after considerable tongue-wagging it was decided that Jacob should tackle the job, his father agreeing to go with him to headquarters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of that. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{afraid you}} might think me unsympathetic, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> here this morning to offer you my cordial assistance, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> see this people put into art.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> the calmest {{man in the}} prison. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> like a child {{about to}} start on a journey. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gone, curious for the new places I shall see. This fear of the lesser death is ridiculous to one who has gone into the dark so often and lived again. [...] .|$|R
50|$|On February 25, 2011, the White House {{appointed}} Jeremy Bernard, {{the first}} male social secretary in its history. “I have long admired {{the arts and}} education programs that have become hallmarks of the Obama White House and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> continue these efforts in the years ahead,” Bernard said during the announcing press conference.|$|R
