5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> certificate of division. In United States v.

Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified.

5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pension.
