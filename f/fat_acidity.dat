Corn is typically stored for 2 or more years in national barns before it is sold as a food or feed ingredient. However, the effects of stored corn in national barns on the animal performance and nutrient utilization have not been investigated thus far. This study attempted {{to determine the effects of}} storage time on the chemical and physical characteristics of corn and its nutritional value, broiler growth performance, and meat quality. Corn grains used in the present study were stored for 4 different periods, from 2 to 5  yr, under the same conditions in a building at the Beijing National Grain Storage Facility. A total of 240 birds in Exp. 1 and 90 birds in Exp. 2 were used to compare the effects of storage time on the utilization of nutrients of corn, the performance, and meat quality of broilers. The content of starch, crude protein, amino acids, fatty acids, and test weight generally decreased with increasing storage time. Corn stored for over 4  yr showed decreased catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities and increased <b>fat</b> <b>acidity.</b> Body weight gain (BWG) and European production index (EPI) of broilers from 0 to 3  wk tended to decrease linearly with storage time (0. 05     0. 05).

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{shelf-life}} of DWGS in the summer diminishes drastically compared to DWGS in the winter. This effect is primarily due to temperature, which drives mold growth in high moisture feedstocks. Therefore, the overall goal of this dissertation research was to increase the shelf-life of wet distillers grains {{by a factor of}} three from its current 3 – 4 days in warm summer conditions and 5 – 7 days in cold winter conditions. The first objective was to understand and quantify the effect of temperature (10, 20, and 25 °C) and condensed distillers solubles (CDS) levels [0, 20, 30 g/ 100 g of Distillers Wet Grains (DWG) ] on the shelf-life of DWGS under warm and cool aerobic storage conditions. Sample conditions which indicate shelf-life such as moisture, pH, <b>fat</b> <b>acidity</b> (FA), fungal growth and mycotoxin levels were measured in the DWGS samples before and after seven days of storage under three storage temperature levels (10, 20, and 25 °C). We found that changes in temperature had the most significant effect on sample conditions (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). After seven days of storage, moisture content and water activity decreased with increase in temperature. We found <b>fat</b> <b>acidity</b> increased after seven days of storage and pH, fungal growth and mycotoxin levels increased with temperature. It was concluded that after seven days of storage at both warm and cool aerobic storage conditions, desired sensory, chemical, physical and microbiological characters were not retained. DWGS deteriorated less at 10 °C than at 20 °C and 25 °C, likewise we saw less deterioration in 0 (g/ 100 g) CDS than in 20 (g/ 100 g) and 30 (g/ 100 g) CDS.

40|$|Due to {{the small}} size of the seed, canola (Brassica napus or Brassica campestris) offers {{different}} challenges in the harvest and the subsequent post-harvest operations. Often, in Argentina, farmers do not have enough permanent storage capacity so they overcome this deficit with the use of hermetic plastic bags (silobags). The objectives of this work were: 1) Determine the feasibility of the bagging and extraction processes of canola. 2) Monitoring the condition of canola by periodic measurement of carbon dioxide (CO₂), temperature, moisture content (m. c.) and quality of the grain. Thirty tonnes of canola with initial m. c. of 6 % were stored in a silobag in the southeast of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The storage period was extended from November 2008 to November 2009. The variables measured every two weeks were CO₂ concentration, m. c. and grain quality parameters, such as foreign matters, <b>fat</b> <b>acidity</b> and fat content. The temperature and relative humidity (r. h.) of the interstitial air inside the bag and of the ambient air were also recorded with a frequency of one hour. It was observed that, even the size and characteristics of the canola seeds, it was possible to perform the bagging and extraction operations of canola seeds without problems. The r. h. in the interstitial air remained below 50 % along the entire storage period. The temperature of the grain inside the bag followed the monthly average ambient temperature. The CO₂ concentration ranged from 1 to 8 %, indicating low to moderate biological activity in the grain mass. The m. c., foreign matters and fat values remained unchanged throughout the storage period. The <b>fat</b> <b>acidity</b> increased during storage in 0. 7 % points, reaching a final value of 1. 4 %, but did not represent a commercial quality loss.

40|$|Background For many centuries, {{the human}} {{has made a}} lot of efforts to {{determine}} sex ratios in different species and has proposed various theories. In this regard, the effect of several plants on sex ratio (female to male) has been examined, but an empirical research about the effect of aqueous extracts from the leaves of celery on the sex ratio has not been carried out yet. Objectives Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of celery extract on the delivery rate, sex ratio, and the number of newborns in female rats. Patients and Methods A total of 45 adult Wistar rats (15 Males and 30 Females) were prepared. The rats were divided into 3 groups; a control group and the 2 other experimental groups received celery extracts at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg of their body weight. The extract was given orally to the female rats by gavage for 15 consecutive days. For mating, each male rat was placed with two female rats in separate cages for five days. After delivery, the percentage of rats that gave birth, as well as the number and sex ratio of the newborns were determined. The results were analyzed using SPSS version, 1 -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, Tukey test, and post hoc LSD. Results The results showed that aqueous extracts of celery have significantly increased the mean percentage of delivery rate (extract, and control were 100 ± 60 vs. 60 ± 0. 16, respectively), the average number of newborns (extract, and control were 7. 8 ± 1. 2 vs. 3. 5 ± 1. 2, respectively) and the mean sex ratio (male to female ratio) of newborns (extract and control were 1. 26 ± 0. 37 vs. 0. 81 ± 0. 13, respectively) (P ≤ 0. 05). Conclusions The extract contains substances that are effective on the delivery rate, sex ratio, and the number of newborns in the female rats. It may affect through the ionic changes in the rats, by modifying the activity of follicle-stimulating and testosterone hormones, and/or changing the rate of fertilizing ability of sperms containing Y chromosome.

Highly significant (P< 0. 001) differences for ash was found in Khartoum North and Omdurman, while there were non significant differences between the cheeses collected from the two cities in fat content and titratable acidity. The microbiological quality result revealed that there were non significant differences in total bacterial count, coliform count and yeasts and molds count between the two types of cheese. However, there were non significant differences in total bacterial plate counts between samples collected from the two cities. Coliform and yeasts and molds count showed that there were highly significant (P< 0. 001) differences between the samples from the two cities. It was concluded that the processed cheese produces in Sudan is more or less similar to the imported Egyptian processed cheese in chemical composition and microbiological qualit...|$|R
40|$|Palm oil as a {{rich source}} of {{carotene}} appears to be the only oil of vegetable origin which can serve as a potent source of vitamin A and monounsaturated fatty acids mainly oleic acid. Considering the nutritive value of crude palm oil this study was directed towards blending of CPO with other commonly used cooking vegetable oils to attain ideal fatty acid composition of SFA:MUFA:PUFA (1 : 2 : 1). Palm oil was blended with safflower oil and soybean oil in two different proportions, i. e. CPO:safflower oil (65 : 35 and 70 : 30) and CPO:soybean oil (55 : 45 and 65 : 35). Chemical characteristics and fatty acid composition of crude palm oil and its blends were determined. Saponification value was highest in CPO and lowest in safflower oil. No peroxide value was detected in fresh oils. β-Carotene content was 366. 19 μg g− 1 in CPO and found absent in safflower and soybean oils. <b>Fat</b> <b>acidity</b> (mg KOH/g) was lowest (0. 12) in CPO and highest (0. 25) in safflower oil. The fatty acid composition of different oils revealed that palmitic acid was the predominant fatty acid (43. 45...|$|E
40|$|Chemical composition, {{bioavailability}} {{of minerals}} and in vitro digestibility of proteins in karkade seed (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) as affected by soaking, sprouting and cooking were studied. The different methods showed varied deviation of nutrients and antinutrients from the raw seeds. Sprouting and cooking significantly increased protein content and decreased starch and soluble carbohydrates levels. K, Na {{and all the}} trace elements studied were decreased by processing methods. Cooking was more effective in improving bioavailability of minerals studied than soaking or sprouting. Total polyphenols reduced more by cooking, while phytic acid did not change significantly by processing. In vitro protein digestibility was significantly reduced by all processing methods, with soaking gave {{the highest percentage of}} reduction and cooking the lowest percentage. The results also indicated that domestic processing methods changed total acidity and <b>fat</b> <b>acidity</b> as well as N solubility in water and 1 M NaCl. Amino acid profile of the karkade seed indicated that sulfur amino acids and threonine are the limiting amino acids. With respect to FAO pattern, considerable proportion of the essential amino acids were retained on processing, except for lysine on soaking and sprouting and sulfur acids on sprouting and cooking...|$|E

In order to evaluate the degree of spoilage by those organisms, sterile milk sample were inoculated by 3. 1 x 103 cfu mL- 1 of B. cereus and 3. 5 x 103 cfu mL - 1 B. subtilis and stored at 7, 12, 21, 37 and 45 °C. The milk samples were investigated daily for total bacterial counts, fat %, protein % and acidity. The present results revealed that Bacillus spp. inoculated in milk samples showed significant differences for protein, <b>fat,</b> <b>acidity</b> and bacterial count (p< 0. 05) at different storage periods and temperatures. Moreover the milk samples showed a shelf life of more than 5 days at 7 and 12 °C. However, the milk samples that stored at 21, 37 and 45 °C recorded a shelf life of 1 - 4 days...|$|E

A total of 160 cow milk samples were collected and examined from January to August of 2001. These were obtained from 12 different local points of the Van province in Turkey. The {{research was}} carried out in two periods. The first period was the winter period covering January-February-March months and the second one was the summer period covering June-July-August months. Samples were collected according to season, so that milk samples could be taken from the cows which had been fed with hay in born in winter period (January-February-March) and from those which had been fed with green grass on the Pasteur in the area in summer period. According to the results paired t test, the fat content and titratable acidity of winter and summer periods have been found significantly at p< 0. 05 level.

In order to partialy increase non-fat solid content of fermented cream samples, skim milk powder and demineralized whey powder in two different rates (50 % and 70 %) were used. Samples were analyzed for changes in their biochemical and physicochemical properties (total solid, ash, <b>fat,</b> titratable <b>acidity,</b> pH value, total nitrogen, viscosity, tyrosine, acid number, peroxide and diacetyl values) during 29 -day of storage period. Samples tested consisted of 7 different groups; control group (without adding any powder), skim milk powder, 50 % demineralized whey powder and 70 % demineralized whey powder samples were in two different addition rate (2 % and 4 %). Also samples were analyzed for sensory properties. According to the results obtained, the addition of milk powder products affected titratable acidity and tyrosine values of fermented cream samples. Although powder addition and/or storage period didn&# 8217;t cause significant variations in total solid, ash, fat, pH value, viscosity, acid number, peroxide, tyrosine and diacetyl values; sensory properties of fermented cream samples were influenced by both powder addition and storage period. Fermented cream containing 2 % skim milk powder gets the top score of sensory evaluation among the samples...|$|R
