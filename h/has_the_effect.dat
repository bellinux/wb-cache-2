5|$|Capybaras are {{hunted for}} their meat and pelts in some areas, and {{otherwise}} killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some areas, they are farmed, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by {{their ability to}} breed rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} {{causes the}} Coriolis effect, which bends currents {{to the right}} in the Northern Hemisphere {{and to the left}} in the Southern Hemisphere. When this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore, it can amplify the surge, and when it bends the current away from the shore it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of lessening the surge.|$|E

5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution {{by a factor of}} nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{dominate}} other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown hyenas encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.|$|E
5|$|With no {{government}} subsidy (s=0) the resulting equilibrium {{will be the}} standard Cournot outcome, {{as shown in the}} graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of shifting the domestic firm's best response function to the right. Because its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court {{to apply for the}} order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of clearing out polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E

5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, {{the presence of a}} tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientific}} {{studies suggest that}} ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E

5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E

25|$|To {{adjust for}} a large {{sampling}} fraction, the fpc factored into the calculation of {{the margin of error}}, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of narrowing the margin of error. It holds that the fpc approaches zero as the sample size (n) approaches the population size (N), which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of eliminating the margin of error entirely. This makes intuitive sense because when N = n, the sample becomes a census and sampling error becomes moot.|$|E
