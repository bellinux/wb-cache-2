The Rjurik exhibit the berserk rage of the Vos and are led by the teachings of druids, and are renowned throughout Cerilia for their martial prowess and the high quality of their weapons and armor. <b>Expanded</b> <b>character</b> generation within the sourcebook presents player with unique abilities for the Rjurik, including modified bard and druid careers to double-edged, inherent Rjurik curses. The book depicts the various Rjurik tribes, their cultures and societies, the tension between the original nomadic tribes and the urban settlers, and comprehensive information on the geography of the highland areas. The land offers many possible domains for a potential emperor, including the wild land of Taelshore, the bitterly cold tundra and untouched woods of the northlands, and the desolate realms of the Wildlands. Each domain is presented in a double-page layout detailing the law, guilds and temples of the nations, along with what magical sources are present and those who have taken possession of them, and important NPCs, allies and enemies, the trade situation and the armed forces available to the players. Each region is under intense political and social tension, and they must contend with powerful anwnshegh such as the White Witch surrounding them, humanoid alliances intent on conquest, and power-hungry rivals kept in check only by the struggle for survival. Six cardsheets are included which detail major settlements, powerful NPCs, adventure tips, and a layout of Rjurik domains for players to plan and track their ambitions for territory.|$|E

40|$|Australia, is the earliest-known {{freshwater}} {{representative of}} the basal isopod suborder Phreatoicidea. In contrast, the late Paleozoic Palaeophreatoicidae species, which are morphologically distinct from extant families, are found in marine or estuarine facies. Comparison of Protamphisopus wianamattensis with living Phreatoicidea permits the external morphology of the fossils to be reconstructed and the species to be coded for cladistic analysis using a revised and <b>expanded</b> <b>character</b> set developed for living phreatoicideans. In resulting parsimonious trees as well as immediately suboptimal trees, Protamphisopus is nested within clades related to the family Amphisopodidae. Although {{not included in the}} analysis, the Late Permian Protamphisopus reichelti Malzahn (in Glaessner and Malzahn, 1962) appears {{to be a member of}} the Palaeophreatoicidae, rather than among the crown group of the Phreatoicidea. Therefore, a minimum age of Middle Triassic can be assigned to the basal branches within the phreatoicid crown group. The minimum age for the colonisation of fresh water by the suborder is also established although, given the advanced position of Protamphisopus wianamattensis in the cladograms, the habitat shift may have occurred earlier. The biogeographic distribution of extant Phreatoicidea on fragments of Gondwana is consistent with early Mesozoic origins for the major clades of this isopod suborder...|$|E
