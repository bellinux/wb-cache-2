Pitney pulls this song off like a pro, making it both enjoyable and believable. The soft production and Pitney’s smooth, sweet vocals really enhance the song. I’m certainly looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> more from Pitney and hope to see his career succeed! We need more artists like Mo, stone cold country." ...|$|R
