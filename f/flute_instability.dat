So the high plasma pressure in a nonaxisymmetric minimum-B anchor mirror cell, which {{is important for the}} flute mode stability, is taken into account by redefining the specific volume of a magnetic field line. It is found that the flute modes are stabilized by the minimum-B magnetic field even with a divertor mirror although its stabilizing effects are weaker than that without the divertor mirror.

When the amplitudes of the zonal modes become of the same order as that of the streamer modes, the flute instabilities get suppressed and poloidal (zonal) flows dominate.

Mode I has azimuthal mode number m = 1, and {{occurs when the}} radial electric field is negative (directed inward), while mode II has m = - 1 and occurs when the field is positive. The radial electric field is controlled by varying the potential of a secondary anode cylinder located close to the outer discharge radius. A linear perturbation analysis, based on the two-fluid equations, is given for a low-beta, collisionless, cylindrical plasma column, immersed in a uniform axial magnetic field, having a Gaussian density profile and an arbitrary radial electric field profile.

Around a fully developed sunspot, as well as the fine scale of the penumbra, the moat sometimes shows clearly observable spoke-like structure at low azimuthal wavenumbers. We investigate the formation of azimuthal structure by computing the linear stability properties of fully nonlinear axisymmetric magnetoconvection, which {{takes the form of a}} central flux tube surrounded by a convecting field-free region.

It is proposed that some plasmaspheric ELF hiss {{is generated by}} ring current protons. The mechanism by which waves are generated is the anisotropic proton instability magnetospheric (APIM) hiss mechanism. APIM hiss (with a frequency close to the lower hybrid resonance frequency) is a loss-cone, <b>flute</b> <b>instability</b> arising from proton velocity space anisotropies. The energy driving the waves comes from the free energy of the 'inverted population' of the proton loss-cone distribution.

A theoretical model describing the barium neutral cloud expansion and the ion cloud formation is developed. The mechanism of formation of the striational features observed in the release is also discussed. Two candidate instabilities, which may contribute to striation formation, are examined. The drift instability stemming from the outwardly directed drag force exerted on the ions by the outstreaming neutrals is rejected {{on the grounds that the}} ion density is too low during the collision-dominated phase of the cloud expansion to support this kind of instability. The joint action of Rayleigh-Taylor and <b>flute</b> <b>instabilities</b> plausibly accounts for the observed striational structure.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} self-regulation {{mechanism of}} the drift wave turbulence has been subject to attentions in order to clarify the structural formation of the plasma turbulence. The drift wave instability has been extensively studied in linear magnetized plasmas in different plasma parameter regimes, including weakly ionized, fully ionized, collisionless and collision plasmas [1]. In the magnetic confinement hot plasmas, there has been considerable interest in the coexistence and the competition between the dissipative instability (such as the collisional drift wave instability) and the reactive instability (such as the <b>flute</b> wave <b>instability)</b> recently. In this paper, we investigate the interaction of drift wave and <b>flute</b> wave <b>instabilities</b> using the bounded linear Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma device.

A method for calibrating telescopes is considered by which well-studied objects will be photographed to provide references for images of Halley's Comet. This procedure is expected to reduce errors to approximately 0. 05 mag. A coordinated study of Halley's Comet will provide important data on the physical properties of the Comet.

40|$|The {{sporadic}} {{disruption of}} the plasma tails of some comets has recently been explained {{to be caused by}} magnetic-field-line reconnection in the cometary ionospheres due to magnetic-sector-boundary traversals. An alternative model is proposed in which the tail disruption is the end result of compression of the cometary ionosphere by high-velocity solar-wind streams, triggering the <b>flute</b> <b>instability</b> in the marginally stable tangential-discontinuity surface which separates the cometary ionosphere from the solar-wind plasma. According to the proposed model, the tail-disruption events could occur at all heliographic latitudes, whereas the Niedner-Brandt (1978) model should predict that these events are restricted to low heliographic latitudes in view of the present understanding of the sector structure of the heliosphere.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the Venus ionopause is examined {{in light of the}} importance of gravitation and curvature. Using a one-fluid approximation for the equation of motion of the plasma, and ignoring the effects of neutrals, a dispersion relation is obtained that includes the effects of the magnetic field, sheared plasma flow, buoyancy, centrifugal force and magnetic tension due to boundary curvature. It is found that buoyancy acts to neutralize the <b>flute</b> <b>instability.</b> As expected, the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode is the dominant instability over most of the dayside ionopause. The expected growth times of this mode are short in comparison with the wave-convection time over the boundary; the waves can grow and saturate quickly, producing a turbulent boundary that may affect electrodynamic coupling between the solar wind and ionospheric plasmas...|$|E
40|$|After a {{dynamically}} active emergence phase, {{magnetic flux}} at the solar surface soon ceases to show strong {{signs of the}} subsurface dynamics of its parent magnetic structure. This indicates {{that some kind of}} disconnection of the emerged flux from its roots in the deep convection zone should take place. We propose a mechanism for the dynamical disconnection of the surface flux based upon the buoyant upflow of plasma along the field lines. Such flows arise in the upper part of a rising flux loop during the final phases of its buoyant ascent towards the surface. The combination of the pressure buildup by the upflow and the cooling of the upper layers of an emerged flux tube by radiative losses at the surface lead to a progressive weakening of the magnetic field in several Mm depth. When the field strength has become sufficiently low, convective motions and the <b>fluting</b> <b>instability</b> disrupt the flux tube into thin, passively advected flux fragments, thus providing a dynamical disconnection of the emerged part from its roots. We substantiate this scenario by considering the quasi-static evolution of a sunspot model under the effects of radiative cooling, convective energy transport, and pressure buildup by a prescribed inflow {{at the bottom of the}} model. For inflow speeds in the range shown by simulations of thin flux tubes, we find that the disconnection takes place in a depth between 2 and 6 Mm for disconnection times up to 3 days.

On time-scales shorter than the poloidal rotation time, the time series of potential and electron density fluctuations measured on stationary Langmuir probes essentially reflect the spatial poloidal structure of the turbulent field (Taylor hypothesis). On these time scales the signals reveals an intermittent character exposed via analysis of probability density functions and computation of multifractal dimension spectra in different regimes of time scales. This intermittency {{is associated with the}} shape and distribution of pronounced spikes in the signal.

In order to clarify effects ofboth radial electric field and its shear on low-frequency fluctuations, systematic experiments and precise measurements {{have been done in}} a small linear device, Qr-U of Tohoku University. Drift-mode fluctuations depend on both radial electric field and its shear. The driftmode is destabilized in the region of weakly negative electric field. In the strong E. region, the mode is suppressed, irrespective of its sign. This behavior agrees qualitatively with that observed in the ECH mode of GAMMAI 0. The drift-mode in the Q 7 -U is clearly stabilized by the increase in the net ion drift shear which is defined as the sum of. E x I drift shear and ion diamagnetic drift shear.

40|$|AbstractSaturn’s moon Rhea {{is thought}} to be a simple plasma absorber, however, {{energetic}} particle observations in its vicinity show a variety of unexpected and complex interaction features that do not conform with our current understanding about plasma absorbing interactions. Energetic electron data are especially interesting, as they contain a series of broad and narrow flux depletions {{on either side of the}} moon’s wake. The association of these dropouts with absorption by dust and boulders orbiting within Rhea’s Hill sphere was suggested but subsequently not confirmed, so in this study we review data from all four Cassini flybys of Rhea to date seeking evidence for alternative processes operating within the moon’s interaction region. We focus on energetic electron observations, which we put in context with magnetometer, cold plasma density and energetic ion data. All flybys have unique features, but here we only focus on several structures that are consistently observed. The most interesting common feature is that of narrow dropouts in energetic electron fluxes, visible near the wake flanks. These are typically seen together with narrow flux enhancements inside the wake. A phase-space-density analysis for these structures from the first Rhea flyby (R 1) shows that Liouville’s theorem holds, suggesting that they may be forming due to rapid transport of energetic electrons from the magnetosphere to the wake, through narrow channels. A series of possibilities are considered to explain this transport process. We examined whether complex energetic electron drifts in the interaction region of a plasma absorbing moon (modeled through a hybrid simulation code) may allow such a transport. With the exception of several features (e. g. broadening of the central wake with increasing electron energy), most of the commonly observed interaction signatures in energetic electrons (including the narrow structures) were not reproduced. Additional dynamical processes, not simulated by the hybrid code, should be considered in order to explain the data. For the small scale features, the possibility that a <b>flute</b> (interchange) <b>instability</b> acts on the electrons is discussed. This instability is probably driven by strong gradients in the plasma pressure and the magnetic field magnitude: magnetometer observations show clearly signatures consistent with the (expected) plasma pressure loss due to ion absorption at Rhea. Another potential driver of the instability could have been gradients in the cold plasma density, which are, however, surprisingly absent from most crossings of Rhea’s plasma wake. The lack of a density depletion in Rhea’s wake suggests the presence of a local cold plasma source region. Hybrid plasma simulations show that this source cannot be the ionized component of Rhea’s weak exosphere. It is probably related to accelerated photoelectrons from the moon’s negatively charged surface, indicating that surface charging may play a very important role in shaping Rhea’s magnetospheric interaction region...|$|R

The interacting large-scale structures of fine field elements are separated by numerous non-force-free elements (tangential discontinuities) which are neglected in the traditional field picture. An incorporation of these elements into the model implies a dynamical rather than statical character of equilibrium of the field configuration. A transition of the system into flaring can be triggered by the ballooning mode of <b>flute</b> <b>instability</b> of prominences or/and coronal condensations.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of fluctuations on electron-neutral collision frequency (V en) and the radial location is investigated in an {{electron cyclotron resonance}} plasma in a divergent magnetic field region {{for a set of}} magnetic fields. Results indicate that the fluctuations depend strongly on the collision frequency.

Coherent wave modes are found to contribute up to about 30 % of the total fluctuation power, and two to three harmonics are present in the power spectra. There are two principal modes present in the discharge: one appears to be a dissipative mode associated with a collisional drift wave instability initiated at a lower pressure (collision frequencies) (∼ 0. 5 mTorr) and is stabilized at a higher pressure (≳ 3 mTorr). The other mode appears at intermediate pressure (≳ 1. 75 mTorr) and possesses the signature of a <b>flute</b> <b>instability.</b> The fluctuation levels indicate that flute modes are predominant in the discharge at higher pressures (> 1. 75 mTorr) and at higher values of the magnetic field (∼ 540 Gauss) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pulsating and {{explosive}} time {{profiles of}} mm-wave solar bursts observed at Metsähovi are examined {{in terms of}} the energy release in a single current-carrying loop. We suppose that the electric current in the loop is driven by photospheric convective flows. The flare occurs due to <b>flute</b> <b>instability</b> provoking the penetration of partially ionized plasma from the chromosphere or prominence into the current channel of a loop and increasing the loop resistance by many orders of magnitude. The feedback of deviation of the loop magnetic field on the energy release rate is taken into account. Joule plasma heating due to current dissipation and electron acceleration in DC electric field are considered. Both processes act simultaneously and are driven by one parameter, the penetration depth of partially ionized plasma into the current-carrying loop. Two regimes of energy release are studied: (i) Pulsating energy release in current-carrying loops with negative radial gradient of gas pressure; (ii) Explosive plus pulsating energy release in a loop with positive radial gradient of gas pressure. One can explain the various time behaviours of the flares, for example, several quasi-periodic pulses, and pulsations with increasing amplitude at pre-flash phase followed by explosive enhancement of the emission at flash phase. The possibility of powerful flare in current-carrying magnetic loop with plasma beta β ≪ 1 is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe analyse the {{interchange}} or <b>flute</b> <b>instability</b> of {{the equatorial}} plasma disk in Jupiter's middle magnetosphere. Particular {{attention is paid}} to wave coupling between the dense plasma in the equatorial disk and the more rarefied plasma at higher latitudes, and between the latter plasma and the conducting ionosphere {{at the feet of the}} field lines. It is assumed that the flute perturbations are of small spatial scale in the azimuthal direction, such that a local Cartesian approximation may be employed, in which the effect of the centrifugal acceleration associated with plasma rotation is represented by an "external" force in the "radial" direction, perpendicular to the plasma flow. For such small-scale perturbations the ionosphere can also be treated as a perfect electrical conductor, and the condition is determined under which this approximation holds. We then examine the condition under which flute perturbations are at the threshold of instability, and use this to determine the corresponding limiting radial density gradient within the plasma disk. We find that when the density of the high-latitude plasma is sufficiently low compared with that of the disk, such that coupling to the ionosphere is not important, the limiting radial density profile within the disk follows that of the equatorial magnetic field strength as expected. However, as the density of the high-latitude plasma increases toward that of the equatorial disk, the limiting density profile in the disk falls increasingly steeply compared with that of the magnetic field, due to the increased stabilising effect of the ionospheric interaction. An initial examination of Galileo plasma density and magnetic field profiles, specifically for orbit G 08, indicates that the latter effect is indeed operative inside radial distances of ~ 20 R J. At larger distances, however, additional density smoothing effects appear to be important...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic field {{fluctuations}} {{were observed}} in the data of Voyager 1 on its inbound leg in Saturn’s magnetosphere from about 19 to 8. 4 Saturn radii, during the interval 7 - 17 hours before closest approach. These low amplitude oscillations had the appearance of irregular micropulsations. The wave periods in the spacecraft frame varied between ≈ 1 and 20 minutes with {{a tendency to be}} inversely correlated with the field strength. An eigenfunction analysis yielding wave propagation direction as a function of frequency showed that at and near peak frequency two distinct types of waves were present, one propagating along field lines (within 30 °) usually at the higher frequencies considered, (4 - 14) x l 0 - 3 Hz, and the other propagating along φ ̂ (the azimuthal direction in a standard spherical coordinate system) at lower frequencies, (0. 8 - 4) x l 0 - 3 Hz. The power spectral density [in (nT) 2 /Hz] at the peaks tended to be inversely related to frequency over the full set of frequencies. An interpretation of these results is that Alfven waves are propagating along field lines at the higher frequencies with wavelengths between 1 / 4 and 1 / 2 RS. These occur in both the mantle and plasma sheet. The waves traveling along φ ̂ which are observed to occur in the low latitude plasma mantle, are apparently manifestations of rapidly corotating MHD waves with large compressional components and are probably due to the operation of the centrifugal <b>flute</b> <b>instability</b> at the plasma sheet-mantle boundary. For both types wave absorption occurs with a high frequency cutoff at or near the gyrofrequency of O+ (and/or N+). Our results establish the framework for MHD waves within Saturn’s outer magnetosphere and it is expected that the Cassini Mission, for which orbit insertion occurred on July 1, 2004, will add considerably to that presented here...|$|E
