"See, dear child," [...] said Susan, [...] "while {{she only}} gave thee an orange stuck with cloves, or an <b>embroidery</b> <b>needle,</b> {{or even a}} puppy dog, it is all very well; {{but when it comes}} to Spanish gloves and coral clasps, the next time there is an outcry about a plot, some evil-disposed person would be sure to say that Master Richard Talbot had been taking bribes through his daughter." ...|$|E

[...] Gertie {{carefully}} stuck her <b>embroidery</b> <b>needle</b> into her doily, rolled up the doily meticulously, laid it down on the center-table, straightened the pile of magazines which Carl had deranged, and rose. [...] "But I'm glad you could drop up this evening. Come up any time you haven't anything better to do. Oh--what about our tramp? If you know some place that is better than Bronx Park, we might try it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bunka shishu (文化刺繍), in English often {{shortened}} to bunka, {{is a form}} of Japanese embroidery originating {{around the}} turn of the 20th century. Bunka artists use a specialized <b>embroidery</b> <b>needle</b> and rayon threads to create very detailed pictures that some liken to oil paintings. Typical subjects include people, living things (traditionally fish), and traditional Japanese scenes.|$|E
50|$|Buttonhole stitch and {{the related}} blanket stitch are hand-sewing {{stitches}} used in tailoring, <b>embroidery,</b> and <b>needle</b> lace-making.|$|R
50|$|A {{sewing needle}} for hand-sewing {{is a long}} slender tool with a pointed tip {{at one end and}} a hole or eye at the other. The {{earliest}} needles were made of bone or wood; modern ones are manufactured from high carbon steel wire and are nickel- or 18K gold-plated for corrosion resistance. The highest quality <b>embroidery</b> <b>needles</b> are plated with two-thirds platinum and one-third titanium alloy. Traditionally, needles have been kept in needle books or needlecases which have become objects of adornment. Sewing needles may also be kept in an etui, a small box that held needles and other items such as scissors, pencils and tweezers.|$|R
5000|$|Cutwork or cut work, {{also known}} as punto tagliato in Italian, is a {{needlework}} technique in which portions of a textile, typically cotton or linen, are cut away and the resulting [...] "hole" [...] is reinforced and filled with <b>embroidery</b> or <b>needle</b> lace.|$|R
50|$|Chikan work in {{the recent}} times has adapted {{additional}} embellishments like Mukaish, Kamdani, Badla, Kamdani, sequin, bead and mirror work, which gives it a rich look. Chikan embroidery is mostly done on fabrics like cotton, semi-Georgette, pure Georgette, crepe, chiffon, silk and any other fabric which is light and which highlights the embroidery. The fabric cannot be too thick or hard, else the <b>embroidery</b> <b>needle</b> won't pierce it.|$|E
50|$|In {{everyday}} language, {{a stitch}} {{in the context}} of embroidery or hand-sewing is defined as the movement of the <b>embroidery</b> <b>needle</b> from the backside of the fabric to the front side and back to the back side. The thread stroke on the front side produced by this is also called stitch. In the context of embroidery, an embroidery stitch means one or more stitches that are always executed in the same way, forming a figure. Embroidery stitches are also called stitches for short.|$|E
5000|$|Smocking {{requires}} lightweight fabric with {{a stable}} weave that gathers well. Cotton and silk are typical fiber choices, often in lawn or voile. Smocking is {{worked on a}} crewel <b>embroidery</b> <b>needle</b> in cotton or silk thread and normally requires three times the width of initial material as the finished item will have. [...] Historically, smocking was also worked in piqué, crepe de Chine, and cashmere. [...] According to Good Housekeeping: The Illustrated Book of Needlecrafts, [...] "Any type of fabric can be smocked if it is supple enough to be gathered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fundamentally, {{women were}} thought to be taking work defined as [...] "men's work;" [...] however, the work women did was {{typically}} catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity. For example, in a Sperry Corporation recruitment pamphlet the company stated, [...] "Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press." [...] A Ford Motor Company at Willow Run bomber plant publication proclaimed, [...] "The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters." [...] One manager was even stated saying, [...] "Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied <b>embroidery</b> <b>needles,</b> knitting needles and darning needs all their lives?" [...] In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.|$|R
5000|$|Broderie anglaise (French, [...] "English embroidery") is a whitework {{needlework}} technique incorporating {{features of}} <b>embroidery,</b> cutwork and <b>needle</b> lace that became associated with England, {{due to its}} popularity there in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Small {{rectangular}} {{pieces of}} metal are squeezed shut around some threads of the fabric. Mukesh work (known also as badla or fardi), includes women making shiny stitches amid chikan <b>embroidery</b> using a <b>needle</b> and long, thin strips of metal.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{research}} projects and patents have proposed to apply embroidery of conductive yarn to build electric circuits on textile substrates. To contact electronic modules or components to these circuits, embroidery itself was applied as a contacting method. Thereby, the <b>embroidery</b> <b>needle</b> is stitching through a conductive pad on an electronic substrate and is laying the conductive thread over this pad. The yarn and the pad establish an electrical contact. However, until today this contacting technology based on embroidery has not been adopted by the industry since reliability issues during stress were reported by different researchers. Yet, neither these failure phenomena were investigated comprehensively, nor was it attempted to understand their cause. This inhibited potential improvements to make these embroidered contacts reliable. Furthermore, the lack of alternative technologies for a reliable and volume producible contacting of embroidered circuits with electronic components or modules kept embroidered circuits from evolving to actual products. Therefore, this thesis primarily develops {{an understanding of the}} contact mechanism underlying embroidered contacts, and develops a theory that explains the failure phenomena. Secondarily the thesis overcomes these reliability issues by improving these contacts and by finding alternatives. The ultimate goal beyond this thesis is a volume producible contacting process. Therefore, this thesis looks mainly at machine embroidered contacts...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} first Millennium BC elite {{garments}} {{can be considered}} to be exceptional; as is it actually possible to correlate surviving physical remains with comparable textual and artistic evidence The main purpose of this investigation is to bring into academic discussion the visual corpus of late Neo-Elamite elite garments and head-dresses. To this purpose, the author has assembled quality photographs and produced complementary new line-drawings. An important element of diagnosis characterizing the Neo-Elamite elite robe is the combination of fringes with parallel (ladder) bands including rosettes or disks. Stylistically (and chronologically) this clothing is framed by the lavish elite Mesopotamian "sky-garments" which by the 7 th century BC had distinctly evolved towards a "minimalist" display of arrangements and motifs. This reduced repertoire is contrasted by an affluence of bracteates in the shape of rosettes, circles or dots, and squares. On the other end there is a variety of costumes and new garment styles introduced during the Persian Empire, including the broad-sleeve, draped court-dress, introduced by Darius I with its conspicuous absence of fringes. In addition, the fortuitous discoveries at Arj?n and Nimrud of cotton-made fabrics indicate that by the 8 th- 7 th centuries BC a novelty of garments were being adopted by members of the Assyrian and Elamite elites. Taken altogether, this evidence suggests an innovative period in the history of garments characterized by the presence of splendid wardrobes and luxurious fabrics, sumptuously ornamented, with metal appliqu's (bracteates), sophisticated <b>embroidery</b> (<b>needle</b> work), and fringes (knotted work including rosettes). 29 page(s...|$|E
50|$|In {{the textile}} arts, a stitch {{is a single}} turn or loop of thread, or yarn. Stitches are the {{fundamental}} elements of sewing, knitting, <b>embroidery,</b> crochet, and <b>needle</b> lace-making, whether by hand or machine. A variety of stitches, each {{with one or more}} names, are used for specific purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectangular}} {{shape of}} the fabric indicates a life's journey and the ornamentation captures the cultural ancestral memory of the region. The material used is either linen or hemp. The act of spinning thread {{and the process of}} weaving linen embodies spiritual power dating back to the ancient deity Mokosh who is often represented in <b>embroidery.</b> The <b>needle</b> has its own energy, an idea similar to acupuncture, and the color of the thread has sacred meaning. Red represents life and is the main color used. A rushnyk is given to a baby at birth, it follows the person throughout life and used in the funeral service after death.|$|R
5000|$|Xiyoubu (西遊補 - [...] "Supplement to the Journey to the West", 1640) - A Ming dynasty {{addendum}} to {{the famous}} Chinese novel Journey to the West, which takes place {{between the end of}} chapter 61 and the beginning of 62. In the novel, The Monkey King faces a representation of his own carnal desires and is trapped inside of a tower full of mirrors, each with its own powers. One mirror causes him to travel forward in time, from the Tang to the Song dynasty. There, some junior devils appear and tell him that the ruler of the underworld King Yama has recently died of an illness, and so Monkey must take his place until a suitable replacement can be found. Monkey ends up judging the fate of the recently deceased Prime Minister Qin Hui. He tortures Qin into confessing his sins. These tortures include having millions of <b>embroidery</b> <b>needles</b> shoved into his flesh, being ground into paste, thrown onto a mountain of swords and spears, hacked into bits, forced to drink human pus, and his rib cage ripped apart to give him the appearance of a dragon fly. A demon is charged with using his magic breath to [...] "blow" [...] Qin back into his proper form. Monkey finally sends a demon to heaven to retrieve a powerful magic gourd that sucks anyone, who speaks before it, inside, and melts them down into a bloody stew. He uses this gourd for Qin's final punishment. Meanwhile, Monkey invites the ghost of Yue Fei to the underworld and takes him as his third master. (He claims this completes his lessons on the three religions since: 1) the immortal Subhodi taught him Taoist magic 2) the Tang Monk taught him Buddhist restraint and 3) Yue Fei taught him Confucian ideals.) He entertains Yue Fei until Qin has been reduced to liquid and offers the general a cup of Qin's [...] "blood wine." [...] Yue, however, refuses on the grounds that drinking it would sully his soul. Monkey then does an experiment where he makes a junior devil drink the wine. Sometime later, the devil, apparently under the evil influence of the blood wine, murders his personal religious teacher and escapes into the [...] "gate of ghosts," [...] presumably being reborn into another existence. Yue Fei then takes his leave to return to his heavenly abode. Monkey sends him off with a huge display of respect by making all of the millions of denizens of the underworld kowtow before him.|$|R

40|$|Ode to Colin Wiggins’ 	-A {{project by}} Andrew Kenny in {{collaboration}} with the National Gallery The National Gallery was founded ‘to give the people an ennobling enjoyment’ and this democratic approach to high-art was something I wanted to explore with this project. My original aim was to find out how people today gained this ‘ennobling enjoyment’ and in particular, how it related to my own specialism of Textiles for Fashion. To do this I asked my undergraduate textiles students to visit the gallery and pick out two or three paintings that appealed to them. I then filmed them at the gallery talking about what it was that they liked about them and how they inspired their own practice. I was accompanied on these interviews by Colin Wiggins, Head of Education at the NG and asked him to talk to the student and myself about each painting after the interview. I was stuck not only by Colin’s vast knowledge of the paintings, but also by how he managed to bring each one to life by connecting its story directly to the life in interests of the student. I decided that, as Colin had been such an inspiration, it might be nice to dedicate the project to him and his inspiring narratives of the paintings. To draw from this research I explored the textile medium of patchwork to represent the storytelling that I found so inspiring. My final piece, entitled ‘Ode to Colin Wiggins’ {{takes the form of a}} full-scale embroidered and printed patchwork quilt and brings together many drawings based on the interviews that I conducted. The process used to drawing the picture of Colin (featured centrally on the quilt) connects the embroidery with the paintings and the history of the paintings with their modern narratives. It was created by subverting the use of a CAD embroidery machine by attaching a paintbrush to the head of a CAD <b>embroidery</b> machine. The <b>needle</b> on the machine is prevented from going down and fabric was replaced in the embroidery hoop by paper which was dragged underneath the paintbrush producing strokes and marks which look like stitches. The embroidered and printed patches around his head, and the magazine in his arms visually represent the stories and narratives for the interviews. This work was part of a larger project executed by researchers of London College of Fashion’s Drawing Hub {{in collaboration with}} the National Gallery over the period of a year. The research was presented at a symposium in May 2013 at LCF and the results of this work and shown in an event at the National Gallery on 14 th June 2013. ‘Flight: Drawing Interpretations’ was an exhibition that brought together a group of researchers from London College of Fashion who, over a period of a year, engaged directly with the collection at the National Gallery in London in response to the theme of ‘Flight’. The process of drawing as a means of investigation, of thinking and articulating ideas, played a pivotal role in the development of this research. Late Night Exhibition at the National Gallery showcased this research...|$|R
