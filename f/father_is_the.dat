25|$|In Eastern Orthodox Christianity {{theology}} {{starts with}} the Father hypostasis, not the essence of God, since the <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> God of the Old Testament. The <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> origin of all things {{and this is the}} basis and starting point of the Orthodox trinitarian teaching of one God in Father, one God, of the essence of the Father (as the uncreated comes from the Father as this is what the Father is). In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the uncreated Father (God).|$|E

25|$|The three {{centers are}} {{directly}} related to the Trinity, Trimurti, or threefold-ness of creation, the intellect being related to the Father (Kether, Affirmation, Positive), the emotion related to the Son, (Chokmah, Denial, Negation), and the sexual center related to the Holy Spirit (Binah, Reconcile, Neutral).

25|$|In Eastern Orthodox theology, {{essence of}} God being {{that which is}} beyond human {{comprehension}} {{and can not be}} defined and or approached by human understanding. Roman Catholic teachings are somewhat similar in considering the mysteries of the Trinity as being beyond human reason. However, differences exist in that in Roman Catholic theology and teaching, God the <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> eternal source of the Son (begot the Son by an eternal generation) and of the Holy Spirit (by an eternal procession from the Father and the Son) and the one who breathes the Holy Spirit with and through the Son, but the Eastern Orthodox consider the Spirit to proceed from the Father alone.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> eternal, {{infinite}} and uncreated reality, {{that the}} Christ and the Holy Spirit are also eternal, infinite and uncreated, in that their origin {{is not in}} the ousia of God, but that their origin is in the hypostasis of God called the Father. The double procession of the Holy Spirit bears some resemblance to the teachings of Macedonius I of Constantinople and his sect called the Pneumatomachians in that the Holy Spirit is created by the Son and a servant of the Father and the Son. It was Macedonius' position that caused the specific wording of the section on the Holy Spirit by St Gregory of Nyssa in the finalized Nicene creed.|$|E
