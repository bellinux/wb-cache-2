Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. This union was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> <b>had</b> no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|E

25|$|Eliot {{arranged}} for a formal separation in February 1933, and thereafter shunned her entirely, hiding from her and instructing his friends– including members of the Bloomsbury Group and the publisher Faber & Faber, {{where he was a}} director– not to tell her where he was. <b>Her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> her committed to an asylum in 1938, after she was found wandering the streets of London at five o'clock in the morning, apparently asking whether Eliot had been beheaded. Apart from one escape attempt, she remained there until she died nine years later at the age of 58; she was said to have suffered a heart attack, although there is a suspicion that she took an overdose. Eliot won the Nobel Prize for Literature the following year.|$|E

25|$|Stoltenberg's drug {{addiction}} became {{known to the}} Norwegian public in October 2001, one week after <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> resigned from his first cabinet.

Following the program in which she appeared together with her father, Thorvald Stoltenberg, she received more than 2,000 letters of support from viewers who {{in one way or another}} had experienced the problems associated with illegal drug abuse. Thorvald Stoltenberg has described his experiences with having a child who was an intravenous drug user in his 2001 memoirs, Det handler om mennesker ("It's about people")–one day being immersed in peace negotiations in the Balkans, the next wandering the streets of Oslo trying to find Nini.|$|E

25|$|James Smithson {{was born}} in c. 1765 to Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland and Elizabeth Hungerford Keate Macie. His mother was the widow of James Macie, a wealthy man from Weston, Bath. An illegitimate child, Smithson {{was born in}} secret in Paris, {{resulting}} in his birth name being the Francophone Jacques-Louis Macie (later altered to James Louis Macie). After {{the death of his}} parents, he changed his last name to Smithson, the surname of his biological father prior to marriage. He was educated and eventually naturalised in England. In 1766, his mother inherited from the Hungerford family of Studley, where <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> lived up until his death. His controversial step-father John Marshe Dickinson (aka Dickenson) of Dunstable died in 1771. Smithson enrolled at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1782 and graduated in 1786, later taking his MA.

500|$|At the {{sentencing}} hearing on April 27, 2016, the government presented two witnesses. Jolene Burdge, {{the sister of}} Stephen Reinboldt, read a letter that <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> written {{shortly before his death}} in 1995. Addressing Hastert, Burdge stated that she wanted to [...] "hold you accountable for sexually abusing my brother. I knew your secret, and you couldn't bribe or intimidate your way out. ... You think you can deny your abuse of Steve because he can no longer speak for himself -- that's why I'm here." ...|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{also ran}} an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member, {{and led the}} group on a diving trip to the Bahamas.

Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. [...] Jolene said that Hastert [...] "damaged Steve I think more than any of us will ever know." ...|$|E

30|$|A 79 -year-old {{woman had}} been seeing her family doctor for {{hypertension}} and {{had been diagnosed with}} liver dysfunction for about 10  years. She continued to attend follow-ups because of her drinking habit. Two months before her visiting our institution, further elevation of hepatobiliary enzymes was noted, and abdominal ultrasonography showed a hepatic tumor of 4  cm in diameter in the lateral segment, so she was referred to our hospital. HCC was suspected because AFP (102  ng/ml) and L 3 fraction (85.4 %) were elevated, and the appearance on enhanced computed tomography (CT) was not inconsistent with HCC. Thus, she was hospitalized for surgery. The patient was a non-smoker, had a history of habitual alcohol consumption, and reported a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her father and one of <b>her</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>had</b> had esophagus cancers, two of <b>her</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>had</b> liver cirrhosis, and one of <b>her</b> <b>brothers</b> received dialysis.|$|R
500|$|In her memoir, Stanton {{credits the}} Cadys' neighbor, Rev. Simon Hosack, with {{strongly}} encouraging her intellectual development and academic abilities {{at a time}} when she felt these were undervalued by her father. Writing of her brother Eleazar's death in 1826, Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father, saying that she would try to be all <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> been. At the time, her father's response devastated Stanton: [...] "Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!" [...] Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls, Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack, whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father's perceived disparagement. Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek, encouraged her to read widely, and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books. His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton's confidence and self-esteem.|$|E
500|$|The {{legend of}} the green {{children}} of Woolpit concerns two children of unusual skin colour who reportedly appeared {{in the village of}} Woolpit in Suffolk, England, some time in the 12th century, perhaps during the reign of King Stephen. The children, brother and sister, were of generally normal appearance except for the green colour of their skin. They spoke in an unknown language, and would only eat raw broad beans. Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green pallor, but the boy was sickly and died soon after he and his sister were baptised. The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be [...] "rather loose and wanton in her conduct". After she learned to speak English, the girl explained that she and <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> come from Saint Martin's Land, a subterranean world inhabited by green people.|$|E
500|$|Beatrice {{left home}} when Mills {{was nine years}} old, which left her, her older brother Shane, and her younger sister, Fiona, {{in the care of}} their father. Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons. The window broke and <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father". (Their father disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.) ...|$|E

Following the accident, her initial hospitalisation and rehabilitation was in Canberra for three months, among elderly amputees. Her rehabilitation was then moved to the Royal North Shore Hospital, where she met Christie Dawes (née Skelton), who she would later race with in the Australian 4x100m relay team at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics. Because <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> spina bifida, and was already [...] "in the [...] system", her parents insisted that Angie continue at a regular school, rather than one specifically for disabled students. She attended Lyneham Primary School and Lyneham High School in Canberra. Her physical education teacher {{was one of the people}} who first encouraged her to participate in wheelchair sports. After her rehabilitation she tried swimming and wheelchair basketball. Her first experiences of racing at the age of 12 resulted in blisters and a sore neck, but wheelchair athletics soon became her passion.
