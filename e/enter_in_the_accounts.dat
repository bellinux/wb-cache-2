The end of practical part consists of analysis receivables and trade payables, which is important for evaluate their development and complete economic situation...|$|R
50|$|Part IV, Title XI, Law xvii: Concerning Separate Property Belonging to the Wife, Which is Not Given as Dowry, and Which is Called in Latin, Paraphernalia. (return) All {{property}} and possessions, whether personal or real, which women keep separately for themselves, {{and do not}} <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> of a dowry, are called in Greek parapherna, and this derived its name from para, which means, <b>in</b> Greek, <b>the</b> same as near, and pherna which {{takes the place of}} dowry, <b>in</b> Greek, <b>the</b> same as things which are joined to, or connected with a dowry. All <b>the</b> articles called, <b>in</b> Greek, parapherna, when they are given by a wife to her husband with the intention that he shall have control of them as long as the marriage lasts, he has the right to keep, just as those which are given him by way of dowry. Where they are not specifically given to the husband, and it was not the intention of the wife that he should have control of them, she always remains their owner; and the same rule applies whenever any doubt arises whether she gave them to her husband or not.|$|R
60|$|It is stated and <b>entered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account,</b> that an {{entertainment}} was provided for Mr. Hastings {{at the rate}} of 200l. a day. He stayed at Moorshedabad for near three months; and thus you see that visits from Mr. Hastings are pretty expensive things: it is {{at the rate of}} 73,000l. a year for his entertainment. We find that Mr. Middleton, an English gentleman who was with him, received likewise (whether under the same pretence I know not, and it does not signify) another sum equal to it; and if these two gentlemen had stayed in that country a year, their several allowances would have been 146,000l. out of the Nabob's allowance of 160,000l. a year: they would have eat up nearly the whole of it. And do you wonder, my Lords, that such guests and such hosts are difficult to be divided? Do you wonder that such visits, when so well paid for and well provided for, were naturally long? There is hardly a prince in Europe who would give to another prince of Europe from his royal hospitality what was given upon this occasion to Mr. Hastings.|$|R
50|$|The «Gesellschaft für schweizerische Kunstgeschichte GSK» (Society for {{the history}} of art in Switzerland SHAS), named thus since 1934, was founded in June 1880 <b>in</b> Zofingen under <b>the</b> name of the «Vaterländische Gesellschaft für Erhaltung historischer Denkmäler» (Patriotic Society for the {{preservation}} of historic monuments). Its creation was due to important personalities, members of the Schweizerischer Kunstverein (Swiss society of fine arts), and its first president was the Genevan painter, Theodore de Saussure, grandson of the celebrated naturalist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure. The vice-presidency was held by the Zurich art historian Johann Rudolf Rahn. The «Patriotic society for the preservation of historic monuments» had as its aim to preserve and restore architectural monuments, but also to save scattered works of art by bringing them together in museums, to arouse a better understanding for the «fine arts» and to support artists, painters and sculptors. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> statutes adopted at the meeting of this committee on 20 June 1880, the name of the society was altered to «Verein für Erhaltung vaterländischer Kunstdenkmäler» (Association for the preservation of artistic monuments of the fatherland). The regulations stipulated that the sums received must be divided and <b>entered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>in</b> two equal shares to be used, on the one hand, to finance publications and, on the other hand, to buy works of art and old objects of value. This second part of the fund was also allocated for the restoration of historic monuments that were at risk of being destroyed or falling into ruin.|$|R

5000|$|The company {{published}} a pamphlet in 1719, setting out its practice. The procedure {{was that a}} borrower took goods {{to one of the}} corporation's warehouses and signed a bill of sale. The warehouse keeper valued the pledge and he and an assistant signed a certificate. This was passed to <b>the</b> bookkeeper for <b>entering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corporation's <b>accounts,</b> and then to the cashier who paid the borrower his loan. Both the warehouse keeper and the cashier were required to give security, and there were surveyors of warehouses to act as a check on the warehousekeepers. Furthermore, the books were signed every night. Unredeemed pledges could be sold after a year. The borrower had not only to pay lawful interest (five percent) but also fees of a similar amount, so that the company was actually receiving considerably more than [...] "lawful interest". [...] These systems should have been sufficient to prevent fraud, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1720s, compliance with the procedure became lax, opening the way to fraud on a massive scale.|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} {{estimates of}} fixed capital comprise four vital measures: investment, {{the most dynamic}} component of GDP; the gross capital stock, which determines national output capacity; the net stock, the value of future capacity and {{a large part of}} measured national wealth; and capital consumption, the annual amount by which the latter shrinks, through wear-and-tear and obsolescence. Yet, it is contended here, by an anomaly of national <b>accounting,</b> <b>the</b> means of producing these statistics are flawed. The annual investment survey lacks vital data categories, and the so-called perpetual inventory method (PIM), using assumed values of service lives, estimates the capital stock and capital consumption with gross inaccuracy. A good system of fixed capital statistics is not possible without a correctly designed survey questionnaire. Unfortunately, present questionnaires generally do not adequately capture the logic of capital accumulation, routinely <b>entered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company <b>accounts.</b> These contain three distinct investment components, capital expenditure on off-the-shelf items directly adding to the producing stock; capital expenditures for work-in-progress that will <b>enter</b> service only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sometimes distant future; and large account transfers, from time to time, when completed work enters service...|$|R
60|$|A tradesman's {{books are}} his repeating clock, which upon all {{occasions}} are {{to tell him}} how he goes on, and how things stand with him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world: there he will know when it is time to go on, or when it is time to give over; and upon his regular keeping, and fully acquainting himself with his books, depends at least the comfort of his trade, if not the very trade itself. If they are not duly posted, and if every thing is not carefully <b>entered</b> <b>in</b> them, <b>the</b> debtor's <b>accounts</b> kept even, <b>the</b> cash constantly balanced, and the credits all stated, the tradesman is like a ship at sea, steered without a helm; he is all in confusion, and knows not what he does, or where he is; he may be a rich man, or a bankrupt--for, in a word, he can give no account of himself to himself, much less to any body else.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} in this account another curious {{circumstance}} {{with regard to the}} deposit of this sum of money, to which he referred in his first paragraph of his letter of the 29th of November, 1780. He states that this deposit was made and passed into the hands of Mr. Larkins on the 1st of June. It did so; but it is not <b>entered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Company's <b>accounts</b> till November following. Now in all that intermediate space where was it? what account was there of it? It was entirely a secret between Mr. Larkins and Mr. Hastings, without a possibility of any one discovering any particular relative to it. Here is an account of two hundred thousand pounds received, juggled between the accountant and him, without a trace of it appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Company's books. Some of those committees, to whom, for their diligence at least, I must say the public have some obligation, and in return for which they ought to meet with some indulgence, examining into all these circumstances, and having heard that Mr. Hastings had deposited a sum of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of <b>the</b> Company's sub-treasurer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> month of June, sent for the Company's books. They looked over those books, but they did not find the least trace of any such sum of money, and not any account of it: nor could there be, because it was not paid to <b>the</b> Company's <b>account</b> till <b>the</b> November following. The accountant had received the money, but never entered it from June till November. Then, at last, have we an account of it. But was it even then entered regularly upon <b>the</b> Company's <b>accounts?</b> No such thing: it is a deposit carried to the Governor-General's credit.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> that {{situation}} <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> of <b>the</b> Company {{were left with}} regard to very great sums which passed through Mr. Hastings's hands, and for which he, instead of giving his masters credit, took credit to himself, and, being their debtor, as he confesses himself to be at that time, took a security for that debt {{as if he had}} been their creditor. This required explanation. Explanation he was called upon for, over and over again; explanation he did not give, and declared he could not give. He was called upon for it when in India: he had not leisure to attend to it there. He was called upon for it when in Europe: he then says he must send for it to India. With much prevarication, and much insolence too, he confesses himself guilty of falsifying <b>the</b> Company's <b>accounts</b> by making himself their creditor when he was their debtor, and giving false accounts of this false transaction. The Court of Directors was slow to believe him guilty; Parliament expressed a strong suspicion of his guilt, and wished for further information. Mr. Hastings about this time began to imagine his conscience to be a faithful and true monitor,--which it were well he had attended to upon many occasions, as it would have saved him his appearance here,--and it told him that he was in great danger from the Parliamentary inquiries that were going on. It was now to be expected that he would have been in haste to fulfil the promise which he had made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Patna letter of the 20th of January, 1782; and accordingly we find that about this time his first agent, Major Fairfax, was sent over to Europe, which agent entered himself at the India House, and appeared before the Committee of the House of Commons, as an agent expressly sent over to explain whatever might appear doubtful in his conduct. Major Fairfax, notwithstanding <b>the</b> character <b>in</b> which Mr. Hastings employed him, appeared to be but a letter-carrier: he had nothing to say: he gave them no information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> India House at all: to the Committee (I can speak with the clearness of a witness) he gave no satisfaction whatever. However, this agent vanished in a moment, in order to make way for another, more substantial, more efficient agent,--an agent perfectly known in this country,--an agent known by the name given to him by Mr. Hastings, who, like the princes of the East, gives titles: he calls him an incomparable agent; and by that name he is very well known to your Lordships and the world. This agent, Major Scott, who I believe was here prior to the time of Major Fairfax's arrival <b>in</b> <b>the</b> character of an agent, and for the very same purposes, was called before the Committee, and examined, point by point, article by article, upon all that obscure enumeration of bribes which the Court of Directors declare they did not understand; but he declared that he could speak nothing with regard to any of these transactions, and that he had got no instructions to explain any part of them. There was but one circumstance which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of his examination we drew from him,--namely, that one of these articles, <b>entered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> of <b>the</b> 22d of May as a deposit, had been received from Mr. Hastings as a bribe from Cheyt Sing. He produced an extract of a letter relative to it, which your Lordships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of this trial may see, and which will lead us into a further and more minute inquiry on that head; but when that committee made their report in 1783, not one single article had been explained to Parliament, not one explained to the Company, except this bribe of Cheyt Sing, which Mr. Hastings had never thought proper to communicate to the East India Company, either by himself, nor, as far as we could find out, by his agent; nor was it at last otherwise discovered than as it was drawn out from him by a long examination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Committee of the House of Commons. And thus, notwithstanding the letters he had written and the agents he employed, he seemed absolutely and firmly resolved to give his employers no satisfaction at all. What is curious in this proceeding is, that Mr. Hastings, all the time he conceals, endeavors to get himself the credit of a discovery. Your Lordships have seen what his discovery is; but Mr. Hastings, among his other very extraordinary acquisitions, has found an effectual method of concealment through discovery. I will venture to say, that, whatever suspicions there might have been of Mr. Hastings's bribes, there was more effectual concealment in regard to every circumstance respecting them in that discovery than if he had kept a total silence. Other means of discovery might have been found, but this, standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way, prevented the employment of those means.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The objectives {{of this study are}} threefold: to describe and analyse what reading material was available in Canada; to explain the business methods by which it was made available; and, to delineate by specific criteria the Scottish contribution to such availability. The study is the first to use newspaper advertisements, circulating library catalogues and business records to examine book availability, at the individual title level, in selected colonial Canadian towns. The primary research material is analysed by means of a customized database, BOOKSCAN, which includes bibliographic, business and geographic information in a single database. BOOKSCAN is a union catalogue with one record for each title, and multiple repeatable fields which detail where, when, how (for sale or loan, at what price, etc.) and by whom the title was made available. Narrative and graphical analyses include: intellectual content, occupation of book provider, geographic route of acquisition, business practice and, country of origin of shipment. Scottish contributions in terms of authorship, publishers, wholesalers and book trade personnel are examined in detail, and some preliminary comparisons are drawn between <b>the</b> trade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Canadian colonies and that <b>in</b> provincial Scotland. <b>The</b> principal findings question previous assumptions about the role of Scots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Canadian book trade. Scottish general merchants were frequently retailers of books in Canada, but Scottish publishers were not proactive in seeking Canadian markets, and Scottish printers tended not to emigrate to Canadian towns in this early period, as they did to American towns. The key business factor which determined whether Scottish publishers and booksellers exported to Canada was having a known contact in a Canadian town. Case studies of several Scots include: Alexander Morrison, bookbinder and stationer in Halifax; Richard, William, James and Alexander Kidston, general merchants in Halifax; and, John Neilson, printer <b>in</b> Quebec. <b>The</b> greatest quantities of books shipped from Scotland were not those works of the Scottish Enlightenment, which tended to be shipped from London, but were school books, Bibles and chapbooks, categories supplied by stationers. The role of wholesaling stationers in book exports, uncovered in this study, suggests that previous surveys of book exports from Scotland may greatly underestimate the total, as stationers' shipments were <b>entered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Customs <b>Accounts</b> generically as "stationery" rather than as "books". Wholesaling stationers in Scotland and Scottish general merchants <b>in</b> Canada are <b>the</b> two principal groups of Scots who contributed to early Canadian book availability. This study contributes new information to the book histories of both Scotland and Canada, and provides a methodological model for future comparative research...|$|R
