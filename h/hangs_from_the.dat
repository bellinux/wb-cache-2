5|$|Over the years, Hydro-Québec {{researchers}} engineered a {{new type}} of pylon, the V-guyed tower, which reduced materials consumption to 11.8 tonnes of steel per kilometre of power line. This type of tower also includes a variation with longer side crossbars, where all conductors are hung with a V-shaped insulator and one with shorter side crossbar, where only the middle bundle <b>hangs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> insulator and the side bundles are strung on vertical insulator strings.|$|E
5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that <b>hangs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> underside of the beak and a fleshy protuberance that <b>hangs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of , the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests {{in which they live}} and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In all of Maryland's species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Four species of Phasianidae have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

25|$|On {{the lower}} {{crosspiece}} {{of the central}} cross are back to back statues (géminée) depicting Mary Cléophas, a piéta and Mary Magdalene on one side with Saint John, a statue of the risen Christ and Saint Peter on the other. On the upper crosspiece are two men on horseback, Saint Longinus and Stephaton, the two soldiers {{who were at the}} crucifixion. It was Longinus who pierced Jesus' side so he carries a lance whilst Stephaton carries a sponge as he was the soldier who gave Jesus a sponge soaked in vinegar. On the reverse side of the two horsemen is a depiction of Jesus tied with ropes ("Christ lié"). Jesus <b>hangs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central cross and is sculpted back to back with an Ecce Homo. The crucified Jesus is surrounded by four small angels who are collecting the blood running from his wounds. Note that Jesus was nailed to the cross but the two thieves were tied to their crosses with rope.|$|E

The {{inscription}} surrounding {{the base of}} the dome (Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevale buntadversus eam: You are Peter (rock) and on that rock I shall build my church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it) is from the Confession of Peter and is {{the same as that of}} St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Above it, there are sculptures of four Doctors of the Church: Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine (his sculpture can be seen from the entrance), Saint Ambrose, and Pope Gregory I. Still above them there are scores of angels. The composition culminates with God the Father in the center of the dome as if to say that God sees everything. This composition seems inverted since the Evangelists are below the Doctors, but that could be a purposeful statement to emphasize importance of the Church after the Council of Trent. A boat-shaped chandelier made of brass and glass beads <b>hangs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> middle of the dome and reminds that Saint Peter was a fisherman. Made by craftsmen from Liepāja and installed in 1905, it had eight seven-branch candle holders.|$|E
