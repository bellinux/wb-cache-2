5|$|Umbridge finally sacks Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher; However, she is outraged when Professor Dumbledore {{undermines}} {{her power}} by allowing Trelawney to continue {{living at the}} school, and hires Firenze, a centaur, to take her place, in spite of Umbridge's prejudice against part-humans. Soon after, Umbridge is given a tip-off about Dumbledore's Army by Marietta Edgecombe, who in doing so unwittingly activates a curse set by Hermione which disfigures her face. Despite Dobby's warning, the gang are caught and <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> with Fudge.

The same year the truth about her illegitimate son is revealed, and when the community discovers this, Betty finds it difficult to face them. She busies herself by taking in lodgers, and acquiring a ginger cat named Marmaduke for extra companionship.

25|$|Several factors {{combine to}} put credit unions {{at risk of}} failure. They may {{not be allowed to}} lend enough money to enough people who are willing and able to repay because of their rules on {{responsible}} lending. When debtors <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble,</b> they will often repay liabilities such as payday loans with high interest rates first, leaving the credit unions until last. In some cases courts may, after ruling against debtors, leniently allow them to pay off their debts with very small payments, sometimes free of interest, over a long period.|$|E
25|$|In China, the {{majority}} of investment is carried out by entities that are at least partially state-owned. Most of these are {{under the control of}} local governments. Thus booms are primarily the result of perverse incentives at the local-government level. Unlike entrepreneurs in a free-enterprise economy, Chinese local officials are motivated primarily by political considerations. As their performance evaluations are based, to a large extent, on GDP growth within their jurisdictions, they have a strong incentive to promote large-scale investment projects. They also don’t face any real bankruptcy risk. When localities <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble,</b> they are invariably bailed out by state-owned banks. Under these circumstances, overinvestment is inevitable.|$|E

25|$|That desire {{manifested}} in two attempted murders. The first happened when Jesperson was around 10 years old. He was {{friends with a}} boy named Martin, and the two would often <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> together. Jesperson claimed he was punished many times for things Martin had done and blamed on Jesperson. This led Jesperson to attack Martin, violently beating him until his father pulled him away. He later claimed his intention was to kill the boy. Approximately a year later, Jesperson was swimming in a lake when another boy held him under water until he blacked out. Some time later, at a public pool, Jesperson attempted to drown the boy, holding his head under water until the lifeguard pulled him away.|$|E

500|$|Banjo-Kazooie was {{developed}} by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles. The game evolved from Project Dream, a cancelled adventure game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that was being developed by Rare's [...] team. Project Dream used Rare's ACM (Advanced Computer Modeling) graphics technology, first used in Donkey Kong Country, to a very advanced level and was originally intended to star a boy named Edison who would own a wooden sword and <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> {{with a group of}} pirates. However, as development of the game continued, Edison was replaced by a rabbit and later a bear, who became Banjo. Although the project was in development for more than one year, it was ultimately cancelled with the introduction of the Nintendo 64, which made the ACM technology obsolete.|$|E
500|$|Artist V. Jeevananthan {{compared}} Aval Appadithan {{to other}} films whose central theme was women, such as Charulata (1964), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Panchagni (1986), while also labelling them as [...] "classics {{that put the}} spotlight on women." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam, which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a [...] "fluid narrative style" [...] and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and [...] "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks [...] "what {{do you think of}} 'women's liberation'", [...] Arun's wife answers, [...] "I don't know", [...] to which Manju says [...] "that is why you are happy", send the message that one will inevitably <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> if one exhibits assertive behaviour.|$|E
