40|$|Abstract—Channel {{variation}} {{causes a}} loss of orthogonality among the subcarriers of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbol and leads to inter-carrier inter-ference (ICI) and degradation in performance. In this work, we propose a {{minimum mean square error}} ICI canceller with an adaptive sliding window (MMSE-ASW). In a frequency selective channel, the proposed MMSE-ASW adopts a different window size depending on the degree of ICI to which each subcarrier is subjected relative {{to the power of the}} signal part. A metric is computed for each subcarrier to determine the degree of interference which depends on the estimated ICI coefficients. A closed form is derived to get the optimum value of the window size used in the MMSE-ASW approach. We analyze the performance and the complexity trade-off of the algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fast</b> <b>fading</b> channel, in a first generation digital video broadcasting system (DVB-T).

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a modulation technique to further increase the robustness against frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fading</b> at high data rates.

Generally, QO-SFBC obtains full diversity gain with more than two transmit antennas by using the constellation rotation in flat fading channel. However, QO-SFBC provides less diversity gain in frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fading</b> channel, because the discrepancy of channel frequency responses (CFRs) at adjacent subcarriers causes additive interferences. Although the conventional method using the simple averaging scheme for all CFRs at adjacent subcarriers can be effective for mitigating interferences, it is not quite robust to variation of CFRs, especially in high Doppler frequency environments. Therefore, to achieve better diversity gain in frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fading</b> channel environment, the selective averaged QO-SFBC decoding method based on mathematical analysis considering each CFR of elements in QO-SFBC encoding block is proposed.
