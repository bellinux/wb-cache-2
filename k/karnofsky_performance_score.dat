40|$|Abstract Background Carcinoma of {{the breast}} is the second leading cause of {{malignant}} pleural effusions. This study reports on the efficacy of mitoxantrone as a sclerosing agent in patients with breast cancer who had a pleural effusion as {{a direct consequence of}} metastatic disease. Patients and methods Over a 5 -year period, 114 patients with a known breast malignancy and having recurrent symptomatic pleural effusion referred for chest tube drainage and sclerotherapy were considered eligible. They had received no prior intrapleural therapy and had a predicted survival of > 1 month. All of them underwent pleural drainage and chemical pleurodesis with mitoxantrone. Survival, complications and response to pleurodesis according to clinical and radiographic criteria were recorded. The data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and the median. The χ 2 test was used for statistical analysis. To assess the prognostic value of <b>Karnofsky's</b> <b>performance</b> status <b>score</b> a Cox proportional hazards model was used. Results The mean age of the patients was 53. 5 ± 2. 1 years. Effusion occurred after 38. 2 ± 6. 2 months (range: 1 – 229 months) after the diagnosis. Ipsilateral effusion was seen in 73 %, contralateral in 20 % and bilateral in 7 %. Forty patients (35 %) had pleural effusion as the first evidence of recurrence. The mean volume of effusion drained was 1020 ± 125 ml and the chest tube was removed within 5 days in 82 % of patients. Side effects of chemical pleurodesis included mainly fever, chest pain, nausea and vomiting. At 30 days 64 patients (56. 3 %) had a complete response (CR) and 30 patients (26. 3 %) partial response (PR) to pleurodesis (overall response: 82. 6 %). At 60 days the overall response was 78. 5 % (CR: 53. 5 %, PR: 25 %). The mean survival was 15. 6 ± 2 months. <b>Karnofsky's</b> <b>performance</b> status <b>score</b> was found to be a statistically significant predictor. Patients with <b>Karnofsky's</b> <b>performance</b> status <b>score</b> > 70 had a median survival of 513 days, as opposed to a median survival of only 63 days for patients with a <b>Karnofsky's</b> <b>performance</b> status <b>score</b> Conclusions Mitoxantrone is effective in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion due to breast carcinoma with relatively low local or systemic toxicity. <b>Karnofsky's</b> <b>performance</b> status <b>score</b> at the time of pleurodesis is predictive of survival. </p...|$|R

We hypothesized that VEGF polymorphisms may affect survival outcomes among locally advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (LA-NSCLC) patients. Methods We genotyped three potentially functional VEGF variants [- 460 T > C (rs 833061), - 634 G > C (rs 2010963), and + 936 C > T (rs 3025039) ] and estimated haplotypes in 124 Caucasian patients with LA-NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy. We used Kaplan-Meier log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the association between VEGF variants and overall survival (OS). Results Gender, <b>Karnofsky's</b> <b>performance</b> <b>scores</b> (KPS) and clinical stage seemed to influence the OS. The variant C genotypes were independently associated with significantly improved OS (CT+CC vs. TT: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 58; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 37 - 0. 92, P = 0. 022), compared with the VEGF - 460 TT genotype.

40|$|Background and purpose: In the prospectively, {{randomized}} Dutch Bone Metastasis Study on {{the effect}} of a single fraction of 8 Gy versus 24 Gy in six fractions on painful bone metastases, 28 % of the patients survived for more than 1 year. Purpose {{of the present study was}} to analyze the palliative effect of radiotherapy in long-term surviving patients, and to identify prognostic factors for survival. Material and methods: Response rates were compared in ail patients surviving > 52 weeks. The Cox proportional hazards model stratified by primary tumour was used for multivariate (MV) analyses of prognostic factors for survival. Results: In 320 patients surviving > 52 weeks, responses were 87 % after 8 Gy and 85 % after 24 Gy (P= 0. 54). Duration of response and progression rates were similar. For all primary tumours, prognostic factors for survival were a good <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Score,</b> no visceral metastases, and non-opioid analgesics intake (all factors, MV P < 0. 001).

40|$|Object: To {{identify}} pre-operative prognostic {{parameters for}} survival {{in patients with}} spinal epidural neoplastic metastasis when the primary tumour is unknown. Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent surgery for spinal epidural neoplastic metastases between February 1997 and January 2011. The inclusion criteria were as follows: known post-operative survival period, a <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Score</b> {{equal to or greater}} than 30 points and a post-operative neoplastic metastasis histological type. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate post-operative survival, and the Log-Rank test was used for statistical inference. Results: A total of 52 patients who underwent 52 surgical procedures were identified. The mean age at the time of spinal surgery was 53. 92 years (std. deviation, 19. 09). The median survival after surgery was 70 days (95 % CI 49. 97 – 90. 02), and post-operative mortality occurred within 6 months in 38 (73. 07 %) patients.

The generic questionnaires were the <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> Status scale and the Chinese (Hong Kong) version of the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Survey, which measures 8 health concepts: 4 physical components and 4 mental components. Within 1 year, 30 consecutive donors were included. These 11 male and 19 female donors (36. 7 % and 63. 3 %, respectively) had a median age of 35 years (range, 21 - 56 years). There was no donor mortality or major complications. Donor quality-of-life worsening was most significant in the first 3 postoperative months, particularly among the physical components. The physical and mental components returned to the previous levels in 6 to 12 months'time, though the <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>scores</b> were slightly lower at 1 year (P = 0. 011).

40|$|PURPOSE: This review {{will address}} {{the current state of}} {{individualized}} cancer therapy for glioblastoma. Glioblastomas are highly malignant primary brain tumors presumably originating from neuroglial progenitor cells. Median survival is less than 1 year. DESIGN: Recent developments in the morphologic, clinical, and molecular classification of glioblastoma were reviewed, and their impact on clinical decision making was analyzed. RESULTS: Glioblastomas can be classified by morphology, clinical characteristics, complex molecular signatures, single biomarkers, or imaging parameters. Some of these characteristics, including age and <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> Scale <b>score,</b> provide important prognostic information. In contrast, few markers help to choose between various treatment options. Promoter methylation of the O-methylguanine methyltransferase gene seems to predict benefit from alkylating agent chemotherapy. Hence, it is used as an entry criterion for alkylator-free experimental combination therapy with radiotherapy. Screening for a specific type of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation is currently being explored as a biomarker for selecting patients for vaccination. Positron emission tomography for the detection of ανβ 3 / 5 integrins could be used to select patients for treatment with anti-integrin antiangiogenic approaches. DISCUSSION: Despite extensive efforts at defining biological markers as a basis for selecting therapies, most treatment decisions for glioblastoma patients are still based on age and performance status. However, several ongoing clinical trials may enrich the repertoire of criteria for clinical decision making in the very near future. The concept of individualized or personalized targeted cancer therapy has gained significant attention throughout oncology. Yet, data in support of such an approach to glioblastoma, the most malignant subtype of glioma, are limited, and personalized medicine plays a minor role in current clinical neuro-oncology practice. In essence, this concept proposes that tumors that are currently lumped together based on common morphologic features can be subclassified {{in a way that the}} resulting subentities are more homogeneous, for example, in molecular signatures and will therefore be amenable to selective therapeutic interventions. At present, the major "biomarkers" used to allocate treatment in glioblastoma are age and <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> Scale <b>score,</b> and these markers have so far survived all efforts at more sophisticated approaches to the management of this disease. Treatment allocation basically means intensity of treatment, especially the use of the standard-of-care or radiotherapy alone beyond age 65 to 70 years or below a <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> Scale <b>score</b> of 60...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Deterioration of {{nutritional}} status during PEG-interferon containing therapy for chronic hepatitis C can be ameliorated by preventive nutritional support. We {{aimed to explore}} whether such support also affects paid labour productivity, physical exercise and performance status. METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled trial (J Hepatol 2012; 57 : 1069 - 75), 53 patients with chronic hepatitis C had been allocated to "on demand" support (n= 26 : nutritional intervention if weight loss> 5 %) or preventive support (n= 27 : regular dietary advice plus energy- and protein-rich evening snack) during PEG-interferon-containing therapy. Paid labour productivity, physical exercise and performance status were evaluated at baseline, after 24 and (if applicable) after 48 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: At baseline, 46 % of patients performed paid labour and 62 % performed some kind of physical exercise. Furthermore, most patients were {{able to carry out}} normal activity with only minor symptoms of disease (mean <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> score: 94). Decreases of paid labour productivity (- 21 % vs. - 70 %, P= 0. 003), physical exercise activity (- 43 % vs. - 87 %, P= 0. 005) and <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>scores</b> (- 12 % vs. - 24 %, P< 0. 001) were less in the preventive than in "on demand" group after 24 weeks of treatment.

Thirty-eight patients with progressive or recurrent GM were treated at UCSF with repeat craniotomy, tumor resection, and permanent, low-activity 125 I brachytherapy between June 1997 and May 1998. Selection criteria were <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>score</b> ⩾ 60, unifocal, contrast-enhancing, well-circumscribed progressive or recurrent GM that was judged to be completely resectable, and no evidence of leptomeningeal or subependymal spread. The median brachytherapy dose 5 mm exterior to the resection cavity was 300 Gy (range, 150 – 500 Gy). One patient was excluded from analysis. Median survival was 52 weeks from the date of brachytherapy. Age, <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>score,</b> and preimplant tumor volume were all statistically significant on univariate analyses. Multivariate analysis for survival showed only age to be significant. Median time to progression was 16 weeks. Both univariate and multivariate analysis of freedom from progression showed only preoperative tumor volume to be significant. Comparison to temporary brachytherapy patients showed no apparent difference in survival time. Chronic steroid requirements were low in patients with minimal postoperative residual tumor.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although many {{patients}} with cervical spine metastases are treated surgically, {{it is unknown}} whether certain subsets achieve better pain relief and improvement of neurologic function. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does tumor removal with reconstruction improve the neurologic status? (2) Is any subset of patients {{more likely to have}} neurological recovery from palliative surgery? (3) What is the rate of surgery-related complications? PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 46 patients who had palliative surgery for metastatic solid tumor metastases of the subaxial cervical spine. Indications were neurologic deficits, life expectancy longer than 6 months, and a <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Score</b> of 50 to 70. Surgery consisted of anterior tumor removal and reconstruction with titanium mesh cages and/or tricortical iliac crest allograft plus plate fixation or of a combined procedure with adjunctive posterior decompression and stabilization with lateral mass screw fixation. Postoperatively, neurologic Frankel score grade, <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Score,</b> and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Five of 18 nonambulatory patients (Frankel B/C) became ambulatory again (Frankel D). No patients were Frankel Grade E preoperatively, whereas 19 of 46 gained Frankel Grade E after surgery. One patient worsened neurologically and died 4 months after surgery. Patients with neoplastic pachymeningitis had less neurologic recovery than those without. Complications included dural tears (three), wound infection (three), and tumor relapse at the same or an adjacent level (four). Two of these four patients had instrumentation-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery improved clinical and neurologic status according to Frankel score; patients with neoplastic pachymeningitis are likely to experience less neurologic recovery.

AIM: We undertook this study to determine the efficacy and toxicity of single-dose Sm- 153 ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonate as a palliative treatment for painful skeletal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eightysix patients with painful skeletal metastases from various primaries, were treated with Sm- 153 EDTMP at a dose of 37 MBq/kg. The effects were evaluated according to change in visual analogue pain score, analgesic consumption, <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>score,</b> mobility score and blood count tests, conducted regularly for 16 weeks. STATISTICS: Repeated measures analysis. RESULTS: The overall response rates were 73 &#x 0025;, while complete response was seen in 12. 4 &#x 0025;.

Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 Items (QLQ-C 30) and the Brain Cancer Module (BCM 20) before initiation of treatment for first recurrence of disease. Six symptoms (fatigue, uncertainty about the future, motor difficulties, drowsiness, communication difficulties, and headache) were reported with a frequency > 50 % by both groups of patients. An additional two symptoms (visual problems and pain) were also reported with frequencies of > 50 % by patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Most of the symptoms were likely due to recurrence, but previous radiation therapy and on-going corticosteroid treatment may have also been casual factors for fatigue, whereas uncertainty about the future and pain were probably nonspecific for brain cancer. Problems with motor functioning, vision, leg strength, and pain were reported more frequently by patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme than by those with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma.

We compared the probability of overall survival (OS), progression- free survival (PFS), disease progression, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) among Black (N= 303) and White (N= 1892) recipients of AHCT for MM, who were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) from 1995 to 2005. The Black cohort was more likely to be female, and had better <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>scores,</b> but lower hemoglobin and albumin levels at diagnosis. Black recipients were younger and more likely to be transplanted later in their disease course. Disease stage and treatment characteristics prior to AHCTwere similar between the 2 groups. Black and White recipients had similar probabilities of 5 -year OS (52 % versus 47 %, P=. 19) and PFS (19 % versus 21 %, P=. 64) as well as cumulative incidences of disease progression (72 % versus 72 %, P=. 97) and NRM (9 % versus 8 %, P=. 52). In multivariate analyses, race was not associated with any of these endpoints. Black recipients of AHCT for MM have similar outcomes compared to Whites, suggesting that the reasons underlying lower rates of AHCT in Blacks need to be studied further to ensure equal access to effective therapy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} outcomes in patients with 3 ̆e/= 10 CNS metastases treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GK-SRS). METHODS: Patients with 3 ̆e/= 10 brain metastases treated using GK-SRS during the period between 2004 and 2010 were identified. Overall survival and local and regional control as well as necrosis rates were determined. The influence of age, sex, histological type, extracranial metastases, whole-brain radiation therapy, and number of brain metastases was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate (log-rank) analyses were performed, with a p value of 3 ̆c 0. 05 considered significant. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with 3 ̆e/= 10 brain metastases were treated between 2004 and 2010. All had a <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> Status <b>score</b> of 3 ̆e/= 70. Seventy-two percent had either non-small cell lung cancer (38...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the fraction of}} patients presenting with seizures and explore possible associations between seizure as presenting symptom and sex, age, tumor location, laterality, histology, <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>score</b> and prognosis. Materials and methods: All patients who underwent primary craniotomy for a meningioma at the Oslo University Hospital, in the time period 1990 – 2010 were included in this study. The patients operated during the years 1990 – 2002 were identified by reviewing operative protocols from this time period, while patients operated after 2002 were identified from our prospectively collected tumor database. All charts were studied retrospectively. The total number of patients identified with a histological verified intracranial meningioma was 1469. Results: The frequency of seizures, raised ICP and focal neurological deficits as presenting symptoms were 29. 6 %, 31. 7 % and 60. 2 %, respectively. Site of dural attachment, laterality of tumor, gender and Karnofsky score {{showed a significant association}} with seizures as presenting symptom, while age, WHO grade and right/left tumor location did not. Convexity- and parasagittal tumors most frequently presented with seizures. Falx-, lateral sphenoid wing- and supratentorial skull base had an intermediate frequency of seizures as presenting symptom, while tumors located in posterior fossa or brain ventricles rarely presented with seizures. Male gender and Karnofsky performance status > 70 were positively associated with seizure as presenting symptom. Overall survival (OS) at 1 -, 12 - and 60 - months were 98 %, 96 % and 88 %, respectively. Seizures as presenting symptom was not significantly associated with survival. Conclusions: 29. 6 % of the meningioma patients presented with seizures. Seizures as presenting symptom showed a significant positive association with convexity-/parasagittal tumor locations, male gender and high <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>performance</b> <b>score.</b> Seizures as a presenting symptom was not associated with survival...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is associated with increased proliferation of glioma cells. However, the impact of EGFRvIII on survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) has not been definitively established. In the present study, we prospectively evaluated 73 patients with primary GBM treated with surgical resection and standard radio/chemotherapy. The EGFRvIII was assessed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (PCR), O 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation was assessed by methylationspecific PCR, and phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In 14 patients of this series, who presented with tumor recurrence, EGFRvIII was determined by real-time PCR. Sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) was assessed in vitro on GBM neurosphere cell cultures with different patterns of EGFRvIII expression.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{incidence}} of nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) –infected patients, and to analyze the main associated risk factors, we performed a 1 -year multicenter prospective study of patients with advanced HIV infection who were consecutively admitted to 17 Italian infectious diseases wards. As of May 1999, a total of 65 NBSIs (4. 7 %) occurred in 1379 admissions, for an incidence of 2. 45 NBSIs per 1000 patient-days. Twenty-nine NBSIs were catheter-related bloodstream infections, with a rate of 9. 6 central venous catheter–associated infections per 1000 device-days. Multivariate analysis indicated that variables independently associated with NBSIs included active injection drug use, a <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>Performance</b> Status <b>score</b> of! 40, presence of a central venous catheter, and length of hospital stay.
