The main subject of the thesis is especially the <b>documentary</b> <b>system</b> of payments. The thesis characterizes the documentary letter of credit and the documentary collection as two of the most considerable payment and custodial banking instruments in an international trade. It deals with advantages and disadvantages of their using, their main principles, relations between participants in documentary transactions and with a description of the whole process of operations with these documentary instruments. Further there are captured individual kinds of documentary letter of credits and documentary collections in the thesis. The thesis also deals with a comparison of the documentary letter of credit and the documentary collection from standpoints of advantages and disadvantages, which these instruments may bring to both parties of the contract of purchase. To complete general questions the thesis also deals with documents, that are used by documentary payments. In conclusion, the thesis outlines the current development in the field of the <b>documentary</b> <b>system</b> of payments...|$|E

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this thesis is the {{exceptions}} in documentary credits in English law. The exceptions were established during {{the development of the}} <b>documentary</b> credits <b>system</b> to solve drawbacks of the payment means caused by its distinctive feature of autonomy. A rationale of the research is the current decline of the market share of documentary credits as a recognized means of settlement in international trade. This thesis aims to explore an appropriate and efficient way to apply certain necessary exceptions in <b>documentary</b> credits <b>system.</b> And hopefully, the current high rate of the rejection of the documents by banks by relying on the strict compliance principle can be decreased by the improving of the application of exceptions in documentary credits. The research centres primary the application of the exceptions in English law. An early study of the original development of the fraud exception will cover both English and American authorities. Because there is no statute law in English law to regulate the exceptions in documentary credits, the thesis will analyse the exceptions mostly through the case law. The main exceptions analysed in the thesis are the fraud rule, the illegality exception and the nullity exception. The application pattern for the three exceptions will be worked out respectively; the specific application of the injunction rules in applying the fraud rule will be concluded during the analysis of the fraud rule; some common features in the application among the exceptions will also be summarized in the thesis. An effort is made to suggest a prospective development of exceptions, which is in consistent with the autonomy principle. And as the necessary exceptions are applied efficiently, the disputes existing in <b>documentary</b> credits <b>system</b> currently may be settled without the appliance of any explanatory rules.

A molecular technique employing 26 S rDNA profiles generated by PCR-DGGE was used to detect the variation in yeast community structures of Shea tree fruits (Vitellaria paradoxa) from Senegal, Ghana and Mali. When the 26 S rDNA profiles were analyzed by image analysis and multivariate analysis, distinct microbial communities were detected on Shea tree fruits. The band profiles of yeasts from different countries were specific for each location and {{could be used as a}} bar code to discriminate the origin of the fruits. This method is a new traceability tool which provides fruit products with an unique biological bar code and makes it possible to trace back the fruits to their original location.

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} {{case study}} was to examine social service workers and managers approach towards the implementation of the Signs-of-Safety (SoS) model and their comprehension of working with the model. This study took place at a children and youth unit at a social service office in Stockholm. The empiric is based on three qualitative semistructured interviews and participant observations. The result was analyzed by definitions from Hasenfeld’s Human service organizations (HSO), Lipsky’s and Johansson’s definitions of "street-level bureaucrats", and room for manoeuvre. Lundquist’s definitions of "understand", "want" and "can" was also used, as well as the core-components that Fixsen, Naoom, Blase, Friedman och Wallace draw together of a successful implementation. The main result of the study indicates that the SoS-model contributes to the participation of children and parents and that it is complicated to implement the SoS-model in such a specialized organization. The study’s result also shows that the implementation is promoted by the support and the resources of every level in the organization {{and the fact that the}} initiative came from the street-level bureaucrats. The <b>documentary</b> <b>system</b> that comes with the BBIC is complicated to combinate with the SoS-model and therefore this might become a restricting effect...|$|E
40|$|This review {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} to determine livestock consumption of genetically modified (GM) feeds/ingredients including detection of genetically modified organism (GMO) -related DNA or proteins in animal samples, and the <b>documentary</b> <b>system</b> that is in place for GM feeds under EU legislation. The presence and level of GMO-related DNA and proteins can generally be readily measured in feeds, using established analytical methods such as polymerase chain reaction and immuno-assays, respectively. Various technical challenges remain, such as the simultaneous detection of multiple GMOs and the identification of unauthorized GMOs for which incomplete data on the inserted DNA may exist. Given that transfer of specific GMO-related DNA or protein from consumed feed to the animal had seldom been observed, this cannot serve {{as an indicator of}} the individual animal's prior exposure to GM feeds. To explore whether common practices, information exchange and the specific GM feed traceability system in the EU would allow to record GM feed consumption, the dairy chain in Catalonia, where GM maize is widely grown, was taken as an example. It was thus found that this system would neither enable determination of an animal's consumption of specific GM crops, nor would it allow for quantitation of the exposure. </p...|$|E

40|$|This article {{undertakes}} four tasks. First, I {{show how}} and why states have sought to monopolize the "legitimate means of movement" [...] that is, to gather {{into their own hands}} the exclusive right to authorize and regulate movement. Next, I argue that the processes involved in this monopolization force us to re-think the very nature of modern states as they have been portrayed by the dominant strands of sociological theories of the state. In particular, I seek to show that the notion that states "penetrate" societies over time fails adequately to capture the nature of state development, and argue instead that we would do better to regard states as "embracing" their citizenries more successfully over time. Then, I analyze the development of modern states as nation-states and demonstrate the corresponding need for states to identify unambiguously who belongs and who does not-in order to "embrace" their members more effectively and to exclude unwanted intruders. Finally, I discuss the nature and legal implications of the various <b>documentary</b> <b>systems</b> that undergird and make possible both states' embrace of individuals and the monopolization of the means of legitimate movement by states and the international state system: (external or international) passports, internal passports ("passes"), and ID cards...|$|R
