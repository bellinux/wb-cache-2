5|$|On 10 May 1947, {{immediately}} after a Great Britain versus Rest of Europe match in Glasgow (Britain won 6–1), {{he made the}} move for £11,500, {{at the age of}} 32. The match itself raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned where <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> money ended up – he doubted that much of it ended up as funding for grass-roots football.|$|E
5|$|Although John was the Count of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E

25|$|In Great Britain, MMA {{failed to}} {{capitalise}} on this momentum {{and has not}} seen anywhere near the popularity levels MMA has received in USA. It is hard to pinpoint the main reason why <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> has happened. The failure of MMA promoters to secure a substantial and locked TV deal until late last year. The reluctance of broadcasting powerhouses BBC and Sky Sports to fully support the sport? The stereotype of extreme violence {{that they have been}} unable to shake off? All of these are valid reasons why MMA failed to capture the public’s imagination.|$|E

The old uptown express and local trackways that used to lead to the 42nd Street Shuttle are visible from the uptown local track. As the alignment of the original trackways curves into the old Grand Central station on the 42nd Street Shuttle, it passes through the rebuilt area for the proposed Grand Central station shuttle platform. From the public passageway, none of the original support columns and roof are visible, since they were removed in <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> area to open the way for the unused shuttle station. The unused ramps leading from the 42nd Street Shuttle are still in place, just south of this station.|$|E
25|$|Milroy, {{despite the}} engagements up to point, {{still had no}} idea that he was facing the entire Second Corps of Lee's Army. Milroy {{concentrated}} all of his forces in the three forts defending the town. Having feared <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> type of a scenario, General-in-chief Henry W. Halleck had asked Schenck to order Milroy to fall back from Winchester to Harpers Ferry. Although Schenck had discussed evacuation with Milroy, he left no clear direction for Milroy to evacuate, since Milroy had convinced Schenck that his defensive position in Winchester was strong. Milroy had previously decided to disregard concerns from Washington because he was confident that the strength of his fortifications would allow his garrison to withstand an assault or a siege.|$|E

25|$|Although Behn assures {{that she}} is not looking to {{entertain}} her reader with the adventures of a feigned hero, she does <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi stresses that spectacle was the main mediator for the representation of alien cultures in Restoration England. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko’s native beauty as a spectacle of 'beauty so transcending' that surpassed 'all those of his gloomy race'. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko’s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due to the color of his skin, his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an English royal, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Englishness is incomplete. He has the English-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko to infuse some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to well-known historical figures like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko’s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that this comparison to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko’s foreignness into familiar European narratives. These historical allusions and romantic gallant feats allowed English readers to relate this exotic character with their own Western history and narrative tradition.|$|E

500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E
500|$|TISM were {{distinguished}} from other 'joke' or 'gimmick bands', by, among other things, their musical style. The band rarely in any seriousness stated actual {{influences on the}} type of music they played, except that The Residents were a band which TISM 'did' notice and 'possibly' took some influence from. A clear link can be drawn from The Residents' The Third Reich 'n' Roll video, in which that band wore Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper: TISM did <b>exactly</b> <b>this</b> at their first gig. Another link may be drawn to early TISM tracks [...] "The Ballad of the Semitic Nazi" [...] or [...] "I'm Gonna Treat Ya to a Neitschze [...] Double Feature" [...] (sic) which use a similar naming convention to The Residents. Other bands which may have influenced TISM are difficult to pinpoint, although a Sydney Morning Herald article on the band described them as [...] "a cross between Skyhooks, Dave Warner, Talking Heads and The Residents".|$|E
