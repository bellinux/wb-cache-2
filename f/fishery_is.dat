5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the night shark globally as Vulnerable, citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure. It {{has also been}} listed as Vulnerable by the American Fisheries Society (AFS). This species was once {{a significant part of}} the Cuban artisanal shark fishery, comprising 6075% of the catch from 1937 to 1941, before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s. Similarly, the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic longline fishery fell from 26.1% from 1981 to 1983 to 0.33.3% in 1993 and 1994; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s. Currently, the intense Brazilian targeted <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> of particular concern, although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> beginning to shift towards swordfish and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). No fishery information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic, leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region.|$|E
5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits. Shark finning is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common thresher <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common thresher <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings. There {{is evidence that the}} California subpopulation is recovering, and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 47% per year.|$|E
5|$|The main {{industries}} on Mersea are farming, {{fishing and}} servicing the leisure boating and yachting industry. Oysters have been harvested {{off the island}} since Roman times, and are shipped worldwide. The extensive history and association with the oyster trade attracts {{a significant number of}} tourists each year, though today the trade is predominantly with Pacific oysters that have been introduced to the area. The Essex oyster <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> opened by the Mayor of Colchester every September.|$|E

5|$|Cancer pagurus {{is heavily}} {{exploited}} commercially throughout its range, {{being the most}} commercially important crab species in Western Europe. The crabs are caught using crab pots (similar to lobster pots) which are placed offshore and baited. The catch of C. pagurus has increased steadily, rising from 26,000tonnes in 1978 to 60,000t in 2007, of which more than 70% was caught around the British Isles. The <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> widely dispersed around the British and Irish coasts, and C. pagurus {{is thought to be}} overfished across much of this area. Most of the edible crabs caught by the British fleet are exported live for sale in France and Spain.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1829, the species {{has long been}} prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both recreational and commercial fishermen in New South Wales and Queensland. The sand whiting <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research {{has been carried out}} on the species, especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and {{has been}} {{displayed}} in public aquariums. It is frequently caught by recreational anglers from shore or ski-boats; it is edible but rarely eaten. Small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal longline fishery targeting the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) in the Gansbaai and False Bay region. The meat from sharks caught in the <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> either made into biltong or jerky and sold locally, or exported fresh or frozen to Italy and Taiwan. Although in South Africa the sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species and thus cannot be harvested commercially, it is often mistaken for the common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) by fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sharptooth houndshark as Near Threatened. This species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure, due to its restricted range, slow growth rate, and low fecundity. The fact that most sharks caught by fishers are immature is an additional source of concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years old, with 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that the <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E

In 2014, the Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) included queen conch in Annex III of its Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol).

40|$|Here is a {{fascinating}} case study in government regulation: the fishing industry. Many of the world's <b>fisheries</b> <b>are</b> in crisis, with stocks greatly depleted.

25|$|Economic or bioeconomic {{overfishing}} additionally {{considers the}} cost of fishing when determining acceptable catches.

25|$|The main {{commercial}} King George whiting <b>fishery</b> <b>is</b> {{centred on}} South Australia from Ceduna {{in the west}} to Gulf St Vincent in the east.

The fish are sold either whole or as fillets and are generally rated as one of the very best quality Australian fish for the table.|$|E
