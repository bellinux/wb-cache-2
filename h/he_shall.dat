5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else <b>he</b> <b>shall</b> receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E
5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. When she came across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and <b>he</b> <b>shall</b> rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E
5|$|Singaporeans are {{encouraged}} to display the national flag outside their homes during National Day celebrations, and residents' committees, particularly those of public housing estates, often arrange co-ordinated displays. However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the People's Action Party, the ruling party in Parliament, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, {{without the need for}} the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as part of any costume or attire except that <b>he</b> <b>shall</b> do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect to the Flag.|$|E

5|$|The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains {{the upper}} hand after {{trapping}} Magil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger. With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that <b>he</b> <b>shall</b> achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess Schala of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power. As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish and guilt {{for her role in}} the incident. Nearby in the Ocean Palace, the Frozen Flame felt her grief and changed her to a baby, sending her to the modern era where Lucca found her. It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala's wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in Chrono Trigger. Once the distortion subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee. Kid tells Serge that she is aware of her true origin, and knowing that is a treasure which cannot be stolen. She bids him goodbye before disappearing into the darkness with Magil.|$|E

25|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{is mentioned}} in the Bible in several contexts. The most familiar refers to a Hebrew slave who was to be freed in the seventh year of servitude but wishes to continue serving his master and refuses to go free: “…his master shall take him before God. <b>He</b> <b>shall</b> {{be brought to the}} door or the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and <b>he</b> <b>shall</b> then remain his slave for life” (Exodus 21:6).|$|E
60|$|Further, {{though the}} {{fly in the}} web is {{altogether}} incapable of looking for relief, yet this awakened, tempted Christian is not. What must he do therefore? How should he contain hopes of life? If he look to his heart, there is blasphemy; if he look to his duties, there is sin; if he strive to mourn and lament, perhaps he cannot; unbelief and hardness hinder. Shall this man lie down and despair? No. <b>Shall</b> <b>he</b> trust to his duties? No. <b>Shall</b> <b>he</b> stay from Christ till his heart is better? No. What then? Let him NOW look to Jesus Christ crucified, then <b>shall</b> <b>he</b> see his sins answered for, then <b>shall</b> <b>he</b> see death a-dying, then <b>shall</b> <b>he</b> see guilt borne by another, and there <b>shall</b> <b>he</b> see the devil overcome.

2500|$|In Azali belief, the Promised One {{could not}} appear until the {{realization}} of the laws of the Bayán and the maturation of the Bayán in 2000 years. However, there are problems with this belief and inconsistencies in Azali belief. [...] The Azalis believe that the Báb gave permission for Subh-i-Azal to complete the Arabic Bayán with the permission of <b>He</b> whom God <b>shall</b> make manifest, thus pointing to <b>He</b> whom God <b>shall</b> make manifest appearing in Subh-i-Azal's own lifetime. Also, the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf, an Azali text, states that the laws of the Bayán may be abrogated a few years after the Báb's death, and that <b>He</b> whom God <b>shall</b> make manifest may appear within Subh-i-Azal's lifetime. The Azali view that the appearance of <b>He</b> whom God <b>shall</b> make manifest can only occur thousands of years in the future is also problematic, since in some of their texts they state that Subh-i-Azal is <b>He</b> whom God <b>shall</b> make manifest.|$|R
