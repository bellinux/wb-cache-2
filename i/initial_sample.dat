5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. <b>Initial</b> <b>sample</b> fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{collecting}} data from samples using the flow cytometer is termed 'acquisition'. Acquisition is mediated {{by a computer}} physically connected to the flow cytometer, and the software which handles the digital interface with the cytometer. The software is capable of adjusting parameters (e.g., voltage, compensation) for the sample being tested, and also assists in displaying <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> information while acquiring sample data to ensure that parameters are set correctly. Early flow cytometers were, in general, experimental devices, but technological advances have enabled widespread applications {{for use in a}} variety of both clinical and research purposes. Due to these developments, a considerable market for instrumentation, analysis software, as well as the reagents used in acquisition such as fluorescently labeled antibodies has developed.|$|E
25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget’s theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E
40|$|Clustering {{ensemble}} combines some clustering outputs {{to obtain}} better results. High robustness, accuracy and stability {{are the most}} important characteristics of clustering ensembles. Previous clustering ensembles usually use k-means to generate ensemble members. The main problem of k-means is <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> which have high effect on final results. Refining <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> of kmeans increases the complexity of algorithm significantly. In this paper we try to predict <b>initial</b> <b>samples,</b> especially for clustering ensemble, without any increasing in time complexity. In this paper we introduce two approaches to select the <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> of k-means intelligently to generate ensemble members. The proposed methods increase both accuracy and the speed of convergence without any increasing in time complexity. Selecting one sample from each cluster of previous result and selecting k samples which have minimum similarity to each other from coassociation matrix are the two proposed method in refining <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> of k-means. Clarity, simplicity, fast convergence and higher accuracy {{are the most important}} parameters of proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effect of proposed algorithm in convergence and accuracy of common datasets...|$|R

25|$|During {{preparation}} for sequencing, cDNA copies of transcripts may be amplified by PCR to enrich for fragments that contain the expected 5’ and 3’ adapter sequences. Amplification {{is also used}} to allow sequencing of very low input amounts of RNA, down to as little as 50 pg, in extreme applications. Spike-in controls can be used to provide quality control assessment of library preparation and sequencing, in terms of GC-content, fragment length, as well as the bias due to fragment position within a transcript. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are short random sequences that are used to individually tag sequence fragments during library preparation, so that every tagged fragment is unique. UMIs provide an absolute scale for quantification and the opportunity to correct for subsequent amplification bias introduced during library construction, and accurately estimate the <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> size. UMIs are particularly well suited to single-cell RNA-Seq transcriptomics, where the amount of input RNA is restricted and extended amplification of the sample is required.|$|E

40|$|As a {{recursive}} algorithm, {{the particle}} filter requires <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> to track a state vector. These <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> must be {{generated from the}} received data and usually obey a complicated distribution. The Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm is used for sampling from intractable multivariate target distributions and is well suited for the initialization problem. Asymptotically, the M-H scheme creates samples drawn from the exact distribution. For the particle filter to track the state, the <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> need to cover only the region around its current state. This region is marked {{by the presence of}} modes. Since the particle filter only needs samples around the mode, we modify the M-H algorithm to generate samples distributed around the modes of the target posterior. By simulations, we show that this "mode hungry" algorithm converges an order of magnitude faster than the original M-H scheme for both unimodal and multi-modal distributions...|$|R

30|$|Once the {{sampling}} box {{and a certain}} number of <b>initial</b> <b>samples</b> are acquired, the proposed differential evolution algorithm will be executed, which uses the sample weight as objective function. Since the observation results from the normal nodes only involve anchor nodes, the sample weight is equal to 0 or 1. Next, the derived sample weight is equal to 1 and it can be remained in the next generation. Otherwise, the parents’ sample can only reserve in the next generation. After several generations being produced, plenty of samples can be satisfied with the filtering conditions, most of which is close to the actual position of the node. As can be seen from Fig.  1, compared with the <b>initial</b> <b>samples,</b> the samples of subsequent generation with differential evolution are closer to the actual location of the node.|$|R
