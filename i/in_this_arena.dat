25|$|Baldwin and Melisende {{agreed to}} put the {{decision}} to the Haute Cour. The Haute Cour decided that Baldwin would rule {{the north of the}} kingdom and Melisende the richer Judea and Samaria, and Jerusalem itself. Melisende acquiesced, though with misgivings. This decision would prevent a civil war but also divide the kingdom's resources. Though later historians criticized Melisende for not abdicating in favor of her son, there was little impetus for her to do so. She was universally recognized as an exceptional steward for her kingdom, and her rule had been characterized as a wise one by church leaders and other contemporaries. Baldwin had not shown any interest in governance prior to 1152, and had resisted responsibility <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>arena.</b> The Church clearly supported Melisende, as did the barons of Judea and Samaria.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} routinization of {{prenatal}} diagnosis, {{little research has}} examined men’s roles <b>in</b> <b>this</b> reproductive <b>arena</b> or these technologies’possibilities for reinforcing or transforming gender roles and relations. The authors analyze male partners’participation in the amniocentesis decisions of Mexican-origin women {{at high risk for}} problems, drawing on interviews with 157 women and 120 of their male partners. The primary aim is to explore whether the normalization of prenatal testing poses a threat to women’s autonomy <b>in</b> <b>this</b> decision <b>arena.</b> The findings challenge critics of new reproductive and genetic technologies who assume that these technologies inherently represent male attempts to control women’s bodies and the processes of reproduction. In contrast, the authors find many couples try to bal-ance their desire to share equally in parenting responsibilities while maintaining the woman’s ultimate control over her body and decisions associated with it...|$|R

500|$|In {{the final}} days of 2002, when an {{invasion}} of Iraq was still a hypothetical question, Daniels told the New York Times that the cost of war with Iraq “could be” in the range of $50 to $60 billion. [...] It was not clear whether Daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war, but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both. [...] He also described the “back-of-the-envelope” estimate by Bush Economic Advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey that it would cost $100 to $200 billion as much too high. Two days later, after the New Years Holiday, an OMB spokesperson clarified Daniels’ remarks, adding that the $50 to $60 billion figure was not a hard White House estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost.

[...] USA Today {{negatively}} stated [...] "The only one that seems out of place is the club anthem 'Put It in a Love Song', a collaboration with Beyoncé that's catchy but ultimately underwhelming, considering the talents involved." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe stated [...] "in high vamping mode, has already made its way to radio, but it’s a slip of a song, coasting on its contagious chorus and delivering little more." [...] While reviewing The Element of Freedom, Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole gave a negative review for the song saying, [...] "The upbeat numbers, which ought to stand out given their infrequency, incline toward the forgettable, though the cutesy club-ready duet with Beyoncé, 'Put It in a Love Song,' is especially embarrassing—not only because the song is bad, but also because Beyoncé delivers what is, by a rather large margin, the best vocal performance of the album's second half." [...] That was somehow echoed by Tyler Lewis of PopMatters who said, [...] "In fact, when she shares a song with Beyoncé—the contemporary queen of pointless bombast—Keys' weakness <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>arena</b> is startingly apparent. Beyoncé completely steals the song away and Beyoncé fans will love it, even though it’s a terrible song." ...|$|E
