In a <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal coordinate system.

50|$|Note {{that these}} {{limitations}} are {{not due to}} geohashing, and not due to latitude-longitude coordinates, but due {{to the difficulty of}} mapping coordinates on a sphere (non linear and with wrapping of values, similar to modulo arithmetic) to two dimensional coordinates and the difficulty of exploring a two dimensional space uniformly. The first is related to <b>Geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system and Map projection, and the other to Hilbert curve and z-order curve. Once a coordinate system is found that represents points linearly in distance and wraps up at the edges, and can be explored uniformly, applying geohashing to those coordinates will not suffer from the limitations above.|$|E

Lack of quality in rainfall data will influence {{the process of}} analyses and subsequently, produce misleading results. Thus, this study is aimed to propose modified missing rainfall data treatment methods that produced more accurate estimation results. In this study, the old normal ratio method and the modified normal ratio based on trimmed mean are combined with <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> method. The performances of these modified methods were tested on various levels of the missing data of 36 years complete daily rainfall records from eighteen meteorology stations in Peninsular Malaysia. The results indicated that both modified methods improved the estimation of missing rainfall values at the target station based on the least error measurements. Modified normal ratio based on trimmed mean with <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> method {{is found to be}} the most appropriate method for station Batu Kurau and Sg.

The first vertex on the line string is chosen as the origin of the local coordinate system, and the local coordinates of the remaining vertices are determined by calculating the relative 3 D vector between the rest of the vertices and the first one, using the Vincenty algorithm (Behzadan and Kamat 2007).|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{the time}} of Prayer was being {{announced}} through mosques. Nowadays, theres a special time in cities of Muslim countries, known as Prayer Times Table. Mean while villages lack such division or table, they use the Prayer times of nearby cities. In non-Muslim countries, such tables just belong to big cities and other areas have difficulties to find (precise) Prayer times. Quantitative computation of Prayer times is dependent on <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> of that place and space/time position of Sun. Residential areas are determined as polygon {{and each of them}} are located in a specific <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate.</b> Therefore its not possible to use the Prayer time of one point for another point far from that. In this research, the area is divided into pixels of 1000 * 1000 m and Prayer time is calculated with astronomical relations. The accuracy of this study has been compared to those were presented by Calendar Center of Geophysics Institute (University of Tehran) and have had perfect accuracy. Prayer time is calculated for each pixel of the studying area by GIS. Further analysis on results of this research obviously showed the necessity of GIS in determining Prayer times and led to more accuracy of calculations...|$|E
