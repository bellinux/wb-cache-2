5000|$|For dual-gauge {{track to}} be {{achievable}} using three rails, {{the difference between}} the gauges needs to be at least as wide as the foot of the rail, otherwise {{there is no room for}} the rail <b>fastening</b> <b>hardware</b> (spikes, clips, and the like). The following pairs of gauges can be dual-gauged without problem: standard gauge (...) and , [...] and , and [...] and [...] Standard gauge (...) and [...] can also be dual-gauged, albeit with lighter, narrow-footed rails, as done in Victoria, Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Fabryka Elementów Złącznych FEZ S.A ( [...] Fastening Elements Factory FEZ [...] ) {{is a large}} {{company which}} {{produces}} <b>fastening</b> <b>hardware</b> in Poland. It {{is one of the}} oldest and biggest factories in Siemianowice Śląskie and one of the oldest producer in Poland that still and incessantly producing. It was founded in 1868 as Nieten Fabrik by metallurgist Hugo Wilhelm Fitzner. Initially it comprised a craft-manufactory workshop specialising in the production of screw, rivets and nuts. From 1999 the company has been functioning as a joint stock company.|$|E
5000|$|Radius at base of hole in boss: Bosses find use in many part designs as {{points for}} {{attachment}} and assembly. The most common variety consists of cylindrical projections with holes designed to receive screws, threaded inserts, or {{other types of}} <b>fastening</b> <b>hardware.</b> Providing a radius on the core pin helps in avoiding a sharp corner. This not only helps molding but also reduces stress concentration. It is recommended that the radius at base of hole in boss should be 0.25 to 0.5 times the nominal wall thickness.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Todds and his friend, Cholo Burns, {{began selling}} rubber foot pads {{that could be}} {{attached}} to any snowboard. Their kits also included a bungee cord that attached to a point {{in front of the}} front foot, as well as a point behind the back foot. The cords acted like training wheels for riders who needed help keeping the board on their feet. They called their innovation Noboard. A Noboard is a kit to convert a snowboard into a board without bindings. The conversion kit consists of a rubber pad (where the rider stands), a rope, retractable leash, and <b>fastening</b> <b>hardware.</b> Other companies are manufacturing boards designed to be ridden bindingless, as opposed to Noboard's conversion kit.|$|E
50|$|The basic dome has a {{rectangular}} floor and two poles which cross at the peak; each pole {{runs in a}} smooth curve from one bottom corner, up to the peak, and then down to the diagonally opposite bottom corner. There are usually special fittings at each corner which fit into sockets {{at the ends of}} each pole - pole tension keeps everything in shape. The poles can run on either the inside or outside of the tent fabric. When located on the interior, poles are held in place by a variety of means including hook and loop style straps, clips, and other <b>fastening</b> <b>hardware.</b> Poles that are located {{on the outside of the}} tent fabric are attached via fabric pole sleeves or plastic clips. Dome tents do not require guy ropes and pegs for structural integrity as they are considered free-standing, but must be pegged down in high winds.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{plan for}} {{the scope of the}} {{restoration}} to the nave, side altars, balcony, Sanctuary, transepts, and aisle side walls was to scrape all loose and peeling paint; repair damage on the walls and ceilings; clean and treat all surfaces to be painted; clean and remove dirt from all the artwork and stencils, including faux marble and painted murals; repair and touch up the faux marble at points of failure; clean the stained glass windows; repair the wood trimming around the windows and doors; touch up damaged areas within the artworks; re-gild the capitals using gold paint; clean all architectural woodwork, not including pews; paint the ceilings, walls, and trim in original color scheme. Full restoration to the two transept murals on the Sanctuary ceiling and the Risen Christ behind the Tabernacle. New stenciling at the side Altars. New carpeting at the main church, sanctuary, and altar steps. Installation of new plywood and vinal flooring under the pews. Remove and dispose of existing kneelers and replace with new ones. Restore off-site all the nave pews from scratches, dents, marks and discoloration; wax and residue removal; lacquer and re-install with new <b>fastening</b> <b>hardware.</b>|$|E
40|$|Etalon mounts for tunable Fabry- Perot interferometers {{can now be}} {{fabricated}} from reaction-bonded {{silicon carbide}} structural components. These mounts are rigid, lightweight, and thermally stable. The fabrication of these mounts involves the exploitation of post-casting capabilities that (1) enable creation of monolithic structures having reduced (in comparison with prior such structures) degrees of material inhomogeneity and (2) {{reduce the need for}} <b>fastening</b> <b>hardware</b> and accommodations. Such silicon carbide mounts could be used to make lightweight Fabry-Perot interferometers or could be modified for use as general lightweight optical mounts. Heretofore, tunable Fabry-Perot interferometer structures, including mounting hardware, have been made from the low-thermal-expansion material Invar (a nickel/iron alloy) in order to obtain the thermal stability required for spectroscopic applications for which such interferometers are typically designed. However, the high mass density of Invar structures is disadvantageous in applications in which there are requirements to minimize mass. Silicon carbide etalon mounts have been incorporated into a tunable Fabry-Perot interferometer of a prior design that originally called for Invar structural components. The strength, thermal stability, and survivability of the interferometer as thus modified {{are similar to those of}} the interferometer as originally designed, but the mass of the modified interferometer is significantly less than the mass of the original version...|$|E
