Prospective interventional animal study. Surgical laboratory and hyperbaric chamber. Twenty-two Landrace pigs. Under general anesthesia, probes to measure intracranial pressure, brain oxygen tension (PbtO 2), and brain microdialysis, and electrodes for electroencephalography were placed. The electroencephalogram (quantified using temporal brain symmetry index) was suppressed during 1 hour by repeated injection of air boluses through a catheter placed in the right ascending pharyngeal artery. <b>Hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was administered using U.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The {{objective was}} to investigate the transport of an anticancer agent carboplatin across the blood-brain barrier in combination with <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> treatment. An in vitro well-validated model of bovine brain capillary endothelial cells was used. 2. A transendothelial transport of doxorubicin, a known P-glycoprotein substrate, was enhanced 1. 5 -fold by verapamil for 2 -h incubation at 37 °C. A transendothelial permeability coefficient of carboplatin (1. 29 x 10 - 3 cm min - 1) was also increased 1. 8 -fold by verapamil. 3. Under the <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> conditions (at 0. 2 MPa for the first 10 min), the transendothelial transport for 2 h of doxorubicin and carboplatin were increased 1. 3 - to 1. 8 -fold by <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> like the suppressive effects of verapamil on P-gp function, without increase of the transport of lucifer yellow, a non P-glycoprotein substrate. 4. Combination of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> treatment and verapamil could not further increase the permeability coefficients of these drugs that were already enhanced by either treatment, implying the P-glycoprotein-mediated carboplatin efflux transport similarly as doxorubicin. 5. Together with our reported high efficacy of carboplatin combined with <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> therapy on brain tumours, the present results suggest that carboplatin could be transported by P-glycoprotein, but that this efflux mechanism would be reduced by the <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> with the consequences of clinical efficacy...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Testosterone has a {{modulating}} {{effect on}} inflammatory and healing processes. In this study, we evaluate whether <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> therapy (HOT) modifies the blood concentration of total testosterone (TT) in patients treated for different pathologies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen male patients (23 - 72 years old) {{were treated with}} 90 -min HOT sessions (range 4 to 23 sessions) as an adjuvant to the following conditions: leg fractures, osteonecrosis, diabetic foot, firearm injuries, complicated arthroprosthesis and underwater diving embolism. As controls, six healthy male volunteers (37 - 51 years old) were subjected to 10 HOT sessions. Testosterone plasma levels were determined immediately before the first HOT session {{and the day after}} the last session. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, 12 patients fully recovered and 2 (diabetic foot patients) showed a marked improvement. Testosterone significantly increased after <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> therapy in both patients and controls (ANOVA, p< 0. 004). DISCUSSION: We conclude that <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> therapy increases the blood concentration of total testosterone in patients as well as in healthy men. This finding raises new questions and indicates the need to investigate the causes of this increase and its therapeutic significance. Since testosterone modulates inflammation and healing processes, it is possible that hormonal changes are the mechanisms affected by <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|During {{therapeutic}} <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> lymphocytes {{are exposed}} to high partial pressures of oxygen. This study aimed to analyze the mechanism of apoptosis induction by hyperbaric oxygen. For intervals of 0. 5 - 4 h Jurkat-T-cells were exposed to ambient air or oxygen atmospheres at 1 - 3 absolute atmospheres. Apoptosis was analyzed by phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase- 3 activation and DNA-fragmentation using flow cytometry. Apoptosis was already induced after 30 min of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> (HBO, P < 0. 05). The death receptor Fas was downregulated. Inhibition of caspase- 9 but not caspase- 8 blocked apoptosis induction by HBO. Hyperbaric oxygen caused a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase- 9 induction. The mitochondrial pro-survival protein Bcl- 2 was upregulated, and antagonizing Bcl- 2 function potentiated apoptosis induction by HBO. In conclusion, a single exposure to <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> induces lymphocyte apoptosis by a mitochondrial and not a Fas-related mechanism. Regulation of Fas and Bcl- 2 may be regarded as protective measures of the cell in response to hyperbaric oxygen...|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of combination use of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> succinate-containing solutions, and anti-edematous agents in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning. Subjects and methods. The results of treatment were analyzed in 32 patients admitted in 2009 — 2011 for severe acute carbon monoxide poisoning and a Glasgow coma score of 6 — 8. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) patients whose combination therapy involved <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> Succinasol infusions, and L-lysine-aescinate injections; 2) those who received traditional therapy. All the patients underwent complex clinical, laboratory, and neurophysiologic examinations. Results. Just 24 hours after the combination use of Succinasol and L-lysine-aescinate, Group I patients were observed to have substantially reduced lactate, {{the content of the}} latter approached the normal value following 48 hours, which was much below the values in the control group. The similar pattern was observed when endogenous intoxication parameters were examined. During the performed therapy, the level of consciousness and that of intellect according to the MMSE and FAB scales were restored more rapidly in the study group patients than in Group 2. Conclusion. The combination use of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> the succinate-containing solution Succinasol, and the anti-edematous agent L-lysine-aescinate considerably enhances the efficiency of intensive therapy for acute carbon monoxide poisoning.

30|$|At present, <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> is {{considered}} to be the cornerstone of CAE treatment (Muth and Shank 2000; Mirski et al. 2007). However, prospective trails demonstrating its efficacy are lacking. In our case <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was not available. Since induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest provides substantial neuroprotective effects (Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest Study Group 2002), and CAE may induce pathophysiological changes similar to hypoxic brain injury, we decided to apply moderate hypothermia for neuroprotection. We are aware of the limited significance of this case report since we are not able to estimate the effect of hypothermia on the course of our patient. Otherwise, the initial neurologic status heralded a poor outcome of our patient and he retained a moderately severe disability after 3  months. Similarly, Inoue et al. reported a favorable outcome of a patient with CAE after pleural lavage treated with therapeutic hypothermia (Inoue et al. 2013). Therefore, we conclude that hypothermia is feasible in CAE and may have a neuroprotective effect in this disorder. In contrast to <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> permanent availability makes hypothermia highly beneficial. Thus, as potential neuroprotective approach in CAE therapeutic hypothermia should be further investigated.|$|E
40|$|Background: Aluminium {{phosphide}} (AlP) {{is used as}} a fumigant. It produces phosphine gas {{which is}} a mitochondrial poison. Although this poisoning has been repeatedly reported in literature with a high mortality rate, there is no known antidote for AlP intoxication. In the present study, we studied the effects of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> (HBO) on the survival time of AlP intoxicated rats. Methods: Intoxicated rats with AlP (11. 5 mg/kg, oral gavage) were placed in <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygenation</b> with different concentrations of compressed air and oxygen. Results: All the animals exposed to AlP died within 5 days. The mean survival times of rats exposed to AlP without any intervention, treated with hyperbaric condition by compressed air, and treated with hyperbaric condition by pure O 2 were 91 ± 1, 262 ± 8, and 276 ± 6 minutes, respectively.
