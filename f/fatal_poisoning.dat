5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is {{the most common type of}} <b>fatal</b> <b>poisoning</b> in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{compounds}} such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic acid (ALA, not to {{be confused}} with the unrelated alpha-linolenic acid) are both capable of helping to regenerate glutathione levels. NAC in particular is commonly used to treat overdose of acetaminophen, a type of potentially <b>fatal</b> <b>poisoning</b> which is harmful in part due to severe depletion of glutathione levels.|$|E

50|$|In some Greek myths, blood {{taken from}} {{the right side of}} a Gorgon could bring the dead back to life, yet blood {{taken from the}} left side was an {{instantly}} <b>fatal</b> <b>poison.</b> Athena gave a vial of the healing blood to Asclepius, which ultimately brought about his demise.|$|R
60|$|And {{how they}} DID run! The warriors fairly tumbled {{over one another}} {{in their efforts to}} escape the <b>fatal</b> <b>poison</b> of that awful egg, and those who could not rush down the winding stair fell off the balcony into the great cavern beneath, {{knocking}} over those who stood below them.|$|R
500|$|Later {{that month}} the group re-emerged, with several members playing [...] "Kropotkin Vodka" [...] {{on the roof}} of an {{automobile}} display unit in a luxury-store district and in the windows of fashion boutiques, while another member discharged a fire extinguisher into the air. The song took its title from Russian anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin, and metaphorically concerned the assassination of [...] "Kremlin bastards" [...] by <b>fatal</b> <b>poisoning.</b>|$|E
500|$|Sarcosphaera coronaria has no {{distinctive}} taste or odor, {{although one}} source {{says that as}} it gets older the odor becomes [...] "reminiscent of rhubarb". Although older literature describes it as a good edible species, modern literature does not recommended it for consumption. It gives some individuals gastrointestinal discomfort, reputedly similar to poisoning symptoms caused by morels. A number of poisonings attributed to this species have been reported from Europe, including one <b>fatal</b> <b>poisoning</b> in the Jura area in 1920, following which a warning was issued not to eat it raw or in salads. Although the fruit bodies are edible after cooking, they are rarely collected by mushroom pickers, and have no commercial value.|$|E
500|$|A fatal dose {{has been}} {{calculated}} as 15 caps. Deaths from this fungus A.muscaria {{have been reported}} in historical journal articles and newspaper reports, but with modern medical treatment, <b>fatal</b> <b>poisoning</b> from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare. Many older books list Amanita muscaria as [...] "deadly", but this is an error that implies the mushroom is more toxic than it is. The North American Mycological Association has stated that there were: [...] "no reliably documented cases of death from toxins in these mushrooms in the past 100 years". The vast majority (90% or more) of mushroom poisoning deaths are from eating the greenish to yellowish [...] "death cap", (A.phalloides) or perhaps even one of the three white Amanita species which are known as destroying angels, A. virosa, A. bisporigera and A. ocreata.|$|E
40|$|Cyanide is a toxin {{and one of}} {{the most}} rapidly acting <b>fatal</b> <b>poisons</b> that human being is aware. If it is not treated promptly, encountering to cyanide poison will lead to die in minutes. Cyanide avoids {{cellular}} oxygen usage by inactivating mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase thus inhibits cellular respiration. In this case, we represent a case report describing uncommon cyanide intoxication owing to consumption of a few portion of apricot kernels and its rapid treatment with dicobalt edetate after suspection of cyanide poisoning...|$|R
5000|$|In Dune, it is {{established}} that De Vries had pioneered {{a type of}} toxin called [...] "residual poison" [...] which remains in the body for years and requires an antidote to be administered regularly. One such <b>fatal</b> <b>poison</b> is secretly administered by the Harkonnens to Thufir Hawat, the Mentat of House Atreides, {{in order to keep}} Hawat's allegiance as the only provider of the antidote (in the 1984 movie version, it is shown that Hawat has to milk a gruesome captive cat for the antidote every day).|$|R
40|$|Aluminium {{phosphide}} poisoning is {{very common}} in India. It {{is one of the}} most <b>fatal</b> <b>poisons.</b> The clinical spectrum of poisoning varies depending upon the dosage and duration of consumption. The main effect of the poison is due to the release of phosphine which inhibits cytochrome oxidase and thereby hampers cellular oxygen utilization. Almost any organ can be affected by aluminium phosphide poisoning. We report a case where the heart was the predominantly affected organ. We describe the clinical symptoms and signs and their correlation with electrocardiographic and histopathological examinations...|$|R
2500|$|Dr. Thomas Neill Cream (27 May 1850 – 15 November 1892) was {{a doctor}} {{secretly}} specialising in abortions. He was born in Glasgow, educated in London and Canada, and entered practice in Canada and later in Chicago, Illinois. In 1881 he {{was found guilty of}} the <b>fatal</b> <b>poisoning</b> of his mistress's husband. He was imprisoned in the Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet, Illinois, from November 1881 until his release on good behaviour on 31 July 1891. He moved to London, where he resumed killing and was soon arrested. He was hanged on 15 November 1892 at Newgate Prison. According to some sources, his last words were reported as being [...] "I am Jack the...", interpreted to mean Jack the Ripper. However, police officials who attended the execution made no mention of this alleged interrupted confession. As he was still imprisoned {{at the time of the}} Ripper murders, most authorities consider it impossible for him to be the culprit. However, Donald Bell suggested that he could have bribed officials and left the prison before his official release, and Sir Edward Marshall-Hall suspected that his prison term may have been served by a look-alike in his place. Such notions are unlikely, and contradict evidence given by the Illinois authorities, newspapers of the time, Cream's solicitors, Cream's family and Cream himself.|$|E

Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.|$|R
5000|$|He {{typically}} armed {{himself with}} a trick cigarette that could fire <b>fatal</b> <b>poison</b> gas — his trademark [...] "Dust of Death" [...] — toward his victim. The [...] "Dust of Death" [...] is a red powder which kills a victim within seconds of skin contact. The powder causes {{the skin of the}} victim's head to shrivel, tighten, and take on a red discoloration, while causing all of his hair to fall out. Hence the victim's head resembles a [...] "red skull". He also carries a large arsenal of conventional and advanced fire arms and explosives.|$|R

As Princess Turkestanova was unmarried, the news made a scandal at the court. In despair, Varava {{ingested}} a <b>fatal</b> <b>poison</b> and died in St. Petersburg, tended by the empress Maria Feodorovna. The death was officially pronounced as related to cholera. She was buried at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. Her daughter, Maria (also known as Mimi; 1819-1843), was reared by Prince Golitsyn and eventually married Ivan Nelidov, brother of Varvara Nelidova, mistress of Nicholas I of Russia.|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The {{objective of this}} investigation was to evaluate postmortem changes of electric charge of human erythrocytes and thrombocytes after fatal carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The surface charge density values were determined {{on the basis of the}} electrophoretic mobility measurements of the cells carried out at various pH values of electrolyte solution. The surface charge of erythrocyte membranes after <b>fatal</b> CO <b>poisoning</b> as well as after sudden unexpected death increased compared to the control group in the whole range of experimental pH values. Also, a slight shift of the isoelectric point of erythrocyte mem-branes to high pH values was observed. The surface charge of thrombocyte membranes after <b>fatal</b> CO <b>poisoning</b> decreased at low pH compared to the control group. However, at high pH, the values increased compared to the control group. The isoelectric point of thrombocyte mem-branes after <b>fatal</b> CO <b>poisoning</b> was considerably shifted toward low pH values compared to the control group. The observed changes are probably connected with the destruction of blood cell structure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Aluminum {{phosphide}} {{is commonly}} used as a rodenticide and insecticide {{and is one of}} the most <b>fatal</b> <b>poisons.</b> The active ingredient is Phosphine gas which inhibits cytochrome oxidase and cellular oxygen utilization. The clinical symptoms are due to multiorgan involvement including cardiac toxicity which is the most common cause of mortality. Severity of clinical manifestations depends upon the amount of the gas to which a person is exposed. There is no specific antidote available. High index of suspicion and early aggressive treatment is the key to success. We report 2 cases of aluminum phosphide toxicity in 2 families due to incidental exposure after fumigation...|$|R

Therefore, the {{preservation}} of limulus is to protect species diversity. So far, Limulus in Chaoshan area has been under the protection since it was listed as the second category in endangered species.In old days, Chaoshan people caught limulus and cooked them to make sauce, which is like caviar in western countries. Limulus sauce also has special medical function for digestion. However, limulus is also poisonous. After knowing its <b>fatal</b> <b>poison</b> and its decreasing number, people begin to stop killing limulus.|$|R
