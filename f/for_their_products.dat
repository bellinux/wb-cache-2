The demand merely shifts from one provider to another. Clearly, this is not a long-term solution.|$|E

5|$|The meat, blubber and fur {{coats of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{have traditionally been}} used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks.

The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.|$|E
5|$|According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in {{the early}} 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 {{while he was in}} the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This was a {{difficult}} period for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting technical barriers as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced with these issues, Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>products,</b> including Luminous Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>products</b> and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
5|$|Once relentlessly hunted <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>products,</b> {{whales are}} now {{protected}} by international law. Some species are attributed {{with high levels}} of intelligence. At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights, listing cetaceans as non-human persons. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and are considered functionally extinct by cetologists. The baiji is also considered functionally extinct by the IUCN with, the last sighting in 2004. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Small cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor. Whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world.|$|E

5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>products,</b> at least initially, however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living. This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries, where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.|$|E
