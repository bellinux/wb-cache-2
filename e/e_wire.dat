We propose that evolution was likely to have optimized neural circuits to minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of "wire" used to construct circuits, and to have maximized the density of synapses. Here we ask the question: "What fraction of the volume should be taken up by axons and dendrites (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>wire)</b> when these variables are at their optimal values?" The biophysical properties of axons and dendrites dictate that wire should occupy 3 / 5 of the volume in an optimally wired gray matter.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{reliable}} obstacle warning and avoidance capabilities to ensure safe low-level flight operations {{has led to}} the development of various practical systems suitable for fixed and rotary wing aircraft. State-of-the-art Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology employing eye-safe laser sources, advanced electro-optics and mechanical beam-steering components delivers the highest angular resolution and accuracy performances in a wide range of operational conditions. LIDAR Obstacle Warning and Avoidance System (LOWAS) is thus becoming a mature technology with several potential applications to manned and unmanned aircraft. This paper addresses specifically its employment in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Sense-and-Avoid (SAA). Small-to-medium size Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are particularly targeted since they are very frequently operated in proximity of the ground and the possibility of a collision is further aggravated by the very limited see-and-avoid capabilities of the remote pilot. After a brief description of the system architecture, mathematical models and algorithms for avoidance trajectory generation are provided. Key aspects of the Human Machine Interface and Interaction (HMI 2) design for the UAS obstacle avoidance system are also addressed. Additionally, a comprehensive simulation case study of the avoidance trajectory generation algorithms is presented. It is concluded that LOWAS obstacle detection and trajectory optimisation algorithms can ensure a safe avoidance of all classes of obstacles (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>wire,</b> extended and point objects) in a wide range of weather and geometric conditions, providing a pathway for possible integration of this technology into future UAS SAA architectures...|$|E
40|$|Metal {{hardware}} {{is gaining}} increasing interest in polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) {{development as a}} possible alternative to machined graphite hardware because of its potential for low-cost manufacturing combined with its intrinsic high conductivity, minimal permeability and advantageous mechanical properties. A major barrier to more widespread use of metal hardware has been the susceptibility of various metals to corrosion. Few pure metals can withstand the relatively aggressive environment of a fuel cell and thus the choices for hardware are quite limited. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are prohibitively expensive and so tend to be utilized as coatings on inexpensive substrates such as aluminum or stainless steel. The main challenge with coatings has been to achieve pin-hole free surfaces that will remain so after years of use. Titanium {{has been used to}} some extent and though it is very corrosion-resistant, it is also relatively expensive and often still requires some manner of surface coating to prevent the formation of a poorly conducting oxide layer. In contrast, metal alloys may hold promise as potentially low-cost, corrosion-resistant materials for bipolar plates. The dozens of commercially available stainless steel and nickel based alloys have been specifically formulated to offer a particular advantage depending upon their application. In the case of austenitic stainless steels, for example, 316 SS contains molybdenum and a higher chromium content than its more common counterpart, 304 SS, that makes it more noble and increases its corrosion resistance. Likewise, 316 L SS contains less carbon than 316 SS {{to make it easier to}} weld. A number of promising corrosion-resistant, highly noble alloys such as Hastelloy{trademark} or Duplex{trademark} (a stainless steel developed for seawater service) are available commercially, but are expensive and difficult to obtain in various forms (i. <b>e.</b> <b>wire</b> screen, foil, etc.) or in small amounts for R and D purposes...|$|E

40|$|The current gold {{standard}} of care for mandibular segmental defeat reconstruction {{is the use of}} Ti- 6 Al- 4 V immobilization hardware and fibular double barrel graft. This method is often successful immediately at restoring mandible function, however the highly stiff fixation hardware causes stress shielding of the grafted bone and stress concentration in the fixation device over time which can lead to fixation device failure and revision surgery. The purpose of reconstructive surgery could be to create normal stress trajectories in the mandible following engraftment. We investigate the use of a two stage mechanism which separates the immobilization/healing and regenerative phases of mandibular segmental defect treatment. The device includes the use of a very stiff, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, releasable mechanism which assures bone healing. Therefore it could be released once the reconstructed boney tissue and any of its ligamentous attachments have completely healed. Underneath the released Ti- 6 Al- 4 V plate would be a pre-loaded nitinol (NiTi) wire-frame apparatus that facilitates the normal stress-strain trajectory through the engrafted bone after the graft is healed in place and the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fixation device has been released. Due to the use of NiTi wires forming a netting that connects vascularized bone and possibly bone chips, bone grafts {{are also more likely to}} be incorporate rather than to resorb. We first evaluated a healthy adult mandible during normal mastication to obtain the normal stress-strain distribution. Then, we developed the finite element (FE) model of the mandibular reconstruction (in the M 1 - 3 region) with the proposed fixation device during the healing (locked state) and post-healing (released state) periods. To recreate normal stress trajectory in the reconstructed mandible, we applied the Response Surface Methodology (RMS) to optimize the Bone Bandaid geometry (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>wire</b> diameters and location). The results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism immobilizes the grafted bone in the locked state properly since the maximum resultant gap (21. 54 micron) between the graft and host mandible surfaces are in the safe region (less than 300 micron). By considering the von Mises criteria for failure, FE analysis together with experimental studies (i. e., compressive and tensile testing on the inferior and superior fixation devices, respectively) confirm that the proposed fixation devices do not fail, showing safety factor of at least 10. 3. Based on the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique, the optimal parameter values for the wires are achieved (0. 65 mm and 1 mm for the superior and inferior wires, respectively) and the required level of preload on each wire are calculated (369. 8 N and 229 N for the inferior and superior wires, respectively). The FE results for stress distribution on the reconstructed mandible during the released state closely match that of a healthy mandible...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} from investigations carried out on epitaxially grown III-V semiconductor nanowires aimed at improving our understanding of and knowledge on the growth mechanism of nanowires. This {{is important to be}} able to control their growth, in order to make future applications possible. Nanowire growth was carried out using chemical beam epitaxy (CBE). This is a growth technique with the advantage of a fast response in the flow at the substrate surface and a slow growth rate, which makes it possible to realize size-controlled heterostructures with atomically abrupt changes in materials within a single nanowire. The growth mechanism of epitaxially nucleated wires is usually described by the vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism, where metallic seed particles, often gold (Au), are used to form a eutectic system with the growth material. These particles act as seeds for nanowire growth by creating supersaturation in the particle, which is the driving force for anisotropic growth. It was shown that the seed particle, often described as being in the liquid phase, is probably in the solid phase in this growth system. Despite the solid phase of the seed particle, it is believed that it maintains its catalytic property by locally changing the surface below the seed particle, at the wire-particle interface. The growth rate at this interface will increase in comparison with the growth rate on surrounding surfaces, resulting in anisotropic growth, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>wire</b> growth. The effect of different growth conditions was studied and the results indicate that Au-seeded growth of both GaAs and InAs nanowires on the (111) B surface is strongly dependent on the diffusion of group-III material (Ga and In precursors) from the surrounding surfaces to the growth point. Based on these results, a model was proposed for epitaxial growth of nanowires with CBE. More complex nanowires were also grown and studied, such as nanowires of ternary compounds, InAs(1 -x) P(x), as well as InAs nanowires containing InP and InAs(1 -x) P(x) segments. The crystal structure, direction and composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (XEDS), showing that growth is almost always in the B direction, a result of the low interfacial free energy of this plane. The crystal structure is zincblende or wurtzite, sometimes intermixed through stacking faults in the growth direction. The electronic properties of the homogeneous InAs and InAs(1 -x) P(x) nanowires were characterized {{as a function of the}} applied source-drain voltage, gate voltage and temperature. The InAs nanowires are n-type and degenerated, with a resistance that decreases with decreasing temperature. The InAs(1 -x) P(x) nanowires are also n-type but are not degenerated and therefore show a resistance that increases with decreasing temperature. Finally, measurements on InAs nanowires containing InAs(1 -x) P(x) barriers with x varying from 0. 22 - 1 were carried out to map the conduction band offset of InAs(1 -x) P(x) relative to InAs. These measurements were carried out by thermal excitation of the carriers across the barrier. With this information, band gap engineering in nanowires based on the InAs(1 -x) P(x) system could be performed, resulting in applications such as resonant-tunnelling-diodes, infrared detectors and improved transistor behaviour...|$|E
