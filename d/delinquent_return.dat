40|$|When a {{taxpayer}} files an honest 2 ̆ 7 {{federal income tax}} return for a taxable year, section 6501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code 2 limits {{the period of time}} during which the Government can assess a tax for that year to a three-year period commencing with the date that the return was filed. The three-year limitations period is extended for an additional three years by section 6501 (e) (1) (A) if the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s return omits properly includible gross income in an amount in excess of twenty-five percent of the gross income that was reported. If {{a taxpayer}} fails to file a return for a taxable year or files a fraudulent return, sections 6501 (c) (1) and (c) (3) permit the tax for that year to be assessed at any time; in other words, there is no limitation on the time available to the Government to assess or collect the tax. If a taxpayer who failed to file a timely return for a taxable year subsequently fies an honest <b>delinquent</b> <b>return,</b> the three-year limitations period commences to run from the date that the <b>delinquent</b> <b>return</b> is fied no matter how tardy it is and irrespective of whether the taxpayer had a fraudulent purpose for failing to file on time. 3 On the other hand, the Supreme Court recently held that a taxpayer who initially files a fraudulent income tax return cannot invoke a period of limitations by filing an honest amended return correcting the fraudulent aspects of the original return. The Supreme Court held in Badaracco v. Commissioner 4 that once a fraudulent return has been filed, there is no limitation on the time available to the Government to assess a tax deficiency and penalties for that year regardless of corrective action taken by the taxpayer or by anyone else. Prior to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Badaracco, the Tax Court and two circuit courts of appeals had applied a limitations period once an honest amended return was filed, 5 but two other circuit courts of appeals had held that no period of limitations is applicable in such cases. 6 As will be shown below, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s eight-to-one decision in Badaracco was not merely poorly reasoned and erroneous; it was an egregious misapplication of the principles of statutory construction. The issue resolved by the Court is not one of great moment, and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s mishandling of that issue is not in itself of much consequence. What is interesting is- how eight justices of the Court could err in such a seemingly easy case and what that error suggests as to the importance of continuing to provide for Supreme Court review of tax litigation. The case also serves as a useful exemplar of the 2 ̆ 2 do 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 don 2 ̆ 7 ts 2 ̆ 2 of statutory construction. Before addressing the lessons to be derived from Badaracco, it is necessary to make good on the author 2 ̆ 7 s claim that it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a reasonably skeptical reader that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision was patently wrong and resulted from a poor technique of statutory construction. This is a heavy burden, especially since the decision was reached by an overwhelming majority of the Court and since two courts of appeals and at least one student law review note reached the same result. 7 The reader must judge whether the author succeeds in satisfying it. This Article will first set forth the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning and then will consider how the issue should have been resolved...|$|E

5000|$|Davey {{was born}} in 1882 in Nuriootpa, South Australia, to Emily Mary (née Roberts) and Stephen Henry Davey. She began {{teaching}} at a Port Adelaide private school in 1908 and at St Peter's Collegiate Girls' School in 1909. She attended the University of Adelaide as a part-time student, completing a B.A. in philosophy in 1915 and an M.A. in 1918. In 1921 she won a Catherine Helen Spence Memorial Scholarship which allowed her to undertake a doctorate at the University of London; her main area of research was [...] "mental efficiency and deficiency" [...] in children. She received her doctorate in 1924 and visited the United States and Canada to observe the teaching of intellectually disabled and <b>delinquent</b> children before <b>returning</b> to Australia.In November 1924 Davey was hired as the first psychologist in the South Australian Department of Education, where she was tasked with examining and organising classes for [...] "backward, retarded and problem" [...] school students. She examined performed intelligence tests on all educationally delayed children, and established South Australia's first [...] "opportunity class" [...] for these children in 1925. She set up a course which educated teachers on working with intellectually disabled children in 1931. She began lecturing in psychology at the University of Adelaide in 1927, continuing until 1950, and in 1938 she helped {{to set up a}} new university course for training social workers. She resigned from the Department of Education in 1942, by which point there were 700 children in the opportunity classes she had introduced.|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study examined the}} social and academic needs of formerly incarcerated students upon reentry to public high schools {{with the goal of}} graduating. The sample consisted of a total of 17 participants across two public high schools in one large urban district in California. The research design consisted of semi-structured interviews with students, teachers, counselors, principals, probation officers, and delinquency court judges. The interview design was intended to gain insights into the participants’ perspectives on the needs of formerly incarcerated youth towards graduation. Findings are organized around three themes: oppression and control; dignity and agency; and, sense of belonging and turning point. Findings reveal that students experience psychosocial stressors upon reentry that are either diminished or strengthened based on adult actors’ responses to student behavior, students perceive adults use coercive control in their attempts to help them succeed, colorblind adults downplay their influence and attribute student success to connectedness with family and students’ willingness to work hard in school, critical adults have a strong sense of agency to support student beyond a technical level, students perceive graduation as a means to change life course although the motivator to graduate and change life course is sense of belonging and connectedness with adults at school, and critical adults perceive students’ relationships with school adults as a driver to graduate and change their life course. Implications of the findings include a focus on social and emotional supports for student learning and targeted allocation of resources for professional staff training and teacher education programs on race conscious and culturally relevant pedagogy. Moreover, implications include a need for targeted staff training on critical consciousness to reduce stigmatization and further criminalization of <b>delinquent</b> youth upon <b>return</b> to school. Five recommendations for policy and practice are made {{as a result of this}} study’s findings: (a) direct and additional resources to schools with high numbers of students returning from jail, (b) critical consciousness training for adult actors, (c) school-based interdisciplinary teams to develop individual student plans, (d) development of inter-agency communication and monitoring of students, and (e) service centers should be developed to render multidisciplinary support to students. Limitations of the study include generalizability given that data were collected from participants at only two school sites. In addition, the participants were purposefully selected based on success with formerly incarcerated youth and may not be a representative sample of the majority of large comprehensive high schools. The two judges and one probation officer who participated did not have direct knowledge of or contact with the student participants in this study...|$|R
