25|$|In 1948, Leavis {{focused his}} {{attention}} on fiction and made his general statement about the English novel in The <b>Great</b> <b>Tradition</b> where he traced this claimed tradition through Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad. Contentiously, Leavis, and his followers, excluded major authors such as Charles Dickens, Laurence Sterne and Thomas Hardy from his canon, characterising Dickens as a mere entertainer, but eventually, following the revaluation of Dickens by Edmund Wilson and George Orwell, Leavis changed his position, publishing Dickens the Novelist in 1970. The Leavisites' downgrading of Hardy may have damaged Leavis's own authority.|$|E
25|$|The 17th-century critic Giovanni Bellori, in his survey {{entitled}} Idea, praised Carracci as the {{paragon of}} Italian painters, who had fostered a “renaissance” of the <b>great</b> <b>tradition</b> of Raphael and Michelangelo. On the other hand, while admitting Caravaggio's talents as a painter, Bellori deplored his over-naturalistic style, if not his turbulent morals and persona. He thus viewed the Caravaggisti styles {{with the same}} gloomy dismay. Painters were urged to depict the Platonic ideal of beauty, not Roman street-walkers. Yet Carracci and Caravaggio patrons and pupils did not all fall into irreconcilable camps. Contemporary patrons, such as Marquess Vincenzo Giustiniani, found both applied showed excellence in maniera and modeling.|$|E

It doesn't work, given that Morrison has never been political, thankfully sticking to music. It is, however, detailed and comprehensive in its sources, and as such carries on that <b>great</b> <b>tradition</b> of bashing the odious one." ...|$|E
