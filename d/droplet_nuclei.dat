40|$|Expiratory {{droplets}} and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> can be pathogen carriers for airborne diseases. Their transport {{characteristics were}} studied {{in detail in}} two idealized floor-supply-type ventilation flow patterns: Unidirectional-upward and single-side-floor, using a multi-phase numerical model. The model was validated by running interferometric Mie imaging experiments using test droplets with nonvolatile content, which formed <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei,</b> ultimately, in a class- 100 clean-room chamber. By comparing the droplet dispersion and removal characteristics with data of two other ceiling-supply ventilation systems collected from a previous work, deviations from the perfectly mixed ventilation condition were found to exist in various cases to different extent. The unidirectional-upward system {{was found to be}} more efficient in removing the smallest <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> (formed from 1. 5 mu m droplets) by air extraction, but it became less effective for larger droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Instead, the single-side-floor system was shown to be more favorable in removing these large droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In the single-side-floor system, the lateral overall dispersion coefficients for the small droplets and nuclei (initial size <= 45 mu m) were about an order of magnitude higher than those in the unidirectional-upward system. It indicated that bulk lateral airflow transport in the single-side-floor system was much stronger than the lateral dispersion mechanism induced mainly by air turbulence in the unidirectional-upward system. The time required for the droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> to be transported to the exhaust vent or deposition surfaces for removal varied with different ventilation flow patterns. Possible underestimation of exposure level existed if the perfectly mixed condition was assumed. For example, the weak lateral dispersion in the unidirectional ventilation systems made expiratory droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> stay at close distance to the source leading to highly nonuniform spatial distributions. The distance between the source and susceptible patients became an additional concern in exposure analysis. Relative significance of the air-extraction removal mechanism was studied. This can have impact to the performance evaluation of filtration and disinfection systems installed in the indoor environment.

40|$|Human expiratory {{droplets}} can be pathogen carriers {{for various}} airborne infectious diseases. However, {{due to the}} discrete and polydispersive nature, investigations of their indoor transport characteristics have been challenged by various modeling and experimental difficulties. In this research, transport characteristics of expiratory droplets were investigated by treating the droplets or <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> as discrete matters. Motion tracks were modeled by a multiphase approach where the turbulent effects were treated by using stochastic methods. Experiments were performed in test chambers to obtain the turbulence characteristics of the bulk airflow using particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The dispersions of polydispersed test droplets were measured in-situ by the Interferometric Mie imaging (IMI) method combined with light-scattering aerosol spectrometers. The applicability of the numerical model was tested by comparing the numerical data with the experimental results. Results revealed the size-specific transport characteristics of expiratory droplets. Droplets or <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> with an initial size up to 45 μm showed airborne transmittable behavior while those with initial sizes of 87. 5 μm or above settled quickly due to heavy gravitational effect. This is inconsistent with the current definition in infection control guidelines, in which airborne pathogen carriers are regarded as <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> of size 1 - 5 μm. Smaller droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> were more favorable for lateral dispersions as characterized by the overall dispersion coefficient.

40|$|Interpersonal {{transport}} of expiratory droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> constitutes {{a prerequisite for}} the transmission of pathogens {{as well as the}} transmission of respiratory diseases. This study modeled the physical process of interpersonal {{transport of}} droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> in a ventilated room. The impacts of a number of parameters in three length scales and three corresponding physical processes were analyzed, including dispersion and evaporation of droplets/droplet nuclei at 1 to 100 μm, human exhalation flows and body plumes at 0. 1 to 1 m, and the indoor environment at 1 to 10 m. The strong hygroscopicity of the solutes in the droplet is capable of keeping the droplet with an equilibrium size in humid air, larger than that of a dried particle. Mathematical models were developed to predict the droplet nucleus size in both dry air and humid air, by simplifying the composition of one expiratory droplet to NaCl solution and suspended spherical particles. For a droplet with an initial diameter of 100 μm, initial NaCl concentration of 0. 9 %, and initial solids ratio of 1. 8 %, the droplet nucleus size was estimated to be 42 μm in an ambient relative humidity of 90 % (25 °C), which is 30 % larger than it was in a relative humidity of 30 % (25 °C). A numerical model was also developed to predict droplet evaporation and dispersion in a constant turbulent buoyant jet. Droplets with initial sizes larger than 80 μm were predicted to deposit on the floor at a distance of ~ 1. 25 m (~ 1. 7 m for 60 μm) away from the mouth, while droplets with initial sizes less than 40 μm travelled {{to the end of the}} jet. A series of experiments was conducted to assess the characteristics of human exhalation airflows and thermal plume, using a full-scale test room and a breathing thermal manikin. The impacts of the ventilation system were illustrated by comparing the velocity distribution of the exhalation airflows and airflows induced by thermal plume. Further experiments employing two breathing thermal manikins were carried out to evaluate the interpersonal transport of the expiratory contaminants that were simulated by tracer gas. When the two manikins with the same heights were standing face to face at a mutual distance of 0. 8 m, the exhalation airflows from the mouth of the source manikin could directly travel into the breathing region of the susceptible manikin, resulting in a high exposure. The high exposure decreased sharply with an increase in the mutual distance from 0. 5 m to 1. 0 m. Between 1. 0 m to 3. 0 m, the exposure by the susceptible manikin remained at a low and constant level. Numerical simulations considering droplet evaporation and droplet nucleus sizes were carried out; and the impacts of the parameters of droplet initial size, humidity, vicinity, ventilation conditions and synchronization of exhalation were evaluated. Fine droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> were predicted to travel toward the upper part of the test room, whereas large droplets tend to be deposited on the floor. With a high relative humidity, 95 %, most of the droplets were deposited on the floor within 16 seconds. Meanwhile, all of the droplets evaporated to <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> and remained suspended in the air when the relative humidity was 35 %. Mixing ventilation that supplied fresh air with a ventilation rate of 5. 6 h- 1 resulted in drafts and strong turbulence, which made droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> dispersed in the room. The average vertical position was higher than that when the ventilation rate was 3. 0 h- 1. Displacement ventilation led to the vertical temperature stratification in the room. The vertical temperature gradient could neutralize the buoyancy force and weaken body plumes and the vertical dispersion of droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The inhalation of the droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> by the susceptible person and the deposition of the droplets and <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> on the body surface of the susceptible person were investigated at mutual distances of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 3. 0 m.

Bacteriol. 91 : 942 – 944. 1966. —Viable aerosols of four {{strains of}} Mycoplasma: M. hominis II, M. pharyngis, M. pneumoniae, and an undetermined strain {{recovered from a}} lung at autopsy were dispersed, and the particle size was determined. The median diameter of the <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> ranged from 1. 5 to 3. 1 μ. M. pharyngis had a dieaway constant k of 0. 008, indicating a survival potential of 6 hr from 10, 000 colony-forming units at 23 % relative humidity. Ultraviolet irradiation destroyed over 99 % of the aerosols of all four strains concurrently with spraying. The particle size and viability of the <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> carrying Mycoplasma {{were consistent with the}} theory of airborne transmission of lower respiratory-tract infection...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{tuberculosis}} is {{an infectious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is carried in airborne particles, called <b>droplet</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Tuberculosis infection is spread {{from a person}} ti person by inhaling the droplets of infected material produced by a person with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis, patients with positive Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear. <b>Droplet</b> <b>nuclei</b> can survive {{in the air for}} several hours depend on enviromental factor, source case or person with active tuberculosis and contact or person who is exposed to infectious pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Home is vulnerable place for transmission this disease to its contacts. Family such as spouse, children and parents have a higher risk to be transmitted. This was a descriptive study to know prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in spouse of pulmonary tuberculosis patients with positive Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear in Arifin Achmad General Hospital. The samples of this study are 30 people. Results showed that 1 samples (3, 33 %) had a positive Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear and abnormal radiograp...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Skyrme {{model is}} a {{low-energy}} effective field theory for QCD, where the baryons emerge as soliton solutions. It is, however, not so easy within the standard Skyrme model to reproduce the almost exact linear growth of the nuclear masses with the baryon number (topological charge), {{due to the lack}} of Bogomolny solutions in this model, which has also hindered analytical progress. Here we identify a submodel within the Skyrme-type low-energy effective action which does have a Bogomolny bound and exact Bogomolny solutions, and therefore, at least at the classical level, reproduces the nuclear masses by construction. Due to its high symmetry, this model qualitatively reproduces the main features of the liquid <b>droplet</b> model of <b>nuclei.</b> Finally, we discuss under which circumstances the proposed sextic term, which is of an essentially geometric and topological nature, can be expected to give a reasonable description of properties of nuclei...|$|R
40|$|Three blends were made, {{consisting}} of 20 % polypropylene (PP) homopolymer and 80 % {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) or {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE). Isothermal crystallisation of PP, at temperatures where the PE remained molten was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hot-stage optical microscopy (HSOM) with polarised light. The resulting semi-crystalline morphology was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was observed by HSOM that the PP crystallised as open armed, diffuse spherulites in the PP-LLDPE blend, similar to the crystal morphology observed in miscible blends, while in the PP-LDPE and PP-HDPE blends, PP crystallised in phase separated droplets. The crystallisation rate of PP decreased significantly in the PP-LLDPE blend, but in PP-LDPE, PP-HDPE blends, it was {{similar to that of the}} pure PP. The difference in crystallisation rates indicated that PP was much more dispersed in the LLDPE melt, either by dissolution, or greater dispersion of <b>droplets</b> without <b>nuclei,</b> or both. The DSC and HSOM results suggested that the PP was miscible with the LLDPE at elevated temperatures at a PP composition of 20 %, while the PP was immiscible with the HDPE and LDPE at these temperatures. However, TEM showed that there was phase separation in the PP-LLDPE (20 : 80) blend as well, though the droplets were much finer. Nevertheless, the form of spherulitic growth implies a substantial amount of PP dissolved in the molten LLDPE...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Shiptracks detected on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images posses longer detection lives and down-track brightness than expected. A simple model of physical processes is developed to correlate the ship injected aerosols to the subsequent affects on cloud condensation <b>nuclei,</b> <b>droplet</b> distribution, effective radius, and albedo. The theoretical dispersion model is tested using measured values {{corresponding to the}} terms of the model equation. The data sets consisted of insitu aircraft droplet concentration and effective radius cross-shiptrack profiles and AVHRR satellite reflectance values collected during the Monterey Area ShipTracks (MAST) experiment. Strong reinforcement of the model's droplet concentration, effective radius, and reflectance relationships is shown. The near constant value in the observed down-track fractional change of droplet concentration disputes the decreasing fractional changes of droplets predicted by dispersion associated with track widening. The results indicate downtrack modification of cloud and droplet concentrations able to maintain track brightness and track detection life[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
