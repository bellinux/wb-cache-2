40|$|AbstractEight {{researchers}} from Ghana and Benin, with different backgrounds but all co-operating within the Convergence of Sciences project, conducted <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> {{as a first}} step of their research aimed at developing technologies together with resource-poor farmers. The purpose of including <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> was to increase the likelihood that the resulting technologies would be grounded in the needs and opportunities of these farmers. To better understand the potential of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> for improving the contribution of agricultural research to farmers' livelihoods, a comparative study was conducted of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> carried out by the eight researchers. This research on agricultural research was participatory in that its results were arrived at in consultation with the eight researchers. The comparison revealed that <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> identified and established forums of stakeholders, especially of farmers, who were to play key roles in the co-construction of knowledge during the field experimental phase that followed the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies.</b> The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> gave farmers a say in the design and conduct of the experimental phase which allowed them to influence the research process in the direction of developing and testing technologies that work in their circumstances and that satisfy their needs and priorities. In addition, the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> have led to transparent choices with respect to the selection of sites, farmers and experiments. Furthermore, the conditions for negotiation were created.

The Standards for Reporting of <b>Diagnostic</b> Accuracy <b>Studies</b> (STARD), first published in 2003, were developed {{to improve the quality of}} research reports on <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies.</b> We aimed to evaluate STARD statements in the setting of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>studies</b> on non-invasive liver fibrosis tests, and to propose an extended version developed specifically for those studies. METHODS: Eight French experts evaluated STARD statement adequacy in 10 studies on non-invasive liver fibrosis tests and then developed an extended version with a glossary.

50|$|Imaging, {{such as the}} use of {{ultrasound}} or a {{computed tomography}} scan, is the generally preferred way of diagnosis as it is more accurate and is sensitive to bleeding, however; due to logistics this is not always possible. For a person who is hemodynamically unstable a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) scan may take place which is used to find free floating fluid in the right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant of the abdomen. The FAST scan however may not indicated in those who are obese and those with subcutaneous emphysema. Its speed and sensitivity to injuries resulting in 400mL of free-floating fluid make it a valuable tool in the evaluation of unstable persons. Computed tomography is another <b>diagnostic</b> <b>study</b> which can be performed, but typically is only used in those who are hemodynamically stable. A physical examination may be used but is typically inaccurate in blunt trauma, unlike in penetrating trauma where the trajectory the projectile took can be followed digitally. A diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may also be utilized but has limited application as it is hard to determine the origin of the bleeding. A diagnostic peritoneal lavage is generally discouraged when FAST is available as it is invasive and non-specific.|$|E
5000|$|The {{total area}} of the {{ecological}} disaster zone is 7 million hectares, including {{the territory of the}} test site (1.8 million hectares) and the zones of emergency-level and maximum radiation risk (5.2 million hectares). Some 27.4 million hectares of agricultural land is registered in the impact zone of the Semipalatinsk testing ground (88.3% of the total {{area of the}} region).By the Government Decree of the Republic of Kazakhstan №172 of February 7, 1996 the Semipalatinsk test site lands became reserve lands and measures were identified to improve the ecological situation in the districts located in the zones of emergency-level and maximum radiation risk. The difficulty of full economic land development on the test site is that a radiological <b>diagnostic</b> <b>study</b> has not been completed in the area and the norms of the maximum permissible pollution of the lands have not been established. Due to the transfer of part of the Semipalatinsk test site lands to economic use, the priority objective is to conduct detailed studies and develop measures on the safe implementation of economic activity in these areas. Due to lack of funding such measures have not yet materialized.The Semipalatinsk Nuclear Testing Polygon (SNTP) was established on August 21, 1947. Covering three oblasts-Western Kazakhstan, Karaganda and Pavlodar, SNTP occupies an area of 18,500 km2 with a perimeter of 600 km. The Polygon occupies 10,000 km2 of the former Semipalatinsk oblast. Nuclear tests were performed over the period between 1949 and 1989, with around 470 systems, including 30 surface, 86 air and 340 subsurface devices detonated. The power of the explosions reached 17,400,000 tons of trinitrotoluene equivalent. Initially, nuclear tests were performed to test nuclear explosive systems and armament samples, and later for economic purposes.These tests resulted {{in the formation of the}} “atomic lake” Balapan, plus radioactive gas emissions in the air, environmental imbalance and negative health implications for people living in areas adjoining the SNTP site.Reports indicate gamma-radiation levels many times exceeding the norm - up to 1,250 mcr/hr in Semiplatinsk in 1960-1980, which exceed the background level approximately 100 times, and up to 60,000 mcr/hr in Sarapan village. Pollution with radioactive isotopes of caesium and strontium exceeding the threshold was identified in Shagan and Aschisu rivers, Balapan Lake and other water sources within the SNTP site. At least 4,500 km2 of the Polygon area (land, rocks, water) are polluted with Cs-137 and Sr-90 in concentrations exceeding the threshold.The environmental and agricultural implications and consequences of activities carried out at the Polygon are remarkable. Nuclear tests affected not only the Polygon’s natural landscapes, existing ecosystems and agriculture, but also lands adjacent to the Polygon. Radionuclide pollution of milk and meat produced on farms located near the SNTP was sometimes registered at levels exceeding both the background level and safety requirements.Currently, there is a clear need for the following to be carried out at the SNTP: ...|$|E
