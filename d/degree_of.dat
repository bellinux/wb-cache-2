50|$|N {{atoms in}} a {{molecule}} have 3N <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom which constitute translations, rotations, and vibrations. For non-linear molecules, there are 3 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for translational (motion along the x, y, and z directions) and 3 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for rotational motion (rotations in Rx, Ry, and Rz directions) for each atom. Linear molecules {{are defined as}} possessing bond angles of 180°, so there are 3 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for translational motion but only 2 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for rotational motion because the rotation about its molecular axis leaves the molecule unchanged. When subtracting the translational and rotational <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom, the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> vibrational modes is determined.|$|R

30|$|The {{number of}} elements, nodes, and <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for a simply {{supported}} beam (pin/pin) and a beam with mixed boundary conditions (pin/clamped) are reported in Table 5. The LogFE formulation, in general, includes both nodal and internal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom. Nodal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom {{may be linked to}} the nodal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom of other finite element elements, e.g. by continuity conditions. In contrast, internal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom are not linked to any <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom of other elements, and thus can be eliminated from the model by static condensation.|$|R
40|$|When {{performing}} multi-component significance {{tests with}} multiply-imputed datasets, analysts {{can use a}} Wald-like test statistic and a reference F-distribution. The currently employed <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom in the denominator of this F-distribution are derived assuming an infinite sample size. For modest complete-data sample sizes, this <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom can be unrealistic; for example, it may exceed the complete-data <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom. This paper presents an alternative denominator <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom that is always {{less than or equal}} to the complete-data denominator <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom, and equals the currently employed denominator <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for infinite sample sizes. Its advantages over the currently employed <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom are illustrated with a simulation. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> viremia, and inversely proportional to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E

In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips (secret handshakes) peculiar to his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge. In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.|$|E
