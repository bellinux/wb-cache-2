The original formula {{was extended to}} show the presence of both the cyclic silicate groups and M4-site silicon, according to the nomenclature of the eudialyte group. Some niobium substitutes for tungsten in khomyakovite. Khomyakovite is an iron-analogue of manganokhomyakovite, the second mineral being a bit more common. The two minerals are the only group representatives, beside taseqite, with species-defining strontium, although many other members display stronium <b>diadochy.</b> Khomyakovite is the third eudialyte-group mineral with essential tungsten (after johnsenite-(Ce) and manganokhomyakovite).|$|E
50|$|Jinshajiangite {{is a rare}} {{silicate}} mineral {{named after}} the Jinshajiang river in China. Its currently accepted formula is BaNaFe4Ti2(Si2O7)2O2(OH)2F. It gives a name of the jinshajiangite group. The mineral is associated with alkaline rocks. In jinshajiangite, there is a potassium-to-barium, calcium-to-sodium, manganese-to-iron and iron-to-titanium <b>diadochy</b> substitution. Jinshajiangite is the iron-analogue of surkhobite and perraultite. It is chemically related to bafertisite, cámaraite and emmerichite. Its structure is related to that of bafertisite. Jinshajiangite is a titanosilicate with heteropolyhedral HOH layers, where the H-layer is a mixed tetrahedral-octahedral layer, and the O-layer is simply octahedral.|$|E
5000|$|The {{current work}} {{is based on}} a single- crystal {{fragment}} of cervandonite measuring 0.08 X 0.03 X 0.02 mm. The exact fragment was re-examined with MoKα radiation using BRUKER Apex II diffractometer equipped with a 2K CCD detector. Through the use of X-ray diffraction, the unusual nature of the As to Si substitution found arsenic to be present as As3+ instead of As5+, with the presence of sorosilicate Si2076− anions were also established. The original description of the cervandonite mineral,(Ce,Nd,La)(Fe3+,Fe2+,Ti4+,Al)3SiAs(Si,As)O13, was rewritten to,(Ce,Nd,La)(Fe3+,Fe2+,Ti4+,Al)3 O2(Si2As7)1−x+y(As03)1+x-y(OH)3x-3y. The x and y values are 0.47 and 0.31. Even though the values were derived from a refined and disordered crystal, the new formula matches the charge balance negative versus 12.75 positive charges for the average chemical composition for the M(1)+M(2) sites. [...] The As-containing silicates, none of which contained the Si2As7 composition, or arsenic in the 3+ state, where considered to be examples of As to Si <b>diadochy.</b> However, after accurate determination of the crystal structure the As and Si atoms where shown to occupy distinct cell sites. So far, the As-Si disorder is unique for the cervandonite mineral, and accounts for the As:Si ratio. Due to the unusual <b>diadochy,</b> the variable composition of cervandonite might consist of an assembly of more or less twinned microdomains. Since cervandonite contains different values of As/Si and unit- cell parameters, has observed one type of superstructure.|$|E

40|$|Rare-element {{granitic}} pegmatites {{are common}} hosts to economic deposits of rare metals, including Li, Ta, and rare-earth elements, which are increasing in economic importance due to advancing technology. Gahnite (ZnAl₂O₄) occurs as an accessory mineral in metamorphosed massive sulfide deposits (MMSDs) and some rare-element granitic pegmatites, {{including those with}} rare-metal mineralization, but detailed chemical studies of gahnite in these rocks are very scarce. In this study, gahnite from twenty-four granitic pegmatites and the Broken Hill-type Nine Mile MMSD, Australia, was analyzed for major and trace element chemical compositions to determine the relative degree of evolution of the pegmatites and identify chemical differences between Li-rich and Li-poor pegmatites and between these and MMSDs. In the spinel ternary diagram in terms of mol % gahnite (Ghn), hercynite (Hc), and spinel (Spl) end-members, the compositions of gahnite from the pegmatites fall within the previously defined pegmatite field and are given by: Ghn₇₀. ₆₃₋₉₈. ₄₈Hc₀. ₉₅₋₂₈. ₆₁Spl₀. ₀₀₋₄. ₅₂. Gahnite from the Nine Mile deposit (Ghn₅₅. ₆₂₋₇₆. ₀₆Hc₁₇. ₄₇₋₃₇. ₃₄Spl₃. ₈₁₋₁₀. ₇₃) falls within the MMSD field characterized by compositions that reach higher Mg and lower Zn contents compared to gahnite from granitic pegmatites. Gahnite from the LCT (lithium, cesium, tantalum) family, rare-element class, beryl-columbite-phosphate subtype and LCT family, muscovite-rare element class, Li subclass granitic pegmatites of the Comechingones (Blanca Dora, Juan Román, Magdalena, La Ona, and Sin Nombre pegmatites) and Conlara (Nancy pegmatite) pegmatite districts, Pampean Pegmatite Province, Argentina, was analyzed in detail. The chemical composition of gahnite from these pegmatites {{is defined by the}} ranges Ghn₇₈. ₄₉₋₉₀. ₃₅Hc₉. ₀₇₋₂₀. ₅₂Spl₀. ₂₅₋₃. ₃₇. Gahnite from the Nancy pegmatite has higher Mg and Mn contents than gahnite from the Comechingones pegmatites. Chemical zoning within gahnite crystals is characterized by an increase in Zn (~ 2. 8 wt. % ZnO) and a decrease in Fe (~ 2. 6 wt. % FeO) from core to rim, reflecting the evolution of the pegmatite melt via simple fractional crystallization. Plots of molecular Fe vs. Zn and Fe+Mg vs. Zn+Mn and Zn/Fe ratios in gahnite display the <b>diadochy</b> and the relative degree of fractionation of the pegmatites. The Zn/Fe ratios range from 3. 82 to 9. 96. Based on all these parameters, the relative degree of evolution of the pegmatites increases in the order: Sin Nombre [arrow to] Magdalena [arrow to] Juan Román [arrow to] Blanca Dora [arrow to] Nancy [arrow to] La Ona. This order is consistent with mineralogical evidence and indicates that the composition of gahnite in granitic pegmatites can effectively be used to determine the relative degree of evolution of pegmatite melts. The trace elements present in gahnite are first-series transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, and Cu), as well as Mn, Li, Ga, Cd, Sn, and Pb. Gahnite in the Nine Mile deposit reaches higher Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, and Pb and lower Mn, Li, Ga, Sn, and Cu contents than gahnite from granitic pegmatites. Gahnite from highly evolved granitic pegmatites of the Borborema Pegmatite Province, Brazil, has the highest Cu (up to 68 ppm), Mn (up to 8, 819 ppm), Li (up to 376 ppm) and Zn (up to 43 wt. % ZnO) contents and these compositions may be good indicators of Li-rich pegmatites. This study shows that the major and trace element chemistry of gahnite in granitic pegmatites may be used to understand relative pegmatite evolution and to distinguish pegmatites that contain Li-mineralization from barren pegmatites.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Heavy {{minerals}} {{can contain}} potentially economic amounts of metals as both matrix and trace constituents. Such minerals appear as unconsolidated black sands on the continental shelf off southwest Oregon {{and along the}} Oregon coast. Two diverse energies are considered in this investigation. Environmental energy of the depositional regimen, Part I; energy involved in crystallization of transition metals from a magma, Part III. In Part II, an analytical scheme {{for the evaluation of}} opaque oxides is proposed, and an examination of the results as applied to two samples is presented. Part I The unconsolidated black sands on the Oregon continental margin have been profoundly affected by tectonic uplift aid by cyclic erosive transgression and regression. Progressive enrichment in heavy minerals from the Klamath Mountains has apparently occurred during each glacio-eustatic regression of the Pleistocene seas, each regression a period of intensified erosion and sediment transport. Subsequent erosive transgressions selectively sort and redistribute these heavy minerals into paralic beach and nearshore deposits. Uplift of the coast and shelf implies that the heavy minerals were reworked during the Holocene transgression into concentrations of greater extent and higher ore tenor than relict deposits of earlier transgressions in upraised Pleistocene terraces. Extrapolation of ore reserve values from the terraces by "Mirror Image" concepts might seriously underestimate the potential of offshore deposits. Offshore heavy mineral concentrations should be coincident with observed submarine terraces. Part II An analytic scheme was developed to investigate opaque oxides in two samples; one from the Pleistocene terraces; the other from near the present shelf edge. Analyses involving X-ray diffraction techniques, atomic absorption and neutron activation established the mineralogy and elemental distribution in magnetically separated diagnostic splits. Chrome spinel, ilmenite and magnetite comprise the opaque oxide fraction in both samples. Correlation studies of these analyses suggest: (1) Chromium is a matrix metal of chrome spinel and is diadochic into magnetite. (2) Iron appears in all opaque oxides and in increasing amounts with increasing magnetic susceptibility. (3) Titanium is a matrix metal in ilmenite, and diadochic into chrome spinel and magnetite. (4) Nickel and ruthenium are diadochic into and correlated to the spinel structure; i. e. to chrome spinel and magnetite. (5) Osmium appears to be correlated to chromium. (6) Zinc is limited to spinel in these samples. Part III Goldschmidt's and Ringwood's criteria for <b>diadochy</b> often fail to explain the distribution of the transition metals because crystal field effects are not considered. Favored d[superscript n] configurations, e. g. octahedrally coordinated, low spin d⁶ cations in the spinel minerals, result in shortened interatomic distance and significantly strengthened cation-ligand bonds, possibly affecting the distribution of such metal cations. The octahedral site preference energy parameter (OSPE) has been used to explain distributional behavior of the first (3 d) transition series metals. OSPE calculations for four low spin d⁶ cations - Co(III), Ru(II), Rh(III), and Pt(IV) - give significantly high values for this parameter. High OSPE valued transition metal cations possibly form stable proto-mineral oxide complexes in the magma which persist through crystallization. These associations predetermine the enrichment of transition metals in oxide minerals and act as nuclei during cooling and solidification. Subduction of oxidized and hydrolyzed near-surface rocks down a Benioff zone provides progressively higher Eh in the magma, a variety of cation oxidation states, and water for sepentinization of ultramafic rocks. The distribution of the platinum metals in a strongly reducing magma environment should be different than in the oxidizing magma proposed for the Klamath ultramafics. The OSPE parameter offers an explanation for the observed distribution of platinum group metals in spinel minerals from this investigation, in chromites from Uralian dunitic massifs and the Stillwater complex; and of iridium from the Great Lake Doleritic Sheet, Tasmania. Chrome spinel from Oregon had twice the concentration of ruthenium, and one-third the amount of osmium as similar Uralian chromite deposits. The first significant concentration of ruthenium in magnetite is herein reported recommending continued research into the platinum metal distribution in southwest Oregon...|$|E
