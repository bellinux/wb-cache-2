25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> believe that it won't come out in 2016".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} ranting," [...] he said. [...] "I feel I've been--eloquent. You {{make me feel}} like an actor-manager, in a play by Capes.... You are the most <b>difficult</b> person <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> talk to in all the world--because you mean so much to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} obstinate and tiresome--and {{you make it}} so <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I want <b>to</b> hear about the furniture--and how {{you are going to}} manage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think it's in {{my power}} to do {{anything}} that he would like," [...] he said in a serious tone. [...] "Forgive me my frankness, Mrs. Travers, but he makes it very <b>difficult</b> sometimes <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> keep civil. Whatever I have {{had to put up with}} in life I have never had to put up with contempt." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{music of}} Nine Inch Nails has {{reportedly}} {{been used by}} the U.S. military as music torture to break down the resolve of detainees. Reznor objected to the use of his music in this way with the following message {{on the front page of}} the Nine Inch Nails website: [...] "It's <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you've put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture. If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities. Thank GOD this country has appeared to side with reason and we can put the Bush administration's reign of power, greed, lawlessness and madness behind us." ...|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{received}} an Academy Award nomination {{for the second}} year running for her work opposite Burt Lancaster in The Rainmaker (1956). Again she played a lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it became apparent that Hepburn had found a niche in playing [...] "love-starved spinsters" [...] that critics and audiences enjoyed. Hepburn said of playing such roles, [...] "With Lizzie Curry [...] and Jane Hudson [...] and Rosie Sayer —I was playing me. It wasn't <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play those women, because I'm the maiden aunt." [...] Less success that year came from The Iron Petticoat (1956), a reworking of the classic comedy Ninotchka, with Bob Hope. Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, a performance Bosley Crowther called [...] "horrible". It was a critical and commercial failure, and Hepburn considered it the worst film on her resume.|$|E
500|$|After Winehouse's death, {{according}} to Pete Doherty, he and Winehouse were lovers at one point, {{speaking to the}} Daily Mail about it he said [...] "This is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> admit. But, yes, it's true. Amy and I were lovers. I loved her then and, well, I still do today. But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools… and believe me, she had a mean right hook." [...] However, in July 2008, Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse about her relationship with Doherty. Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, {{he looked at me}} like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Nora," [...] he sighed, [...] "what a brute I {{must seem}} {{to you and}} how <b>difficult</b> it is <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> try and tell you all that is in my heart!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” {{said the}} man, {{in a voice}} that was curiously expressionless, “you heard Miss Harding’s story. She was very fair—about Lucy Davidson—but you can realize how <b>difficult</b> it is <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go into that?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean to {{hurt your}} feelings, Walter," [...] Mrs. Davenant said; [...] "but of course, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> at first, <b>to</b> realize {{that while you}} have been away you have changed from a boy into a man." ...|$|R
500|$|After trying various {{science fiction}} shows after Lost, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson felt the episode made [...] "him feel like [...] picked a winner". Like other critics, Hanson loved the twist ending, writing that [...] "Fringe {{is making it}} more and more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pick my {{favorite}} episode". Television Without Pity called Walternate's sudden appearance one of 2010's [...] "Most Memorable TV Moments", explaining [...] "We knew we'd meet him eventually, but the way they surprised us {{with him at the}} end of a stand-alone episode was a fitting introduction for such an ominous and shadowy character, and we knew even then that it marked a new and improved era for the show." [...] At the time, TV Fanatic called [...] "Northwest Passage" [...] the best Fringe episode to date, giving the series' its first [...] "five out of five stars".|$|E
500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
500|$|Reger {{completed}} {{the composition of}} the psalm in May to August 1909. The work was published by Peters in Leipzig, first the vocal score with piano in September 1909, with the piano reduction prepared by Reger himself. The score and the parts appeared in December that year. The complete work was premiered simultaneously on 23 February 1910 in both Chemnitz and Breslau. In Chemnitz, Reger conducted the church choir of St. Lukas and the municipal orchestra (Städtische Kapelle), with Georg Stolz at the organ. In Breslau, [...] conducted the Sing-Akademie and the Orchester-Verein, with organist Max Ansorge. A reviewer wrote in the journal NMZ: [...] "" [...] (Still under the impression of what we heard and experienced, it is unspeakably <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> express here all the deeply experienced, the sublime and divine of that hour. One was deeply shaken, when the gigantic double fugue ended, had experienced something unforgettable.") ...|$|E
5000|$|On 2 April 2010 it was {{announced}} that Benjamin had chosen to leave the show to pursue other projects. Of her decision, she said [...] "I have had an amazing time at EastEnders and {{this has been a very}} <b>difficult</b> decision <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make but now seems like the right time to move on and leave Chelsea behind even through she's been such a fantastic character to play." [...] Her final episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Christine Anu {{refused to}} offer harsh {{criticism}} of the contestants resigning in April 2004. In a statement issued on her departure, she said: [...] "I chose to play a positive role model and wanted to encourage these young people in their endeavours, rather than criticise them. Although leaving Popstars Live was a <b>difficult</b> decision <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make, I do feel somewhat relieved that I can now focus on my music." [...] John Paul Young was sacked although the producers claimed that his contract had finished.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Brown began {{starring}} as Shirley Bennett on {{the comedy}} series Community. On September 30, 2014, Brown {{announced that she}} would be leaving the show after five seasons in order {{to take care of her}} ailing father. In her announcement she said, [...] "My dad needs daily care and he needs me. The idea of being away 16 hours a day for five months, I couldn't do it. It was a <b>difficult</b> decision <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make, but I had to choose my dad." ...|$|R
500|$|Millar did {{not like}} the first draft of the screenplay, {{considering}} that the approach was [...] "too tame" [...] and [...] "a little bit Americanized" [...] given he wanted [...] "basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want, then choosing the dark path." [...] The author only started to support the direction the project was taking once Bekmambetov [...] "came in with his Eastern European madness" [...] and the intention of coming closer to the spirit of the book. Bekmambetov said that he would take liberty in adapting the comic book's world: [...] "It’s <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> just follow. It’s interesting for me to create. I feel a little bit different how this world has to be executed". In July 2006, screenwriter Chris Morgan was hired to revise the third act of the Wanted script written by Haas and Brandt.|$|E
500|$|... "Hikari" [...] and [...] "Simple & Clean" [...] {{are often}} cited as [...] "one of the best video game songs in recent history", as {{described}} by Dannii C. from Celebmix.com. Alex Hanavan from The Young Folks listed the orchestral version of [...] "Hikari", which also appeared during the credits section of Kingdom Hearts, at number two on their [...] "Top Ten Video Game Theme Songs". He stated his reason through his extended review; [...] "Kingdom Hearts has several 'theme songs' but the orchestrated version of 'Hikari' takes the cake with all {{the makings of a}} grand adventure. It resonates with the many themes of the games: friendship, teamwork, and adventure. 'Hikari' undoubtedly brings back wealth of memories for any fan of the franchise." [...] GameFAQs's editor Pierce Sparrow listed both [...] "Simple & Clean" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary" [...] at number two on their [...] "Top Ten Lyrical Songs for a Video Game". Sparrow stated: [...] "It was a little too <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> choose just one of the songs, seeing as they have very similar qualities... I doubt that anyone will disagree that these are two of the greatest theme songs ever produced." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga was {{the most}} {{nominated}} artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t {{stand up for what}} we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. [...] "But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, Churchill {{decided to}} stop writing and withdrew from public life. As {{a result of this}} he was {{gradually}} forgotten by the public. In 1940, The Uncharted Way, his first book in twenty years, was published. The book examined Churchill's thoughts on religion. He did not seek to publicize the book and it received little attention. Shortly before his death he said, [...] "It is very <b>difficult</b> now <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{think of myself as a}} writer of novels, as all that seems to belong to another life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} of that, my man," [...] {{interrupted}} the consul, with a sad smile, [...] "but your aid {{in this case will}} be useless. The fact is that the preservation of your life will be a more <b>difficult</b> matter <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> accomplish than my own. If Lord Exmouth really arrives and proceeds to extremities, I and my family will be in the greatest peril from these irate corsairs, but you, my poor fellow, are doomed whatever happens, seeing that you have laid violent hands on the Turkish guard of the gates." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we get this thing to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was moderately positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of Scully's portrayal, noting [...] "Really, this works best as a Scully episode. I prefer Darin Morgan's {{version of the}} character , but I doubt that version could support a full episode about God {{in the same way}} that this more searching, and lost, Scully does." [...] However, Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode, noting that [...] "If there's a Christian God in the X-Files universe, doesn't that trump just about everything else that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on?... There are too many implications here for the show to support, and while it doesn't destroy the episode, it does make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> back it as fully as I'd like to." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode highlights Scully and her faith, and in the process, manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character. The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing, and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy-handed, it works well enough." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of the episode's [...] "inventiveness," [...] which [...] "derives from its choice of the most mainstream paranormality of all—Christianity." [...] The review also wrote positively of the Mulder-Scully role reversal, calling the change [...] "always welcome". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that [...] "Scully's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama, and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge." [...] Vitaris, however, criticized elements of the plot, most notably the [...] "un-saintly" [...] quality of Kevin and Kevin's lack of emotion after his mother is killed. Furthermore, she called the ending [...] "a real mess". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, and called it a [...] "peculiarly bloodless episode". The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes, such as the ability to bilocate. Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should [...] "take a serious subject by all means, but then take the subject seriously." ...|$|E
5000|$|Williams did {{not like}} to discuss his sexual {{orientation}} publicly, and described his marriage with Eva O as more of a [...] "partnership". In an interview with John Ellenberger of Golgotha Magazine in 1997, while discussing The Whorse's Mouth and how he was hesitant to have his family listen to the album, Williams stated, [...] "There are certain things that I just feel don't need to be shared with them. It was really kind of a <b>difficult</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> call and just say, you know, 'Well hey, guess what? I'm gay.' And my mother's response was, 'Well son, I'm not stupid.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} Altrurian, {{as if he}} did not quite follow this joking; and, to tell the truth, I never find the {{personal}} thing in very good taste.

40|$|A true {{information}} and political earthquake {{resulted from the}} collision of the two great plates of internet freedom and US diplomacy. The epicenter? Wikileaks, a well known website led by Julian Assange since 2006 that encourages online whistle-blowing with the guarantee to keep the source a secret. Coming from Chile, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> think about earthquakes when describing such a big political crash. However, being fair with Wikileaks, earthquakes have a doubtless destructive power that the website arguably does not have: at least the picture of Wikileaks {{is one of a}} rich variety of grey, rather than plain black or white...|$|R

2500|$|The Song Remains The Same {{is not a}} great film, but there's {{no point}} in making excuses. [...] It's just a {{reasonably}} honest statement of where we were at that particular time.

2500|$|Dylan {{talked about}} his {{difficulty}} at the recording sessions {{in an interview with}} Guitar World magazine. [...] "I lose my inspiration in the studio real easy, and it's very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think that I'm going to eclipse anything I've ever done before. I get bored easily, and my mission, which starts out wide, becomes very dim after a few failed takes and this and that." [...] In the same interview Dylan cited Buddy Holly as an influence during the recording sessions.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} other, [...] "I cannot, with exactness, say that I did. It would be <b>difficult,</b> indeed, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} {{the manner in}} which we arrived at this most satisfactory conclusion. Miss Raybold is a mistress of expression, and, without moving a hair's-breadth beyond the lines of maidenly reserve which always environ her, she made me aware, not only that I desired to propose marriage to her, but that it would be well <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do so. There were objections to this course, which, as an honest man, I could not refrain from laying before her, and with my proposition I stated these objections, but they were overruled to my entire satisfaction, and she consented to become Mrs. Bishop." ...|$|R
5000|$|Albarn was {{the subject}} of a half-hour episode of The Culture Show {{broadcast}} on BBC Two in February 2014, which focused on his previous bands and his current work. In the programme he returned to his former homes in Leytonstone, East London, and Colchester, Essex. Speaking in the programme, he revealed that he found his first solo LP tough, saying: [...] "I've spent so long in bands, playing to large groups of people, that doing a solo album is quite a <b>difficult</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do.

It was a lottery, and I believe that I'm alive thanks to sheer chance, because there were people who were detained with me and they shot them dead; this could just as well happened to me." ...|$|R
