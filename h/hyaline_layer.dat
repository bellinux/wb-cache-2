25|$|The {{first step}} of {{gastrulation}} is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingression of primary mesenchyme cells into the blastocoel. Primary mesenchyme cells, or PMCs, {{are located in the}} vegetal plate specified to become mesoderm. Prior to ingression, PMCs exhibit all the features of other epithelial cells that comprise the embryo. Cells of the epithelium are bound basally to a laminal matrix and apically to an extraembryonic matrix. The apical microvilli of these cells reach into the <b>hyaline</b> <b>layer,</b> a component of the extraembryonic matrix. Neighboring epithelial cells are also connected to each other through apical junctions, protein complexes containing adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, linked to catenins.|$|E
25|$|As PMCs {{begin to}} undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the lamina which binds them dissolves {{to begin the}} {{mechanical}} release of the cells. Expression of the membrane protein that binds laminin, integrin, also becomes irregular {{at the beginning of}} ingression. The microvilli which secure PMCs to the <b>hyaline</b> <b>layer</b> shorten, as the cells reduce their affinity for the extraembryonic matrix. These cells concurrently increase their affinity for other components of the basal matrix, such as fibronectin, in part driving the movement of cells inward. The apical junctions which bind PMCs to their neighboring epithelial cells become disrupted during this transition, and are absent in cells that have fully ingressed into the blastocoel. Because staining for cadherins and catenins in ingressing cells decreases and develops as intracellular accumulations, apical junctions are thought to be cleared by endocytosis during ingression.|$|E

40|$|During seed {{formation}} of Brassica macrocarpa {{the development of}} the embryo precedes that of the integuments; structural changes and histochemical changes are associated. Esterases, acid phosphatases, phenols and starch follow a sigmoid pattern, increasing during embryogenesis and decreasing during seed maturation. In the mature seed, esterase activity is localized in the embryo and in the cells of the mucilaginous, aleuronic and <b>hyaline</b> <b>layers.</b> Acid phosphatases are present in the mucilaginous cells, mainly in the column, the cell walls delimiting intercellular spaces of the cortical cylinder and the adhesion areas of the cotyledons. Phenols are scanty in the root apex, mucilaginous cells and the palisade layer, and abundant in the pigmented layer. Starch is absent in ripe seeds which have lipid and protein reserves. The major classes of storage proteins have molecular weights of 21, 22, 27 and 30 KD and accumulate in the late stages prior to complete drying. Esterases and acid phosphatases in mucilaginous cells of the seed integument suggest that these enzymes are involved in hydrolytic processes occurring prior to germination and that mucilages have a metabolic function in seed-soil interactions...|$|R

40|$|Spores of the arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) Glomus geosporum and Glomus constrictum were {{harvested from}} single-spore-derived pot cultures with either Plantago lanceolata or Hieracium pilosella as host plants.

Both species produce small, hyaline spores in aggregates {{formed in the}} soil and inside roots. Glomus achrum was associated with roots of Ammophila arenaria (L.) Link colonizing maritime dunes of the Vistula Bar in northern Poland, and G. bistratum occurred among vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza of Xanthium cf. spinosum growing in dunes of the Mediterranean Sea adjacent to Veriko, Greece. Spores of G. achrum are globose to subglobose, (25 -) 43 (- 55) mu m in diameter, rarely egg-shaped, oblong to irregular, 15 - 45 mu m x 55 - 65 mu m. Their wall consists of three hyaline layers: a mucilaginous, short-lived outermost layer; a laminate middle layer composed of loose sublayers; and a flexible innermost layer. The outermost and the innermost layers stain deeply red in Melzer's reagent. Spores of G. bistratum are globose to subglobose, (20 -) 29 (- 50) mu m in diameter, and have a wall composed of two permanent, <b>hyaline</b> <b>layers.</b> The outer layer is unit, smooth, and the inner one laminate.

40|$|AbstractObjective Data {{pertaining}} to the quantitative structural features and organization of normal articular cartilage are of great importance in understanding its biomechanical properties and in attempting to establish this tissue's counterpart by engineering in vitro. A comprehensive set of such baseline data is, however, not available for humans. It was {{the purpose of the}} present study to furnish the necessary information. Design The articular cartilage layer covering the medial femoral condyle of deceased persons aged between 23 and 49 years was chosen for the morphometric analysis of cell parameters using confocal microscopy in conjunction with unbiased stereological methods. The height of the <b>hyaline</b> articular cartilage <b>layer,</b> as well as that of the calcified cartilage layer and the subchondral bone plate, were also measured. Results The mean height of the <b>hyaline</b> articular cartilage <b>layer</b> was found to be 2. 4 mm, the volume density of chondrocytes therein being 1. 65 %, the number of cells per mm 3 of tissue 9626 and the mean cell diameter 13 μm.

40|$|Summary: A recent {{revival of}} global {{interest}} for reconstruction of long-segment tracheal defects, which {{represents one of}} the most interesting and complex problems in head and neck and thoracic reconstructive surgery, has been witnessed. The trachea functions as a conduit for air, and its subunits including the epithelial <b>layer,</b> <b>hyaline</b> cartilage, and segmental blood supply make it particularly challenging to reconstruct. A myriad of attempts at replacing the trachea have been described. These along with the anatomy, indications, and approaches including microsurgical tracheal reconstruction will be reviewed. Novel techniques such as tissue-engineering approaches will also be discussed. Multiple attempts at replacing the trachea with synthetic scaffolds have been met with failure. The main lesson learned from such failures is that the trachea must not be treated as a “simple tube. ” Understanding the anatomy, developmental biology, physiology, and diseases affecting the trachea are required for solving this problem...|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} of {{gastrulation}} is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingression of primary mesenchyme cells into the blastocoel.

50|$|To {{create this}} barrier {{cortical}} granules, specialized secretory vesicles {{located within the}} egg's cortex (the region directly below the plasma membrane), are fused with the egg's plasma membrane, causing {{the contents of the}} cortical granules to be released outside the cell where they modify an existing extracellular matrix to make it impenetrable to sperm entry. The cortical granules contain proteases that clip perivitelline tether proteins, peroxidases that harden the vitelline envelope, and glycosaminoglycans that attract water into the perivitelline space, causing it to expand and form the <b>hyaline</b> <b>layer.</b> The trigger for the cortical granules to exocytose is the release of calcium ions from cortical smooth endoplasmic reticulum in response to sperm binding to the egg.|$|E
50|$|As PMCs {{begin to}} undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the lamina which binds them dissolves {{to begin the}} {{mechanical}} release of the cells.

The apical junctions which bind PMCs to their neighboring epithelial cells become disrupted during this transition, and are absent in cells that have fully ingressed into the blastocoel. Because staining for cadherins and catenins in ingressing cells decreases and develops as intracellular accumulations, apical junctions are thought to be cleared by endocytosis during ingression.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>hyaline</b> <b>layer</b> is {{responsible}} for the adhesion and proper orientation if the cells of an embryo. Throughout development, certain cells change their binding affinity towards hyalin. Hyalin helps cells differentiate into the animal and the vegetal halves during oogenesis by utilizing zinc and lithium ions. Zinc enhances the amount of hyalin precipitated, while lithium keeps the hyalin solubilized when around calcium. Zinc, then, causes an animalizing effect since the binding of the blastula cells would be stronger, while the weaker attachment of the cells would form the vegetal half. Cells can further differentiate if they gain an affinity towards other membranes. Invagination of the blastula occurs when the endoderm loses its affinity towards hyalin, while the ectoderm retains it. [...] This leads to the keystone shape of the gastrula, with the different layers forming into separate biological systems.|$|E
50|$|While the {{mechanisms}} of ingression are not fully understood, studies using the sea urchin as a model organism have begun {{to shed light on}} this developmental process, and will be the focus here. There are three main changes that must occur within a cell to enable the process of ingression. The ingressing PMCs must first alter their affinity for the neighboring epithelial cells that will remain in the vegetal plate (vertebrate PMCs ingress from the primitive streak). During this time, these cells must lose their affinity for the <b>hyaline</b> <b>layer</b> to which their apical surface is attached. The ingressing cells will then apically constrict and alter their cellular architecture through a dramatic reorganization of their cytoskeleton. Lastly, these cells will modify their mode of motility and presumably gain affinity for the basal lamina which composes the lining of the blastocoel, the future migration substrate of the PMCs,.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The mandibular {{condylar}} {{surface is}} made up of four layers, i. e., an external layer composed of dense connective tissue, followed by a layer of undifferentiated cells, hyaline cartilage and bone. Few studies have demonstrated the behavior of the condylar cartilage when the mandible is positioned posteriorly, as in treatments for correcting functional Class III malocclusion. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the morphologic and histological aspects of rat condyles in response to posterior positioning of the mandible. METHODS: Thirty five-week-old male Wistar rats were selected and randomly divided into two groups: A control group (C) and an experimental group (E) which received devices for inducing mandibular retrusion. The animals were euthanized at time intervals of 7, 21 and 30 days after the experiment had began. For histological analysis, total condylar thickness was measured, including the proliferative, <b>hyaline</b> and hypertrophic <b>layers,</b> as well as each layer separately, totaling 30 measurements for each parameter of each animal. RESULTS: The greatest difference in cartilage thickness was observed in 21 days, although different levels were observed in the other periods. Group E showed an increase of 39. 46 % in the total layer, reflected by increases in the thickness of the hypertrophic (42. 24 %), hyaline (46. 92 %) and proliferative (17. 70 %) layers. CONCLUSIONS: Posteriorly repositioning the mandible produced a series of histological and morphological responses in the condyle, suggesting condylar and mandibular adaptation in rats...|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} this {{research}} may be summarized as follows : 1) Connective tissue fibers appearing in the above described 6 groups of structures of pig ovaries were observed {{with the use of}} GOMORI's silver impregnation method. 2) Normal vesicular follicles were divided into 2 types. 3) Normal vesicular follicles in the process of maturation could not be distinguished by the findings of silver preparations : fibrous elements are not found in the granulosa layer. The theca interna consists of only argyrophil fibers, which form a meshwork. The theca externa is composed of collagenous fibers, which run to parallel to the follicle wall and do not tend to form a meshwork. 4) In mature follicles and in just before ovulation the behavior of the connective tissue fibers in the walls {{is similar to that of}} follicles in maturating process. But in these follicles small masses of similar networks to these in the theca interna protrude from the inner side of the theca interna into the granulosa layer, showing plica-like configuration. 5) Cystic atretic follicles were divided into 9 types. 6) At the earliest stage of the regressive process the behavior of connective tissue fibers is almost like that in normal vesicular follicles. At the more advanced and the middle stages in a meshwork of argyrophil fibers of theca interna, collagenous fibers appear and increase gradually. Then after the appearance and gradual development of the yellow body-like tissues in the periphery of the follicle cavity, fine argyrophil fibers penetrate into these tissues from the theca interna, and gradually form a fine meshwork. Accompanied by the appearance and increasing of <b>hyaline</b> <b>layers</b> in the inner side of the theca interna, fine granular substances come into sight and increase in quantity. Moreover, with the appearance of radial layers in the outer wall of atretic follicles, collagenous fibers of these parts increase and form large networks in radial arrangement. At the last stage, in the scar tissue, the small zigzag folds composed of fine granular substances are found in parts corresponding to so-called glass membrane. In the outer side of this scar, radially arranged networks begin to decrease and argyrophil fibers which filled out the original follicle cavity show gradual transformation into collagenous fibers. 7) In this research there were found some follicles which were recognized to be undergoing change into the regressive process after maturation. 8) Atretic follicles with hemorrhage were divided into 4 types in this research. 9) In this research these follicles at the early stage of regression were found to be similar to the normal vesicular follicles, and those at the last stage were also like in character to the last stage of cystic atretic follicles. At the middle stage, however, slight differences were found in the connective tissue fibers of the wall, in spite of the active penetrating and increasing of the argyrophil fibers into the follicle cavity. 10) Corpora lutea of non-pregnancy were divided into 9 types. 11) At the vascularization stage fine argyrophil fibers penetrate actively from theca lutein cell layers into granulosa lutein cell layers, and form networks enclosing 2 or more granulosa lutein cells in one of the same networks. At the bloom stage these fibers encircle completely each lutein cell. At the earliest stage of regression the condition of argyrophil fibers is similar to that of the bloom stage. But at a later stage collagenous fibers appear and increase gradually around lutein cells contrary to the diminishing of argyrophil fibers. And fine pale purple fibers or fine pale purple granular structures come into sight and develop gradually in the parts which are undergoing hyaline degeneration. At the last stage the whole wall of a corpus luteum becomes occupied by fine pale purple granular substances, in which a few broken argyrophil and swollen collagenous fibers are scattered. 12) On the derivation of lutein cells, the present writer in this research has confirmed definitely the dualistic theory of CORNER. 13) Corpora lutea of non-pregnancy with a large central cavity were divided into 6 types. 14) In this research the behavior of the connective tissue fibers in the wall was found to be similar to that of corpora lutea of non-pregnancy. 15) "Vascular bodies" were divided into 3 types. 16) In the regressive process the connective tissue fibers show similar processes of change as in corpora lutea of non-pregnancy. In this research, however, argyrophil fibers in the wall of blood vessels, especially arterioles are maintained in the far advanced stage, showing the characteristics of the present writer's so-called "vascular bodies. " The writer wishes to express his gratitude to Prof. K. TAKAHATA, the chief of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy, for his kind instructions and reviews. Further he would like to express his cordial thanks to the members of the staff of the Department who assisted on this research...|$|R
50|$|At the 120- cell stage, the {{sea urchin}} embryo is {{considered}} a blastula because of its developed blastocoel, which every embryonic cell surrounds and touches. Every cell is {{in contact with the}} proteinaceous fluid of the blastocoel on the inside and touches the <b>hyaline</b> <b>layer</b> on the outside. The loosely connected blastomeres are now tightly connected because of tight junctions that create a seamless epithelium that completely encircles the blastocoel. Even as the blastomeres continue to divide, the blastula remains one-cell thick and thins out as the embryo expands outward. This is accomplished in part due to the influx of water that expands the blastocoel and pushes the cells surrounding it outwards. At this point, the cells have become specified and are ciliated {{on the opposite side of}} the blastocoel. The vegetal plate and animal hemisphere develop and secrete a hatching enzyme that digests the fertilization envelope and allows the embryo to now become a free-swimming hatched blastula.|$|E
