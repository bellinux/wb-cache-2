500|$|Oxford coach Sean Bowden said [...] "We {{had a good}} {{race and}} made all the right moves to Hammersmith, but we couldn't quite shake them off and didn't quite have enough lead to defend", while Cambridge's number six Kieran West said [...] "Credit to Oxford. They threw {{everything}} they had at us, but we absorbed it all." [...] Cambridge head coach Duncan Holland praised his cox: [...] "Rebecca was magnificent. She steered a superb course. She steered <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> thought she should steer and she stayed calm, it was great." [...] Dowbiggin herself recounted: [...] "The guys asked me to be very calm, very relaxed, not to panic, even if Oxford were pushing and moving, I was just like 'okay, they're pushing, they're moving, but we're going to do this'." [...] Bowden criticised the umpire who he claimed [...] "pushed us too tight round the bend. From Hammersmith Bridge on that took away our advantage." [...] Cambridge's Tom James was finally successful, winning the Boat Race at his fourth attempt: [...] "I really couldn't think about losing this race. [...] Oxford really hounded us. The line was getting closer but never quickly enough." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} random recursive trees, where deterministically weights {{are attached}} to the edges according to the labeling of the trees. We will give a bijection between recursive trees and permutations, which relates the arising edge-weights in recursive trees with inversions of the corresponding permutations. Using this bijection we obtain exact and limiting distribution results for the number of permutations of size n, <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> m elements have j inversions. Furthermore we analyze the distribution of the sum of labels of the elements, which have <b>exactly</b> j inversions, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can identify Dickman's infinitely divisible distribution as the limit law. Moreover we give a distributional analysis of weighted depths and weighted distances in edge-weighted recursive trees...|$|R

2500|$|Spacey called Netflix's {{model of}} {{publishing}} all episodes {{at once a}} [...] "new perspective." [...] He added that Netflix's commitment to two full seasons gave the series greater continuity. [...] "We know <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are going," [...] he said. In {{a speech at the}} Edinburgh International Television Festival, he also noted that while other networks were interested in the show, they all wanted a pilot, whereas Netflix – relying solely on their statistics – ordered the series directly. In January 2016, show creator, executive producer and showrunner Beau Willimon's departure following season 4 was announced.|$|E
2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what they want us to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E

40|$|We obtain general {{results on}} the {{dynamics}} of <b>exactly</b> conical geometries, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> use the notion of boundaries at infinity to characterize asymptotic behavior. As we demonstrate in examples, these notions also apply to smooth geometries that are merely asymptotically conical, such as the Eguchi-Hanson or resolved conifold geometries. In these cases we obtain a rather complete qualitative understanding of the varieties of asymptotic behavior, and we probe the connectivity of the phase space by finding infinitely large families of multiple geodesics connecting a point on the infinite past boundary with {{a point in the}} infinite future boundary.

2500|$|FOX {{attempted}} to increase {{word of mouth}} advertising for the film by showing a sneak preview on June 19, 2010; the Los Angeles Times reported {{the same day that}} pre-release surveys determined that the film was likely to become a commercial flop. Projections indicated that the film would only make $20 million at the box office; the film cost $125 million to produce. FOX production President Emma Watts commented of the film's commercial prospects, [...] "We aren't <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> hoped we would be." [...] Los Angeles Times noted, [...] "In addition, Cruise and Diaz are not as popular with younger moviegoers, who often drive big opening weekends in the summer. ... Among teenage and college-age males, the movie is barely registering, according to people who have seen the survey results." [...] New York Magazine reported the film was [...] "tracking miserably" [...] prior to its first week. New York Magazine reported that an issue with Knight and Day was, [...] "one of the film's biggest handicaps: its star, Tom Cruise". A FOX official commented to New York Magazine regarding the film's pre-release polling data, [...] "at those numbers, we can’t open the movie right now. Hopefully, they’ll change in the next few days." ...|$|E

2500|$|With a {{small band}} of between eight and twenty paratroopers of the 505th, Gavin began to march toward the sound of the guns. “He had no idea where his {{regiment}} was and only a vague idea as to <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> he was. <b>We</b> walked all night,” said Major Vandervoort. The paratroopers did not pose a real threat as a fighting force, but their guerilla tactics were nevertheless very effective. They aggressively took on enemy forces, leaving the impression of a much larger force. At one point on the morning of July 10, Gavin’s tiny band encountered a 35-man Italian anti-paratroop patrol. An intense firefight ensued, and the Italians were driven back. Several paratroopers were wounded before Gavin and his men were able to gradually disengage. Gavin was the last man to withdraw. “We were sweaty, tired and distressed at having to leave [...] wounded behind,” said Vandervoort. “The colonel looked over his paltry six-man command and said, ‘This is a hell of a place for a regimental commander to be.’” ...|$|R

"Now, mother," [...] said Margery, {{when the}} two were alone together, [...] "you have seen him and you have talked to him, and Uncle Hector has told you how {{he went to the}} office of Glassborough & Clyde and found he was really their nephew, and all about him and his family; and you have been told {{precisely}} why it was necessary that we should engage ourselves so abruptly on account of the violent nature of Mr. Raybold and the trouble he might cause, not only to us, but to dear Aunt Harriet and Uncle Archibald.

40|$|<b>Where</b> <b>exactly</b> should <b>we</b> {{draw the}} line between {{determination}} and predication? In order to answer that question, {{the first part of}} this paper starts from word categories, defined thanks to the notions of immediate and mediate extension (noun, adjective, verb, connective), and proceeds to functions defined thanks to the notions of internal and external incidence (determinative, completive, predicative, operative). After listing several cases of illicit encroachment of complementation or predication on determination (the postmodifiers and the 'false' appositions le roi Louis XIV or la ville de Paris), the second part is devoted to the conditions under which the transfer of an apposition-outside the affixed noun phrase-to a qualification within the phrase can or could happen. The conclusion asks for a greater recognition of second predication, that has probably not been exhausted by French grammar. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
