60|$|I {{recognized}} the old picture in a moment--the Saviour with bowed head {{seated at the}} centre of a long, rough table with scattering fruits and dishes upon it, and six disciples on either side in their long robes, talking to each other--the picture from which all engravings and all copies have been made for three centuries. Perhaps no living man has ever known an attempt to paint the Lord's Supper <b>differently.</b> <b>The</b> <b>world</b> seems to have become settled in the belief, long ago, {{that it is not}} possible for human genius to outdo this creation of da Vinci's. I suppose painters will go on copying it as long as any of the original is left visible to the eye. There were a dozen easels in the room, and as many artists transferring the great picture to their canvases. Fifty proofs of steel engravings and lithographs were scattered around, too. And as usual, I could not help noticing how superior the copies were to the original, that is, to my inexperienced eye. Wherever you find a Raphael, a Rubens, a Michelangelo, a Carracci, or a da Vinci (and we see them every day,) you find artists copying them, and the copies are always the handsomest. Maybe the originals were handsome when they were new, but they are not now.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to engage a {{different}} notion of feminism in accounting by addressing the issues of feminism, balance, and integration as a means of understanding <b>differently</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for which one accounts. The ideas are communicated by the sharing of experiences through myth and storytelling. Design/methodology/approach – An alternative lens for understanding the giving of accounts is proposed, drawing on earlier feminist accounting literature as well as storytelling and myth. Findings – Including the subjective and intersubjective approaches to experiencing and understanding the world recommends an approach whereby both the feminine-intuitive and the masculine-rational processes are integrated in constructing decision models and accounts. Research limitations/implications – Through an expanded view of values that can be included in reporting or recounting a different model is seen, and different decisions are enabled. The primary limitation is having to use words to convey one's subjective and intersubjective understandings. The written medium is not the most natural language for such an undertaking. Practical implications – By enabling the inclusion of more feminine values, a way is opened to engage more holistically with the society in which decisions are embedded. Originality/value – Drawing on the storytelling tradition, a holistic model is suggested that can lead to emergence of a more balanced societal reporting.

40|$|Tourism can {{be defined}} <b>differently.</b> <b>The</b> <b>World</b> Tourist Organization defines tourism as {{activities}} of people who "travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes {{not related to the}} exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited". Tourism in Poland dates back to the beginnings of the previous millennium. One of the earliest and well documented tourist trips in Poland was that made by Beata Łaska with her servants to the Tatra Mountains in 1563. The first rafting on the Dunajec River was organized in 1839. The foundations for the Polish tourism were laid by many persons, representatives of different social groups, among them Stanisław Staszic, Mieczysław Karłowicz, Tytus Chałubiński, Wincenty Pol, Oskar Kolberg, Stefan Żeromski. Towarzystwo Tatrzańskie (The Tatra Society), established in 1873 (1872 ?) is considered the first Polish tourist and sight-seeing organization. In the following years many tourist organizations were founded in different regions of Poland, among them the Polskie Towarzystwo Krajoznawcze (The Polish Sight-Seeing Society), Akademicki Klub Turystyczny (Academic Tourist Club), Poznańskie Towarzystwo Turystyczne (Poznań Tourist Society), Liga Popierania Turystyki (Tourist Support League). The largest tourist organization in Poland is Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze (The Polish Tourist and Sight-Seeing Society), which was reestablished in 1950. Its main mission is promotion of tourism and sight-seeing, expression of love for one's home country through trips and travels around it, protection of historical monuments and nature (Photo 1 - 3). There were many organizations and enterprises, which organized tourist, activities as part of their regular operations.

50|$|The {{concept of}} the borough has been used {{repeatedly}} (and often <b>differently)</b> throughout <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Often, a borough is a single town with its own local government. However, in some cities it is a subdivision of the city (for example, New York City, London, and Montreal). In such cases, the borough will normally have either limited powers delegated to it by the city's local government, or no powers at all. In other places, such as the U.S. state of Alaska, borough designates a whole region; Alaska's largest borough, the North Slope Borough, is comparable in area to the entire United Kingdom, although its population is {{less than that of}} Swanage on England's south coast with around 9,600 inhabitants.

Furthermore, in recent times, supermax prisons have been created where the custody level goes beyond maximum security for people such as terrorists or political prisoners deemed a threat to national security, and inmates from other prisons who have a history of violent or other disruptive behavior in prison or are suspected of gang affiliation. These inmates have individual cells and are kept in lockdown, often for more than 23 hours per day. Meals are served through [...] "chuck holes" [...] in the cell door, and each inmate is allotted one hour of outdoor exercise per day, alone.

In this system homogeneous agents have the same structure and domain but act and are situated <b>differently</b> in <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Lack of information about each other’s internal state and observation inputs may lead to non-desirable prediction in planning and control, since {{they may not be}} able to predict <b>the</b> <b>world</b> change. To cope with missing knowledge, agents simulate each other’s behavior as part of environment dynamic and build their own policy based on the local data from the simulation episodes. Reinforcement learning method is applied to derive the policy of future actions, where agents compute and update the result repeatedly towards the goal. The Monte Carlo approach is used in solving the reinforcement problem from simulated experiences. Since each agent learns to adapt it’s policy to environment changes, the global picture is supposed to appear as multiagent coordination. Multiple vehicles domain, where there is no communication among the vehicles and sensing of vehicle is limited, is considered under simulation model. I...|$|R
40|$|Symmetry is a {{fundamental}} concept {{which can be found}} in the whole range of human activities e. g. from arts to science. The beauty of a statues is often related to its symmetric form. In physics, all the laws are related to some sort of symmetry. Equally important is a small breakdown ofsymmetry. Even for the case of a statue, its beauty might be enhanced by introducing small distortions. In this course, we investigate the role symmetry in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of elementary particles. Some symmetries found there are very similar to those which can be seen in our daily life, while others are more exotic and related to the quantum nature of the elementary particles. Our particular focus ismade on symmetry and its violation between the matter and anti-matter, known as CP violation. It is experimentally well established that particleand anti-particle behave a tiny bit <b>differently</b> in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of elementary particles. We discuss how this would be explained and how we can extendour knowledge. Evolution of our universe is strongly influenced by CP violation. So far, we see anti matter in our universe.

This paper explores the potential well-being benefits of participating in this practice, examining the different social and creative ways in which participants use it. We interviewed sixteen people who currently participate in photo-a-day projects, and identified with the concept that participation in these projects had positive wellbeing benefits. Data were analysed using a grounded and iterative approach. Analysis focused on how participants derived well-being benefits in photo-a-day projects. Photo-a-day projects enabled participants to look <b>differently</b> at <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> There was something satisfying to participants about noticing <b>the</b> <b>world</b> around them more, perhaps giving {{a sense of being}} more alive because they were more aware. The negative impacts on well-being mainly centred around the rules and constraints of the projects, including feeling obliged to respond to comments.
