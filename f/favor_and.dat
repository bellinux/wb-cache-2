Soon after, Street shuttered the Western World and moved to Illinois.|$|E

He first achieved notoriety on April 1, 1986, when he sued the village of Zion, Illinois for displaying a Christian cross on a water tower, {{as well as other}} property. The case eventually went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992, which ruled in Sherman's <b>favor</b> <b>and</b> ordered municipalities to drop the use of religious symbols.|$|E

5|$|The King County Superior Court {{ruled in}} April that the {{university}} was exempt from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance and could go ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a stay that would leave them responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, who ruled in the city's <b>favor,</b> <b>and</b> rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.|$|E

5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of <b>favor</b> <b>and</b> he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's <b>favor,</b> <b>and</b> {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them to take credit.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arafat {{left the}} University and, {{along with other}} Arabs, sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces {{fighting}} against Israeli troops {{and the creation of}} the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's <b>favor,</b> <b>and</b> Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 President Ulysses S. Grant {{appointed}} Harrison {{to represent}} {{the federal government in}} a civil suit filed by Lambdin P.

The civil case was referred to the U.S. Circuit Court for Indiana at Indianapolis, where it evolved into Milligan v. Hovey. Although the jury rendered a verdict in Milligan's <b>favor</b> <b>and</b> he had sought {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in damages, state and federal statutes limited the amount the federal government had to award to Milligan to five dollars plus court costs.|$|E
5|$|Kilmer is {{considered}} among {{the last of the}} Romantic era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional in style and does not break any of the formal rules of poetics—a style often criticized today for being too sentimental to be taken seriously. The entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of <b>favor</b> <b>and</b> Modernism took root—especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse.|$|E

5|$|Li Yuan, {{known as}} Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, {{when he was}} forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin. Li Shimin had {{commanded}} troops {{since the age of}} 18, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges. Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621. In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626. Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his <b>favor</b> <b>and</b> Li Shimin ascended the throne. He is conventionally known by his temple name Taizong.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the Horns of Hattin, {{near the}} village of Hattin. For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern {{weaponry}} at the Ottoman military's disposal. Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's <b>favor</b> <b>and</b> a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds. As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.|$|E
