5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, {{but as soon as the}} <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{three types}} of clouds: white clouds, which follow the avatar; gray, neutral clouds, which become white when touched; and black clouds, which may be combined with white clouds to cause rain, dissolving both clouds. A large number of white clouds more easily dissolves {{a small number of}} <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> than an equal number, and vice versa. White clouds stop following the avatar if the player moves too quickly and they resume following if approached again. Each of the four missions in Cloud has a different objective, including forming patterns in the sky with clouds, eliminating black clouds, and creating rain over each of the islands.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> {{appeared}} in many Westerns and other films during the 1910s. He moved with Griffith's company to the West Coast in 1912, eventually appearing {{in at least}} 34 silent movies in a brief film career of only 8 years, cut short by the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. [...] He was sometimes billed as Chief <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> or as William <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud.</b> After Remington's death, <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> collaborated on making a 1917 Francis Ford movie, based on John Ermine of Yellowstone, in which [...] "John Darkcloud" [...] appeared as Fire Bear.|$|R
40|$|Carbon recombination-line {{emission}} {{has been}} detected at two frequencies from a <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> contiguous {{with the small}} H II region Sharpless 140. The observations show the <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> to be of unusually low temperature {{and to have a}} markedly inhomogeneous density distribution, with localized region of high density surrounding one or more embedded stars. The carbon is probably ionized by photons from both the exciting star of S 140 and the embedded stars. The <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> and S 140 apparently represent two stages of star formation which have occurred over a period of at least 500, 000 years in adjacent regions of the same <b>dark</b> <b>cloud...</b>|$|R
25|$|As in <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud,</b> weapons {{wear out}} over time, {{and it is}} {{necessary}} to repair them in order to avoid them breaking and becoming unusable. However, unlike in <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud,</b> when a weapon is broken it does not disappear from the players' inventory. Instead it becomes unusable until repaired, and some of the ABS it has accrued are lost. Also carried over from <b>Dark</b> <b>Cloud</b> is that characters themselves can only grow stronger with the consumption of particular items, which can increase their health points and defense.|$|R
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. The session was held in dry weather conditions but <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> meant that there was a risk of further rain showers. With limited dry running in the final practice session grip, levels rose as qualifying progressed.|$|E
5|$|Upon Bradman's dismissal, <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> {{began to}} close in on the ground, and rain {{appeared}} to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the square cut. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.|$|E

5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E
5|$|During England’s second innings, Joe Hardstaff, Jr. {{fell for}} 43, lofting Ernie Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side to end a {{partnership}} of 93 with Denis Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Australia eventually finished off the hosts for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon. Australia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell. Bradman came in and was out for a duck. This left Australia at 2/48, at which point <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> began to close in on the ground, and it appeared that rain might save England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. The tourists reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary, but ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing that the match was over. He returned to the field when he noticed the crowd reaction; Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit.|$|E

40|$|Five-band {{ultraviolet}} spectrophotometry {{has been}} carried out for 54 stars in the upper Scorpius complex. Of these, 14 stars in the rho Ophiuchi <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> and 13 in the surrounding area are found to be free of spectral peculiarities and contamination by scattered light from nearby bright stars. The <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> stars give extinction curves which are significantly lower than the average extinction curves derived by other investigators and also those observed for localized regions such as the area around Cygnus X- 1 and the Cepheus OB III cluster. This implies that the dust in the upper Scorpius region, especially that in the rho Ophiuchi <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> has larger average size than the normal interstellar medium. R, the ratio of total-to-selective extinction, is found to be 4. 2. The effects of a lower extinction curve on the chemistry of a <b>dark</b> <b>cloud</b> is also briefly discussed...|$|R

5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E
5|$|England were {{eventually}} out for 441 {{on the final}} day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his square cut. The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{ball was}} due {{soon after the}} start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.|$|E

25|$|By {{balancing}} and {{stimulated emission}} with spontaneous emission, {{it is possible}} to construct a relation between excitation temperature and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to <b>dark</b> <b>clouds,</b> regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in <b>dark</b> <b>clouds</b> show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 104 and 105 cm−3 in <b>dark</b> <b>clouds.</b> Mapping of NH3 gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 pc and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.|$|E

25|$|Many {{factors may}} disrupt the {{equilibrium}} {{of a giant}} molecular cloud, triggering a collapse and initiating the burst of star formation that can result in an open cluster. These include shock waves from a nearby supernova, collisions with other clouds, or gravitational interactions. Even without external triggers, regions of the cloud can reach conditions where they become unstable against collapse. The collapsing cloud region will undergo hierarchical fragmentation into ever smaller clumps, including a particularly dense form known as infrared <b>dark</b> <b>clouds,</b> eventually leading {{to the formation of}} up to several thousand stars. This star formation begins enshrouded in the collapsing cloud, blocking the protostars from sight but allowing infrared observation. In the Milky Way galaxy, the formation rate of open clusters is estimated to be one every few thousand years.|$|E
