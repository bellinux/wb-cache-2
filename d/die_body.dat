60|$|Now let us {{turn our}} horse into a man, His rider to a spirit, if we can. Then let us, by {{the methods of}} the guider, Tell every horse how he should know his rider. Some go, as men, direct in a right way, Nor are they {{suffered}} to go astray; As with a bridle they are governed, And kept from paths which lead unto the dead. Now this good man has his especial guider, Then by his going let him know his rider. Some go as {{if they did not}} greatly care, Whether of heaven or hell they should be heir. The rein, it seems, is laid upon their neck, They seem to go their way without a check. Now this man too has his especial guider, And by his going he may know his rider. Some again run as if resolved to <b>die,</b> <b>Body</b> and soul, to all eternity. Good counsel they by no means can abide; They'll have their course whatever them betide. Now these poor men have their especial guider, Were they not fools they soon might know their rider. There's one makes head against all godliness, Those too, that do profess it, he'll distress; He'll taunt and flout if goodness doth appear, And at its countenancers mock and jeer. Now this man, too, has his especial guider, And by his going he might know his rider.|$|E

40|$|In {{contemporary}} Western culture, {{death is}} often made separate from life. The <b>dying</b> <b>body</b> is rendered invisible, even though sociocultural performances of death foreshadow and signify death and dying. This article challenges this signifying {{by arguing that}} death and dying are constituted performatively through the inscriptive surfaces of living, <b>dying,</b> and dead <b>bodies,</b> rendered visible by breath and breathing. The article begins by reflecting {{on the experience of}} witnessing the author's mentor's dying breath. Thinking through the dying breath, it then questions to what extent the separation of death from life is maintained by what is unspoken of the <b>dying</b> and dead <b>body.</b> Finally, the article considers the analytical implications of the argument for those who remain behind to grieve for, and remember, the <b>dying</b> <b>bodies,</b> and those to whom those bodies once belongedKatrina Jaworsk...|$|R

40|$|Pultrusion is a {{composite}} manufacturing process in which fibers are pulled continuously through a resin bath for resin impregnation before entering into a heated die, where an exothermic cure reaction occurs. The energy needed to provide the cure reaction depends on many aspects such as cure kinetics and pulling speed. Generally, the pultrusion forming is divided in heat zones that can be heated at different temperature levels. The temperature distribution on the die surface can greatly affect material quality and energy cost. In the present work, through a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) algorithm, {{it was possible to}} verify that the energy requirements can be reduced by changing the heating configuration of the pultrusion die. For this, an alternative configuration with internal heaters inside the <b>die</b> <b>body</b> was simulated. The heating rate was considered as the objective function. For the optimization study, we used a stochastic algorithm, the so-called particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results showed that the energy spent to cure the resin-fiber system can be reduced considerably...|$|E
40|$|Fragrances {{have been}} used since at least 5000 years ago and all {{traditional}} scents are found in modern perfumes. Although perfumes are obviously involved in sexual communication, the significance of great individual differences in preference for fragrances is an evolutionary puzzle. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic and conserved set of genes that {{plays an important role}} in immune function in vertebrates. Both mice and humans have been shown to prefer <b>die</b> <b>body</b> odor of potential partners that have a dissimilar MHC genotype, which would result in heterozygous offspring. We tested whether individual preferences for perfume ingredients correlate with a person's MHC genotype. The human MHC is called HLA (human leukocyte antigen). A total of 137 male and female students who had been typed for their MHC (HLA-A, -B, -DR) scored 36 scents in a first test for use on self ("Would your like to smell like that yourself?") and a subset of 18 scents 2 years later either for use on self or for a potential partner ("Would you like your partner to smell like that?"). An overall analysis showed a significant correlation between the MHC and the scorings of the scents "for self" in both tests. In a detailed analysis we found a significant interaction of the two most common HLAs with the rating of the 36 scents in the first study as well as with the 18 scents in the second study when evaluated for self. This result suggests that persons who share, for example, HLA-A 2, have a similar preference for any of the perfume ingredients. The significant repeatability of these preferences in the two tests showed that the volunteers that had either HLA-A 1 or HLA-A 2 were significantly consistent in their preferences for the perfume ingredients offered. Hardly any significant correlation between MHC genotype and ratings of the scents "for partner" were found. This agrees with the hypothesis that perfumes are selected "for self" to amplify in some wall body odors that reveal a person's immunogenetic...|$|E

40|$|A coating die is {{used for}} distributing liquid in order to apply a uniform film on a solid surface. The fluid flowing through the die cavity can exert a {{pressure}} of up to 500, 000 Pascal on the <b>die</b> <b>body.</b> This liquid pressure can distort the die and lead to a non-uniform slot opening, which in turn causes non-uniformity in the coating thickness. Distortion of the die can also occur during non-isothermal operation of the die; this is an undesired consequence of delivering liquids at a different temperature than the die itself. The distortions undergone by the die both due to liquid pressure and non-isothermal conditions should be within the manufacturing tolerances for the slot heights {{in order to maintain}} uniformity in the coating. The deformation exhibited by a coating die due to pressure loadings is modeled both two-dimensionally and three-dimensionally. A two-dimensional model has lower computational load and is preferred for die design. For the two-dimensional analysis of a coating die, the finite element method is used to determine the deflections due to pressure loadings with a focus on slot heights. A model of low computational load is also developed based on beam theory, and its results are compared with those of the two-dimensional finite element analyses predictions. The beam model is incorporated in a die design and simulation program in which flow and slot deformations are coupled. Two-dimensional finite element analyses due to non-isothermal conditions are also performed on the coating die to give an estimate of the die deflection due to temperature variations within the die. A three-dimensional coating die with varying inner cavity area is modeled and analyzed to check its predictions with those of the two-dimensional finite element analyses and beam theory results. In the literature reviewed, flow distribution is fully coupled to die deformation only for extrusion dies. Extrusion dies are used for extruding melted polymers of very high viscosity. Therefore, the deflections are much larger for extrusion dies than for coating dies. Mechanical adjustments can be used to manage the large deflections in the case of extrusion dies whereas coating dies have to be designed for small deflections comparable to manufacturing tolerances. This is the first time where a coupled analysis has been done for a coating die. This research provides the slot deflections for a coating die subjected to pressure loadings that vary throughout the die length. The model of flow distribution coupled with die distortion incurs low computational load and is intended for use in design and simulation programs. Die design guidelines are developed based on examination of the die dimensions and flow parameters having the greatest effect on slot deflections...|$|E
