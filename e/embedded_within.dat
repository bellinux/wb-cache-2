5|$|Alex {{turned to}} the east-northeast after passing the Outer Banks in {{response}} to becoming <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> the west-southwesterly flow. The hurricane briefly weakened to a Category1, but restrengthened due to warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Water temperatures remained 3.6 °F (2 °C) above normal, resulting in Alex intensifying into a 120mph (195km/h) major hurricane on August 5 while located 450miles (710km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Due to low vertical shear and favorable conditions, Alex remained a Category3 hurricane until passing over cooler waters late on the 5th while 290miles (465km) south of Newfoundland. Alex rapidly weakened, degrading into tropical storm status on August 6. Later on the 6th, Alex became extratropical while 950miles (1530km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and lost its identity shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|By midday on September24, {{the system}} became <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> the {{mid-latitude}} westerlies and rapidly accelerated towards the northeast. The National Hurricane Center anticipated that Emily would undergo an extratropical transition within 24hours {{at this point}} as they forecast it to merge with the frontal system to the northeast. However, the storm unexpectedly underwent a second phase of rapid intensification on September25, at one point reaching the rate of explosive intensification with the central pressure decreasing at 2.5mbar per hour. By 0600UTC, Emily had re-attained hurricane intensity and at 1145UTC, the center passed directly over Bermuda with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Soon after, the storm reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum pressure of 974mbar (hPa; 28.76inHg).|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of June22, {{satellite}} imagery indicated {{the formation of an}} eyewall; by this time Andres was near hurricane-status. Early the next day, the center of circulation became <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> a central dense overcast and Andres intensified into a hurricane, the first of the season, around 0600UTC. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mbar (hPa; 29.06inHg); the storm was located roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas upon attaining this intensity. Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane, most of the deep convection associated with the storm had weakened; however, Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75mph (120km/h) winds despite the ragged appearance of Andres.|$|E
5|$|Development of Igor quickly ceased once it {{was named}} as a nearby {{disturbance}} produced moderate wind shear over the storm, displacing convection from its center. <b>Embedded</b> <b>within</b> a monsoon trough over the eastern Atlantic, the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on September9. Intensification resumed the following day once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of Igor; it would remain so throughout {{the remainder of the}} cyclone's existence. Contrary to its earlier movement, the storm's forward motion markedly increased. Following the development of an intermittent eye feature and steady convection around its center, Igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000UTC on September12.|$|E

5|$|Early on September 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection roughly 1,100km (700mi) east of Guam. A broad, low-level circulation center {{had formed}} within the system and became increasingly organized, showing signs of developing convective banding. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released later that day as convection was rapidly consolidating around the low, which was <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> {{the eastern end of}} the monsoonal trough. It was then declared as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC with the latter designating it as Tropical Depression 15W The tropical depression was tracking westward along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge situated east of the international dateline.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of its duration, Agatha steered toward the north while <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> a deep southerly flow. Steady {{intensification}} continued, and the storm reached winds of 50 mph (90 km/h) six hours after being upgraded as it neared the coast of Mexico. By the afternoon of June 2, the center exhibited an elongated appearance within its associated central dense overcast, a large area of organized mid-tropospheric convection. Around 1800 UTC that same day, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August18. Shortly after, the system became <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> the Intertropical Convergence Zone and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By August23, the system began to intensify while convective activity become consolidated around the center of circulation. By 0600UTC on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Eight roughly 965miles (1,555km) east of Barbados. A weak ridge of high pressure {{to the north of}} the depression led to a general westward movement of the system. Gradually strengthening, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm early on August25, at which time it was given the name Gustav.|$|E

That afternoon, Celia degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system; operationally, the system was monitored as a tropical depression for an additional six hours before the final advisory from the NHC was issued.

40|$|AbstractWe adapt Kahn-style (“big-step”) natural {{semantics}} {{to take on}} desirable {{aspects of}} small-step and denotational semantics forms, more precisely: (i) the ability to express divergent computations; (ii) the ability to reason about the (length of a) computation of a derivation; and (Hi) the ability to compute upon and reason about higher-order values. To accomplish these results, we extend the classical, inductive interpretation of natural semantics with coinduction mechanisms and use “negative” rules to express divergence. A simple reformatting of the syntax of derivations allows a simple description of the “length” of a derivation. Finally, the receding of closure values into denotational-semantics-like functions lets one <b>embed</b> derivations <b>within</b> closures that <b>embed</b> <b>within</b> derivations; in this sense, the semantics becomes “higher order. ” Examples are given to support the definitional developments...|$|R
5|$|Late on September26, shear {{began to}} relax and deep {{convection}} redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase. Several hours later, the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough. By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained winds up to 70mph (110km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200UTC on September27 while located about 345mi (555km) west of Bermuda. Upon attaining this intensity, the storm became <b>embedded</b> <b>within</b> an area strong, divergent, upper-level winds. Increasing in forward motion, the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge of the deep convection.|$|E
5|$|Moving very little, the {{depression}} was disorganized due to continued shear, leaving {{the center of}} circulation west of the convective activity. By later in the morning hours of May27, the system began to show overall signs of organization, primarily related to a burst of convection in the eastern semicircle. At the same time, the center of circulation either reformed or began to move farther north, possibly north-northeast. <b>Embedded</b> <b>within</b> the steering currents of a ridge, most forecasts anticipated the storm would drift northward for several days, though some computer models predicted the storm would eventually move inland near Acapulco.
