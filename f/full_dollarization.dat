40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract Behind the {{discussion}} on optimal exchange-rate regimes lies {{the need to}} achieve external and internal equilibrium, and thus create an appropriate macroeconomic climate for sustained growth and development. The optimality and feasibility of exchange-rate regimes in individual Latin American and Caribbean countries must take into consideration several parameters linked to microeconomics, open macroeconomics, and political economy aspects. More recently, {{the discussion}} has incorporated the regional dimension {{and the possibility of}} joining monetary unions to the set of feasible national strategies. According to the optimal currency area criteria, the region still does not fit all the traditional conditions, but the empirical evidence presented in the document shows a more promising picture at subregional level. It is also argued that joining a monetary union or an exchange rate coordination mechanism could improve the policy-making process and foster better macroeconomic governance at both national and regional levels. In the authors' view, the optimal exchange-rate regime should be one that truly supports and is supported by the achievement and sustainability of sound and balanced domestic macroeconomic policies in a credible institutional framework. The present inclination in favour of non-cooperative corner solutions, either <b>full</b> <b>dollarization</b> or pure free floating implemented at purely national level, is seen as shortsighted and creates the dangerous illusion of easy solutions. Subregional cooperation offers both an intermediate option and a more coherent reference for the exchange-rate regimes in Latin America and the Caribbean. It provides the missing link for a concrete institutional building process on which macroeconomic sustainability could be founded. The paper presents a cooperative alternative to the national corner solutions of <b>full</b> <b>dollarization</b> or pure free floating. The solution is to create a set of incentives operating in a strong and institutionalised system of checks and balances at the regional level. This cooperative arrangement would bind national policy-making to a greater goal of regional macroeconomic coordination, and avoid that circumstantial problems may affect the long-term goal of good fiscal and monetary management...|$|E
40|$|How Much to Commit to an Exchange Rate Rule? Balancing Credibility and Flexibility There are {{different}} ways in which policy-makers back their commitment to a fixed exchange rate. A regime where countries can devalue unilaterally represents a weaker commitment than one where a devaluation needs to be agreed upon with other parties (e. g. the European monetary system). <b>Full</b> <b>dollarization,</b> understood here as full replacement of the domestic currency by the U. S. dollar, is an extreme commitment to a fixed exchange rate. Indeed, it is a especial case of a fixed exchange rate. The central message of this paper is that the cost of reneging is a key reason holding policymakers back from making strong commitments on their exchange rate policy. The stronger the commitment to an exchange rate rule, the more costly it is to deviate from it. The paper develops a Barro-Gordon type model in which the policymaker has to decide the degree of commitment under uncertainty. It is shown that, even for policy makers that have a strong preference for maintaining the fixed exchange rate, there are circunstances under which they will choose to devalue. This will happen when the economy is hit by an adverse shock and the costs of adhering to the fixed exchange rate are larger than those associated with devaluing. The model provides useful insights to understand why many high inflation economies have not adopted full dollarizarion as a way to stabilize prices. Our emphasis on the cost of reneging stands in contrast with most existing works, which single out the desire to rely on seigniorage as the main motive for stopping short of <b>full</b> <b>dollarization.</b> Strong commitments will only be made once {{there is a good chance}} that the policy maker will not renege, and by then they might not be necessary. We illustrate the main points of the paper with examples from Latin American countries. </p...|$|E

40|$|How does a country’s {{choice of}} {{exchange}} rate regime impact {{its ability to}} borrow from abroad?

We compare a floating regime to <b>full</b> <b>dollarization.</b> We find that dollarization is potentially beneficial, even though it means the loss of the monetary instrument, precisely because this loss can strengthen incentives to maintain access to debt markets. Given stronger repayment incentives, more borrowing can be supported, and thus dollarization can increase international financial integration. This prediction of theory is consistent with the experiences of El Salvador and Ecuador, which recently dollarized, as well as with that of highly-indebted countries like Italy which adopted the Euro as part of Economic and Monetary Union. In each case, spreads on foreign currency government debt declined substantially around the time of regime change. Dollarization...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, many {{emerging}} market countries have suffered severe currency and banking crises.

Other analysts draw a very different lesson from these events.

40|$|With a few exceptions, the {{advantages}} of dollarization have not been discussed in a dynamic general equilibrium framework, especially for partially dollarized economies {{that are supposed to}} be good candidates to follow this kind of regime. After reviewing the arguments for and against dollarization, this paper explores its implications on the volatility of the main macroeconomic variables of an emerging small open economy that faces terms-of-trade shocks. Dynamic equilibrium models are used as laboratories to study these issues and contrast two environments: a partially dollarized economy with flexible exchange rate (calibrated for the Peruvian economy) and a fully dollarized economy. Simulation exercises are performed to analyze in both cases the volatility of key variables such as output, consumption, investment, inflation rate, and fiscal deficit. The conclusions are that <b>full</b> <b>dollarization</b> implies (1) higher real volatility, especially on output and investment; (2) lower inflation volatility; (3) higher fiscal deficit volatility; (4) higher output response to terms-of-trade shocks. Consequently, in this context it is difficult to affirm that dollarization reduces country risk. Finally, the paper points up the role of price stickiness and countercyclical monetary policy in these findings. ...|$|E
40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} author and do not represent those of the Central Bank of Uruguay. Uruguay succeeded in implementing a stabilization plan featured by two economic policy pillars: a gradual reduction of exchange rate devaluation (the nominal anchor) and a time-consistent fiscal discipline (the real anchor). Nevertheless, since the challenge for actual policy making is to consolidate stabilization within a sound fiscal framework, monetary policy must be rethought in this context. From our viewpoint, the best option in Uruguay consist of adopting an inflation targeting approach, which necessarily preserves the exchange rate as the main policy instrument. Some idiosyncratic features of the Uruguayan economy are behind our conclusions: high dollarization, high passthrough between devaluation and inflation, and its particular location between two unstable countries, Brazil and Argentina. On the one hand, the currency substitution process makes interest rate policy very inefficient for stabilization objectives, since monetary and credit channels do not actually work. On the other hand, regional instability introduces high volatility in inflation and activity if Uruguay adopts any hard peg system (currency board or <b>full</b> <b>dollarization)</b> ...|$|E

Dollar-denominated bank loans whose borrowers lacked dollar income increasingly turned non-performing.

40|$|The recent {{debate over}} {{dollarization}} {{has been more}} focused on the motives of the idea than in analyzing the proposal more formally. Here we attempt to prove a very simple point {{that should be considered}} as the hardest lesson ever learnt by emergent economies: no stability is achieved without fiscal sustainability. The purpose of devaluation has been usually {{to find a way to}} finance a deficit. Obviously within a dollarized economy that avenue is closed. Under the assumption that there is a deficit that needs to be financed out, investors will expect some reaction from the government: either lose reserves, increase its debt or print money. Another way to accomplish the objective when all these scapegoats are banned is to confiscate somebody devaluing the domestic currency or defaulting on its external obligations, s the risk posed by the presence of an unexpected deficit would get transfer ed from one sector to another. This paper stress the idea that dollarization is at the very end a fiscal issue, and the results over the economy depends on the existence of the balance sheet effect. These results are: i) when the economy does not face a balanc sheet effect, as de devaluation risk disappears, the country risk goes up, and ii) when the economy face a balance sheet effect, a dollarization could reduce the country risk. The paper shows that those countries that face higher potential bailout cost due either to highly liability dollarized banking systems or firms that face costly balance sheet effects are the ones that the <b>full</b> <b>dollarization</b> proposal seems to have a higher potential benefit as both the country risk and devaluation risk are lower under that scenario. * The authors would like to thank Ernesto Stein and Jorge Streb for very helpful comments, Ricardo Adrogué fro...|$|E
40|$|The authors examine {{possible}} {{monetary policy}} strategies for Latin America {{that may help}} lock in the gains the region attained {{in the fight against}} inflation in the 1990 s. Instead of focusing the debate about the conduct of monetary policy on whether the nominal exchange rate should be fixed or flexible, the focus should be on whether the monetary policy regime appropriately constrains discretion in monetary policymaking. Three basic frameworks deserve serious discussion as possible long-run strategies for monetary policy in Latin America. The authors examine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} a hard exchange-rate peg, monetary targeting, and inflation targeting, in light of monetary policy's recent track record in several Latin American countries, looking for clues about which of the strategies might be best suited to economies in the region. The answer: It depends on the country's institutional environment. Some countries appear not to have the institutions to constrain monetary policy if discretion is allowed. In those countries, there is a strong argument for hard pegs, including <b>full</b> <b>dollarization,</b> that allow little or no discretion to monetary authorities. In countries such as Chile, which can constrain discretion, inflation targeting is likely to produce a monetary policy that keeps inflation low yet appropriately copes with domestic and foreign shocks. Monetary targeting as a strategy for Latin America is not viable because of the likely instability of the relationship between inflation and monetary aggregates, of which there is ample international evidence. No monetary strategy can solve the basic problems that have existed in Latin American economies for a long time. The authors welcome the recent move in Latin American countries toward inflation targeting, but say no policy will succeed unless government policies also create the right institutional environment.

It shows that the Argentine convertibility system was successful as an anti-inflationary program. However, the reduction in the inflation rate has been accompanied by a dramatic change in relative prices of tradable and non tradable goods and services, which have caused serious problems in the international competitiveness of the economy. The dollarization regime in Ecuador did not lead, as in Argentina, to a rapid reduction in the inflation rate (in 2001, CPI may still increase 30 %); if inflationary inertia persists for too long, Ecuador may witness the same deterioration of relative prices between tradable and non tradable products, negatively affecting its external sector. Price stability is not a synonym of economic stability. The convertibility system generated a paradoxical situation, in which the economy is very stable when judged by the stability of the general price level and the exchange rate, but very unstable, if one looks at the growth rates of the economy. This instability relates to external credit cycles and changes in export income which directly affect the monetary base and hence the level domestic credit. Also, the absence of the adjustment in relative prices between tradables and non-tradables, requires that {{in the event of an}} external deficit, the entire burden of adjustment falls on the contraction of the economic activity, since this is the only way to reduce imports. Hard-peg regimes heighten the external sector's influence over the pace of economic activity, even in a country like Argentina, with low coefficients of trade openness (in 2001, importsand exports each represented less than 10 % of GDP in current values). In Ecuador, trade openness coefficients are around 30 %. Argentina took advantage of the availability of foreign capital that emerging markets enjoyed beginning in 1991 - 1992. In the first half of the nineties, the capital inflows permitted the financing of the current account deficit and significant pace of economic growth. Nevertheless, it has resulted in high external indebtedness and rising payments of interest and capital income, which, in the absence of a sustained rate of export growth, jeopardized the future viability of the convertibility scheme. A lesson that arises from the Argentine experience is that it is not possible to sustain in the long run a hard peg regime together with long lasting fiscal or current account deficits; either fiscal or current account equilibrium have to be achieved, which as it was seen is not an obvious outcome of hard peg regimes. In Argentina, this simultaneous equilibrium was not attained: when the economy grew, it produced an increase of imports and a trade deficit; when it did not grow, there was a fall in tax revenues, which led to a fiscal deficit. Increasingly since the Mexican crisis, the way to elude this contradiction was the increasing in public external debt. In this sense contrary to what was suggested, the convertibility system stimulated public external indebtedness instead of forcing a move towards fiscal discipline. As a final result, at present Argentina had to face severe deficits both in the fiscal and external sectors. This implies that in the case of Argentina the convertibity law was able to eliminate for several years the devaluation risk, but dramatically increased the default risk, which has proven to be as costly as the former and led to a strong attack to convertibility. It is also shown that for the Argentinean case the automatic adjustment mechanisms implied by hard pegs has not operated in a smooth way. This is due to the fact that international financial markets tend to adjust via quantity rather than via prices: a rise in interest rates does not lead to an increase in capital inflows to a country whose over-indebtedness is already manifest, as is the case of Argentina and Ecuador and they can not rely on a permanent access to the international financial markets at reasonable interest rates. Also, external crisis go hand by hand with domestic banking crisis introducing difficulties in the dynamics of the automatic adjustment. The natural raise in the domestic interest rates to attract external financing has a strong effect in deepening domestic recession and increasing financial cost. These two factors create solvency and liquidity problems in the corporate level, worsening the risk of the banking sector liabilities and driving it towards a banking crisis. As long as the exchange rate regime places limits on the Central Bank to act as a lender of last resort problems of insolvency can spread more easily to the banking system...|$|E
