40|$|A {{preliminary}} assessment of Appalachian basin natural gas reservoirs designated as 'tight sands' by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) suggests that greater than 90 % of the 'tight sand' resource occurs within {{two groups of}} genetically-related units; (1) the Lower Silurian Medina interval, and (2) the Upper Devonian-Lower Mississippian Acadian clastic wedge. These intervals were targeted for detailed study {{with the goal of}} producing geologic reservoir characterization data sets compatible with the Tight Gas Analysis System (TGAS: ICF Resources, Inc.) reservoir simulator. The first phase of the study, completed in September, 1991, addressed the Medina reservoirs. The second phase, concerned with the Acadian clastic wedge, was completed in October, 1992. This report is a combined and updated version of the reports submitted in association with those efforts. The Medina interval consists of numerous interfingering fluvial/deltaic sandstones that produce oil and natural gas along an arcuate belt that stretches from eastern Kentucky to western New York. Geophysical well logs from 433 wells were examined {{in order to determine the}} geologic characteristics of six separate reservoir-bearing intervals. The Acadian clastic wedge is a thick, highly-lenticular package of interfingering fluvial-deltaic sandstones, siltstones, and shales. Geologic analyses of more than 800 wells resulted in a geologic/engineering characterization of seven separate stratigraphic intervals. For both study areas, well log and other data were analyzed to determine regional reservoir <b>distribution,</b> <b>reservoir</b> thickness, lithology, porosity, water saturation, pressure and temperature. These data were mapped, evaluated, and compiled into various TGAS data sets that reflect estimates of original gas-in-place, remaining reserves, and 'tight' reserves. The maps and data produced represent the first basin-wide geologic characterization for either interval. This report outlines the methods and assumptions used in creating the TGAS data input, and provides basic geologic perspective on the gas-bearing sandstones of the Medina interval and the Acadian clastic wedge...|$|E

40|$|During the Triassic and Jurassic periods, {{structural}} and stratigraphic {{development in the}} margins of the Utsira High, in the South Viking Graben, resulted in the development of depressional mini-basins and the halokinesis of the Zechstein Salt Group. The subsequent fluvial, alluvial and delta plain deposits filled in this accommodation space created by the salt withdrawal. Continuous sedimentation and salt development in the Triassic resulted in a pod-like occurrence, while subsidence and dissolution of Zechstein salt in the Jurassic created further accommodation space, for coarse clastic sediments. The difficulties of having rift-related normal faults in combination with salt movement, has complicated the <b>distribution</b> of <b>reservoir</b> sandstones within the Triassic Skagerrak Formation and Jurassic Hugin and Draupne Formations. In this study, a multi-faceted approach including 3 D seismic, well data and synthetic seismograms have been applied, in order to obtain surface distribution, thickness' and attribute maps for investigation of <b>reservoir</b> <b>distribution.</b> The situation of having poor seismic resolution, and few Permian penetrations(most of wells being dry), further complicates the work. Surface-, thickness and attribute maps have been generated to further understand the influence the evaporite-dominated Zechstein salt, has upon <b>reservoir</b> <b>distribution</b> within Triassic and Jurassic strata. Sandstones are seen to thicken towards the Sleipner Terrace and thin towards the Utsira High, with intermittent local pod development, that I perceived to complicate the <b>reservoir</b> <b>distribution.</b> Whether the mini-basins are isolated or connected is unknown, due to significant noise within the seismic data, little well control and uncertainties when interpreting the top of the salt pods.
