50|$|The three inner girders are {{conventional}} being 0.76m {{deep and}} built up {{of a web}} plate, four angles and top and bottom cover plates. The outer girders are less conventional, with the angles n {{one side of the}} web left off to provide a <b>flush</b> <b>face.</b> The 5/16 inch (a standard recommendation in the early twentieth century) web plates are fastened with 8 rivets to the 100 x 75 x 9.5 mm vertical angles. The horizontal angles are 100 x 75 x 16 mm and secured with an additional 13 or 14 rivets per web plate. Corners are bolted through with 28 mm bolts.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} stated by non astronomers and non navigators, {{that two people}} are {{required}} to use the small instrument successfully; one to take the sight and one to read the cord (plum line) position on the radius segment and incorrect presumption as the instrument is to be held <b>flush</b> (<b>face</b> on) and below eye level with a single user, the two holes used for projecting {{the image of the}} Sun not direct sighting. As one can see from the photograph, it is easy to optically aligned the instrument with the Sun using simple image projection method, the device held in a single hand. At the moment of alignment, one views the face of the instrument to read the angular position of the cord relative to the radii segment of the instrument. However, it does help to have another person write down the scale readings as they are taken if a single operator is not able to do such because of environmental conditions, the single operator not having the capability to sufficiently hold the device stable, retaining the optical alignment, with just one hand.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The use of amplitude and phase shading {{on a pair}} of concentric piston radiators has been employed as a means for controlling the acoustic radiation patterns for a small <b>flush</b> <b>face</b> transducer which is intended for use as a 75 kHz sound source in the underwater tracking of vehicles. A description is given of the design, construction and tests of several models of the composite piezoelectric ceramic transducer. Results indicate that this appears to be a feasible method for achieving a principal design goal of a broad beamwidth radiation pattern with a pronounced reduction in source level along the transducer axis. Some additional development is needed for achieving a configuration which might be optimum for production. [URL] Commander, Canadian Force...|$|E
