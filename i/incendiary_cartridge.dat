50|$|The {{cartridges}} {{manufactured in}} Poland during the interwar period were mainly copies or modifications of the corresponding original German cartridge designs. The standard rifle cartridge was the S—a {{copy of the}} 1905 pattern German S Patrone loaded with the 9.9 g S bullet. For machine guns a cartridge variant loaded with the heavier 12.8 g SC bullet—{{a copy of the}} German 1934 pattern s.S. cartridge—was used. The armor-piercing variant loaded with the P bullet was a copy of the German SmK cartridge. The armor-piercing with tracer PS and <b>incendiary</b> Z <b>cartridges</b> were Polish modifications of the original German counterpart designs. The Polish designed a long-range machine gun cartridge loaded with the D bullet, which offered a maximum plunging fire range of 5200 m to 5500 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{cartridge}} is {{in principle}} an enhanced Russian {{version of the}} 7.63×25mm Mauser. The Russians produced {{a wide array of}} loadings for this cartridge for use in submachine guns. These include armor-piercing, tracer, and <b>incendiary</b> rounds. This <b>cartridge</b> has excellent penetration and can easily defeat lighter ballistic vests (NIJ level I and IIA) as well as some kevlar helmets, such as the American PASGT helmet. When fired from a carbine length barrel the cartridge may penetrate NIJ level II, but is readily stopped by the current standard armor NIJ level IIIA. Although most firearms chambered in this caliber were declared obsolete and removed from military inventories, some Police and Special Forces units in Russia, Pakistan and (mainly) in China may still use it because of the large quantity of stored ammunition available.|$|R
