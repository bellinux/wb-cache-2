40|$|The normal {{prostate}} shows a {{high degree}} of cellular organization. The basal layer is populated by prostate epithelial stem cells and a population of transiently proliferating/amplifying (TP/A) cells <b>intermediate</b> to the <b>stem</b> cells and fully differentiated cells. The luminal layer is composed of fully differentiated prostate epithelial cells. Neuroendocrine cells are scattered throughout the gland. This organization is also seen in prostate cancer, where the tumor cell origin (cancer stem cells) can be traced to a normal cell type by characteristic keratin expression patterns. Basal cells showed strong expression of K-[keratin] 5, but they were only weakly positive for K 18. Luminal cells strongly expressed K 18. A subpopulation of basal cells coexpressed K 5 and K 14. These keratin expression patterns changed with the degree of cell differentiation as well as location. The least differentiated stem cells in the basal layer were positive for K 5 and K 14, with weak expression for K 18. Intermediate stages of differentiation were identified by expression of K 5 and K 18. Neuroendocrine cells also expressed K 5 as well as typical neuroendocrine cell markers (eg, chromogranin A). Evidence supporting the hypothesis that prostate cancer arises from malignant transformation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>stem</b> cells included the presence in prostate cancers of keratin patterns associated with the intermediate stages of differentiation, androgen independence of both prostate cancers and <b>intermediate</b> <b>stem</b> cells, and expression of c-met by both the TP/A <b>intermediate</b> <b>stem</b> cells and tumor cells...|$|R

40|$|Background: Antibiotic spacers in {{shoulder}} periprosthetic joint infection deliver antibiotics locally and provide temporary stability. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate differences between <b>stemmed</b> and stemless <b>spacers.</b> Methods: All spacers placed from 2011 to 2013 were identified. Stemless spacers were made by creating a spherical ball of cement placed in the joint space. <b>Stemmed</b> <b>spacers</b> had some portion in the humeral canal. Operative time, complications, reimplantation, reinfection, and range of motion were analyzed. Results: There were 37 spacers placed: 22 were stemless and 15 were <b>stemmed.</b> The stemless <b>spacer</b> population was older (70. 9 ± 7. 8 years vs. 62. 8 ± 8. 4 years, p = 0. 006). The groups had a similar percentage of each gender (stemless group, 45 % male vs. stemmed group, 40 % male; p = 0. 742), body mass index (stemless group, 29. 1 ± 6. 4 kg/m 2 vs. stemmed group, 31. 5 ± 8. 3 kg/m 2; p = 0. 354) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (stemless group, 4. 2 ± 1. 2 vs. stemmed group, 4. 2 ± 1. 7; p = 0. 958). Operative time was similar (stemless group, 127. 5 ± 37. 1 minutes vs. stemmed group, 130. 5 ± 39. 4 minutes). Two stemless group patients had self-resolving radial nerve palsies. Within the stemless group, 15 of 22 (68. 2 %) underwent reimplantation with 14 of 15 having forward elevation of 109 ° ± 23 °. Within the stemmed group, 12 of 15 (80. 0 %, p = 0. 427) underwent reimplantation with 8 of 12 having forward elevation of 94 ° ± 43 ° (range, 30 ° to 150 °; p = 0. 300). Two stemmed group patients had axillary nerve palsies, one of which self-resolved but the other did not. One patient sustained dislocation of reverse shoulder arthroplasty after reimplantation. One stemless group patient required an open reduction and glenosphere exchange of dislocated reverse shoulder arthroplasty at 6 weeks after reimplantation. Conclusions: <b>Stemmed</b> and stemless <b>spacers</b> had similar clinical outcomes. When analyzing all antibiotic spacers, over 70 % were converted to revision arthroplasties.

40|$|SummaryRecent {{evidence}} indicates that mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are fixed at different developmental stages, with the former positioned earlier. We show that a narrow concentration of the naturally occurring short-chain fatty acid, sodium butyrate, supports the extensive self-renewal of mouse and human ESCs, while promoting their convergence toward an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stem</b> cell state. In response to butyrate, human ESCs regress to an earlier developmental stage characterized by a gene expression profile resembling that of mouse ESCs, preventing precocious Xist expression while retaining the ability to form complex teratomas in vivo.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor osterix (Osx) {{is a key}} regulator of osteoblast differentiation and induces bone formation in embryonic but not adult stem cells. We investigated the effect of up-regulating Osx on an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stem</b> cell type, first trimester fetal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are more expandable than adult MSCs. Human fetal (hf) MSCs were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding human Osx. In undifferentiating MSCs cultures, forced expression of Osx stimulated osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase expression. However, Osx did not up-regulate osteocalcin, a late marker of osteoblast differentiation or result in extracellular calcium crystals, indicating that Osx does not directly mediate terminal differentiation in primary hfMSCs. To understand the downstream effects of Osx expression in primary hfMSCs, we next investigated the regulatory relationship between Osx, and the {{transcription factor}}s Dlx 5, Runx 2, and Msx 2. Osx induced Dlx 5 but did not affect Runx 2 and Msx 2, whereas stealth ribonucleic acid interference of Osx inhibited Dlx 5 without affecting expression of Runx 2 and Msx 2. In conclusion, Osx regulates osteogenic gene expression in hfMSCs but is insufficient to induce terminal osteogenic differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: The plastic {{alterations}} of clonal architecture {{are likely}} to have functional consequences, as they affect the spatial distribution of ramets over patchy environments. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of mechanical stresses on the clonal growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clonal plasticity induced by mechanical stress consisting of continuous water current encountered by aquatic plants. More particularly, the aim was to test the capacity of the plants to escape this stress through clonal plastic responses. Methods: The transplantation of ramets of the same clone in two contrasting flow velocity conditions was carried out for two species (Potamogeton coloratus and Mentha aquatica) which have contrasting clonal growth forms. Relative allocation to clonal growth, to creeping stems in the clonal biomass, number and total length of creeping <b>stems,</b> <b>spacer</b> length and main creeping stem direction were measured. Key Results: For P. coloratus, plants exposed to water current displayed increased total length of creeping stems, increased relative allocation to creeping stems within the clonal dry mass and increased spacer length. For M. aquatica, plants exposed to current displayed increased number and total length of creeping stems. Exposure to current induced for both species a significant increase of the proportion of creeping stems in the downstream direction to the detriment of creeping stems perpendi Conclusions: This study demonstrates that mechanical stress from current flow induced plastic variation in clonal traits for both species. The responses of P. coloratus could lead to an escape strategy, with low benefits with respect to sheltering and anchorage. The responses of M. aquatica that may result in a denser canopy and enhancement of anchorage efficiency could lead to a resistance strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|The rodent {{and human}} nonpregnant mammary glands contain epithelial, {{intermediate}} and myoepithelial cells which {{have all been}} isolated as cell lines in vitro. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) and {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) are produced by myoepithelial cells and can stimulate the growth of <b>intermediate</b> <b>stem</b> cells in vitro. Epithelial and intermediate cells behave like stem cells in vitro, since they can differentiate into alveolar-like an myoepithelial cells. The myoepithelial differentiation pathway is associated with the early expression of a calcium-binding regulatory protein called p 9 Ka and the protease, Cathepsin D. Myoepithelial cells are also present in benign lesions but not in malignant mammary carcinomas of rats or humans, whose resultant cell lines fail to differentiate completely along the myoepithelial cell pathway. Loss of the myoepithelial cell in some invasive carcinomas may be compensated, at least in part, by changes in malignant cells. Over-expression of TGF alpha and/or erbB receptors may reduce the requirement for TGF alpha, whilst ectopic production of bFGF and its receptors and p 9 Ka/Cathespin D may assist in tumorigenesis and in metastasis, respectively. Thus compensation for, or retention of, molecules potentially involved in the differentiation of mammary cells may be a mechanism by which malignancy progresses in some human invasive carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} turtles and their unusual body plan has fascinated {{scientists}} {{for the last}} two centuries. Over {{the course of the last}} decades, a broad sample of molecular analyses have favored a sister group relationship of turtles with archosaurs, but recent studies reveal that this signal may be the result of systematic biases affecting molecular approaches, in particular sampling, non-randomly distributed rate heterogeneity among taxa, and the use of concatenated data sets. Morphological studies, by contrast, disfavor archosaurian relationships for turtles, but the proposed alternative topologies are poorly supported as well. The recently revived paleontological hypothesis that the Middle Permian Eunotosaurus africanus is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stem</b> turtle is now robustly supported by numerous characters that were previously thought to be unique to turtles and that are now shown to have originated over the course of tens of millions of years unrelated to the origin of the turtle shell. Although E. africanus does not solve the placement of turtles within Amniota, it successfully extends the stem lineage of turtles to the Permian and helps resolve some questions associated with the origin of turtles, in particular the non-composite origin of the shell, the slow origin of the shell, and the terrestrial setting for the origin of turtles...|$|R
40|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} of {{different}} embryonic origin respond to distinct signaling pathways. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which {{are derived from}} the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos, are dependent on LIF-Stat 3 signaling, while epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which are established from postimplantation embryos, require activin-Smad 2 / 3 signaling. Recent studies have revealed heterogeneity of ESCs {{and the presence of}} <b>intermediate</b> pluripotent <b>stem</b> cell populations, whose responsiveness to growth factors, gene expression patterns, and associated chromatic signatures are compatible to a state in between ESCs and EpiSCs.

Here, we describe the identification of clonal stem cells from mouse ESCs with global gene expression profiles representing such a state. These pluripotent stem cells display dual responsiveness to LIF-Stat 3 and activin-Smad 2 / 3 at single-cell level and thus named as <b>intermediate</b> epiblast <b>stem</b> cells (IESCs). Furthermore, these cells show accelerated temporal gene expression kinetics during embryoid body differentiation in vitro consistent with a more advanced differentiation stage than that of ESCs.

Current concepts of microscopic analyses {{are based on the}} analysis of two-dimensional (2 D) histologic sections. For this approach, the assessment of the stromal core of sectioned villi is of key importance. The classification of stromal properties of sectioned villi allows allocation of villous sections to villous types which are named by their expected position in villous trees (terminal, <b>intermediate,</b> and <b>stem</b> villi). MethodThe present study takes these current concepts of placental histology as hypothesis and validates them against predetermined 3 D positions of branches of villous trees. The 3 D positions were determined prior to histologic sectioning using a recently introduced 3 D-microscopic approach. Individual histologic sections of villi were classified by their stromal structures and inter rater variability of these histologic assessments were determined. Results/disscussionInter rater variability was high and indicates substantial observer influence on the outcome of histologic assessments. Cross-match of villous types with the predetermined positions of villous branches of villous trees revealed substantial mismatch between the outcome of stromal classification and 3 D-position of the sectioned villi in the placental villous trees...|$|R

These two types of cells are established and maintained under different culture conditions. Here, we show that a modified EpiSC culture condition containing the GSK 3 inhibitor CHIR 99021 can support a germline-competent pluripotent state that is intermediate between ESCs and EpiSCs. When ESCs were cultured under a modified condition containing bFGF, Activin A, and CHIR 99021, they converted to <b>intermediate</b> pluripotent <b>stem</b> cells (INTPSCs). These INTPSCs were able to form teratomas in vivo and contribute to chimeras by blastocyst injection.

Subsequent reports of transdifferentiation into clinically relevant neuronal subtypes have further endorsed the prospect of autologous cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders. So far, all published neuronal transdifferentiation protocols rely on lentiviruses, which likely precludes their clinical translation. Instead, we delivered plasmids encoding neuronal transcription factors (Brn 2, Ascl 1, Myt 1 l) to primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a bioreducible linear poly(amido amine). The low toxicity and high transfection efficiency of this gene carrier allowed repeated dosing to sustain high transgene expression levels.

The interaction energies lie in the range from 0. 19 to 1. 67 kcal/mol and decrease from Cl to Br and to I.

Herein, global and single-cell analyses revealed a hierarchical organization of transcriptional lineage programs, with downregulation of megakaryocyte-erythroid genes from HSCs to LMPPs, sustained granulocyte-monocyte priming, and upregulation of common lymphoid (but not B and T cell-specific) genes. These biological and molecular relationships, implicating almost mutual exclusion of megakaryocyte-erythroid and lymphoid pathways, are established already in fetal hematopoiesis, as evidenced by existence of LMPPs in fetal liver. The identification of LMPPs and hierarchically ordered transcriptional activation and downregulation of distinct lineage programs is compatible with a model for HSC lineage commitment in which the probability for undergoing different lineage commitment fates changes gradually when progressing from HSCs to LMPPs...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of large scale {{computer}} simulations in which we investigate the structural and dynamic properties of silicate melts with the compositions (Na_ 2 O) 2 (SiO_ 2) and (Al_ 2 O_ 3) 2 (SiO_ 2). In order to treat such systems on a time scale of several nanoseconds and for system sizes of several thousand atoms {{it is necessary to}} use parallel supercomputers like the CRAY T 3 E. We show that the silicates under consideration exhibit additional intermediate range order as compared to silica (SiO_ 2) where the characteristic <b>intermediate</b> length scales <b>stem</b> from the tetrahedral network structure. For the sodium silicate system it is demonstrated that the latter structural features are intimately connected with a surprising dynamics in which the one [...] particle motion of the sodium ions appears on a much smaller time scale than the correlations between different sodium ions.

40|$|SummaryThe core pluripotency factor Oct 4 plays {{key roles}} in somatic cell {{reprogramming}} through transcriptional control. Here, we profile Oct 4 occupancy, epigenetic changes, and gene expression in reprogramming. We find that Oct 4 binds in a hierarchical manner to target sites with primed epigenetic modifications. Oct 4 binding is temporally continuous and seldom switches between bound and unbound. Oct 4 occupancy {{in most of}} promoters is maintained throughout the entire reprogramming process. In contrast, somatic cell-specific enhancers are silenced in the early and <b>intermediate</b> stages, whereas <b>stem</b> cell-specific enhancers are activated in the late stage in parallel with cell fate transition. Both epigenetic remodeling and Oct 4 binding contribute to the hyperdynamic enhancer signature transitions. The hierarchical Oct 4 bindings are associated with distinct functional themes at different stages. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive molecular roadmap of Oct 4 binding in concert with epigenetic rearrangements and rich resources for future reprogramming studies...|$|R
40|$|Ferromagnetism in topological {{insulators}} (TIs) opens a topologically non-trivial exchange band gap, {{providing an}} exciting platform {{to manipulate the}} topological order through an external magnetic field. Here, we experimentally show that the surface of an antiferromagnetic thin film can independently control the topological order of the top and the bottom surface states of a TI thin film through proximity couplings. During the magnetization reversal in a field scan, two <b>intermediate</b> spin configurations <b>stem</b> from unsynchronized magnetic switchings of the top and the bottom AFM/TI interfaces. These magnetic configurations are shown to result in new topological phases with non-zero Chern numbers for each surface, introducing two counter-propagating chiral edge modes inside the exchange gap. This change {{in the number of}} transport channels, {{as the result of the}} topological transitions, induces antisymmetric magneto-resistance spikes during the magnetization reversal. With the high Neel ordering temperature provided by the antiferromagnetic layers, the signature of the induced topological transition persists in transport measurements up to a temperature of around 90 K, a factor of three over the Curie temperature in a typical magnetically doped TI thin film...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{statistical}} embedding of a structural pattern recognition system into the autonomous navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A rule-based system {{is used for the}} recognition of visual landmarks such as bridges in aerial views. In principle, rule-based systems can be designed and coded with no training data at hand, but a sound interpretation and utilization of the achieved results needs statistical inference and representative data sets of sufficient coverages. Flying a UAV with an experimental system is expensive, risky, and legally questionable. Therefore, we chose a virtual globe as a camera simulator providing arbitrary amounts of training and test data. The expected positions of landmarks in the aerial views are modeled by mixture models representing inliers, outliers, and <b>intermediate</b> forms which <b>stem</b> from similar structures appearing frequently in the vicinity of landmarks. The parameters of the corresponding likelihood functions are estimated by the Expectation–Maximization method. Using these estimates, we carry out tests and compare the results for heuristic, pessimistic, optimistic, and Bayesian decision rationales. This performance evaluation reveals the superiority of the Bayesian approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{medical and}} bioindustrial {{applications}} of {{pluripotent stem cells}} rely on {{our understanding of the}}ir biology. Pluripotent stem cell lines derived from embryos in different stages depend on distinct signalling pathways. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of preimplantation embryos, are dependent on LIF/STAT 3 signalling, while epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), established from the postimplantation embryos, require Activin A/Smad 2 / 3 signalling. Recent studies revealed the presence of <b>intermediate</b> pluripotent <b>stem</b> cell populations. Their growth factor responsiveness, gene expression pattern and associated chromatic signatures, are compatible with the state intermediate between ESCs and EpiSCs. However, it remains unknown whether such cell populations represent a stable clonally intermediate cell state. In this thesis, I describe the discovery and characterization of novel stem cell lines displaying gene expression pattern intermediate between ESCs and EpiSCs. These cells respond to LIF/STAT 3 as well as Activin/Smad 2 / 3 signalling at single cell level. They can integrate into the ICM and generate chimeric embryos. In keeping with a more advanced differentiation stage than that of ESCs, the LIF/Activin dual responsive stem cells showed accelerated temporal gene expression kinetics during in vitro differentiation in embryo bodies. I found that these properties are shared by some induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. The notion of an intermediate state was consolidated by a genome-wide microarray profiling. The hierarchical clustering analysis grouped LIF/Activin dual responsive stem cells together into a cluster intermediate between ESCs and EpiSCs. These findings advanced our understanding of the regulation of pluripotency. A better understanding of distinct differentiation state of pluripotent stem cells and their signalling responsiveness is crucial for developing tailored strategies for lineage/cell type differentiation.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the evolutionary {{history of the}} widely studied, cosmopolitan polymorphic species Dodonaea viscosa (hop bush, varnish tree). Location: All continents except Antarctica, extending from 44 ° S (in the South Island of New Zealand) to 33 ° N (in California and Arizona). Methods: For 50 samples across the worldwide distribution, Bayesian analyses of nuclear ribosomal transcribed spacers (ITS 1, ITS 2 and partial ETS) were performed. The alignment was partitioned by secondary structure and analysed using separate models of sequence evolution for each <b>spacer's</b> <b>stem</b> and loop partition. Bayesian relaxed-clock estimations of divergence times were used to investigate the tempo of the transoceanic dispersal history of Dodonaea viscosa. Results: The widely distributed Dodonaea viscosa evolved in Australia from its most recent common ancestor in the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene and subsequently split into two distinct, geographically based, intraspecific lineages. There {{are a number of}} regional subclades that are also supported by specific molecular elements. Main conclusions: Dodonaea viscosa is not an old lineage, as has often been speculated based primarily on its vast distribution. It diverged from its most recent common ancestor and subsequently dispersed and established around the world within the last 2 Myr. Two distinct lineages within Dodonaea viscosa, which have been shaped by Quaternary climatic change, have separate dispersal histories. The molecular investigations have identified that, although there are least two evolutionary lineages within the complex, they do not correlate with any distinct morphological subunits. It is proposed that Dodonaea viscosa (including D. biloba and D. procumbens) be recognized as an ochlospecies...|$|R
