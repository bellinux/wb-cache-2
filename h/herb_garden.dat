On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The <b>herb</b> <b>garden</b> was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included Artemisia, catmint, Santolina and curry plants. To keep the plants within the beds, each was lined by box in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial <b>Herb</b> <b>Garden,</b> located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E
5|$|Gardens, or yards, around medieval castles, abbeys {{and houses}} were formal {{and in the}} European {{tradition}} of <b>herb</b> <b>garden,</b> kitchen garden and orchard. They were often surrounded by defensive walls and they sometimes adjoined a hunting park. The first Renaissance style gardens in Scotland were built for the Stewart dynasty at their royal palaces. French gardeners were hired by James IV at Stirling in 1501 and James V at Holyrood in 1536, where archaeological remains indicate there were sophisticated formal gardens. Similar landscaping is also found at Falkland and Linlithgow, including the king's knot garden at Stirling. From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. These were seen as retreats from the troubles {{of the world and}} were eulogised in country house poetry like that of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649). Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a <b>herb</b> <b>garden</b> at Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him.|$|E

5|$|The ruined {{tower of}} St Mary-le-Port church stands {{to the west}} of the park, {{surrounded}} by derelict financial office buildings. Adjoining the ruins of St Peter's church in the middle of the park is a sensory <b>herb</b> <b>garden,</b> and five silver birch trees as a memorial to the beaches of the D-Day landings. To the east is a grassy arena, and the partially excavated remains of Bristol Castle with a preserved vaulted chamber. There is also a bandstand and a children's play area.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} St Peter's Church are a {{memorial}} to the civilians and auxiliary personnel killed in the aerial bombing of Bristol, and a plaque on its wall lists their names. Adjoining the church is a sensory <b>herb</b> <b>garden</b> and The Normandy Garden of Peace, which was opened on 5 November 1995, with five Silver Birch trees, managed by Bristol's D-Day veterans, {{in memory of the}} five D-Day beaches. There are also memorials for trees for Anne Frank and the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, {{appearing}} much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit {{was placed in the}} nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a <b>herb</b> <b>garden,</b> which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a <b>herb</b> <b>garden,</b> vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E
5|$|Cottage gardens, {{which emerged}} in Elizabethan times, {{appear to have}} {{originated}} as a local source for herbs and fruits. One theory is that they arose out of the Black Death of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens. According to the late 19th-century legend of origin, these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, {{to provide them with}} food and herbs, with flowers planted in for decoration. Helen Leach analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden, subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis, along with the ornamental potager and the <b>herb</b> <b>garden.</b> She concluded that their origins were less in workingmen's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes' discovery of simple hardy plants, in part through the writings of John Claudius Loudon. Loudon helped to design the estate at Great Tew, Oxfordshire, where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden—about an acre—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own <b>herb</b> <b>garden</b> {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E

50|$|Food {{was often}} salted and {{enhanced}} with spices, {{some of which}} were imported like black pepper, while others were cultivated in <b>herb</b> <b>gardens</b> or harvested in the wild. Home grown spices that were used included caraway, mustard and horseradish as evidenced from the Oseberg ship burial or dill, coriander, and wild celery, as found during the archaeological examinations of cesspits at Coppergate in York. Thyme, juniper berry, sweet gale, yarrow, rue and peppercress were also used and cultivated in <b>herb</b> <b>gardens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The gardens {{have a large}} {{variety of}} plants, {{including}} raised vegetable, fruit and <b>herb</b> <b>gardens.</b> These gardens contain a variety of vegetables such as tomatoes and chilis.

25|$|The {{essential}} oils of D. ambrosioides contain terpene compounds, {{some of which}} have natural pesticide capabilities. The compound ascaridole in epazote inhibits the growth of nearby plants, so {{it would be best to}} relegate this plant at a distance from other inhabitants of the <b>herb</b> <b>garden.</b> Even though this plant has an established place in recipes and in folklore, it is wise to use only the leaves, and those very sparingly, in cooking.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{necessarily}} {{had many}} assistants. Some prepared and vended medicines and tended the <b>herb</b> <b>garden.</b> There were pharmacopolae (note the female ending), unguentarii and aromatarii, {{all of which}} names are easily understood by the English reader. Others attended the doctor when required (the capsarii; they prepared and carried the doctor's capsa, or bag.). Jerome Carcopino's study of occupational names in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum turned up 51 medici, 4 medicae (female doctors), an obstetrix ("midwife") and a nutrix ("nurse") {{in the city of}} Rome. These numbers, of course, are at best proportional to the true populations, which were many times greater.|$|E
25|$|Customization was {{significantly}} overhauled, specifically by allowing equipment {{and other items}} to modify their appearance based on who it is equipped to. Depending upon which party member has received it, a piece of armour would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining their identity. Players can craft and customize armour or weapons using the materials they have collected; rarer materials give the particular weapon or armour piece better attributes. Players can customize their keeps, such as rebuilding a garden as a Chantry church or a <b>herb</b> <b>garden.</b> These upgrades have minor effects on the Inquisitions espionage, commerce or military capabilities.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Herb</b> <b>gardens</b> {{developed}} from the general gardens of the ancient classical world, which were used for growing vegetables, flowers, fruits and medicines.

The Abbot House heritage centre on Maygate {{tells the story of the}} history that the house played within Dunfermline over a period of five and a half centuries. There is also a cafe on the ground floor and part of the garden recreates the feel of a 17th-century <b>herb</b> <b>garden.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of medicine in medieval Europe was longstanding. A classical pagan view of medicine in which the main focus was on treating and curing disease survived as the {{practice of}} medicine evolved through the Middle Ages. People in medieval Europe had long been practicing folk medicine as evidenced by the tradition of the <b>herb</b> <b>garden.</b> The continued practice of gardening in monasteries later on and the practicality and accessibility of the works of Hildegard of Bingen and others, as mentioned previously, illustrated a longstanding precedent of medical practice. The roots of medieval medicine in the pagan and folk medicine that preceded it illustrate a development of medical practice that took place in Europe {{over a long period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Other {{forms of}} popular music also thrive on the city's scene.
