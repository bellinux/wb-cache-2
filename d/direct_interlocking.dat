40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} market {{structure}} of the insurance business by analyzing the (interlock) linkages among companies created by their directors. We focus on the non-life business {{since this is a}} sector relatively closed with respect to the competition with other financial activities; an absence of industry competition cannot thus be compensated by other agents. We apply the graph theory to describe the network and the principal component analysis to summarize information and verify the correlation between <b>direct</b> <b>interlocking</b> and companies’ market shares. ...|$|E
40|$|Nanoscale {{observation}} of beetle's attachment systems has revealed various exquisite multiscale architectures for essential {{functions such as}} wing fixation, crawling, mating, and protection from predators. Some of these adhesion systems are mediated by liquid secretion (capillary force), whereas some are purely operated by <b>direct</b> <b>interlocking</b> of high-density microfibers or contact of mushroom-like hairy structures (van der Waals force). In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in beetle-inspired, artificial dry and wet adhesives {{in the context of}} nanofabrication and material properties. For convenience, the beetle's adhesions from wing to tiptoe are classified into four types: hair interlocking, mushroom-shaped pads, oil-assisted spatula-shaped pads, and claws. After introducing the structural features and functions of these systems, we describe how the current nanofabrication methods can be applied to mimic or exploit the systems. Furthermore, relevant beetle-inspired structural materials, devices (fastener, medical tape, electric connector, etc.) and microrobots are briefly overviewed, which would shed light on future smart, directional and reversible adhesion systems. close...|$|E
5000|$|Interlocking {{directorate}} {{refers to}} the practice of members of a corporate board of directors serving on the boards of multiple corporations. A person that sits on multiple boards is known as a multiple director. Two firms have a <b>direct</b> <b>interlock</b> if a director or executive of one firm is also a director of the other, and an indirect interlock if a director of each sits on the board of a third firm. [...] This practice, although widespread and lawful, raises questions about the quality and independence of board decisions.|$|R
40|$|When firms {{engage in}} {{cooperative}} efforts, interfirm relations get {{particular interest to}} be studied. A <b>direct</b> <b>interlock</b> occurs when an executive or director of one firm sits {{on the board of}} another firm, and an indirect interlock occurs when two firms have directors or executives who sit on the board of a third firm. The three commonly used theoretical models such as social network theory, learning theory, and theory of strategic choice are more relevant for the formation and management of interlocking directorates. Uncertainty, resource scarcity, mutual trust, dependency, etc. influence the formation of interlocking directorates. Consequently, interlocking directorates allow sharing of information and overall cooperation between partners through learning, collaboration, networking, and effective relationship, etc. Proper management of interlocking directorates requires communication and collaboration among partners that enhance exchange of knowledge and cooperation...|$|R
30|$|Interlocks {{involving}} {{executive directors}} {{can be seen}} as directed ties because an executive primarily associated with one firm serves as outside director on another firm’s board. By contrast, interlocks established by outside directors are undirected as the director creating the tie is not primarily affiliated with either company (Mintz and Schwartz 1985; Palmer et al. 1986, 1993). Typically, executives and outside directors are equally involved in a firm’s boundary-spanning activities (Mizruchi 1996)—yet the ties they create have a unique content. For <b>directed</b> <b>interlocks,</b> tie content depends on whether the focal firm’s executive serves on another firm’s board or another firm’s executive serves on the focal firm’s board. Ties created by executive directors of the focal firm serving as an outside director on another firm’s board are termed sent interlocks. Researchers and practitioners largely agree that firms benefit from their executives’ external ties (e.g., Connelly and van Slyke 2012; Geletkanycz and Hambrick 1997). Firms even reward the added value of sent interlocks by granting higher levels of compensation to their boundary-spanning executives (Geletkanycz et al. 2001). At the same time, sent interlocks involve costs, such as time constraints, that focal firms need to consider (e.g., Geletkanycz and Boyd 2011). As their counterpart, received interlocks are ties created by executives of another firm serving as outside directors on the focal firm’s board (e.g., Haunschild and Beckman 1998; Palmer et al. 1995). In their role as outside directors, these individuals fulfill a monitoring function typically explained by agency theory as well as a resource provision function typically explained by resource dependency theory (Hillman and Dalziel 2003). However, they do not have direct managerial responsibility. <b>Directed</b> <b>interlocks</b> are sometimes characterized as strong ties that offer a higher intensity of exchange between connected firms (e.g., Palmer et al. 1995) and may for instance facilitate the transfer of complex, tacit knowledge (Hansen 1999). Because the tie-creating individuals are closely committed to one of the two firms they connect, they are said to be more highly motivated and better able to represent their firm’s interests (e.g., Mintz and Schwartz 1985; Mizruchi and Bunting 1981; Palmer et al. 1995). In terms of Simmel’s (1955 : p. 138) concepts of primary and secondary affiliations, “one group appears as the original focus of an individual’s affiliation, from which he then turns toward affiliation with other, quite different groups {{on the basis of his}} special qualities, which distinguish him from other members of his primary group” (see also Breiger 1974).|$|R
30|$|Focusing on tie {{content as}} a driver of network formation, we add a {{relational}} dimension to the typically purely structural analysis of board interlocks. Following Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), we propose that not only the configuration of a focal firm’s network—as reflected by partner choice—counts. Rather, firms strategize on the quality or content of ties they create leading to specific tie choices. In this connection, our paper highlights that the directionality of an interlock significantly influences tie content. Creating a directed (sent or received) as compared to an undirected interlock makes a crucial difference for the benefits that can be realized by the focal firm and thus for tie choice. For early research treating interlocks primarily as instruments for corporate control, the direction of an interlock was a logical result {{of the issue of}} who controls whom. Undirected interlocks were seen merely as a byproduct of outside directors’ multiple engagements (Mintz and Schwartz 1985). Since interlocks have become an instrument used for a larger variety of purposes such as inter-organizational coordination and communication, companies can be supposed to consider carefully whether to create a <b>directed</b> <b>interlock</b> and reap strong tie benefits or instead rely on an undirected interlock that brings about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} weak ties.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 28) Expansion joints utilizing bellows {{are used}} in rocket engine propellant ducts to allows engine angulation and provide an additional feature of isolating mechanical vibrations in one portion of a structure {{from other parts of}} the system. In the present application bellows are located in ducts supplying liquid oxygen to large rocket engine combustors and must accommodate the differential motion isolating the space vehicle from vibrations of the engine and the engine angulation required for thrustvector control. Because of the high pressure levels in the oxygen ducts a tension restraint center linkage is used in each bellows, consistiing of two oppositely <b>directed</b> <b>interlocking</b> tripods attached to the rigid external support rings that join the bellows to the duct ends. Bellows with an internal restraint linkage made of Inconel 718 have failed in the center of the linkage. The tripod design was remodified by changing the hub thickness at the critical center notch location, yet two modified restraint links failed again. The reasons for failure of this interim strut modification, which was indicated by theoretical analysis to be significantly superior to the original design, are considered in this thesis. The results of strain gage experiments on a third interim design and the analysis of the microstructure of the failure area of a restraint joints showed that the major cause for failure was residual stress. A small increase in the stress levels at the critical notch region is found to be due to the lack of weld fusion in that area.

40|$|The {{research}} done {{based on the}} fact that the log from natural forest could not fullfil the need of domestic forest industry. Annual available cut from natural forest in the year 2007 was only 9. 1 million m 3 while forest industry domestic country in the year 2005 reached 44. 5 million m 3. Raw material crisis was the most problem facing by domestic forest industry and the solution could be come soon as posible. The establishment of social plantation forest is one of the government program to solved the lack of forest industry raw materials. The species for social plantation forest are available more than enough. Previous {{research done}} in the year 2009 shown taht most of HTR log was small diameter, short sortimen, heart wood presentation of juvenile wood was very high. The result of research shown that the basic characteristics of three species of HTR namely: Jabon, sengon and pulai have a good colour (bright), moderate texture, fibre is slim to interlocked, have no decoratif form, bulk density low. The characteristic of 6 species HTR was: variation in colour, good texture until moderate, fibre <b>direct</b> until <b>interlocked,</b> the wood have beautiful decoration, moderate bulk density. Basic of characteristic of wood is very important in affacting the quality of the products. An effort to increase the quality of HTR wood should be done so that the use of HTR product becaming important to suggest the developing of creative industr...|$|R
5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when <b>interlocked,</b> <b>direct</b> blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|R
40|$|The dietary {{compositions}} {{of three}} medium to large targeted fish species, which co-occur over reefs in temperate waters of south-western Australia, were determined. These data were {{then used to}} ascertain statistically {{the extent to which}} body size, season and habitat influence the diets of these species {{and the degree to which}} food resources were partitioned among and within those species, and thus reduced the potential of interspecific and intraspecific competition. On the west coast, Bodianus frenchii (Labridae) and Epinephelides armatus (Serranidae) spent their whole life over prominent limestone reefs, as did Glaucosoma hebraicum (Glaucosomatidae) in all but juvenile life, when it lived over low-relief, limestone substrata. The dietary composition of each species changed with increasing body size, which, in G. hebraicum, was particularly pronounced at c. 300 mm total length (LT) and therefore at the size when this species shifts habitat. When the three species co-occurred over the same reefs, their dietary compositions were significantly different, with that of B. frenchii being by far the most discrete, reflecting a far greater contribution by sedentary taxa. Thus, the diet of B. frenchii was distinguished from those of the other two species in containing substantial volumes of bivalve and gastropod molluscs and echinoid echinoderms and essentially no teleosts. Although the diets of G. hebraicum and particularly E. armatus were dominated by teleosts, and especially for larger individuals, the former species ingested greater volumes of cephalopods and small crustaceans. The pointed jaws of B. frenchii, with their forwardly <b>directed</b> and <b>interlocking</b> anterior incisors, are ideally adapted for biting and retaining their invertebrate prey, which are attached to or reside within reef crevices. In contrast, the mouths of G. hebraicum and E. armatus are broader and rounder and contain numerous small, slender and inward-pointing teeth. These teeth, in conjunction with prominent backward-curved canines in E. armatus, facilitate the capture and retention of fish prey. Observations in situ indicate that G. hebraicum is a suction feeder, while E. armatus is predominantly a ram feeder. Although reef environments on the west and south coasts differ, the diet of B. frenchii on these coasts differed only slightly. Interspecific differences in diet, combined with size-related changes in dietary compositions and the occupation of different habitats by juvenile and adult G. hebraicum, reduce the potential for competition for food resources among and within B. frenchii, G. hebraicum and E. armatus and thus helps facilitate the coexistence of these species which historically have been abundant over reefs in south-western Australia...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} three {{essays on}} corporate governance and politically connected firms are presented. The first essay “Interlocked Boards of Directors, Corporate Governance and Earnings Quality” studies {{the effects of}} interlocked boards of directors on voluntary governance disclosures, governance practices and earnings quality. The Canadian environment, where director interlocks are prevalent, is examined. A checklist of twenty voluntary disclosure measures from proxy statements is developed and a <b>direct</b> measure of <b>interlocking</b> directorships is employed. It is found that interlocked boards of directors are negatively associated with voluntary governance disclosures and positively associated with earnings quality. From an accounting perspective, greater earnings quality provides evidence that regulator rules and policies limiting interlocks may be unnecessary. Research has shown that firms can benefit when they are politically connected. The extant literature has shown that politically connected firms benefit from procurement contracts, reduced regulatory issues and lower costs of capital. However, with more politicians joining corporate boards, the effect of political connectedness on corporate governance remains unclear. The second essay is entitled “Politically Connected Directors and Corporate Governance”, and it examines the association between politically connected directors and corporate governance. A sample of high ranking politicians that have joined firm boards of directors is examined. I find that firms with politician directors have higher corporate governance scores. Additional tests also indicate that an addition of a politician to {{a board of directors}} increases the governance quality. The extant literature has also demonstrated that both political connections and cross-listing can benefit firms in various aspects, such as superior stock returns and a lower cost of capital. The third paper, entitled “The Value of Political Connections for Cross-Listed Firms”, examines whether cross-listed firms can obtain incremental financial benefits by also being politically connected. 142 Canadian cross-listed firms are examined {{to determine the extent of}} their political connections and to assess whether any incremental benefits are gained in politically connected cross-listed firms. The results show that politically connected cross-listed firms have higher analyst following, higher market valuations and greater market liquidity...|$|R
