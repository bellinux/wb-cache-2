6000|$|I {{will only}} mention one other animal, a zoophyte (I believe Virgularia Patagonica), {{a kind of}} sea-pen. It {{consists}} of a thin, straight, fleshy stem, with alternate rows of polypi on each side, and surrounding an elastic stony axis, varying in length from eight inches to two feet. The stem at one extremity is truncate, but at the other is terminated by a vermiform fleshy appendage. The stony axis which gives strength to the stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere vessel filled with granular matter. At low water hundreds of these zoophytes might be seen, projecting like stubble, with the truncate end upwards, a few inches above {{the surface of the}} muddy sand. When touched or pulled they suddenly drew themselves in with force, so as nearly or quite to disappear. By this action, the highly <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> must be bent at the lower extremity, where it is naturally slightly curved; and I imagine it is by this elasticity alone that the zoophyte is enabled to rise again through the mud. Each polypus, though closely united to its brethren, has a distinct mouth, body, and tentacula. Of these polypi, in a large specimen, there must be many thousands; yet we see that they act by one movement: they have also one central axis connected with a system of obscure circulation, and the ova are produced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals. (5/18. The cavities leading from the fleshy compartments of the extremity were filled with a yellow pulpy matter, which, examined under a microscope, presented an extraordinary appearance. The mass consisted of rounded, semi-transparent, irregular grains, aggregated together into particles of various sizes. All such particles, and the separate grains, possessed the power of rapid movement; generally revolving around different axes, but sometimes progressive. The movement was visible with a very weak power, but even with the highest its cause could not be perceived. It was very different from the circulation of the fluid in the elastic bag, containing the thin extremity of the axis. On other occasions, when dissecting small marine animals beneath the microscope, I have seen particles of pulpy matter, some of large size, {{as soon as they were}} disengaged, commence revolving. I have imagined, I know not with how much truth, that this granulo-pulpy matter was in process of being converted into ova. Certainly in this zoophyte such appeared to be the case.) Well may one be allowed to ask, What is an individual? It is always interesting to discover the foundation of the strange tales of the old voyagers; and I have no doubt but that the habits of this Virgularia explain one such case. Captain Lancaster, in his voyage in 1601, narrates that on the sea-sands of the Island of Sombrero, in the East Indies, he [...] "found a small twig growing up like a young tree, and on offering to pluck it up it shrinks down to the ground, and sinks, unless held very hard. On being plucked up, a great worm is found to be its root, and as the tree groweth in greatness, so doth the worm diminish, and as soon as the worm is entirely turned into a tree it rooteth in the earth, and so becomes great. This transformation is one of the strangest wonders that I saw in all my travels: for if this tree is plucked up, while young, and the leaves and bark stripped off, it becomes a hard stone when dry, much like white coral: thus is this worm twice transformed into different natures. Of these we gathered and brought home many." [...] (5/19. Kerr's [...] "Collection of Voyages" [...] volume 8 page 119.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the equivalent static method (or simplified spectral method) for the seismic design of the spatial asymmetric buildings presupposes {{the existence of the}} <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> (center of stiffness) -geometrical locus of the elastic centers of the floors- so as to identify the eccentricity of the static seismic loads. But, while in single-storey buildings the elastic center is always defined and has determined static properties, in multi-storey buildings the above properties are not, in general, identified and the definition of the vertical <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> is, in general, impossible. In the present doctoral thesis we will first proceed to the analysis of the cases of existence and non-existence of the <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> and of a building’s principal bending planes, according to research data. Following this stage, and based on the buildings’ “optimum torsion” criterion, the fictitious <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> is defined for every case of frame-wall multistorey building that is regular in elevation. In order to define the fictitious <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> the mathematic theory of the continuous model of the structure, which outdoes in natural comprehension, has been used.

The results indicate that with proper tailoring of planform (fixed or variable sweep), stiffner and <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> location {{it is possible to}} minimize trim requirements between selected extreme conditions. The inertial effects were found to be small for this class of aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{treats the}} {{question}} of the existence of limit cycle oscillations of prototypical aeroelastic wing sections with structural nonlinearity using the describing function method. The chosen dynamic model describes the nonlinear plunge and pitch motion of a wing. The model includes an asymmetric structural nonlinearity in the pitch degree-of-freedom. The dual-input describing functions of the nonlinearity are derived for the limit cycle analysis. Analytical expressions for the average value, and the amplitude and frequency of oscillation of pitch and plunge responses are obtained. Based on an analytical approach as well as the Nyquist criterion, stability of the limit cycles is examined. Numerical results are presented for a set of values of the flow velocities and the locations of the <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> which show that the predicted limit cycle oscillation amplitude and frequency as well as the mean value are quite close to the actual values. Furthermore, for the chosen model with linear aerodynamics, it is seen that the amplitude of the pitch limit cycle oscillation does not always increase with the flow velocity for certain <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> locations...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aerodynamic}} {{tunnel of}} the IT CAS, the interferometric {{measurement of the}} flow field around the NACA 0015 profile in flutter regime was realized. The used profile with two-degree-of-freedom moved in the vertical direction to the flow direction and rotated around the <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> in 1 / 3 of the profile chord. The Mach number for the self-excitated profile vibration was 0. 45. The profile kinematic, acting forces and moments during the self-excitation are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new methodology for {{the formulation of}} the aeroelastic stability and response problem for helicopter rotor blades. The mathematical expressions for the aerodynamic loads need not be explicit functions of the blade displacement quantities. This methodology is combined with a finite element model of the blade, and a quasilinearization solution technique. The resulting computer program is used to study the behavior of blades with noncoincident <b>elastic</b> <b>axis,</b> aerodynamic centers, and centers of mass...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{model has been}} used to study the problem of integrated control system/structural dynamic design. This model utilizes the traditional typical section lifting surface with a control surface attached in 2 -D unsteady incompressible flow. The studies have as their purpose the examination of the use of the location of the <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> of the airfoil as a design variable in the search for an actively controlled configuration that has a specified flutter margin. Items of interest include the determination of flutter speed and divergence speed as functions of a nondimensional parameter, a sub c, that measures the location (in semi-chords) of the <b>elastic</b> <b>axis</b> with respect to the airfoil midchord. All other parameters are fixed. The behavior of velocity root locus curves with changes in a sub c is illustrated. Also shown {{is an example of the}} use of sensitivity derivatives to reposition poles of the open loop system. The behavior of the actively controlled or closed loop system is also discussed. A set of examples are presented to indicate how the shear center parameter, a sub c, affects the design of the controlled system...|$|E
