40|$|Effective <b>infomediaries</b> and {{community}} engagement {{can produce a}} successful environment to service information needs for underserved populations. This paper analyzes data from libraries, telecentres and cybercaf??s in 25 developing countries, to assess how <b>infomediaries</b> {{and community}} engagement help support the social mission of venues that offer public access to {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT). Our results show that while <b>infomediaries</b> and community engagement are critical to facilitate access to information for underserved communities, cybercaf??s are thriving as public access venues without very strong <b>infomediaries</b> or community engagement, and yet they are perceived as being well staffed and serving community needs. Telecentres and, in particular, libraries, face a particular challenge to fulfill their social mission {{in the face of the}} proliferation of cybercaf??s: they must provide access to ICT, train their staff to be digitally literate and able to support the ICT needs of their communities, and ensure that their community engagement activities include ICT as part of their tools and services...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, three {{instruments}} for empowering small, individual shareholders are compared: proxy investing, proxy voting institutions and <b>infomediaries.</b> The working of each instrument is discussed with {{special emphasis on}} the problems of information gathering and coalition forming. Subsequently, each instrument is analysed with respect to appropriateness, costs and effectiveness. No instrument turns out to be clearly superior to the others. Although proxy investing is the most popular concept among small (individual) shareholders at present, the long-run potential of proxy voting institutions and <b>infomediaries</b> may be higher. Since more research could be helpful to establish which of these two options is best, both non-profit organisations and governments could in the meantime stimulate experiments with proxy voting institutions and <b>infomediaries</b> for small shareholders.

Our analysis identified a mix of private, public, non-profit and informal <b>infomediaries,</b> ranging from very large organizations to independent developers. Using a mixed-methods approach, we identified four major groups of organizations within this dynamic and diverse sector: general-purpose ICT providers, urban information service providers, open and civic data <b>infomediaries,</b> and independent and open source developers. A total of nine organizational types are identified within these four groups. We align these nine organizational types along five dimensions accounts for their mission and major interests, products and services, as well activities they undertake: techno-managerial, scientific, business and commercial, urban engagement, and openness and transparency. We discuss urban ICT entrepreneurs, {{and the role of}} informal networks involving independent developers, data scientists and civic hackers in a domain that historically involved professionals in the urban planning and public management domains. Additionally, we examine convergence in the sector by analyzing overlaps in their activities, as determined by a text mining exercise of organizational webpages. We also consider increasing similarities in products and services offered by the <b>infomediaries,</b> while highlighting ideological tensions that might arise given the overall complexity of the sector, and differences in the backgrounds and end-goals of the participants involved. There is much room for creation of knowledge and value networks in the urban data sector and for improved cross-fertilization among bodies of knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Information is an {{essential}} part of the construction value chain. In the early parts of the process information is all there is, in the later parts, information is a prerequisite for managing the process, for trade and communication between the participants in the process, and for the use of the buildings. Construction produces not only buildings, but also information about them. Important, but often unnoticed, actors in the construction industry are the <b>infomediaries,</b> who provide all parties with information. This information has traditionally been stored and distributed on paper, but exists now in digital form and consists mainly of text, pictures, computer files and, to some extent, software, i. e. information goods. The internet has changed the border conditions for the <b>infomediaries.</b> It has created new business opportunities, and threatened the existence of companies who fail to re-engineer their operations. <b>Infomediaries</b> need to adopt a technical solution with internet-based services using a multi-tier architecture, which has separate parts for data storage, data maintenance, and data output. This platform can then be used to provide information goods, and focus needs to be on the value for the customer. In order to gain a deeper understanding of value the author has, through the medium of a formal model, described the construction value network, where parts of the value chain relevant to the pursuit of customer value are modelled. The model can provide a helpful description of where information is produced and provided in order to help to pinpoint where and how value is produced. One central user of information provided by <b>infomediaries</b> is the architect. When computer programs came into use in the architects' practises, there were prejudices towards the new technology and arguments that it might limit the creativity of the architect. Via the use of a triangular division of design work into creative, combinatorial and registering work, areas can be indicated where the use of computers can be beneficial. These areas coincide with the areas where the service offerings of <b>infomediaries</b> could be found. Traditionally, value is dealt with as something that is inherent in the product; it is often seen as a part of brand building or the efforts of marketing, and can be produced and delivered as part of the product and then handed over to the customer. Later research argues that value cannot be pre-produced. It treats value as something co-produced by the customer throughout the relationship, partly in interactions between the customer and the supplier or the service provider. Value is produced and consumed simultaneously. <b>Infomediaries</b> need to gain a thorough understanding of their customers' business processes. Instead of producing products (or services), they can to become facilitators of value for their customers...|$|R

This study adds to the innovation literature by highlighting an important non-market actor, the media, on the diffusion of innovations, and to the managerial and organizational cognition literature by suggesting that affective content (emotions) and specific aspects of content (cognition) on the part of third party <b>infomediaries</b> is associated with innovation diffusion...|$|R

40|$|Software {{vulnerability}} {{identification and}} their disclosure {{has been a}} critical area of concern for policy makers. Traditionally, Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) has been acting as an <b>infomediary</b> between benign identifiers who report vulnerability information and users of the software.

In this marketbased mechanism, the <b>infomediary</b> rewards identifiers for each vulnerability disclosed to it.

40|$|While {{efforts to}} adapt to the impacts of climate change have {{generally}} increased, the impression {{is that there is a}} negligible effort to include the vulnerable areas on the agenda. This paper seeks to fill in the gap by presenting an agricultural extension mechanism to tap high school students as information providers of climate-smart rice agriculture information in their rice-farming communities. This paper looks at the characteristics of the high school students who served as <b>infomediaries</b> as well as their information sources and perceptions on climate change; the best teaching media that can be used; and the infomediation pathways that can be drawn from this initiative. Two survey rounds, 2014 (n=) and 2015 (n=), were used as data sources. Focus group discussions and interviews were also conducted. Chi-square tests were also employed. Data show that females are more likely to be <b>infomediaries</b> than males. Schools serve as the primary sources of information on climate change, and students generally equate climate change to extreme weather events such as drought. Various teaching media explored seem to be useful in various development contexts. Teachers are seen as the champions of this initiative. Hence, this initiative rests heavily on the extent of capacity enhancement that can be extended to the teachers so they are in a better position to train their students in the future...|$|R
