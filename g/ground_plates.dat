The heart of the structure is a series of rectangular frames (arcade posts and collar beams) rising approximately 5 m above the dwarf walls. The frames are transversely braced.

Formulations are derived for admittances and S-parameters of single via and multiple vias structures. The CPUs and results of S-parameters are illustrated for various sizes of via array. For the case of 16 16 via array through hybrid dielectrics in single interior layer, the CPU is about 0. 8 s per frequency and is at least three orders of magnitude faster than Ansoft HFSS. The results are within 5 % difference of accuracy up to 20 GHz. This full-wave method is able to include all the coupling effects among the multiple vias. It is also shown that the approach of using effective dielectric constant by assuming an effective homogeneous media does not give accurate results.

40|$|Mineral-insulated (MI) {{cables and}} Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) {{magnetic}} pick-up coils {{are intended to}} be installed in various position in ITER. The severe ITER nuclear radiation field is expected to lead to induced currents that could perturb diagnostic measurements. In order to assess this problem and to find mitigation strategies models were developed for the calculation of neutron-and gamma-induced currents in MI cables and in LTCC coils. The models are based on calculations with the MCNPX code, combined with a dedicated model for the drift of electrons stopped in the insulator. The gamma induced currents can be easily calculated with a single coupled photon-electron MCNPX calculation. The prompt neutron induced currents requires only a single coupled neutron-photon-electron MCNPX run. The various delayed neutron contributions require a careful analysis of all possibly relevant neutron-induced reaction paths and a combination {{of different types of}} MCNPX calculations. The models were applied for a specific twin-core copper MI cable, for one quad-core copper cable and for silver conductor LTCC coils (one with silver <b>ground</b> <b>plates</b> {{in order to reduce the}} currents and one without such silver <b>ground</b> <b>plates).</b> Calculations were performed for irradiation conditions (neutron and gamma spectra and fluxes) in relevant positions in ITER and in the Y 3 irradiation channel of the BR 1 reactor at SCK•CEN, in which an irradiation test of these four test devices was carried out afterwards. We will present the basic elements of the models and show the results of all relevant partial currents (gamma and neutron induced, prompt and various delayed currents) in BR 1 -Y 3 conditions. Experimental data will be shown and analysed in terms of the respective contributions. The tests were performed at reactor powers of 350 kW and 1 MW, leading to thermal neutron fluxes of 1 E 11 n/cm 2 s and 3 E 11 n/cm 2 s, respectively. The corresponding total radiation induced currents are ranging from 1 to 7 nA only, putting a challenge on the acquisition system and on the data analysis. The detailed experimental results will be compared with the corresponding values predicted by the model. The overall agreement between the experimental data and the model predictions is fairly good, with very consistent data for the main delayed current components, while the lower amplitude delayed currents and some of the prompt contributions show some minor discrepancies...|$|E
