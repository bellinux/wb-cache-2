50|$|The {{collection}} of archaeology of the National Museum comprises more than 100,000 objects, covering distinct cultures and important artifacts produced by several civilizations {{that lived in}} the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Middle East, since the Paleolithic Age until the 19th century. The collection is subdivided into four main segments: Ancient <b>Egypt,</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> cultures, Pre-Columbian archaeology, and Brazilian archaeology — this last nucleus, systematically gathered since 1867, is the largest segment of the archaeological collection, {{as well as the}} most important {{collection of}} its tipology in the world, covering the history of Pre-Cabraline Brazil in a very comprehensive manner and sheltering {{some of the most important}} material records related to Brazilian archaeology. It is, therefore, a collection of considerable scientific value, and object of several works of basic research, theses, dissertations, and monographs.|$|E

Eleven species were reported, two of them seem to be new to science, (Syllis sp. 1 and Syllissp. 2), but need further examination.

The objective of this study was to estimate the sexual compatibility, mating performance and relative sterility between laboratory and wild flies of the Mediterranean fruit fly, C. capitata by new indices (relative mating index, RMI; relative isolation index, RII; isolation index, ISI; male relative performance index, MRPI; female relative performance index, FRPI and relative sterility index, RSI). The results revealed that different doses of gamma radiation 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 Gy had no effect on the various parameters of mating compatibility, performance and competitiveness of lab strain males of medflies when mated with wild males. Moreover, no significant assortative or disassortative mating was observed. Therefore, we suggest that the lab strain males of medfly are compatible of mating with the wild males, at least under the laboratory conditions employed here. ...|$|E

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} {{of the distribution of}} crustaceans from shallow hard bottoms along the Alexandria coast (<b>Egypt,</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea) were studied during a complete year cycle and also in relation to potential drivers of change (both biotic and abiotic), including variation in habitat-forming species. Overall, the crustacean assemblages appeared poor, including only 14 species belonging to Amphipoda (five species), Isopoda (five species), Tanaidacea (two species), Cirripedia and Decapoda (one species each). The distribution {{patterns of}} crustacean assemblages appeared significantly variable both in the spatial and in the temporal dimension on a rather unpredictable basis, albeit variation was related to changes in dominant algal and invertebrate habitat formers. High variability and low species richness observed suggest that the analyzed assemblages are selected by local unfavorable environmental conditions. In fact, the crustacean hard bottom fauna is composed by a bulk of tolerant forms, including the dominant Tanais dulongi, Apohyale perieri, Dynamene bidentata, Sphaeroma serratum, Elasmopus pectenicrus, and Jassa marmorata. Their spatio-temporal dynamics, {{as well as those of}} the remaining species, and correlations with the variation of habitat formers and environmental variables are reported. This is a baseline assessment of the crustacean diversity along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, thus having paramount importance for understanding the predicted future changes of biodiversity for the area...|$|E

50|$|From 1868 {{until the}} end of his reign, Khedive Ismail ordered the {{construction}} of lighthouses at different points across <b>Egypt's</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast.

Ismail commissioned French architect François Coignet to design the lighthouse, and oversee its construction. Coignet used the novel technique of building the lighthouse out of reinforced concrete. The lack of nearby stone quarries and the cost of importing stone from elsewhere caused those in charge of construction to become interested in the use of concrete.|$|R

40|$|Future sea-level changes {{along the}} Mediterranean Egyptian coast (southern Levantine sub-basin) are {{projected}} using satellite altimetry data and model simulations. Twenty-one years (1993 – 2013) of satellite altimetry data, represented by dynamic topography (DT), are examined {{in light of}} tide-gauge observations. Current DT changes are examined with respect to five atmospheric/oceanic factors. The qualities of three realizations of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model are examined by comparing these with DT. Finally, the simulations best describing the present DT are used to describe projected sea-level changes in the study area. The results indicate that DT {{can be used to}} study coastal and deep-water sea-level changes in the study area. The southern Levantine sub-basin sea level has recently risen by an average of 3. 1  cm decade− 1 and exhibits significant annual sea-level variation of − 17  cm to 8  cm. The sea-level variation is significantly affected by several factors: sea-level variation west of the Gibraltar Strait, steric sea level, and sea-surface temperature. The GFDL simulations best describing the recent sea level over the study area, i. e., GFDL-CM 3 and GFDL-ESM 2 M, are used to calculate the two-model ensemble mean (GFDL- 2 ENM), which indicates that <b>Egypt's</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast will experience substantial sea-level rise (SLR) this century. The estimated uncertainty over the study area was 4 – 22  cm by 2100, with the emission assumptions dominating the three sources of uncertainty sources. Comparing the projected SLRs with digital elevation data indicates that <b>Egypt's</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast will only be safe from flooding by 2100 if effective adaptation methods are applied...|$|R
