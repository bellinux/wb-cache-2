5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a sheet metal blank is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] <b>drawing</b> when the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drawn</b> part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part {{through a series of}} dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.|$|R

Therefore, a new approach named electromagnetic pulse assisted progressive deep drawing is proposed in this paper. This method gains the radial electromagnetic force which helps to push the sheet metal in radial direction by placing the circular thrust coil upon and underneath the flange, while gaining the axial electromagnetic force by placing drawing coil {{in the bottom of}} the punch. The results shows that the placement of the radial thrust coil has significant effect on the sheet metal's state and distribution of stress-strain; In addition, the interaction <b>of</b> the axial <b>drawing</b> force and the radial thrusting force has great effect on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the deep <b>drawing</b> cylindrical parts...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a cold forming process in which a tool forces a sheet metal flat blank into a die cavity. By definition, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drawn</b> part {{is greater than the}} tool diameter.

The image analysis may represent a suitable approach for the mathematical implementation of images. Such a treatment is based on the manipulation of the Gray Level image, which is firstly converted into another simplified image with a lower number of grey levels. Then, the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is created and finally analyzed. In the GLCM all the elements represent a correlation index among the image pixels. Given an image, the textures analysis relies on the possibility of quantifying image characteristics. Among them we have considered, as possible indicator candidates, first order parameters, such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, and second order ones, such as dissimilarity, contrast, homogeneity, angular second moment, energy, entropy, correlation...|$|R

40|$|The {{superior}} temporal sulcus (STS) is {{an intriguing}} region both for its complex anatomy {{and for the}} multiple functions that it hosts. Unfortunately, most studies explored either the functional organization or the anatomy of the STS only. Here, we link these two aspects by investigating anatomo-functional correspondences between the voice-sensitive cortex (Temporal Voice Areas) and the STS depth. To do so, anatomical and functional scans of 116 subjects were processed such as to generate individual surface maps on which both depth and functional voice activity can be analyzed. Individual <b>depth</b> profiles <b>of</b> manually <b>drawn</b> STS and functional profiles from a voice localizer (voice > non-voice) maps were extracted and compared to assess anatomo-functional correspondences.

Second, there is an anatomo-functional correspondence between {{the location of the}} voice-sensitive peak and the deepest point inside this asymmetrical region bilaterally. Finally, we showed that this correspondence was independent of the gender and, using a machine learning approach, that it existed at the individual level.

40|$|A common way {{to present}} 3 D {{materials}} to human observers nowadays is by stereoscopic displaying on 3 D TVs or head-mounted displays {{such as the}} Oculus Rift. However, not everyone can see three-dimensional solid shape from stereoscopic viewing and the three-dimensional images remain two-dimensional pictures to them rather than solid shapes. Scientists and artists {{have spent a lot}} of effort in finding ways to dissolve pictorial space into visual space. In other words, they want to figure out how to create a sense of stereopsis in an observer when he or she is looking at non-stereo and stereo pictures. There are many monocular depth cues in addition to binocular disparity that can enhance depth perception, and these cues can therefore also create an impression of stereopsis when the viewing conditions are right. One <b>of</b> these <b>depth</b> cues is <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is defined as the distance range in which objects are perceived as sharp. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is a popular photographic technique that effectively makes the main subject in a picture appear sharp and the foreground and background blurred. The goal of this thesis is to understand the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field in pictures from a relatively low perceptual level to a relatively high cognitive level. This thesis mainly reveals how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the impression of stereopsis and how binocular disparity influences the perception <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. I start the thesis with a study on the discrimination thresholds <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. Then, a subjective study is reported in which I investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception for binocular viewing. The next two studies address the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on a more cognitive level. The first of these two studies explored the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection in pictures. The other one was conducted to evaluate how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the aesthetic appeal and overall quality in photographs. Four subjective studies were conducted to achieve our goals. The cornerstone of the work described in this thesis is that humans are much more sensitive to changes in small <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field than in large <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. A second important finding is that stereoscopic viewing does not significantly affect discrimination thresholds. Based on the discrimination thresholds that were measured in this study, I selected five levels <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field that can be well discriminated under stereo viewing conditions in the second study to explore the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception. I found that the presence <b>of</b> strong <b>depth</b> cues, in this case binocular disparity, weakens the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field as a depth cue when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is small. In contrast, when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is not small, perceived depth decreases with increasing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field irrespective of whether binocular disparity is zero or not. With respect to the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection, I found that <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field directs viewers' attention similarly under both non-stereo and stereo viewing conditions. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field does however weaken the effect of binocular disparity on change detection. In the final study, I found that there are no common rules on how to manipulate <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field to make pictures more beautiful or have higher quality.
