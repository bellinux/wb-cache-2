5|$|Judge José A. Cabranes {{presided over}} {{the case in the}} United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In order to defeat a defense motion to dismiss the case in 1987, the plaintff called a number of expert {{witnesses}} including psychologist Margaret Singer, author of Cults <b>in</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Midst,</b> and psychiatrist and neurologist James Merikangas. Both Singer and Merikangas submitted affidavits asserting that Slee's death was related to the est training. After the defendants refused to respond to discovery requests, on January 18, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment, for failure of the defendants to comply with discovery, which was denied. In 1991, before the case came to trial, defendant Erhard left the country. In 1992, a jury heard the wrongful death lawsuit. During the trial, the defendants called a number of expert witnesses, including medical experts.|$|E

In 1860, at a meeting to choose New York's delegates to the Democratic convention in Charleston, S.C., Wood outlined his case against the abolitionist cause and the [...] "Black Republicans" [...] who supported it. He was of the opinion that [...] "until we have provided and cared for the oppressed laboring man <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own <b>midst,</b> we should not extend our sympathy to the laboring men of other States." [...] During his second mayoral term in January 1861, Wood suggested to the New York City Council that New York secede and declare itself a free city, to continue its profitable cotton trade with the Confederacy.|$|R

25|$|This sentimental, anti-intellectual form of pietism {{is seen in}} {{the thought}} and {{teaching}} of Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravians; but more intellectually rigorous forms of pietism are seen in the teachings of John Wesley, which were themselves influenced by Zinzendorf, and in the teachings of American preachers Jonathan Edwards, who restored to pietism Gerson's focus on obedience and borrowed from early church teachers Origen and Gregory of Nyssa the notion that humans yearn for God, and John Woolman, who combined a mystical view of the world with a deep concern for social issues; like Wesley, Woolman was influenced by Jakob Böhme, William Law and The Imitation of Christ. The combination of pietistic devotion and mystical experiences that are found in Woolman and Wesley are also found in their Dutch contemporary Tersteegen, who brings back the notion of the nous ("mind") as the site of God's interaction with our souls; through the work of the Spirit, our mind is able to intuitively recognize the immediate presence of God <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>midst.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1892, {{at the age}} of 41, Cobden married Thomas Fisher Unwin, an avant-garde {{publisher}} whose list included {{works by}} Henrik Ibsen, Friedrich Nietzsche, H.G. Wells and the young Somerset Maugham. Unwin's involvement in a range of world and humanitarian causes led Cobden—who adopted the surname [...] "Cobden Unwin"—to extend her interests to international peace and justice, reform in the Congo, and more generally the rights of aboriginal peoples. She and Unwin opposed the Boer War (1899–1902); both were founder-members of the pro-Boer South African Conciliation Committee, Cobden acting as the committee's secretary. The couple settled in South Kensington, from where Cobden continued to pursue her own causes. In 1893, with Laura Ormiston Chant, she represented the WFL in Chicago at the World Congress of Representative Women. At home, she assisted women candidates in the 1894 Kensington [...] "vestry" [...] elections. In 1900 she accepted the presidency of the Brighton Women's Liberal Association, and in the same year wrote an extended tract, The Recent Development of Violence <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>Midst,</b> published by the Stop-the-War Committee.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages". Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>midst,</b> Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E

500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>midst.</b> In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E

Beyond the furrow of the border, a sea of hatred and desire for revenge is swelling, awaiting the day when serenity will dull our path, for the day when we will heed the ambassadors of malevolent hypocrisy who call upon us to lay down our arms.
