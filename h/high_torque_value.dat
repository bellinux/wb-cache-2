In this paper the proper structure selection of AFPM machine for {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) application {{is one of the}} aims. To reduce the losses and the total volume of machine, the coreless TORUS-NS type machine is selected. Designing of this machine, to obtain a wide speed range with high efficiency, low cogging torque and <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> <b>value,</b> as in-wheel direct-drive AFPM machine for HEV, is investigated. The operation performance in low and medium speed ranges is studied. A new design method based on multi speed design (MSD) strategy is proposed. Using this method with a coreless type of stators, the total AFPM machine efficiency at the HEV operation cycles could be improved. Performance analysis of this in-wheel AFPM machine is done using finite-element method (FEM). FEM analysis of the single-speed design (SSD) method is also done.

40|$|Intramuscular pressures, {{electromyography}} (EMG) and torque generation during isometric, concentric and eccentric maximal isokinetic muscle activity {{were recorded}} in 10 healthy volunteers. Pressure and EMG activity were continuously and simultaneously measured {{side by side in}} the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles. Ankle joint torque and position were monitored continuously by an isokinetic dynamometer during plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the foot. The increased force generation during eccentric muscular activity, compared with other muscular activity, was not accompanied by higher intramuscular pressure. Thus, this study demonstrated that eccentric muscular activity generated <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> for each increment of intramuscular pressure. Intramuscular pressures during antagonistic co-activation were significantly higher in the tibilis anterior muscle (42 - 46 % of maximal agonistic activity) compared with the soleus muscle (12 - 29 % of maximal agonistic activity) and was largely due to active recruitment of muscle fibers. In summary, eccentric muscular activity creates <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> with no additional increase of the intramuscular pressure compared with concentric and isometric muscular activity...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Modifications in implant surface {{topography}} {{and chemistry}} may alter the early bone response at different levels. This study characterized four implant surfaces and evaluated the biomechanical fixation and histologic response at early implantation {{times in a}} canine radius model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: External-hexagon Branemark-type implants were used with four experimental surfaces: microblasted (MI), acid-etched and microblasted (AAM), anodized (A), and discrete crystalline deposition (DCD). Surface topography was assessed by scanning electron microscopy, interferometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The implants {{were placed in the}} central region of the radii of eight beagle dogs and remained in vivo for 10 or 30 days. The implants were torqued to interface failure, and a general linear statistical model with torque as the dependent variable and implant surface and time in vivo as independent variables was used. RESULTS: All surfaces presented were textured, and different surface chemistries were observed. No significant differences between implant surfaces were observed for torque at 10 days. However, at 30 days, the AAM surface presented significantly <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> compared to the DCD and A surfaces.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different insertion torques on healing of implants loaded immediately or left unloaded. MATERIAL AND METHODS In six Labrador dogs, all mandibular premolars and molars were extracted. After 4 months of healing, flaps were elevated, and two implant sites were prepared at {{each side of the}} mandible. The distal sites were prepared conventionally while the mesial sites were underprepared by 0. 3 mm. As a consequence, different final insertion torques of about 30 Ncm at the distal and > 70 Ncm at the mesial sites were recorded. Healing abutments were applied to the left and transmucosal abutments to the right side. Flaps were sutured, crown preparation of the upper right second and third premolars was performed, and impressions were taken. Within 24 h, crowns were cemented both to implants and teeth in {{the right side of the}} mouth. After 4 months, the animals were sacrificed and ground sections obtained for histological evaluation. RESULTS A higher buccal bony crestal resorption and a more apical position of the coronal level of osseointegration were found at the loaded compared with the unloaded sites. MBIC% and percentages of peri-implant mineralized tissue (MB%) were higher at the loaded compared with the unloaded sites. Moreover, a higher MBIC% was found at the lower compared with the higher final insertion torque. CONCLUSIONS Immediate loading does not seem to have a negative effect on osseointegration. High torque values for the immediate loading procedures were not necessary. Probably, low torque values, were sufficient to obtain primary stability and hence may provide better osseointegration than <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> <b>value...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aggressive engine downsizing, {{variable}} {{compression ratio}} {{and use of the}} Atkinson cycle are being combined to improve fuel economy by up to 40 percent relative to port fuel injected gasoline engines, while maintaining full engine power. Approach Engine downsizing is viewed by US and foreign automobile manufacturers {{as one of the best}} options for improving fuel economy. While this strategy has already demonstrated a degree of success, downsizing and fuel economy gains are currently limited. With new {{variable compression ratio}} technology however, the degree of engine downsizing and fuel economy improvement can be greatly increased. A small variable compression ratio (VCR) engine has the potential to return significantly higher vehicle fuel economy while also providing high power. Affordability and potential for near term commercialization are key attributes of the Envera VCR engine. VCR Technology To meet torque and power requirements, a smaller engine needs to do more work per stroke. This is typically accomplished by boosting the incoming charge with either a turbo or supercharger so that more energy is present in the cylinder per stroke to do the work. With current production engines the degree of engine boosting (which correlates to downsizing) is limited by detonation (combustion knock) at high boost levels. Additionally, the turbo or supercharger needs to be responsive and efficient while providing the needed boost. VCR technology eliminates the limitation of engine knock at high load levels by reducing compression ratio to {approx} 9 : 1 (or whatever level is appropriate) when high boost pressures are needed. By reducing the compression ratio during high load demand periods there is increased volume in the cylinder at top dead center (TDC) which allows more charge (or energy) to be present in the cylinder without increasing the peak pressure. Cylinder pressure is thus kept below the level at which the engine would begin to knock. When loads on the engine are low the compression ratio can be raised (to as much as 18 : 1) providing high engine efficiency. It is important to recognize that for a well designed VCR engine cylinder pressure does not need to be higher than found in current production turbocharged engines. As such, there is no need for a stronger crankcase, bearings and other load bearing parts within the VCR engine. The Envera VCR mechanism uses an eccentric carrier approach to adjust engine compression ratio. The crankshaft main bearings are mounted in this eccentric carrier or 'crankshaft cradle' and pivoting the eccentric carrier 30 degrees adjusts compression ratio from 9 : 1 to 18 : 1. The eccentric carrier is made up of a casting that provides rigid support for the main bearings, and removable upper bearing caps. Oil feed to the main bearings transits through the bearing cap fastener sockets. The eccentric carrier design was chosen for its low cost and rigid support of the main bearings. A control shaft and connecting links are used to pivot the eccentric carrier. The control shaft mechanism features compression ratio lock-up at minimum and maximum compression ratio settings. The control shaft method of pivoting the eccentric carrier was selected due to its lock-up capability. The control shaft can be rotated by a hydraulic actuator or an electric motor. The engine shown in Figures 3 and 4 has a hydraulic actuator that was developed under the current program. In-line 4 -cylinder engines are significantly less expensive than V engines because an entire cylinder head can be eliminated. The cost savings from eliminating cylinders and an entire cylinder head will notably offset the added cost of the VCR and supercharging. Replacing V 6 and V 8 engines with in-line VCR 4 -cylinder engines will provide high fuel economy at low cost. Numerous enabling technologies exist which have the potential to increase engine efficiency. The greatest efficiency gains are realized when the right combination of advanced and new technologies are packaged together to provide the greatest gains at the least cost. Aggressive engine downsizing with variable compression ratio and use of the extended Atkinson cycle can provide large fuel economy gains that are exceptionally cost effective. Analysis indicates that a 2. 2 L supercharged Envera VCR engine can match the torque of a larger V 8 engine at 2000 rpm. The VCR engine's <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> at low engine speed is beneficial for maintaining the driving feel and responsiveness of the larger V 8 engine. The Envera VCR engine will attain high efficiency at {approx} 100 Nm primarily due to the combination of engine down-sizing and use of the Atkinson cycle. Qualitatively the fuel economy gain realized from down-sizing from a V 8 to an Atkinson-cycle I- 4 is about twice as large as the benefits from down-sizing from a V 8 to a Turbo V 6 when evaluated at 100 Nm 2000 rpm...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} find out whether a {{wearable}} strain sensor including thermoplastic polyurethane composite with a multi-walled carbon nanotube network could be a viable alternative to an isokinetic dynamometer for the measurement of knee-extensor muscle strength. For the first time, the voltage-torque and angle-time relations of the sensor were determined to allow a comparison between the angle-dependent torque changes of the dynamometer and the sensor. This comparison suggested that the torque-angle relations of the dynamometer and the sensor did not have the same characteristics. In this regard, the sensor may be used in the torque measurements due to the moderate correlation between the <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> determined via the isokinetic dynamometer and the sensor and due to the significant difference between low and <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> of the sensor.

Material and Methods: Thirty-two implant sites were prepared in eight veal rib blocks. Sixteen sites were prepared using the conventional drilling sequence recommended by the manufacturer to a working depth of 10 mm. The remaining 16 sites were prepared using an oversize drilling technique (overpreparation) to a working depth of 12 mm. Bone density was determined using cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). The implants were placed and primary stability was measured by two methods: insertion torque (Ncm), and RFA (implant stability quotient [ISQ]).

This clamp force is affected by many other variables too: the bolt diameter. The type and number of threads on the bolt, the bolt material and the torque applied.

These relationships were measured with a specially designed mechanical device that allowed inversion movements with angular velocities up to 850 deg/sec. In testing the bare ankle under static conditions, the torque showed a 10 -fold increase within {{the full range of}} motion (average, from 0. 9 N-m at 7 degrees to about 8 N-m at 48 degrees of inversion). The slope of the angle-torque relationship increased under dynamic conditions giving <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> (up to 18 N-m on average). Both orthoses induced similar additional torques that increased linearly, up to about 6 N-m at 45 degrees, with higher angles of inversion. These additional torques are small compared with the amount of stress applied to the foot during a typical ankle sprain situation, such as recovering from a jump. Therefore, we propose that orthotic devices increase the ankle torque, counteracting the inversion movement, and also prevent the start of the inversion movement by preloading and maintaining the ankle in a proper anatomic position with optimal contact between the articular surfaces...|$|R

Additionally, {{it presents a}} comparison of the methods both in static and dynamic states. The methods, in a specific way, make use of an increased number of active vectors of the three-level inverter in order to improve control quality and reduce switching frequency. The two methods modify the DTC method by using its advantages and eliminating, at the same time its drawbacks. In static states the comparison was {{based on the results of}} investigations performed for two different load values and three set values of angular speed, whereas in dynamic states the comparison was focused on the behavior of the machine at startup. The results of the investigations have shown that both methods give very good performance.

40|$|First public study {{reports of}} oral implant {{insertion}} were dated {{in the early}} 20 th century. Besides the research for the best fitted material for the oral implants, great affords were done to achieve a periodontal like connection. In 1969 Br√•nemark et al report the outcome of their developed titanium implant. The success of this implant is attributed to a direct connection of bone with the implant (osseointegration). They recommend the submerged healing, {{three to four months}} in the lower and four to six months in the upper jaw before loading. Within this study ten edentulous patients were treated with each five machined-surface Br√•nemark implants in the lower jaw. After a healing period of up to 20 days, the implant supported prosthesis was fixed. After a follow up of five years, the overall long-term treatment outcome success was at 80 %. The implants that did not osseointegrate have been removed and replaced ad modum Br√•nemark. The marginal bone levels were stable, after the first year of loading, the observed bone loss was within the suggested 0, 2 mm/year. Due to the high implant loss, the success criteria proposed by Albrektsson et al were not fulfilled by this study. The outcome of an oral rehabilitation with implants is influenced by several variables, which can be separated in three groups. The first group is determined by the patient and its given conditions like the different amount and quality of bone, which can barely be manipulated. The relationship between bone density, initial stability, and successful osseointegration has been generally accepted by clinicians and confirmed. Smoking and general diseases may have an influence for the outcome of the therapy, but at the moment cannot be properly determined, whereas habits like bruxism and clenching cause overwhelming stress on the early implant-bone contact. Poor oral hygiene is associated with increased marginal bone loss and thus might cause implant failures. Concerning the different materials, variables as the implant length, the surface, the direction of implant loading and the insertion torque are of great interest. At the beginning, there were many clinicians who recommended the use of long implants to achieve a strong bicortical anchorage with a high primary stability. Due to the results of present studies, the use of shorter implants is favoured. It could often be demonstrated, that there is a significant difference in removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> between machined implants an implants with rough surfaces, so that there is a high agreement in the recommended use of rough surface implants. The implants should be loaded axially to avoid destructive forces. There are also controversial opinions about the insertion torque. On the one hand, <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> are strived for to achieve a high primary mechanical stability, on the other hand might these <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> provoke necrosis and minifractures which endanger the implant healing. The operative and prostodontic procedure is similar to the unloaded healing except the healing time, which is of high importance for the manufacturing of the supraconstruction. New tryouts by using computertomographs allow the planning and manufacturing before inserting the implants and may avoid any complications. Although in this study machined implants were used with a reduced healing time of about 20 days and the early loading of the implants by a fixed prothesis in the lower jaw, there could be demonstrated an implant survival rate of 80 %. On account of the high implant failures the success criteria proposed of Albrektsson et al were not fulfilled. The main reason for this high failure rates might probably the use of machined surface implants. At the time of implantation, there where no rough surface implants by Nobel Biocare available, which show better results in many following studies. Possible other reasons might be the loading within the first three weeks after insertion, reduced insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values,</b> the existence of occlusal contacts on the cantilevers, which might cause an overwhelming load on the distal implants. Additionally distal implants show higher peak axial forces and bending moments when antagonizing a removal denture.

Such contacts can cause permanent root damage and implant instability. Increased torque levels during implant insertion (the index test) {{could be a}} more accurate and immediate measure for diagnosing implant-root contact (the target condition) than radiographs (the reference standard) and could ultimately lead to a reduction or elimination of X-ray exposure. To address this issue, we asked three questions: (1) whether OMIs with root contact had <b>higher</b> insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> than those without, (2) what is {{the accuracy of the}} index test compared with the reference standard to diagnose the target condition and what are the adverse effects of the index test, and (3) whether intermediate <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> have clinical diagnostic utility.

We applied broad spectrum eligibility criteria that included randomized and non-randomized studies on clinical, animal, and cadaver models. Not including such models would be unethical because it could slow down knowledge creation on the adverse effects of implant insertion. We conducted searches in more than 40 electronic databases including MEDLINE and 10 journals were hand-searched. Grey literature and reference lists were also searched.

Mean differences (MD) between these effect estimates were statistically significant in one beagle model (MD, 4. 64; 95 % CI, 3. 50 to 5. 79) and three subgroups of cadaver studies (MD, 2. 70; 95 % CI, 1. 42 to 3. 98) (MD, 3. 97; 95 % CI, 2. 17 to 5. 78) (MD, 0. 93; 95 % CI, 0. 67 to 1. 20). Highest mean differences were identified in most self-drilling compared with pre-drilling groups. Clinical heterogeneity between studies was high, and many items were underreported. All studies except one cadaver study scored at least one domain as 'serious risk' of bias. No studies addressed the second research question. One cadaver study addressed the third question which showed the importance of recording torque levels during the entire implant insertion process. Responses of contacted authors were helpful, but often difficult to obtain. Implants fractured in one animal and in one cadaver model. All eligible studies scored <b>higher</b> insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> for implants with root contact than those without, but none of these studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the index test. The inclusion of non-randomized and animal and cadaver models in this systematic review provided key findings that otherwise would have been wasted. Such studies are important {{in the context of the}} wide applicability of this test, the high prevalence of the target condition, and the underreporting of adverse effects of interventions. A protocol for a potential new diagnostic pathway was presented, and the importance of contacting authors was addressed. The applicability of the findings should be interpreted in the context of underreporting and the many limitations of the included studie...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} sought to compare the {{estimated}} resultant muscle force required throughout the range of motion in two variations of elbow flexion exercise: the Scott exercise, performed {{with the aid of}} a Scott bench, and the unsupported exercise, performed with the upper arm simply resting on the leg. METHOD: Eight healthy individuals performed each exercise eight times, with the same 4 kg load. The biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles were monitored using surface electromyography and the elbow joint movement was measured using an electrogoniometer. A mechanical model of the situation was proposed to evaluate the resultant muscle force acting throughout the range of motion of the exercise. RESULTS: Comparisons between the two exercise variations presented significant differences (p< 0. 01) in practically all of the angles. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the model suggests that greater muscle demand is not necessarily associated with <b>higher</b> resistance <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> in the exercise as it is fundamental to take into consideration the moment arm of the muscles involved...|$|R
40|$|In vivo loads acting at the {{hip joint}} have so far only been {{measured}} in few patients and without detailed documentation of gait data. Such information is required to test and improve wear, strength and fixation stability of hip implants. Measurements of hip contact forces with instrumented implants and synchronous analyses of gait patterns and ground reaction forces were performed in four patients during the most frequent activities of daily living. From the individual data sets an average was calculated. The paper focuses on the loading of the femoral implant component but complete data are additionally stored on an associated compact disc. It contains complete gait and hip contact force data as well as calculated muscle activities during walking and stair climbing and the frequencies of daily activities observed in hip patients. The mechanical loading and function of the hip joint and proximal femur is thereby completely documented. The average patient loaded his hip joint with 238 % BW (percent of body weight) when walking at about 4 km/h and with slightly less when standing on one leg. This is below the levels previously reported for two other patients (Bergmann et al., Clinical Biomechanics 26 (1993) 969 - 990). When climbing upstairs the joint contact force is 251 % BW which is less than 260 % BW when going downstairs. Inwards torsion of the implant is probably critical for the stem fixation. On average it is 23 % larger when going upstairs than during normal level walking. The inter- and intra-individual variations during stair climbing are large and the <b>highest</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> are 83 % larger than during normal walking. Because the hip joint loading during all other common activities of most hip patients are comparably small (except during stumbling), implants should mainly be tested with loading conditions that mimic walking and stair climbing...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: A novel {{technique}} {{based on}} plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) {{is presented to}} modify titanium implant surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, the implants are cleaned with argon to remove contaminants and the nanostructures are created by the bombardment of the surface {{with a mix of}} noble gases. Desired crystal structure of the titanium is obtained by the implantation of oxygen on the contaminant-free surface with particular nanostructures. RESULTS: In this study, turned implants modified by PIII revealed a high density of rutile-TiO 2 nanostructures. Turned implants used as control revealed mainly microstructures and amorphous crystal structure. Surface roughness values were similar at the microscale for both turned and turned + PIII implants. Bone response was evaluated by removal torque tests of implants placed in the rabbit tibia and femur. After 4 weeks of healing, turned + PIII demonstrated <b>higher</b> removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> (P = 0. 001) compared to turned implants. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of rutile-TiO 2 nanostructures may explain the improved bone formation to turned + PIII implants...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: New microplasma spray (MPS) {{equipment}} to deposit calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic coatings onto titanium substrates has been developed. With this apparatus, {{it is possible}} to spray fine particles, as well as to apply textured hydroxylapatite coatings onto titanium surfaces. Moreover, due to the low heat power of the microplasma jet, overheating of the powder particles as well as excessive local overheating of the substrate is reduced. Furthermore, because of the small laminar plasma jet, {{it is possible to}} achieve high spray efficiency in the case of spraying of dental implants. Additionally, the low level of noise (25 - 50 dB) and hardly any dust makes it possible to operate the MSE under normal workroom conditions. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the biological properties of different MPS - CaP coatings on titanium implants when inserted into the femoral condyle of goats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For histomorphometrical evaluation as well as mechanical testing, 48 screw-type titanium implants were inserted into the femoral condyles of 12 goats each. The implants were either coated with a conventionally plasma-sprayed CaP ceramic, MPS CaP ceramic, or acid-etched without an additional CaP coating. Six and 12 weeks after implantation, the animals were sacrificed and bone-to-implant contact, amount of bone, as well as mechanical bone fixation were evaluated. RESULTS: For bone-to-implant contact no statistically significant difference was found between the different CaP coatings. However, statistically significant differences were found between non-coated, acid-etched titanium implants and CaP-coated implants after 6 and 12 weeks of healing. The bone values were not statistically significantly different between the different CaP coatings at 6 and 12 weeks. Furthermore, CaP ceramic-coated implants showed statistically significantly <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> compared with the non-coated implants after 6 and at 12 weeks of healing. No significant differences existed between the various types of CaP coatings. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our observations, we conclude that conventionally plasma-sprayed CaP ceramic-coated implants, as well as MPS-coated implants have a comparable effect on adjacent bone response...|$|R
40|$|Crude {{palm oil}} (CPO) {{is one of}} the {{vegetable}} oil that has potential for use as a fuel in diesel engine. Despite years of improvement attempts, the high viscosity and the major chemically bound oxygen component in the biodiesel fuel play as a key element during combustion process. Purpose {{of this study is to}} explore how significant the effect of preheated biodiesel blends on the engine performance and emission. The blending of biodiesel was varied from 5 vol%(B 5) ~ 45 vol%(B 45) and preheated fuel temperature from 40 oC~ 60 oC. The engine speed was varied from 1500 rpm~ 3000 rpm and the load test conditions of 100 % are considered. The performances parameter study of diesel engine in brake power, torque and flywheel torque are described together with the emissions parameter such as opacity, hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon oxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and oxygen (O 2). Under high load condition, preheated biodiesel blends were found enhancing the combustion process, resulting in better performances. Increased preheated fuel temperature, <b>higher</b> in <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> and brake power increases significantly as the engine speed increases...|$|R
40|$|This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} mechanical cycling on the torque of retaining screw in external hexagon implants with platform switching (PS), regular platform (RP) and wide platform (WP). A total of 30 specimens were equally divided into 3 groups: PS, PR and WP. Each specimen was prepared with implants: 3. 75 x 10 mm for RP group and 5. 0 x 10 mm for PS and WP groups and its respective abutment with 32 Ncm torque. All groups were subjected to 106 cycles with 100 N (corresponding to about 40 months of chewing). The results were obtained with the reverse torque of each specimen and data were evaluated using ANOVA and Tukey test (p< 0. 05). The PS group showed statistically significant difference in screw removal torque (30. 06 &# 177; 5. 42) compared with RP (23. 75 &# 177; 2. 76) and WP (21. 32 &# 177; 3. 53) (p< 0. 05) groups; the RP and WP groups showed {{no statistically significant difference}} between them. It was concluded that the PS group showed <b>higher</b> reverse <b>torque</b> <b>value,</b> suggesting lower susceptibility of the abutment screw loosening...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{influence}} of implant bed preparation, using either Er:YAG laser ablation, piezoelectric surgery or drill osteotomy, on osseointegration of titanium dental implants after 4, 6, and 8 weeks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 108 implants (Camlog) were placed in the pelvis of 6 sheep (18 implants/sheep). Implant sites were prepared by an Er:YAG laser, a dental drill or a piezoelectric device. For each time period, six implants were used for biomechanical removal torque testing and six implants for a semi-quantitative histological assessment of the bone-to-implant contact (BIC). RESULTS: An initially missing implant adjusted site preparation led to slightly <b>higher</b> BIC and <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> in the piezoelectric and laser groups due to a press-fit effect after 4 weeks. Statistical analysis of the average mean BIC after 4, 6, and 8 weeks revealed no significant differences (P > 0. 05) between the different osteotomy techniques. Comparison of individual removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> showed the <b>highest</b> value for laser osteotomy after 8 weeks (1, 698. 50 +/- 67. 52 Nmm), which was significantly higher than the corresponding value for drill osteotomy (P = 0. 006). CONCLUSION: Although BIC and removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> decreased in the laser and piezoelectric groups at 6 weeks during an active remodeling process, favorable and superior BIC as well as <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> could be demonstrated at 8 weeks. Thus laser and piezoelectric osteotomy seem to be at least comparable to drill osteotomy, concerning early osseointegration and implant stability...|$|R
40|$|The main {{advantage}} of claw-pole machines lies {{in their ability}} to yield <b>higher</b> <b>torque</b> density <b>values</b> than is obtainable from a conventional machine. However, the <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> density has its price; leakage flux is often high resulting in low power factor and efficiency. This thesis is mainly concerned with the design of a claw-pole motor that meets application requirements of reasonably <b>high</b> <b>torque</b> density and a power factor comparable to conventional topologies. After critically reviewing previously proposed designs of Transverse-flux and Claw-pole machines, the thesis focuses on a special type of claw pole motor having claws in both the stator and the rotor. The claws are made of Soft Magnetic Composites (SMC); consisting of iron powder particles that are individually insulated and can be readily pressed into complex geometries. Detailed explanation of the operation of such a design is then provided. Internal design of the claw-pole motor is investigated with the aid of three-dimensional finite-element field computation. In particular, the effect of the following parameters on the motor's performance has been investigated: number of poles, main dimensions, magnet material and dimensions, pole-face profile and claw angle. This theoretical work was verified, to some extent, against measurements obtained from an experimental machine especially constructed for this purpose. Details of this experimental motor are also presented. The investigation of the internal design of the claw-pole motors presented in this thesis provides a physical insight into their operation and, therefore, can be utilised for their general design. Indeed, this work enabled realisation of a claw-pole servomotor that is capable of achieving a torque density of about 1. 5 Nm/Kg at a power factor of 0. 9. The decisions made in arriving at the servomotor design are presented and clearly related to the conclusions of the internal design investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{fit of the}} implant-abutment {{interface}} {{was assessed}} by the metallographic technique and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using solid abutment types at different torque levels. Forty Morse taper connections and forty solid abutments were used at different torque levels (repeated after 10 minutes) in the following groups (n = 10) : 25 Ncm (group g 1), 30 Ncm (group g 2), 35 Ncm (group g 3), and 40 Ncm (group g 4). The samples were embedded in a metallographic resin, sectioned lengthwise, and polished. SEM images were {{used to measure the}} linear contacts and the fits between abutments and the internal walls of the implant. The overall mean gap and standard deviation were as follows: 9. 0 ¬± 1. 36 ¬µm for group g 1, 7. 9 ¬± 2. 81 ¬µm for group g 2, 2. 0 ¬± 0. 76 ¬µm for group g 3, and 0. 3 ¬± 0. 40 ¬µm for group g 4. A significant difference was observed in the average fit values between the groups (p < 0. 05). The linear area of contact between the abutment and the implant increased as torque augmented. This study demonstrated that <b>higher</b> insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> in a conical internal connection increase the fit (contact) of the implant-abutment interface...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} hip abductor and adductor {{peak torque}} outputs and compare their ratios between sexes. Design: A cross-sectional laboratory-controlled study. Setting: Participants visited a laboratory and performed an isokinetic hip abductor and adductor test. All participants performed 2 sets of 5 repetitions of concentric hip abduction and adduction in {{a standing position}} at 60 degrees per second. Gravity was determined {{as a function of}} joint angle relative to the horizontal plane and was corrected by normalizing the weight of the limb on an individual basis. Participants: A total of 36 collegiate athletes. Independent Variables: Sex (20 females and 16 males). Main Outcome Measures: Bilateral peak hip abductor and adductor torques were measured. The 3 <b>highest</b> peak <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> were averaged for each subject. Results: Independent t tests were used to compare sex differences in hip abductor and adductor peak torques and the abductor:adductor peak torque ratios. Males demonstrated significantly greater hip abductor peak torque compared with females (males 1. 29 ¬± 0. 24 Nm/kg, females 1. 13 ¬± 0. 20 Nm/kg; P = 0. 03). Neither hip adductor peak torque nor their ratios differed between sexes. Conclusions: Sex differences in hip abductor strength were observed. The role of weaker hip abductors in females deserves further attention and may be a factor for higher risk of knee pathologies...|$|R
