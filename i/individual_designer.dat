40|$|This is {{a conference}} paperUser-centred design is now {{established}} {{as an important}} aspect of design training. This approach employs the centrality of the user both as resource and focus for design. Developing this the authors put forward the concept of an <b>individual</b> <b>designer’s</b> empathic horizon (McDonagh-Philp and Denton, 1999). This can be defined as the individual’s range of understanding and empathy for user experiences in different contexts. It is suggested that the further a designer can develop their empathic horizon the better they are able to design for given ranges of users. This paper firstly examines the concepts of user-centred design and <b>individual</b> <b>designer’s</b> empathic horizon. The paper makes proposals as to how user-centred design approaches could be employed at a school-level to develop the <b>individual</b> student <b>designer’s</b> empathic horizon.

Charted Canvas designs are typically printed in two ways: either in grid form with each thread intersection being represented with a symbol that shows what color {{is meant to be}} stitched on that intersection, or as a line drawing where the stitcher is to trace the design onto his canvas and then fill in those areas with the colors listed. Books typically include a grouping of designs from a single designer such as Kaffe Fassett or Candace Bahouth, or may be centered on a theme such as Christmas or Victorian Needlepoint.

5000|$|During {{my first}} few moments in England, the appalling {{destruction}} {{of homes and}} churches alike, along with the courage of the British people, made it desirable to link their sacrifice with ours. —Major Rev. Harold Appleyard, August 1946 Most of the firm's {{work has been done}} elsewhere in southeast England for Anglican and Roman Catholic churches—either in the company's own name or in the name of an <b>individual</b> <b>designer</b> working for them. [...] One commission also came from outside England. In the early 1940s, Major Rev. Harold Appleyard, an army chaplain from The Royal Regiment of Canada, started collecting fragments of stained glass from church windows destroyed by World War II bombing. He had already accumulated shards from more than 100 damaged churches in countries across Europe when in 1944, immediately after 40 soldiers from the regiment died at Louvigny, he found a piece of bright red glass from the French town's bombed church. This inspired him to turn his collection of fragments into a window to commemorate them and other victims of the war. [...] He had already spent part of his tour of duty in England (his glass collection included shards from Coventry Cathedral, St James's Church in Dover and several of Christopher Wren's London churches), and after the war he returned to the country to find a stained glass manufacturer that could create a window from the hundreds of fragments—preferably using the old-fashioned technique of using sawdust as a drying agent. [...] He approached Cox & Barnard, and their designers were able to produce six mosaic-style windows; these were shipped to Canada and taken to Appleyard's parish church—Christ Church Anglican in Meaford, Ontario—where they were installed and dedicated in 1946 in a ceremony broadcast in Britain and Canada.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{requirements}} for an information system for design and outline a prototype that tests these principles {{in the context of}} building design.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} and discusses {{aspects of the}} responses of student engineering designers to an innovative conceptual design problem in kinematics: {{the design of a}} three dimensional mechanism required to ensure the successful operation of axial flow turbomachinery. The focus of the research was the development of design ideas and argumentation by <b>individual</b> <b>designers,</b> their capacity for thinking flexibly when generating different classes of proposal and when handling different lines of concept development as they explored the potential embodiments of different working principles. It was found possible to represent each designer’s sequences of ideas and argument by means of a branching tree-like structure, as each new proposal evolved through the progressive solution of problems and subproblems. Construction of these design trees enabled the measurement of designer performance in terms of flexibility of thinking and the capacity for elaborating the physical embodiments of alternative working principles. The ways in which <b>individual</b> <b>designers</b> identified the boundaries of the stated problem and how most, but not all, accepted geometrical symmetry as an implicit constraint were noted and discussed in the context of overall designer performance...|$|R
