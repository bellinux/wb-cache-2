5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Other {{places where}} A.auricula-judae has been {{recorded}} as commonly consumed include Poland, Mozambique and Indonesia, while, in Bolivia, Goeldi's monkeys have been recorded as commonly <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> sporocarps. Koreans commonly use it in japchae.|$|E
5|$|Since 1770, all Australian quoll {{species have}} {{declined}} in number owing to habitat loss caused by urbanization.

5|$|The Fool's Gold Loaf {{has been}} {{included}} in numerous publications and cookbooks. The Fool's Gold Loaf was included and generated national interest with David Alder's book The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley.

5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida stone crab. Crabs can crush the snail's shell, <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they can close the aperture using the operculum.|$|E

5|$|The adult russet sparrow {{is mostly}} a seed-eater, <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, {{such as those of}} the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had such a low reproductive success {{that they could not}} be maintained without immigration.|$|E

5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the types}} of insects {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly to break up before <b>eating.</b> <b>The</b> latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Homer is watching the news on Halloween night while eating candy, which ends up being taken by Jimbo and Kearney after they threaten to egg his house. Marge and the kids return home after trick-or-treating with a big haul of candy. Despite warnings from Marge that <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> candy will cause nightmares, Homer, Lisa, and Bart eat from the large candy pile. That night, all three try to sleep, and Lisa is the first to have a nightmare.|$|E

5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> babies. The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
50|$|Eucalyptus saligna regenerates by regrowing from epicormic buds on {{the trunk}} and lower {{branches}} after bushfire. Trees live for over two hundred years.

5|$|In {{a typical}} day, each crew member divided {{his time between}} {{physical}} exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and <b>eating).</b> <b>The</b> crew's daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a typical morning {{had been scheduled to}} begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC. But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. <b>Eating</b> <b>the</b> fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E

50|$|Many rivers {{fed into}} the sea {{bringing}} leaves and driftwood from the land. These served as {{the base of the}} food chain. Bacteria and other microscopic scavengers <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> decaying wood. Plankton <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> bacteria. Clams filtered the small plankton. Snails <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> clams and were eaten in turn by crabs and fish. Mosasaurs and cephalopods <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> fish and crabs. Some organisms were swimmers or floaters, but most lived on or in the sandy mud of the sea bottom. This layer of sandy clay, bones, and shells became the Coon Creek Formation.|$|R
