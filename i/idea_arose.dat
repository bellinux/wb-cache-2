5|$|According to an anecdote, the <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> after a {{group of}} Royal Navy {{officers}} saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power, and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Rockefeller {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the Potantico Expressway, a connector from the to-be-constructed Hudson River Expressway (NY9A) to the Taconic State Parkway. Some opposition to the <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> {{on the grounds that}} the new highway would only benefit the Rockefeller estate and not the residents. Nonetheless, construction began on the Potantico Expressway (now known as Phelps Way) in 1969. When the highway was completed in November1970, it became part of a rerouted NY117. NY117's former alignment along Bedford Road became NY448. The Hudson River Expressway project was cancelled in 1971, and the western stub of the expressway now serves Phelps Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The central {{stars of}} {{planetary}} nebulae are very hot. Their luminosity, though, is very low, implying {{that they must}} be very small. Only once a star has exhausted all its nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size, and so planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding, and so the <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|E

25|$|While the {{equipment}} for the airborne forces was under development, it was decided by War Office officials that gliders would be an integral component of such a force. It was initially thought that gliders {{would be used to}} deliver paratroops. Transport aircraft would both carry paratroops and tow a glider with a second party to troops. The <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> {{as a response to the}} severe shortage of transport aircraft in the early part of the war, as in this way the number of troops that could be drooped in an operation by a given number of transport aircraft would be greatly enhanced. The empty gliders would be towed back to base.|$|E
500|$|Another {{idea that}} has drawn {{attention}} {{for several decades}} is that consciousness is associated with high-frequency (gamma band) oscillations in brain activity.

[...] Rodolfo Llinás, for example, proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus) thalamocortical systems (context) interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations.|$|E

[...] In 1972, looking to move on from Doctor Who, the pair started considering a number of ideas for other shows they could collaborate on. [...] Their first <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> from the successful collaboration they had with the Royal Navy on the Doctor Who serial The Sea Devils which led to them considering pitching a serial set on a frigate only to find they were too late – the BBC had just commissioned a series, Warship, with that very premise. In late 1972, they developed the concept of Moonbase 3, as an anthology series set on a lunar colony that would [...] "provide intelligent, realistic drama rather than Science Fantasy", and submitted a pilot script, titled [...] "Departure and Arrival", to Shaun Sutton, the Head of Drama at the BBC. [...] The series was formally commissioned in December 1972 and would be made, as a co-production [...] between the BBC and 20th Century Fox and the ABC network in America, during the break in production between Seasons 10 and 11 of Doctor Who.|$|E

2500|$|Clan Undead credits United Ranger Films with inspiring them to {{make their}} own film.

According to Henry Lowood of Stanford University, this marked a shift toward {{narrative}} conventions of linear media, in contrast to earlier gameplay-based machinima works, such as Diary of a Camper and Quake done Quick. However, filming still required both the ability to program game modifications and to play proficiently. According to Lowood, Clan Undead probably recorded the raw footage [...] "in a small number of continuous runs". Because there were no publicly available machinima software tools at the time, they handled the significant pre- and post-production work through custom scripts in QuakeC, an interpreted programming language developed for Quake.|$|E
2500|$|From 1810 to 1820, Iturbide {{had fought}} {{against those who}} sought to {{overturn}} the Spanish monarchy and Bourbon dynasty's right to rule New Spain and replace that regime with an independent government. In this, he was solidly aligned with the Creole class. [...] However, events in Spain caused problems for this class, as the very monarchy they were fighting for was in serious trouble. The 1812 Cadiz Constitution, that was reinstated in Spain in 1820 after the successful Riego Revolt, established a constitutional monarchy, which greatly limited Ferdinand VII's powers. There was serious concern in Mexico that the Bourbons {{would be forced to}} abandon Spain altogether. This led to the disintegration of viceregal authority in Mexico City and a political vacuum developed that the Mexican nobility sought to fill, seeking limited representation and autonomy for themselves within the empire. An <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> among this class that if Mexico became independent or autonomous, and if Ferdinand were deposed, he could become king of Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{conventional}} molecular cloning experiment, the DNA to be cloned is obtained from an organism of interest, then treated with enzymes {{in the test}} tube to generate smaller DNA fragments. Subsequently, these fragments are then combined with vector DNA to generate recombinant DNA molecules. The recombinant DNA is then introduced into a host organism (typically an easy-to-grow, benign, laboratory strain of E. coli bacteria). This will generate a population of organisms in which recombinant DNA molecules are replicated along with the host DNA. Because they contain foreign DNA fragments, these are transgenic or genetically modified microorganisms (GMO). This process {{takes advantage of the}} fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take up and replicate a single recombinant DNA molecule. This single cell can then be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule. Thus, both the resulting bacterial population, and the recombinant DNA molecule, are commonly referred to as [...] "clones". Strictly speaking, recombinant DNA refers to DNA molecules, while molecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them. The <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> that different DNA sequences could be inserted into a plasmid and that these foreign sequences would be carried into bacteria and digested as part of the plasmid. That is, these plasmids could serve as cloning vectors to carry genes.|$|E
2500|$|From the 18th century, England and Wales {{experienced}} {{a revival of}} interest in the druids. John Aubrey (1626–1697) had been the first modern writer to (incorrectly) connect Stonehenge and other megalithic monuments with the druids; since Aubrey's views were confined to his notebooks, the first wide audience for this idea were readers of William Stukeley (1687–1765). It is incorrectly believed that John Toland (1670–1722) founded the Ancient Druid Order however the research of historian Ronald Hutton has revealed that the ADO was founded by George Watson MacGregor Reid in 1909. The order never used (and still does not use) the title [...] "ArchDruid" [...] for any member, but falsely credited William Blake as having been its [...] "Chosen Chief" [...] from 1799 to 1827, without corroboration in Blake's numerous writings or among modern Blake scholars. Blake's bardic mysticism derives instead from the pseudo-Ossianic epics of Macpherson; his friend Frederick Tatham's depiction of Blake's imagination, [...] "clothing itself in the dark stole of moral sanctity"— in the precincts of Westminster Abbey— [...] "it dwelt amid the druid terrors", is generic rather than specifically neo-druidic. John Toland was fascinated by Aubrey's Stonehenge theories, and wrote his own book about the monument without crediting Aubrey. The roles of bards in 10th century Wales had been established by Hywel Dda and it was during the 18th century that the <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> that druids had been their predecessors.|$|E

6000|$|About a {{year after}} he had {{returned}} from the continent (in June, 1766,) he again visited his native country, where he had the satisfaction to find his mother and sister still living. At Edinburgh {{he met with the}} two Humes, Robertson, Adam Smith, Blair, and Ferguson; but the bodily ailments, under which he was labouring, left him little power of enjoying the society of men who had newly raised their country to so much eminence in literature. To his friend, Dr. Moore, then a chirurgeon at Glasgow, who accompanied him from that place, to the banks of Loch Lomond, he wrote, in the February following, that his expedition into Scotland had been productive of nothing but misery and disgust, adding, that he was convinced his brain had been in some measure affected; for that he had had a kind of coma vigil upon him from April to November, without intermission. He was at this time at Bath, where two chirurgeons, whom he calls the most eminent in England, and whose names were Middleton and Sharp, had so far relieved him from some of the most painful symptoms of his malady, particularly an inveterate ulcer in the arm, that he pronounced himself to be better in health and spirits than during any part of the seven preceding years. But the flattering appearance which his disorder assumed was not of long continuance. A letter written to him by David Hume, on the 18th of July following, shews that either the state of his health, or the narrowness of his means, or perhaps both these causes together, made him desirous of obtaining the consulship of Nice or Leghorn. But neither the solicitations of Hume, nor those of the Duchess of Hamilton, could prevail on the Minister, Lord Shelburne, to confer on him either of these appointments. In the next year, September 21, 1768, the following paragraph in a letter from Hume convinced him that he had nothing to expect from any consideration for his necessities in that quarter. [...] "What is this you tell me of your perpetual exile and of your never returning to this country? I hope that, as this <b>idea</b> <b>arose</b> from the bad state of your health, it will vanish on your recovery, which, from your past experience, you may expect from those happier climates to which you are retiring; after which, the desire of revisiting your native country will probably return upon you, unless the superior cheapness of foreign countries prove an obstacle, and detain you there. I could wish that means had been fallen on to remove this objection, and that at least it might be equal to you to live anywhere, except when the consideration of your health gave the preference to one climate above another. But the indifference of ministers towards literature, which has been long, and indeed almost always is the case in England, gives little prospect of any alteration in this particular." ...|$|E
