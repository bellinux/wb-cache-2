40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash planetary <b>gear</b> {{system that has}} an input sun <b>gear,</b> a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' <b>gear</b> above the sun <b>gear,</b> a split ring <b>gear</b> that has a fixed lower ring <b>gear</b> coaxial with the sun <b>gear</b> and a rotating upper ring <b>gear</b> also coaxial with the sun <b>gear.</b> A preload bolt is used for securing the split ring <b>gears</b> together. Within the split ring <b>gear</b> is an even number of planet <b>gears</b> between the split ring <b>gear</b> and the sun <b>gear.</b> Each planet <b>gear</b> consists of an upper planet <b>gear,</b> and lower planet <b>gear</b> with {{the upper and lower}} planet <b>gears</b> splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet <b>gears.</b> The lower planet <b>gear</b> meshes with the input sun <b>gear</b> and the fixed ring <b>gear</b> while the upper planet <b>gear</b> is driven by the lower planet <b>gear</b> and meshes with the rotating ring <b>gear...</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{epicyclic}} <b>gear</b> train {{consists of}} two <b>gears</b> mounted so that the center of one <b>gear</b> revolves around {{the center of the}} other. A carrier connects the centers of the two <b>gears</b> and rotates to carry one <b>gear,</b> called the planet <b>gear,</b> around the other, called the sun <b>gear.</b> The planet and sun <b>gears</b> mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip.

In this simplified case, the sun <b>gear</b> is fixed and the planetary <b>gear(s)</b> roll around the sun <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the <b>geared</b> turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|The two battleships of the Nevada-class were {{virtually}} identical except in their propulsion.

50|$|If {{a simple}} <b>gear</b> train has three <b>gears,</b> {{such that the}} input <b>gear</b> GA meshes with an {{intermediate}} <b>gear</b> GI which in turn meshes with the output <b>gear</b> GB, then the pitch circle of the intermediate <b>gear</b> rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output <b>gears.</b> This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this <b>gear</b> train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this <b>gear</b> ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the <b>gears</b> GA and GB engage directly. The intermediate <b>gear</b> provides spacing but does not affect the <b>gear</b> ratio. For this reason it is called an idler <b>gear.</b> The same <b>gear</b> ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler <b>gears</b> and hence an idler <b>gear</b> is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven <b>gear.</b> If the driver <b>gear</b> moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven <b>gear</b> also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} idler <b>gear.</b>|$|R

5|$|After her {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional <b>geared</b> turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises {{and the development of}} tactical operations.|$|E

The most sophisticated timekeeping astrolabes were the <b>geared</b> astrolabe mechanisms designed by Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī in the 11th century and by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the 13th century.
