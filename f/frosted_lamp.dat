40|$|Tungsten halogen lamps {{are widely}} used as sources of radiant {{intensity}} because of their compactness and long life. Little is known, however, about their usefulness as secondary standards of radiant intensity. What is unknown is the polar distribution of the emitted light. If it is irregular in space, {{it may be possible}} to use a frosting as a means of providing for a more uniform distribution. In addition, use of a black sleeve over the lamp may be used to control emitted light, and also control the temperature of the lamp. To perform the experiment, a lampholder was designed and constructed, which allows the lamp to be moved on its horizontal and vertical axis. The lampholder was set up on an optical bench along with a foot-candle meter, for lamp testing. Using this set up a clear lamp, and lamps frosted by mechanical buffing and acid treatement were tested for direction characteristics. A black sleeve was designed and constructed and tested with the machine <b>frosted</b> <b>lamp.</b> Experimentation shows favorably tward the fact that a machine <b>frosted</b> <b>lamp</b> can be used as a secondary standard...|$|E

5000|$|At the {{centrally}} located main entrance, the marble steps fan out, {{flanked by a}} cast-iron railing. It supports cast iron and <b>frosted</b> glass <b>lamps</b> on bronze standards. The doorway is recessed in a brick arch with marble keystone, carved with an oval chrysanthemum patera, and impost blocks paneled on the outer facings and autographed on the inner ones. Above the entry a marble panel reads [...] "Henry Sabin Chase Memorial Dispensary".|$|R
50|$|Designed by Jacob Wrey Mould and {{dedicated}} in the 1860s, this ornamental structure was originally {{designed as a}} watering trough for horses during the 19th century. The fountain consists of a granite dome and sculpted bluestone basin inset with Minton tiles. Crowning this 14-foot high tower are eight <b>frosted</b> round glass <b>lamps</b> and a golden spire.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate different heating methods for thermal structural testing of large scale structures at temperatures up to 350 °F as part of the High Speed Research program. The heating techniques evaluated included: radiative/convective, forced convective, and conductive. The radiative/convective heaters included finned strip heaters, and clear and <b>frosted</b> quartz <b>lamps.</b> The forced convective heating was accomplished by closed loop circulation of heated air. The conductive heater consisted of heating blankets. The tests were conducted on an 1 / 8 inch thick stainless steel plate in a custom-built oven. The criteria used for comparing the different heating methods included test specimen temperature uniformity, heater response time, and consumed power. The parameters investigated included air circulation in the oven, reflectance of oven walls, and the orientation of the test specimen and heaters (vertical and horizontal). It was found that reflectance of oven w [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Mosque lamps of glass, {{enamelled}} {{and often}} with gilding, survive in considerable {{numbers from the}} Islamic art of the Middle Ages, especially the 13th and 14th centuries, with Cairo in Egypt and Aleppo and Damascus in Syria the most important centres of production. [...] They are oil lamps, usually with a large round bulbous body rising to a narrower waist, above which the top section is flared. There is usually a foot {{so they can be}} placed on a surface, but they were normally used suspended by chains that went through a number of loops {{on the outside of the}} body. They were used to light mosques and other buildings in mosque complexes, in large spaces in groups hanging from a circular metal frame. The circular frames continue to be used in many mosques today, but with plain or <b>frosted</b> glass <b>lamps</b> for electric lighting.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} comforts and amenities of Columbia {{were highly}} innovative and advertised as luxurious. She {{had a large}} refrigeration room in her stern for holding food items such as fresh meat. The large refrigerator was capable of keeping a constant cold temperature regardless of the outside temperature. Columbia also included ventilation and heating systems. The main saloon included a Bohemian glass shade illuminated by an electric light bulb. The remainder of the saloon's light bulbs were encased in <b>frosted</b> glass <b>lamp</b> fixtures. The main dining room boasted French walnut, Hungarian ash, mahogany and Maple wooden paneling. Wooden furniture and carpeting further complimented the room's elegance. Telephones were provided in key rooms to allow easier communication between the ship's crew. The bridge was fitted with electrical indicators and monitoring equipment which would have alerted the captain {{the status of the}} engine as well as simplifying commands between the captain and engine room. Columbia had first class state rooms for 250 individuals and could accommodate 600 steerage passengers. The first class state rooms had paneling and furniture commonly seen on first class Pullman rail cars on passenger trains, including folding berths in place of conventional beds. Columbia also boasted fresh water plumbing still system.|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark and very cold, {{and there was}} a sharp hard <b>frost.</b> But the <b>lamps</b> of the car were lighted, and the horse seemed to be on his mettle, for he did his work well. Ballydahan Hill was not above a mile from the glebe, and {{descending}} that, Richard, by his young master's orders, got down from his seat and went to the animal's head. Herbert also himself got off, and led his horse down the hill. At first the girls were a little inclined to be frightened, and Miss Letty found herself obliged to remind them that they couldn't melt the frost by screaming. But they all got safely down, and were soon chattering as fast as though they were already safe in the drawing-room of Castle Richmond.|$|R
40|$|The {{fluorescent}} lamp, a new light-source {{which is}} called the "ideal light", was experimentally compared with the incandescent lamp on the quantitative basis, and the undermentioned conclusions were obtained. (1) In Lange's Standard-Beleuchtungsmesser, the photoelectric current is accurately proportional to the intensity of illumination, and the error is within a range of about 5 % as checked with the Hefner's lamp, proving {{that it is an}} excellent photo-cell illuminometer. (2) In photometry, if there is a space more than double the length of mojor axis, the error is slight even though the inverse square law is applied. (3) The green fluorescent lamp is the highest in luminous intensity and lamp efficiency, which values lessen in order of the white fluorescent lamp, daylight fluorescent lamp, blue-white fluorescent lamp, pink fluorescent lamp and blue fluorescent lamp. (4) The comparison between the value of luminous intensity as measured by Bechstein's Flimmerphotometer and the values obtained by photometers of other types proves the following: (a) The error is generally small in Weber's photometer, but in case of green, blue-white or blue light, which differs in color of light, the measurement of R-G is impracticable. (b) The error in Bechstein's Luxmeter is less than 5 % in any colors of light except green. However, in measurement of different colors other than the so-called "white", there is a trend that the judgement of equilibrium is apt to accompany difficulties. (c) Errors in Tavolux are rather great, but this is considered to be due to the variation caused by age. (d) In Lange's Standard-Beleuchtungsmesser, the error is small in case of white lights, but is fairly great in case of heterochromatic lights. Generally it is difficult to make the physical eye perfectly in accord with the international standard visibility curve, hence there is the need to obtain the light-meter correction factors with respective photometers. (5) Brightness is extremely small in fluorescent lamps, being 0. 46 c/c㎡ for the white fluorescent lamp, and 0. 37 c/c㎡ for the daylight fluorescent lamp, or so small as 1 / 70 of the 100 W <b>frosted</b> incandescent <b>lamp,</b> whereas the lamp efficiency is so high as 5 ～ 7 times the incandescent lamp. (6) The bulb-wall temperature of a fluorescent lamp is very low, while its heat radiation is small. It is a so-called cool light. (7) It is desirable to light a fluorescent lamp at an ambient temperature within the range of 10 °～ 30 °C. The maximum luminous intensity is attained at the temperature of 20 °～ 21 °C. (8) In photometric measurement of a fluorescent lamp, it must be carried out after the lapse of more than 10 minutes from the time when the lamp is lit first. (9) One-fifths of both end-parts of a fluorescent lamp are darker by about 30 % as compared with other parts of the lamp. (10) In the horizontal illumination curve of fluorescent lamp, there is witnessed a peculiar refraction at the horizontal distance of 50 cm rigth beneath the light-source. (11) When measuring the luminous intensity and illumination, the location and direction of light-source must always be kept constant. (12) The variation in luminous intensity for every 1 % of the change in the voltage of light-source is 1. 8 % with the fluorescent lamp, and such variations are lineal as shown in graph. In the incandescent lamp, the variation in luminous intensity grows large in proportion to the rise in voltage, and keep the relations between each other which are represented by a curve. The variations in intensity of illumination within any given time-unit are far less in frequency and degree compared with the incandescent lamp, and are less affected by the fluctuations in the voltage of the source of electric supply...|$|R
