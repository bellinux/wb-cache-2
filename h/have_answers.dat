500|$|As the {{daughter}} of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she {{earned a reputation as}} a [...] "wild child," [...] which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, [...] "I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not <b>have</b> <b>answers</b> for anything and see if people understand." [...] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, [...] "I'm so in love with my brother right now." [...] She dismissed the rumors, saying, [...] "It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus," [...] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.|$|E

500|$|... "The Sixth Extinction" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review, noting that the episode takes the themes of [...] "Biogenesis" [...] and [...] "runs with them". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode a [...] "B+". Tucker praised series creator Chris Carter's writing ability, stating that [...] "the kickoff episode suggests the author's limitless imagination for sustaining his alien-nation tropes". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two called the episode [...] "the most arresting season opener in years" [...] and noted that it [...] "promises that maybe there's life in the old mythology yet." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did critique the lack of finality to the episode, but attributed most of this {{to the fact that}} the episode was the second of a three-part mythology tale. Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi ranked [...] "The Sixth Extinction," [...] along with [...] "Biogenesis" [...] and [...] "," [...] as the fifth best episode of the series, writing, [...] "it is evident that as [...] progressed, the episodes surrounding those storylines and the breaking points Mulder and Scully endured push them further and further towards total, irreversible defeat. This is especially poignant when viewing this anxiety inducing trio of episodes." [...] Monica S. Kuebler of Exclaim magazine called [...] "The Sixth Extinction", along with [...] "Biogenesis" [...] and [...] "Amor Fati", one of the [...] "best" [...] episodes during the show's [...] "colonization" [...] phase. Kenneth Silber of Space.com wrote positively of the episode, hoping that it foreshadowed answers to come, writing [...] "As the middle installment of a three-part story and what was then thought to be the final season premiere of The X-Files, 'The Sixth Extinction' is suffused with a somber pre-apocalyptic mood, but one vivified by the possibility that soon we'll <b>have</b> <b>answers</b> to the most important outstanding mysteries of the series." ...|$|E

Yet there is another stone that I alone can throw, another plan that I alone can practise, and that not always.
