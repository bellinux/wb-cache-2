25|$|As of 2009 {{holders of}} COMEX <b>gold</b> <b>futures</b> have {{experienced}} problems taking delivery of their metal. Along with chronic delivery delays, some investors have received delivery of bars not matching their contract in serial number and weight. The delays cannot be easily explained by slow warehouse movements, as the daily reports of these movements show little activity. Because of these problems, {{there are concerns}} that COMEX {{may not have the}} gold inventory to back its existing warehouse receipts.|$|E
25|$|Contracts are {{negotiated}} at futures exchanges, which act as {{a marketplace}} between buyers and sellers. The buyer of a contract {{is said to be}} long position holder, and the selling party is said to be short position holder. As both parties risk their counter-party walking away if the price goes against them, the contract may involve both parties lodging a margin {{of the value of the}} contract with a mutually trusted third party. For example, in <b>gold</b> <b>futures</b> trading, the margin varies between 2% and 20% depending on the volatility of the spot market.|$|E

50|$|Central banks {{continue}} to keep {{a portion of their}} liquid reserves as gold in some form, and metals exchanges such as the London Bullion Market Association still clear transactions denominated in <b>gold,</b> including <b>future</b> delivery contracts.Today, <b>gold</b> mining output is declining.With the sharp growth of economies in the 20th century, and increasing foreign exchange, the world's gold reserves and their trading market have become a small fraction of all markets and fixed exchange rates of currencies to gold have been replaced by floating prices for <b>gold</b> and <b>gold</b> <b>future</b> contract.Though the <b>gold</b> stock grows by only 1 or 2% per year, very little metal is irretrievably consumed.

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{imitation}} between traders and their herding behaviour not {{only lead to}} speculative bubbles with accelerating over-valuations of financial markets possibly followed by crashes, but also to "anti-bubbles" with decelerating market devaluations following all-time highs. For this, we propose a simple market dynamics model in which the demand decreases slowly with barriers that progressively quench in, leading to a power law decay of the market price decorated by decelerating log-periodic oscillations. We document this behaviour on the Japanese Nikkei stock index from 1990 to present and on the <b>Gold</b> <b>future</b> prices after 1980, both after their all-time highs. We perform simultaneously a parametric and non-parametric analysis that are fully consistent with each other. We extend the parametric approach to the next order of perturbation, comparing the log-periodic fits with one, two and three log-frequencies, the latter one providing a prediction for the general trend in the coming years. The non-parametric power spectrum analysis shows the existence of log-periodicity with high statistical significance, with a prefered scale ratio of λ≈ 3. 5 for the Nikkei index λ≈ 1. 9 for the <b>Gold</b> <b>future</b> prices, comparable to the values obtained for speculative bubbles leading to crashes. ...|$|R
