In 2003, Mohammad Gani http://sb.iub.edu.bd/Dr_Mohammad_Osman_Gani.html, a pupil of Leontief, introduced consistency analysis in his book 'Foundations of Economic Science' (...) , which formally looks exactly like the <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> but explores the dependency relations in terms of payments and intermediation relations. Consistency analysis explores the consistency of plans of buyers and sellers by decomposing the <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> into four matrices, each for a different kind of means of payment.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} to develop a methodology of the compilation of symmetric Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables</b> under the conditions of the Czech Republic. The following aim is to create an input-output model which is based on the compiled symmetric Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables.</b> For the practical applications of this model it is crucial to link the created Input-Output model with the Semi-Dynamic Input-Output model. Semi-Dynamic Input-Output model in the conception of the submitted dissertation thesis takes into account several multiplier effects and presents more comprehensive tool {{for the use of the}} Input-Output analyses in this way. The first chapter focuses on the development of the issues linked to the <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables</b> and analyses on the territory of the Czech Republic and in the world as well. The second chapter which is also theoretical is focused on mapping of different kinds of Input-Output analyses which are done in the world using Physical, Time or Hybrid <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables.</b> The third chapter is a purely methodological because here it is described the methodology of the compilation of symmetric Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables</b> as well as methodological approach to the various sensitivity analyses.

40|$|As part of {{national}} accounts, <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> are becoming crucial statistical tools {{to study the}} economic, social and environmental impacts of globalization and international trade. In particular, global <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> extend the national dimension to the international dimension by relating individual countries’ <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> among each other, thus providing an opportunity to balance the global economy as a whole. Concerning emissions of greenhouse gases, the relative position that countries hold among their main trade partners {{at the global level}} is a key issue in terms of international climate negotiations.

50|$|Leontief {{earned the}} Nobel Prize in {{economics}} {{for his work}} on input-output tables. Input-output tables analyze the process by which inputs from one industry produce outputs for consumption or for inputs for another industry. With the <b>input-output</b> <b>table,</b> one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good. The analysis assumes that input proportions are fixed; thus the use of input-output analysis is limited to rough approximations rather than prediction. Input-output was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work; in 2010 its iterative method was recognized as an early intellectual precursor to Google's PageRank.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, this {{relationship}} between the contribution of Pasinetti and Input-Output models, valid for a static analysis, vanishes in a dynamic analysis. The matrix of technical coefficients, i.e., {{the link between the}} two methods of analysis, evolves over time due to technical change and change of production methods in the economy. That is, we would require an <b>Input-Output</b> <b>table</b> at each point in time for the dynamic analysis of an economy. However, the movement of vertically integrated coefficients can be analyzed over time, as these relationships include the expressions of technical change. This is the reason why the analysis in terms of vertically integrated coefficients is most appropriate for dynamic analysis. We can go back, however, to an inter-sectoral analysis (Input-Output) with reference to any given point in time when we are interested in it.|$|E
5000|$|However, many {{developed}} countries estimate input-output accounts annually and with much greater recency. This is because while most uses of the input-output analysis focus on the matrix set of inter-industry exchanges, the actual focus of the analysis {{from the perspective of}} most national statistical agencies is the benchmarking of gross domestic product. Input-output tables therefore are an instrumental part of national accounts. As suggested above, the core <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> reports only intermediate goods and services that are exchanged among industries. But an array of row vectors, typically aligned at the bottom of this matrix, record non-industrial inputs by industry like payments for labor; indirect business taxes; dividends, interest, and rents; capital consumption allowances (depreciation); other property-type income (like profits); and purchases from foreign suppliers (imports). At a national level, although excluding the imports, when summed this is called [...] "gross product originating" [...] or [...] "gross domestic product by industry." [...] Another array of column vectors is called [...] "final demand" [...] or [...] "gross product consumed." [...] This displays columns of spending by households, governments, changes in industry stocks, and industries on investment, as well as net exports. (See also Gross domestic product.) In any case, by employing the results of an economic census which asks for the sales, payrolls, and material/equipment/service input of each establishment, statistical agencies back into estimates of industry-level profits and investments using the input-output matrix as a sort of double-accounting framework.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{a number of studies}} have been {{presented}} that link material flow accounting and input-output analysis (based on monetary <b>input-output</b> <b>tables)</b> for the calculation of direct and indirect resource inputs for production and consumption activities. The compilation of the first physical <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> for some European countries in the 1990 s opened new possibilities for linking physical accounting and input- output analysis. Physical input-output analysis has so far only been applied for selected materials, but it has not been used for comprehensive assessments of material requirements of economic activities. In this paper, possibilities and limits of this new input-output approach are clarified. We present and discuss a procedure similar to monetary input- output analysis and develop an alternative approach to account for primary inputs and waste otherwise not included in the analysis. Based on aggregated <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> for Germany, we present numerical examples intended to compare the alternative approaches of physical input-output analysis.

Then, the regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> {{is used to}} analyse the production structures in Selangor. Design/Methodology/Approach – The regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for Selangor is estimated by applying the RAS technique. Accordingly, under the homogeneity assumption of production structures and technologies between Selangor and Malaysia, the structure of Selangor’s inter-industry is estimated based {{on the structure of}} national inter-industry transactions. Findings – Results showed that Selangor has modest production structure and highly dependent on imports and exports. The inter-industry linkages analysis indicated that manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and government service sectors are the key sectors in Selangor, where these sectors have potential to stimulate growth in the economy.
