5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E
5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

25|$|Ursa Minor is not {{the only}} {{constellation}} that does not look very much like what it represents; very few do. This has led to nicknames for some of the constellations. These nicknames are another variety of asterism. A <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stick-figures shown in the charts under the constellation names will easily explain the origin of these asterisms.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} overall sales volumes {{were from the}} start lower than Panhard had {{anticipated}} for the car, which {{may have contributed to}} arguments against progressing development of the four-door version that had been envisaged. Although mid-size two-door saloons sold in reasonable numbers in Germany and the Alpine countries, a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sales data suggests that in the French market four doors were a precondition for healthy sales volumes.|$|E
25|$|It was so {{constructed}} as to receive animals; guns, pistols, and cutlasses {{hung on the}} walls; and these, with curious saddles and primitive riding gear, might lead a visitor to imagine he had entered a pioneer's cabin or border chieftain's hut; such an idea would, however, have been once dispelled by <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> many sketches and studies which proclaimed that an artist, and not a bushranger, had here found a home.|$|E

25|$|Loweswater {{is unique}} amongst the major lakes of the District in {{emptying}} toward {{the centre of}} the National Park. Its waters flow out eastwards into Crummock Water before beginning their northward journey as the Cocker. Loweswater does not therefore represent any watershed between the fells on either side of its valley, as might be supposed from a quick <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> map. A low ridge circuiting the western end of the lake joins Burnbank Fell to Low Fell and Fellbarrow, confirming them as the last outpost of the Western Fells.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{learning}} another language, vocabulary presents difficulties. One must continuously search for unknown words, and consequently interest is lost. In the elementary part, however, this {{problem has been}} overcome, because the relevant translation of each word appears below the Volapük words. A selection of readings follows, and {{it is suggested that}} the Volapük words be read out loud. The grammar and a basic vocabulary have already been done in the introduction; nevertheless, a quick <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> translation is recommended to ensure that the overall meaning has been acquired. There is a maxim which states that a little study a day is better than a lot of study all at once.|$|E
25|$|Silborne {{stated that}} a single <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Prussian position, {{as it has been}} described, will suffice to prove that Napoleon was in error as {{regarded}} Blücher's assumed line of battle, and that so far from its having been perpendicular to, it was, in the general military acceptation of the term, parallel with, the Namur road. He may however have been misled by the massing of the Prussian troops between the salient point of the position, Saint-Amand, and the road in question, {{as well as by the}} direction of the line of the occupied villages of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe. It must also be acknowledged that although the inference was incorrectly drawn, it accorded in substance with the real fact, that Blücher did rely upon the arrival of a portion of Wellington's forces by the Namur road from Quatre Bras.|$|E

500|$|After {{his death}} Huskisson's {{body had been}} moved from the sofa on which he had died to an upstairs bedroom. On arrival at the vicarage Emily Huskisson refused to allow the jury to view the body, insisting on being allowed to remain alone with her husband. Eventually {{she had to be}} {{forcibly}} removed from the room, and the jury went into the bedroom in small groups to view the body.

500|$|To {{find the}} lands to {{compensate}} his Norman followers, William initially confiscated the estates {{of all the}} English lords who had fought and died with Harold and redistributed part of their lands. These confiscations led to revolts, which resulted in more confiscations, a cycle that continued for {{five years after the}} Battle of Hastings. To put down and prevent further rebellions the Normans constructed castles and fortifications in unprecedented numbers, initially mostly on the motte-and-bailey pattern. Historian Robert Liddiard remarks that [...] "to <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> urban landscape of Norwich, Durham or Lincoln is to be forcibly reminded {{of the impact of the}} Norman invasion". William and his barons also exercised tighter control over inheritance of property by widows and daughters, often forcing marriages to Normans.|$|E
500|$|John Buckley {{attributed}} the hyperbole about Wittmann to the lingering {{influence of the}} German propaganda campaign and criticised D'Este and Meyer for exaggerating his role and implying that he single-handedly stopped the 7th Armoured Division. Buckley wrote that Russell A Hart's claim that Wittmann [...] "all but annihilated" [...] the 7th Armoured Division spearhead was wrong and that [...] "the complete German propaganda treatment" [...] was available from Gary Simpson. Badsey called Wittmann's attack and the attention it has received, [...] "remarkable but massively over-written". In 2013, Buckley wrote that unquestioning regurgitation of Nazi propaganda by writers and historians was inexcusably casual, when a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> facts showed that {{the defeat of the}} 7th Armoured Division by one Tiger crew led by Wittmann was a myth. Wittmann made a bold attack, which helped to stop the advance of the 4th CLY but did not make a solo effort; the action at Point 213 was led by Rolf Möbius.|$|E

[...] Ben Hogwood of MusicOMH applauded the [...] "huge influence she has become on younger pretenders to her throne," [...] most notably Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera.
