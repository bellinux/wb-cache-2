On June 1, 2009, months after X5-452's escape, terrorists detonate an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> weapon in the atmosphere over the U.S. which destroys {{the vast majority of}} computer and communication systems, throwing the country into chaos.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet {{chemical}} weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes {{from the facility}} as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse.</b> Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, a programmer, Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E

5|$|Walter and Astrid {{find the}} source of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse,</b> and begin {{investigating}} the house the pulse was built on. At the same time, Peter and Olivia go to a rural meeting place where the sheriff said they would find the truck's owner, only to be shot at by the sheriff and his deputy, who are hell bent on keeping the town's secret. Walter manages to turn off the pulse, and all of the townsfolk revert to their deformed appearance. The daughter of one of the army scientists saves Olivia and Peter from getting shot, and explains that her father stayed in Edina to perfect the pulse. After Walter pleads to Broyles to let the townspeople keep their secret, the Fringe team decides to not report the case so that the remaining residents can live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has {{uncovered}} a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|The story, told {{through the}} use of voiced and {{animated}} comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers class will attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> bombs (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire.|$|E

25|$|Gamma rays from {{a nuclear}} {{explosion}} produce high energy electrons through Compton scattering. For high altitude nuclear explosions, these electrons are {{captured in the}} Earth's magnetic field at altitudes between twenty and forty kilometers where they interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce a coherent nuclear <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> (NEMP) which lasts about one millisecond.

25|$|Brau {{served in}} the Guidance Test Directorate at Holloman Air Force Base in 1970–1971, and in the Theoretical Branch of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base during 1971–1974, working with Gregory Canavan. At Kirtland Brau carried out {{theoretical}} studies of laser-target interactions, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse,</b> and charged particle beams. He served as chief of the General Physics Group in 1973–1974, and resigned his Air Force commission in 1974 as a captain.|$|E
25|$|In optics, an ultrashort {{pulse of}} light is an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> whose time {{duration}} {{is of the}} order of a picosecond (1012 second) or less. Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum, and can be created by mode-locked oscillators. They are commonly referred to as ultrafast events. Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification, in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} flew at Khodynka airfield (where Ilyushin's experimental factory was) on December 22, 1976 (Soviet airliners often flew {{before the}} close of calendar years due {{to the requirements of}} Five-Year Plans). It was announced that the type had a patented <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> deicing system. which used 500 times less energy than conventional deicers. It is claimed that over 50 new technological processes were introduced into Soviet practice {{as a result of the}} Il-86 programme.|$|E
30|$|We {{note that}} the {{interaction}} of ultrashort <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulses</b> with atoms has been studied in the past decade, giving emphasis either to ionization effects[39 – 41] or to population dynamics in bound two-level and multi-level systems[40, 42 – 46]. Also, the interaction of ultrashort <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulses</b> with intersubband transitions of semiconductor quantum wells has been recently studied[47, 48], but without {{taking into account the}} effects of electron-electron interactions in the system dynamics.|$|R

25|$|In general, {{vacuum tubes}} {{are much less}} {{susceptible}} than corresponding solid-state components to transient overvoltages, such as mains voltage surges or lightning, the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> effect of nuclear explosions or geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares. This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid-state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the MiG-25. In that plane, output power of the radar is about one kilowatt and it can burn through a channel under interference.|$|E
25|$|A better {{understanding}} of Nuclear <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> (NEMP) presented new problems; a warhead set off at high altitudes and long ranges from the defensive missiles could blind the radars, making the incoming warheads only become visible at lower altitudes. This would further {{reduce the amount of}} time the ABM system had to react. Systems using non-obvious approaches might be able to blind the radars in a sneak attack; the Soviets developed the R-36 with a system called Fractional Orbital Bombardment System to allow attacks on US missile fields from low altitudes and/or from the south, while the US relied on manned bombers for the same role.|$|E
25|$|While {{investigating}} Luthor {{in order}} to root out his motive, Natasha Irons discovers that Luthor has been testing himself {{to see if he}} is compatible with the artificial metagene treatment. John Henry Irons leads an assault on Luthor's building; despite the destruction of his armor during the fight, he confronts Luthor— only to find himself badly outclassed, as Luthor demonstrates nearly all of Superman's powers. Luthor considers conquering Earth and renaming it Lexor. However, Natasha uses her uncle's hammer to trigger an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pulse</b> which shuts down the synthetic metagene long enough for Steel to knock Lex unconscious. Lex is disgraced as a result, and later faces indictment when the members of the Everymen realize they have been used.|$|E

In the middle of Kuje, the party find a village, Joannasburg. There, they meet the spirit of the long dead Joanna (C. C. Seymour). She explains she is a descendent of the Star King, as is her son; Jaster. Desert Claw arrives, telling Jaster he is his father. He gave Jaster to Raul while he prepared for the day when Jaster would awaken the power of the Star King and open the Gates of Eden.|$|E
25|$|In the Matrix, the Agents {{interrogate}} Morpheus in {{an attempt}} to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, the rebel humans' last refuge in the real world. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, who believes that he is not the One, resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists on accompanying him. They rescue Morpheus, and in so doing, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith thwarts Neo's escape. Now surer of himself, Neo fights Smith as a near equal and defeats him, but Smith's nature as an Agent allows him to survive. Neo flees the converging Agents and locates an exit in the hotel from which Trinity had escaped earlier, but Smith shoots him dead. In the real world, machines known as Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, while Trinity whispers to Neo that the Oracle told her that she would {{fall in love with the}} One, and that Neo cannot be dead because she loves him.
