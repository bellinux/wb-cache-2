40|$|Cement grouts {{are used}} {{for a wide range}} of {{applications}} in the construction industry. These grouts require a high workability and superplasticising admixtures. It has been found that some cement pastes and mortars perform better (ie flow faster and are workable for longer times without bleed and segregation) in some countries than in others. These problems may be solved on an empirical basis, but in this project the mechanisms involved are investigated in order to predict the performance of the cement pastes more effectively. To do this, a relationship between the rheological properties of the cement paste and the chemical components, especially the different kinds of sulphates, of the Portland cement is established. First a relationship between the simple industrial tests, such as the mini slump <b>flow</b> <b>cone</b> and the efflux <b>flow</b> <b>cone,</b> and the rheological properties obtained by a rheometer has to be established. Subsequently, as set of cements with different sulphates in them were tested in the rheometer.

40|$|Flow {{visualization}} {{techniques were}} {{used on the}} X- 29 A aircraft at high angles of attack to study the vortical flow off the forebody and the surface flow on the wing and tail. The forebody vortex system was studied because asymmetries in the vortex system were suspected of inducing uncommanded yawing moments at zero sideslip. Smoke enabled visualization of the vortex system and correlation of its orientation with flight yawing moment data. Good agreement was found between vortex system asymmetries and the occurrence of yawing moments. Surface flow on the forward-swept wing of the X- 29 A was studied using tufts and <b>flow</b> <b>cones.</b> As angle of attack increased, separated flow initiated at the root and spread outboard encompassing the full wing by 30 deg angle of attack. In general, the progression of the separated flow correlated well with subscale model lift data. Surface flow on the vertical tail was also studied using tufts and <b>flow</b> <b>cones.</b> As angle of attack increased, separated flow initiated at the root and spread upward.

40|$|Two-stage {{concrete}} (TSC) is {{a special}} type of concrete in which coarse aggregates are pre-placed in the formwork and subsequently injected with a grout. Beneficiating fly ash in TSC grouts increases TSC sustainability through the ecological use of large quantities of fly ash, reduced carbon-dioxide emissions associated with cement production, and enhancement of resource productivity of the concrete industry. Limited research has explored the effects of using high volume of fly ash as partial replacement for cement in TSC grout mixtures. Therefore, the flowability of grout mixtures incorporating various fly ash addition rates (i. e. 0 %, 30 %, 50 % and 70 %) was evaluated using the <b>flow</b> <b>cone</b> method and spread flow test.

40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{particle}} shape on dry rheology {{is considered to be}} an important aspect in order to replace natural sand used in concrete with man-made manufactured sand. There is a significant difference in particle shape and surface texture between crushed rock material (aggregates) and natural sand. The crushed aggregates are normally less rounded and have less equally shaped dimensions compared to natural sand. Thus, the flow ability of the concrete will be different. The main difference is explained by a difference in the wet rheology of the cement paste which in turn is affected by the smallest particles in the size range from microns to a few millimetres. In previous research, it has been demonstrated how different crushing techniques affects the shape of the produced particles. In many cases it is believed that Vertical Shaft Impact (VSI) -technology is the way forward to replace natural sand.

The purpose of this flight test was to obtain tufted flow visualization data which demonstrates the effect of thrust reverser deployment on the wing upper surface flow field {{to determine if the}} disturbed flow regions could be modeled by computational methods. A total of six symmetric thrust reversals of the two inboard engines were performed to monitor tuft and <b>flow</b> <b>cone</b> patterns as well as the character of their movement at the nominal Mach numbers of 0. 55, 0. 70, and 0. 85.

40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{particle}} shape on dry rheology {{is considered to be}} an important aspect in order to replace natural sand used in concrete with manufactured sand. Crushed particles from solid rock are normally less rounded and have less equally shaped dimensions compared to natural sand. Thus, the flowability and workability of the concrete will be different. In previous research, it has been demonstrated how different crushing techniques affects the shape of the particles. In many cases it is believed that Vertical Shaft Impact (VSI) technology is a way forward to replace natural sand. To be able to study {{the effect of}} VSI at the smaller fractions (63 - 2000 µm) sufficient measurements methods to determine particle shape are required. Optical tools to analyze the aggregates would make it possible to study a large amount of particles at small fractions. The determination of particle shape of aggregates is challenging since the shape is highly irregular and the size span of particles are very large. This study aim to evaluate one of the available optical tools, the Camsizer, for digital imaging determination of shape and size distribution. The available default shape parameters of the Camsizer are studied to understand the meaning of the parameters and their suitability for determining the quality of manufactured sand. To evaluate the capacity to determine particle shape, tests are made with 35 different materials. The results are compared with the dry rheology measured with the standardized “flow cone” test. Dependence has been previously proven between particle shape and the mass flow rate in the cone. Three different shape parameters, aspect ratio, sphericity and symmetry, are studied with the Camsizer and the results are compared with the mass flow rates in the cone. The results indicate a strong linear relationship between the optical parameters and the <b>flow</b> <b>cone</b> test...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to design and develop a group pump and solve {{associated}} technical issues for a construction company in Ireland. The design {{is based on a}} high shear colloidal group mixing and pumping rig. The initial machine has failed in terms of bearing and seal performance, has high manufacturing costs and is poorly designed. To account for these issues, extensive research of the design features of grout mixing units from various competitors and suppliers was carried out by research and field studies at trade fairs. Using the information gathered, and incorporating improvements into the existing design, a test rig was developed and tested. Performance tests consisted of varying the flow rates of the grout material through specified industrial flow rate ranges. The head loss through the system was plotted against flow rate to obtain system design curves. Design calculations were used to size the hydraulic motor, the impeller shaft diameter, dynamic loading on bearings and their operational lifetime. The result of the performance testing indicated that the machine performance met specifications. The new colloidal mixing unit met grout mixing standards for a water/cement ratio of 0. 4. This was validated with <b>flow</b> <b>cone</b> testing. The dual bearing system design proved satisfactory, with smooth operation even at higher ranges of industrial flow rates. The mechanical seals were selected for aggressive environments and the seal system developed for the grout pump remained leak proof, as designed.

The new pump design features includes a widened pumping impeller for increased shearing of the group and gives higher volumetric flow rates. This offers enhanced mixing attributes while retaining the positive aspects of the original design such as vortex mixing, high shear colloidal mixing and portability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the technology development of two flow control concepts for aircraft drag reduction. The NASA Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) project worked with Boeing to demonstrate these two concepts on a specially outfitted Boeing 757 ecoDemonstrator {{during the spring}} of 2015. The first flow control concept used Active Flow Control (AFC) to delay flow separation on a highly deflected rudder and increase the side force that it generates. This may enable a smaller vertical tail to provide the control authority needed {{in the event of an}} engine failure during takeoff and landing, while still operating in a conventional manner over the rest of the flight envelope. Thirty-one sweeping jet AFC actuators were installed and successfully flight-tested on the vertical tail of the 757 ecoDemonstrator. Pilot feedback, <b>flow</b> <b>cone</b> visualization, and analysis of the flight test data confirmed that the AFC is effective, as a smoother flight and enhanced rudder control authority were reported. The second flow control concept is the Insect Accretion Mitigation (IAM) innovation where surfaces were engineered to mitigate insect residue adhesion on a wing's leading edge. This is necessary because something as small as an insect residue on the leading edge of a laminar flow wing design can cause turbulent wedges that interrupt laminar flow, resulting in an increase in drag and fuel use. Several non-stick coatings were developed by NASA and applied to panels that were mounted on the leading edge of the wing of the 757 ecoDemonstrator. The performance of the coated surfaces was measured and validated by the reduction in the number of bug adhesions relative to uncoated control panels flown simultaneously. Both flow control concepts (i. e., sweeping jet actuators and non-stick coatings) for drag reduction were the culmination of several years of development, from wind tunnel tests to flight tests, and produced valuable data for the advancement of modern aircraft designs. The ERA systems analysis studies performed by NASA indicated that AFC-enhanced vertical tail could produce approximately 0. 9 % drag reduction for a large twin aisle aircraft and IAM coatings could enable approximately 1. 2 % drag reduction recovery for a potential total drag reduction of approximately 3. 3 % for a single aisle aircraft with a natural laminar flow (NLF) wing design...|$|E

The high-level waste (HLW) tanks have been isolated from FTF facilities. To complete operational closure they will be filled with grout for the purpose of: (1) physically stabilizing the tanks, (2) limiting/eliminating vertical pathways to residual waste, (3) discouraging future intrusion, and (4) providing an alkaline, chemical reducing environment within the closure boundary to control speciation and solubility of select radionuclides. Bulk waste removal and heel removal equipment remain in Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F. This equipment includes the Advance Design Mixer Pump (ADMP), transfer pumps, transfer jets, standard slurry mixer pumps, equipment-support masts, sampling masts, dip tube assemblies and robotic crawlers. The present Tank 18 and 19 -F closure strategy is to grout the equipment in place and eliminate vertical pathways by filling voids in the equipment to vertical fast pathways and water infiltration. The mock-up tests described in this report were intended to address placement issues identified for grouting the equipment that will be left in Tank 18 -F and Tank 19 -F.
