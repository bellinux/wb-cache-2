50|$|Cirsium lecontei {{grows to}} about 35-110 cm {{and has a}} taproot, {{sometimes}} with root sprouts. The plant is spiny and should be handled with care. The flowers are usually pink. The plant requires full sun. Le Conte's Thistle has a Wetland <b>Indicator</b> <b>Status</b> of FACW (facultative wetland, meaning that it usually occurs in wetlands but not always). The stems are loosely arachnoid and stiffly ascending. Leaves have blades that are linear to oblong or narrowly elliptic, loosely arachnoid when young, abaxial and adaxial faces glabrous(smooth), and lobes undivided or coarsely few toothed. Basal leaves sometimes absent at flowering, petiolate. Heads born singly or 2-5 or 10 in open, corymbiform arrays. Penduncles are 5-30 cm elevated above stem leaves. Cypselae are light brown, 5-5.75 mm long. Plants are often unbranched or sparingly branched, with single terminal flower heads that are above the foliage(plant leaves). Stem and lower leaf surfaces have cob webby hairs. With age, the plant starts losing the hairs and becoming glabrous (hairless,smooth). Leaves of the mid-stem are approximately 15 cm long, the leaves gradually reduce in size up the stem, and are pinnately lobed. Corollas have feather-like pappus bristles (modified sepals) that are pinkish/purple.|$|E

40|$|The National Ecology Center of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is {{supporting}} {{a series of}} field research studies to document relationships between hydric soils and wetland vegetation in selected wetlands throughout the United States. This study is one of that series. It {{is a continuation of}} the FWS effort, begun by Wentworth and Johnson (1986), to develop a procedure using vegetation to designate wetlands based on the <b>indicator</b> <b>status</b> of wetland vegetation as described by the FWS 2 ̆ 2 National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands 2 ̆ 2 (Reed 1986 a). This list classifies vascular plants of the U. S. into one of five categories according to their natural frequency of occurrence in wetlands. Concurrent with the development of the wetland plant list, the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) developed the 2 ̆ 2 National List of Hydric Soils 2 ̆ 2 (SCS 1985 a). Studies supported by the National Ecology Center quantitatively compare associations of plant species, designated according to their hydric nature using the Wentworth and Johnson (1986) procedure, with the hydric nature of soils according to their designation on the SCS hydric soils list. The studies are being conducted across moisture gradients at a variety of wetland sites throughout the U. S. Several studies have been modified to obtain information on groundwater hydrology. These studies were conceived in 1984 and implemented in 1985 in response to internal planning efforts of the FWS. They parallel, to some extent, ongoing efforts by the SCS to delineate wetlands for Section 1221 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (the swampbuster provision). The SCS and FWS provided joint guidance and direction {{in the development of the}} Wentworth and Johnson (1986) procedure, and the SCS currently is testing a procedure that combines hydric soils and the Wentworth and Johnson procedure for practical wetland delineation. The efforts of both agencies are complimentary and are being conducted in close cooperation. The primary objectives of these studies are to (1) assemble a quantitative data base of wetland plant community dominance and codominance for determining the relationship between wetland plants and hydric soils; (2) test various delineation algorithms based on the <b>indicator</b> <b>status</b> of plants against independent measures of hydric character, primarily hydric soils; and (3) test, in some instances, the correlation with groundwater hydrology. The results of these studies also can be used, with little or no supplementary hydrologic information, to compare wetland delineation methods of the Corps of Engineers (1987) and the Environmental Protection Agency (Sipple 1987) ...|$|E

Because vegetation sampled at the Double O was wetter and more alkaline than wet meadows sampled {{at the south}} end of the refuge in 2012 and 2013 (Christy 2014), data from the Double O Unit were analyzed and summarized separately. A total of 83 plots were sampled in 2015, and analysis of the data identified 14 plant associations: Alopecurus aequalis - Juncus balticus, Alopecurus pratensis - Potentilla anserina, Carex praegracilis - Juncus balticus, Cicuta douglasii - Carex nebrascensis, Distichlis spicata - Amphiscirpus nevadensis, Distichlis spicata - Nitrophila occidentalis, Eleocharis palustris - Juncus balticus, Eleocharis rostellata, Juncus balticus - Glaux maritima, Hippuris vulgaris - Triglochin maritima, Leymus triticoides - Juncus balticus, Schoenoplectus americanus, Spartina gracilis, and Triglochin maritima.

40|$|While diverse, native {{riparian}} vegetation provides important functions, {{it remains unclear}} to what extent these assemblages can persist in urban areas, and under what conditions. We characterized forested {{riparian vegetation}} communities across an urbanizing metropolitan area and examined their relationships with surrounding land cover. We hypothesized that native and hydrophilic species assemblages would correlate with forest cover in the landscape. For each of 30 sites in the Portland–Vancouver metro area, we recorded vegetation at 1 -cm intervals along 3 transects using the line-intercept method. Land cover was characterized at 2 scales: within 500 m of each site and across the entire watershed. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate relationships between species composition and land cover patterns. A classification tree was created to determine landscape predictors of riparian community type. Results indicated a strong relationship between watershed land cover and vegetation diversity and structural complexity. Our hypothesis of native species association with landscape forest cover in urban riparian areas was supported, but we found no clear relationship between land cover and wetland <b>indicator</b> <b>status.</b> Our results suggest that high watershed forest cover (at least 15 %) may enable the persistence of functionally diverse, native riparian vegetation communities in urban landscapes.

40|$|Presented at The Oregon Water Conference, May 24 - 25, 2011, Corvallis, OR. The inter-relationships of vegetation, soils, and {{stream channel}} erosion {{characteristics}} {{were examined in}} two riparian meadows of the Ochoco National Forest where progressive stream headcut incision is a critical resource management issue and restoration priority. Scientific literature establishes that headcut incision leads to lower groundwater tables, with corresponding shifts in neighboring vegetation from communities tolerant of wetter conditions to those of drier conditions, yet {{further research is needed}} in examining the degree headcut height and soil properties control this relationship. By incorporating headcut incision height and soil properties (particle size distribution, percent organic matter, percent soil moisture, and pH) as additional drivers of soil moisture availability, and thus vegetation change, fieldwork included extensive sampling of soils, vegetation, and stream characteristics. Percent canopy cover by vegetation species was surveyed in systematically placed Daubenmire plots along cross-valley transects. Each plot was later assigned a hydric rating score based on weighted percent cover by hydric <b>indicator</b> <b>status</b> (OBL, FACW, etc). Due to the greater degree of water table drawdown associated with more pronounced incision, I hypothesized that change in hydric rating scores of vegetation communities downstream of the headcuts will be positively correlated with the height of headcuts, and less so with change in soil texture. Preliminary results will be highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Background: Glycemic {{control is}} an {{important}} aspect of patient care in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). This is a pilot study of a novel glycemic analysis tool – the glucogram. We hypothesize that the glucogram may be helpful in quantifying the clinical significance of acute hyperglycemic states (AHS) and in describing glycemic variability (GV) in critically ill patients. Materials and Methods: Serial glucose measurements were analyzed in SICU patients with lengths of stay (LOS) 3 ̆e 30 days. Glucose data were formatted into 12 -hour epochs and graphically analyzed using stochastic and momentum indicators. Recorded clinical events were classified as major or minor (control). Examples of major events include cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, major hemorrhage, infection/sepsis, etc. Examples of minor (control) events include non-emergent bedside procedures, blood transfusion given to a hemodynamically stable patient, etc. Positive/negative <b>indicator</b> <b>status</b> was then correlated with AHS and associated clinical events. The conjunction of positive indicator/major clinical event or negative indicator/minor clinical event was defined as clinical “match”. GV was determined by averaging glucose fluctuations (maximal – minimal value within each 12 -hour epoch) over time. In addition, event-specific glucose excursion (ESGE) associated with each positive indicator/AHS match (final minus initial value for each occurrence) was calculated. Descriptive statistics, sensitivity/specificity determination, and student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test were used in data analysis. Results: Glycemic and clinical data were reviewed for 11 patients (mean SICU LOS 74. 5 days; 7 men/ 4 women; mean age 54. 9 years; APACHE II of 17. 7 ± 6. 44; mortality 36...|$|E
