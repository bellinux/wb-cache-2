5000|$|The Raptor-class is {{the first}} new Klingon ship design {{depicted}} in Enterprise. The vessel {{is the subject of}} the first season episode [...] "Sleeping Dogs". Produced by Herman Zimmerman's art department, it was the first Klingon ship to debut as a completely computer-generated model. John Eaves was responsible for developing the basic shape of the Raptor-class in concept art; Doug Drexler later refined Eaves's sketches to create a CGI mesh using LightWave 3D. Foundation Imaging converted Drexler's work into the final CGI model seen in the episode. Eaves's objective was to make the craft appear more primitive than the Klingon ships later in the franchise's chronology, with <b>exposed</b> <b>piping</b> and rugged design. Eaves stated that the design was made to look [...] "like it is made up of different pieces that are attached to one another, as opposed to a uniform shape". Several designs of various sizes were proposed before Zimmerman settled on the Raptor-class. While the vessel is lightly based on Industrial Light & Magic's Bird of Prey, Eaves attempted to make the craft appear as a precursor to the D7-class. Drexler, who worked closely with Eaves during the creation of the CGI mesh, was allowed to deal with the closer details of the model, such as the position of the shuttlebay. Drexler felt that the design held qualities of both a PT boat and a 19th-century ironclad warship. The overall style of Eaves's design was later used as the basis for future Klingon ships in Enterprise.|$|E
40|$|The 105 -KE Basin {{contains}} 1, 150 Metric Tonnes of Uranium (MTU) of N Reactor fuel, {{along with}} {{less than half a}} MTU of single pass reactor (SPR) fuel. In addition to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in the 105 -KE Basin, extensive quantities of debris and a substantial amount of sludge have accumulated in the basin. The 105 -KE Basin fuel and sludge are not encapsulated and, as a result, corroding fuel has produced contamination products that are deposited on the basin walls, floor, and equipment. contamination products produce radiation dose exposures to the workers. To decrease worker exposures, this Notice of Construction (NOC) describes dose reduction modifications under consideration to mitigate worker radiation exposure from the basin walls and <b>exposed</b> <b>piping.</b> The major equipment egress paths from the basin (the dummy elevator pit and the south loadout pit) are blocked completely with debris and/or empty canisters. Therefore in addition to dose reduction, this NOC also describes debris removal activities and equipment. Recently, the primary water treatment system has been without mechanical filtration capabilities. This NOC describes planned modifications to the primary water treatment system to restore mechanical filtration by restarting the cartridge filters. The proposed modifications described in this NOC are expected to commence in the Fall of 1995. Finally, the NOC describes two other basin activities, fuel and sludge movement, that are expected to be routine in the future...|$|E

[...] Investigation into the metallurgical properties of <b>piping</b> <b>exposed</b> to the high temperatures {{for long periods of time}} was also performed. The Components were designed and fabricated then installed into a test facility and evaluated under operating conditions with the overall goal of improving the reliability and safety of the components and ultimately, the nuclear reactor the components would be used in.|$|R
50|$|Water is {{not present}} in the piping until the system operates; instead, the piping is filled with air at a {{pressure}} below the water supply pressure. To prevent the larger water supply pressure from prematurely forcing water into the piping, {{the design of the}} dry pipe valve (a specialized type of check valve) results in a greater force on top of the check valve clapper by the use of a larger valve clapper area <b>exposed</b> to the <b>piping</b> air pressure, as compared to the higher water pressure but smaller clapper surface area.|$|R

Using 3 D fluorescence spectroscopy {{we were able to}} observe the `protein-like&# 039; fluorophore associated with presence of bacteria, and cross reference this with derivatized fatty acid metabolites determined via GC-MS analyses of the same sample. This methodology {{can be used as a}} simple screening tool to establish the presence or otherwise of microbial processes in waters, and correlation of specific metabolite profiles with different microbes will further enhance the utility of this tool...|$|R
40|$|SNC) hereby {{requests}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{approval of}} the enclosed Alternative HNP-ISI-ALT- 14, Version 1, which proposes a temporary non-code repair to leaks discovered in the Hatch Nuclear Plant Unit 1 (HNP- 1) Plant Service Water (PSW) System. During inspection of HNP- 1 buried demineralized water transfer piping adjacent to the HNP- 1 Reactor Building to address tritium leakage, two leaks were identified in a nearby run of PSW <b>piping</b> <b>exposed</b> by the excavation. An operability determination concluded that PSW system operability is maintained. However, that determination is {{based in part on}} river temperature (the PSW source) remaining above 46 °F. As discussed in the enclosure, the proposed non-code repair meets most of the requirements for a "full code repair"; however, to perform a repair/replacemen...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering Technology) This project {{researched}} {{the feasibility of}} using an existing mitre bend on the main condenser crossover ducting as an on-line flow measuring system. This flow measurement {{is based on the}} principle of an elbow type of flow meter. There are no detailed published standards or specifications available for Elbow flow meters. The knowledge of the cooling water flow rate through the individual condensers would allow turbine heat rate calculations to be performed. In addition condenser, cooling tower and cooling water pump performance can be evaluated. An on-line system would also highlight potential problems sooner, thus eliminating costly unplanned shutdowns. The majority of the straight length of condenser cooling water piping is under concrete, thus making access very difficult. The <b>exposed</b> condenser <b>piping</b> geometry is not ideal, with very distorted flow profiles expected, due to bends, valves, reducers, etc. Conventional flow measuring systems can therefore not be used, as ideal flow conditions (profiles) before and after the measuring instrument are required to er. sure the specified accuracy. The mitre bend being part of the piping geometry does not introduce additional head loss to the system and coupled to the low cost factor of an elbow type meter was the principal reason for the choice of this type of measuring system. Part of the innovative aspect of this research is that a conventional elbow is not used but an existing mitre bend is utilised as the fundamental flow measuring device. The Elbow/Bend differential pressure method to measure the condenser cooling water flow rate was investigated in the Flow laboratory at Eskom (Technology Research and Investigations). A geometrically similar mitre bend was purchased and installed onto the 700 mm NB pipeline at the laboratory. The diametrical differential pressure was measured at the 22. 5 ° and 45 °axes of the 0. 8 D mitre bend. The differential pressure was related to the fluid flow rate, and a calibration constant C was determined. The velocity profiles under the test conditions were verified. A Computational Fluid Dynamics model of the laboratory mitre bend was also produced. The model provided a clearer understanding of the internal flow patterns and the exact pressures on the inside and outside of the bend. The tests that were conducted in the laboratory confirmed the suitability of converting the main condenser crossover ducting mitre bends into an on-line cooling water flow measuring systems...|$|R
