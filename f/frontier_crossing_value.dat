40|$|Blackorby and Murty [2007] prove that, with a {{monopoly}} and under {{one hundred percent}} profit taxation and uniform lump-sum transfers, the utility possibility sets of economies with unit and ad valorem taxes are identical. This welfare-equivalence {{is in contrast to}} most previous studies. In this paper, we relax the assumption of one hundred percent profit taxation and allow the consumers to receive profit incomes from ownership of shares in the monopoly firm. We find that, for any fixed vector of profit shares, the utility possibility sets of economies with unit and ad valorem taxes are not generally identical. But it does not imply that one completely dominates the other. Rather, the two utility possibility <b>frontiers</b> <b>cross</b> each other...|$|R

This new derived code is called Zero Cross-Correlation Code (ZCC).

The study of debris flow is the <b>frontier</b> <b>crossing</b> of multi-disciplinary.

50|$|Prisoner Vintilă Vais was incarcerated at Gherla in May 1951. Arrested for presumed <b>frontier</b> <b>crossing</b> felony, {{he was in}} fact {{victim of}} a {{personal}} scuffle with Marin Jianu, the Interior Minister deputy, on whom he had compromising information. Under torture, he {{made a series of}} compromising reports on high-ranking people from the Party, such as Teohari Georgescu, Petru Groza, Alexandru Nicolschi, Tudor Sepeanu, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and others. This caused unrest in the Securitate and would eventually lead to the secrecy disavowal surrounding the proceedings. Together with other events such as the fact that - after two years of reeducation - there was not much relevant data to report, the considerable number of deaths and the increasing number of fabulations - made under torture - that consumed the Securitate resources, it led to the termination of the program.|$|R
