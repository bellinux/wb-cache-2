500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb {{was provided by}} guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording his scenes only instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: [...] "This morning, at the table read, I had just filled my plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, I want to <b>introduce</b> <b>you</b> to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!" [...] While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got {{to see him in}} action. She thought DeVito [...] "threw his body and soul" [...] into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions {{on a piece of paper}} as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to [...] " [...] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room..." [...] Cartwright said of it: ...|$|E

2500|$|April – The church {{published}} an extensive interview with Oaks and general authority Lance B. Wickman in April {{to clarify the}} church’s stance on homosexuality. In the interview, Wickman states that the church [...] "doesn't counsel against" [...] conversion therapy and that it [...] "may be appropriate" [...] for an individual to use clinical therapy to seek to diminish or eliminate homosexual feelings. However, Oaks states they [...] "can't endorse" [...] the [...] "aversive therapies" [...] recommended {{in the past to}} fix [...] "this affliction" [...] and they [...] "don’t accept responsibility for those abuses" [...] suffered by individuals who had experienced this now disavowed therapy method. On same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships, Elder Oaks states that giving these couples the same government rights given to a man and woman marriage is [...] "not right" [...] and [...] "not appropriate". He added that a mixed-orientation marriage would be appropriate for a gay member who could [...] "deal with [...] feelings" [...] and [...] "put them in the background" [...] and felt a [...] "great attraction" [...] to someone of the opposite sex. They compared devout homosexual Mormons to those with physical or mental disabilities who will also not be able to marry, and adds that [...] "same-gender attraction did not exist in the pre-earth life and neither will it exist in the next life." [...] As far as family acceptance and inclusion of homosexual children they gave some example conversation lines like, [...] "don’t expect to stay overnight. Don’t expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don’t expect us to take you out and <b>introduce</b> <b>you</b> to our friends, or to deal with you in a public situation that would imply our approval of your 'partnership'." [...] He further stated [...] "the Lord’s way is to love the sinner while condemning the sin".|$|E
