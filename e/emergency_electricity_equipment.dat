After the 1988 merger with the power systems company Brown, Boveri & Cie, ASEA became ABB. As a result, Västerås is home to its ABB AB Swedish subsidiary headquarters.Since the Westinghouse takeover of ABB's nuclear business it is owned by Westinghouse Electric Company. It is situated mainly at the Mimer Complex in the city centre. Production facilities are in Finnslätten and Saltängen.

Both tests were carried out according to the instructions enclosed in the packages using diluted water samples taken from the secondary clarifier at the West Side Waste Water Treatment Plant in Fayetteville, AR. The tests were carried out at various temperatures {{in an attempt to}} reflect conditions that could be encountered in the field, where <b>electricity,</b> <b>equipment,</b> and expertise may not be available. The PathoScreenâ„¢ test responded adequately at a relatively wide range of temperatures, from approximately 22 Â°C to 35 Â°C, whereas the Quanti-Tray/ 2000 Â® method was much more sensitive, producing erratic responses. In addition to PathoScreenâ„¢ yielding more consistent responses, the field kit and materials necessary for that test are much cheaper than those for using the Quanti- Tray/ 2000 Â® method. These results suggest that the HachÂ® PathoScreenâ„¢ test, a hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) presence-absence (PA) test, is more reliable for use in the field...|$|R
