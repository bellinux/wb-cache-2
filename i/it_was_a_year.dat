5|$|Mellitus fled {{first to}} Canterbury, but Æthelberht's {{successor}} Eadbald {{was also a}} pagan, so Mellitus, accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. Mellitus was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus' exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> but {{it may have been}} longer. However, Mellitus did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although Mellitus fled, there {{does not seem to have}} been any serious persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until Cedd was consecrated as bishop in about 654.|$|E
5|$|Year 1346 (MCCCXLVI) was {{a common}} year {{starting}} on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in the 14th century, {{in the midst of}} a period known in European history as the Late Middle Ages. In Asia that year, the Black Plague came to the troops of the Golden Horde Khanate; the disease also affected the Genoese Europeans they were attacking, before spreading to the rest of Europe. In Central and East Asia, there was a series of revolts after Kazan Khan was killed in an uprising, and the Chagatai Khanate began to splinter and fall; several revolts in China began what would eventually lead to the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty. The Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara won several victories over Muslim conquerors in the north in this year as well.|$|E

However, Yūkei opened the shutter out of curiosity, and when he peeked inside, there was a mountain of human bones piled up inside. Dumbfounded by this sight, Yūkei recalled a rumor of an onibaba at Adachigahara who would kill travelers and devour their blood and meat, and he got the feeling that this old lady was the rumored onibaba, so he fled the cave.|$|E

500|$|Le Mesurier {{was a heavy}} drinker, but {{was never}} noticeably drunk. In 1977 he {{collapsed}} in Australia and flew home, where {{he was diagnosed with}} cirrhosis of the liver and ordered to stop drinking. Until then he had not considered himself an alcoholic, although he accepted that [...] "it was the cumulative effect over the years that had done the damage". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and a half before he drank alcohol again, when he avoided spirits and drank only beer. Jacques claimed that his calculated vagueness was the result of his dependence on cannabis, although according to Le Mesurier the drug was not to his taste; he smoked it only during his period of abstinence from alcohol. Le Mesurier's favoured pastime was visiting the jazz clubs around Soho, such as The Establishment or Ronnie Scott's, and he observed that [...] "listening to artists like Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson or Alan Clare always made life seem that little bit brighter".|$|E
500|$|Joe Mercer {{took control}} of the team on a {{caretaker}} basis for seven matches, before the FA appointed Don Revie on a five-year contract. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before Revie's England suffered a defeat but despite this, he changed his starting line-up for every game. [...] His relationship with the FA had broken down and his team-building exercises, including carpet bowls and indoor golf, led to disconsolation in the squad. A 2–0 defeat to the Netherlands at Wembley turned the press against him; some commentators compared the loss to the 6–3 defeat by Hungary in 1953. Convinced he was to be replaced by Bobby Robson, he announced he was to become manager of the United Arab Emirates team. Selling his story to the Daily Mail, he subsequently resigned on 11 July 1977. Revie was charged with bringing the game into disrepute and was banned by the FA in a [...] "kangaroo court" [...] for ten years. [...] On appeal to the High Court, the ban was overturned but the judge ordered Revie to pay two-thirds of the costs. Brian Clough applied for the position in 1977, but the FA rejected him and Ron Greenwood was appointed, initially as a temporary replacement for Revie, but later in 1977 on a permanent basis. [...] Bobby Moore described him as [...] "the encyclopaedia of football", and he guided England to Euro 1980 without a defeat during qualification.|$|E

[...] Richard J.

[...] Vibe magazine observed that [...] "R was omnipresent in 1993. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in which Janet Jackson, at 27, topped the Billboard pop album charts for six straight summer weeks, with her critically lauded, six-times-platinum Janet" [...] It became one of only five albums {{in the history of the}} Billboard 200—along with Whitney Houston's Whitney (1987), Norah Jones's Feels Like Home (2004), Taylor Swift's Fearless (2008), and Susan Boyle's I Dreamed a Dream (2009)—to debut at number one and remain at the top of the chart for a minimum of six consecutive weeks.

500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before Horrocks {{recovered}} {{sufficiently to}} tell Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), {{that he was}} [...] "very anxious to be given another corps". Restored to the acting rank of lieutenant-general in August 1944, {{he was sent to}} France to assume command of XXXCorps during the cataclysm engulfing the trapped German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army in the Falaise Pocket. Montgomery had been dissatisfied with the performance of the corps and its commander, Gerard C. Bucknall, since the landings in Normandy two months earlier. Horrocks retained control of XXXCorps during the advance through Belgium, taking Brussels, and at one point advanced [...] in only six days. Supplies were a constant concern, with the major French deep-water ports still in German hands, and Allied supply lines stretching perilously back to the Normandy beaches. Montgomery's 21st Army Group was by now operating [...] from its ports—twice the distance logistical planners had accounted for—so XXXCorps was diverted towards Antwerp to secure its docks and harbour. The city and port fell to the 11thArmoured Division in early September, but Montgomery halted XXXCorps for resupply short of the wide Albert Canal {{to the north of the}} city, which consequently remained in enemy hands. Horrocks regretted this after the war, believing that his corps might have advanced another [...] with the fuel available, although it is doubtful this could have been achieved without delays. Unknown to the Allies, at that time XXXCorps was opposed by only a single German division. The pause allowed the Germans to regroup around the Scheldt River, and by the time the Allies resumed their advance, General Student's First Paratroop Army had arrived and set up strong defensive positions along the opposite side of the canal. The task of breaking the strengthened German line, which stretched from Antwerp to the North Sea along the Scheldt River, would fall to the First Canadian Army in the month-long, costly Battle of the Scheldt. By mid-September, XXXCorps had been diverted again, this time to the east.|$|E

In 1657, he might have found a patron in local art collector Pieter van Ruijven, who lent him some money. It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the fijnschilders from Leiden.

The journal was criticized for failing to become [...] "the organ of militant atheism" [...] as Lenin had ordered by being too philosophical and abstract in argumentation, as well as detached from the real anti-religious struggle. This was part of the purges that characterized the 1930s as well as Stalin's efforts to submit all marxist institutions to himself.
