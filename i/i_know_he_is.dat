500|$|Following {{a change}} in {{administration}} in Washington, in May 2017 {{it was reported that}} Cindy McCain was under consideration for a prominent role at the U.S. Department of State, possibly focusing on issues related to human trafficking. [...] In June 2017, there were further reports that after extensive recruiting by the chief executive following a recommendation from Ivanka Trump, she had agreed to become an Ambassador-at-Large dealing with matters of human trafficking, refugees, and humanitarian aid. [...] No official announcement has yet been made regarding this. [...] In July 2017 she faced the news that her husband had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. [...] She issued a public statement saying that, [...] "We as a family will face the next hurdle together. One thing I do know is he is the toughest person <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> my hero and I love him with all my heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The 100m at the DN Galan {{meeting in}} Stockholm saw Gay's first match-up {{of the year}} against Bolt. He {{surprised}} the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory, beating him with 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97seconds. This was {{only the second time}} Bolt had lost a 100m final – the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell (also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium). Gay broke Powell's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat. Gay chose not to overstate the significance of the win, acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness: [...] "It feels great to beat Usain but deep down inside <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not 100%. I look forward to beating him when he is". With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries, Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week, running a world leading time of 9.78seconds despite poor weather. A victory at the Memorial van Damme in 9.79seconds earned him the first Diamond Race Trophy for the 100m.|$|E
2500|$|Catchers of the Peitz kind are scarce. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not a Beaumont on his feet, {{but he is}} a corking {{good man}} for a team because he always knows what to do and how to do it, and what better do you want? A catcher of the Peitz kind runs the whole game from behind the bat. I wish we had him, and if the Reds let him go it would be a serious mistake.|$|E

2500|$|Pietersen {{is widely}} {{portrayed in the}} media as having a self-assured personality, {{described}} by Geoffrey Boycott as being [...] "cocky and confident". Former England test captain Michael Vaughan counters this, saying, [...] "KP is not a confident person. He obviously has great belief in his ability but that's {{not quite the same}} thing... And I know KP wants to be loved. I try to text him and talk to him as often as I can because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> insecure." [...] He has been noted for unusual haircuts, with his peroxide blond dyed streak of hair along the middle of his head during the 2005 Ashes series being described as a [...] "dead skunk" [...] look. During the 2006–07 Ashes tour, the Australian team, noted for their efforts to dominate opponents psychologically, dubbed him [...] "The Ego", or [...] "FIGJAM" [...] (F*** I'm Good, Just Ask Me). Other nicknames include [...] "KP", [...] "Kelves" [...] and [...] "Kapes".|$|E
2500|$|Philpot made further {{controversial}} comments {{after the}} 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, legalizing gay marriage throughout the United States. Philpot described gay marriage as an oxymoron, the Supreme Court's decision as [...] "pretty close to insane," [...] and described homosexual relationships as [...] "sterile" [...] and [...] "just entertainment." [...] He also described homosexuality as a choice, saying that children now have [...] "got {{to decide which}} gender to date"; this matches his previously expressed views that the gay lifestyle is a [...] "destructive lifestyle" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "behavior, it's not genetic." [...] LGBT rights advocates challenged these views as showing a [...] "fundamental misunderstanding {{of what it means to}} be LGBT" [...] and as evidence of a [...] "deep disrespect for LGBT people and their families." [...] Judges have a First Amendment right to express their views so long as they do not influence their decisions. Philpot has presided over many cases with LGBT people and lawyers who have been involved report that he does not base his decisions on a litigant's sexuality. Speaking of his religious views, Philpot has stated that [...] "I don't mention Jesus inside the courthouse very much, even when <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> absolutely the only answer to the problem in front of me." [...] Philpot has also stated that [...] "half the adoptions I do are for gay people. And they're not bad people," [...] and that he loves homosexuals. Philpot regrets, however, that friendships between straight men are affected as they are unable to hug in the way they used to, and that the rainbow, a symbol from the Bible, had been [...] "stolen" [...] – and he plans to put a rainbow on the back of his car.|$|E

6000|$|I laughed, {{wishing to}} cheer him, though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right. [...] "Surely your {{daughter}} belongs {{to your own}} class," [...] I replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "At this {{he looked}} very much astonished, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an Englishman; for Englishmen always think that Russians study nothing but `ukases.' ...|$|R

60|$|I didn't ask him. D'you think I'd {{have come}} if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to <b>be</b> here? <b>He's</b> {{acknowledged}} {{that he has no}} defence.|$|R

60|$|I {{should have}} laughed at his manner of {{speaking}} but that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> playing a part, and I {{did my best to}} obey the command.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me? Of course not. Why---er---if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{that kind}} of a man-----" [...] Andrew Felps broke off short. [...] "Were you {{listening}} to our talk?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He's {{not nearly}} so young a man as you are; but I really think he is as strong. He's a {{wonderful}} man for his years, certainly." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> hated me, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unscrupulous, but it didn't {{occur to}} me to think he would poison {{the man who had}} just helped him through a {{dangerous}} fever.|$|R
60|$|Here Kari {{looked at}} me, of whom <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} all this time, and seeing that I could overhear his talk, {{began to speak}} of something else.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{too close}} to town to buy a paper then. There would be one {{at the office and}} he would wait until he could get that.|$|R
