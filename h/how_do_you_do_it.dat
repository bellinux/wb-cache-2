6000|$|Yet I suppose none of {{you would}} think yourselves {{particularly}} ingenious architects if you had designed nothing more than this; nay, I will even let you improve it into any grand proportion you choose, and add to it as many windows as you choose; the only thing I insist upon in our specimen of pure architecture is, that there shall be no mouldings nor ornaments upon it. And I suspect you don't quite like your architecture so [...] "pure" [...] as this. We want a few mouldings, you will say--just a few. Those who want mouldings, hold up their hands. We are unanimous, I think. Will, you, then, design the profiles of these mouldings yourselves, or will you copy them? If you wish to copy them, and to copy them always, of course I leave you at once to your authorities, and your imaginations to their repose. But {{if you wish to}} design them yourselves, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> You draw the profile according to your taste, and you order your mason to cut it. Now, will you tell me the logical difference between drawing the profile of a moulding and giving that to be cut, and drawing the folds of the drapery of a statue and giving those to be cut. The last is much more difficult to do than the first; but degrees of difficulty constitute no specific difference, and you will not accept it, surely, as a definition of the difference between architecture and sculpture, that [...] "architecture is doing anything that is easy, and sculpture anything that is difficult." ...|$|E

Scott told a story of his daughter’s relationship with God and why it is important to him as he continues to mourn her loss.

40|$|There {{are three}} major {{questions}} about peer education: what is it? <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> {{and does it}} work? Surprisingly, there is little consensus in the literature in relation to these three questions. The reason being that different studies use different definitions, go about peer education in different ways and so end up with different results. Because of this, {{the focus of this}} paper will not be a step by step approach of “how to do peer education”, but a discussion of the ways peer education can vary and the importance of tailoring it to fit particular circumstances. There are numerous issues to consider in peer education and {{it can be difficult to}} work out which to consider first. This paper is about piecing together the jigsaw that is peer education. Important considerations for design of peer education programs include definition of peer educators and peer education, aims, the setting, characteristics of the target group and evaluation. Each of these considerations will be outlined, followed by some issues for reflection in relation to each consideratio...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{popularity}} of video games, especially violent video games, has reached phenomenal proportions. The theoretical {{line of reasoning}} that hypothesizes a causal relation-ship between violent video-game play and aggression draws on the very large literature on media violence effects. Additionally, there are theoretical reasons to believe that video game effects should be stronger than movie or television violence effects. This paper outlines {{what is known about}} the relationship between violent video-game playing and aggression. The available literature on virtual reality effects on aggression is discussed as well. The preponder-ance of the evidence from the existing literature suggests that exposure to video-game violence increases aggressive behavior and other aggression-related phenomena. However, the paucity of empirical data, coupled with a variety of methodological problems and inconsistencies in these data, clearly demonstrate the need for additional research.

Wouldn’t {{you want to know}} if the intervention worked? That is where evaluation comes in. In this case, we would be conducting a summative evaluation (after the intervention) to answer questions such as: (1) Did rates of smoking among adolescents decrease?; (2) Did the radio ads reach enough teens to have statistical power?; (3) Did the ads affect norms about smoking in that age group?; (4) Was the cigarette tax increase during the evaluation period the real reason that smoking decreased?; (5) Was the implementation of a nosmoking policy in the schools the reason that smoking decreased?; and (6) Was the referral to tobacco quitlines the reason that smoking decreased? If the research team conducted a formative evaluation (before and during the communication intervention), your team would be able to make any necessary changes such as edits to radio ads or when they are played before continuing forward. If you’re still feeling confused, don’t worry; the purpose of this introductory section is to provide you with some useful background information on evaluation planning. What is evaluation...|$|E
40|$|There’s {{nothing like}} a {{vigorous}} national election campaign {{to bring out the}} best in Australia’s mainstream newspapers. Some would say it also brings out the worst, but these remain subjective judgements. Front page treatments with headings like “Send in the Clown,” “Kick This Mob Out,” and “I Know Nuthink’” sparked a polarised debate in the early stages about the role of media and its reduction, even trivialisation, of the fundamental democratic process. These works of newspaper “art” sustained a short life of their own beyond the standard 24 -hour news cycle. And, yes, witnessing PM Rudd’s “Murdoch media” reaction, they lured at least him into a vortex. They also helped newspapers to gain the early high ground advantage, instigating multi-media debate and swatting down any semblance of a counter-balancing social media surge of influence on voters as hoped for by Mr Rudd’s guns-for-hire from U. S. presidential campaigns. Politics and more has been all over the shop in the campaign period media, with parties adopting a “whatever it takes” mantra. Amid the scurrying for one-upmanship on policy fronts, there’s been incessant set-piece announcements from the campaign trail, snappy, coco-pop pollie appearances on breakfast TV, Q&A talk fests (<b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Tony?) and MPs in aprons on the ABC...|$|E
