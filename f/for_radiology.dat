From 1950s he was a Head Physician of the [...] "Centre <b>for</b> <b>radiology</b> and nuclear medicine" [...] at [...] "Vojna Bolnica Zagreb". At the same time he owned the private practice in Zagreb. In the 1958 he received his master's degree and started to teach medicine at the University of Zagreb. In the meantime Altaras started to explore the true causes of the death of his brother Silvio Altaras, who was killed by the communist regime of PR Yugoslavia in early 1945. Because of that, in 1964, League of Communists of Croatia started to political persecute Altaras in a mounted court case. He was forced to leave Croatia and moved to Zurich, Switzerland. There he worked at the University Hospital Zurich from 1964 to 1966. In 1966 Altaras moved to Giessen, Germany and started to work at the University hospital Giessen und Marburg. In 1992 he published his principal professional work: A new atlas of large and small intestine - the integration of diagnostic methods.|$|E
