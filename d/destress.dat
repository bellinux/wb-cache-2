40|$|Rockburst control {{measures}} have been in practice with continued efforts for improvements {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century. The thesis concentrates on the evaluation of <b>destress</b> blasting, which is an important pro-active rockburst control measure. The concept of <b>destress</b> blasting is based on the fracturing of highly stressed rock mass by detonating explosive charge within it. The concept has been carried out ever since the first reported use in a Canadian coal mine circa the early 1930 s. Since then, many mines across the continents have applied this technique using a trial-and-error approach with mixed successes. To date, the application lacks scientific base. The aim of this thesis is to identify the governing mechanisms associated with <b>destress</b> blasting applications. A holistic approach is undertaken, which involves a critical analysis of the reported field evidences, development of a numerical procedure and detailed investigations at the micro-mechanical level to investigate the fracturing of rock under confinement by different types and magnitudes of explosive energy. A numerical procedure is developed in the thesis that carries promising potential to improve the understanding on rock fracturing by explosive energy as well as provides a platform to develop means for enhancing explosive energy utilization. The procedure is validated with reported field observations. Analyses of <b>destress</b> blasting is made through dynamic modelling by simulating discrete fractures using the developed procedure. A normalized parameter ℓ ci is introduced to investigate fracturing extent after <b>destress</b> blasts. The investigations revealed that <b>destress</b> blasting produces limited fractures aligned along the principal stresses. The fracturing extent reduces with the increase in the confinement. The study indicates that the current practice of <b>destress</b> blasting seemingly provides more psychological benefits than factual benefits from the desired destressing. The study also introduces a non-dimensional parameter, betaij, which characterizes destressing effects. The parameter not only adequately explains destressing phenomenon, but also offers clarifications to seemingly inexplicable reported field observations of <b>destress</b> blasting. Local fractures around the boreholes aligned along the principal stresses are found to be the cause of reported local stress concentration and rock stiffening post to <b>destress</b> blasting against the desired stress relaxation and softening...|$|E

Bureau of Mimes conducts {{research}} at the Galena Mine, Wallace, ID, {{with the aim of}} mitigating the effects of rock bursting. <b>Destress</b> blasting is commonly used as a stress control technique at the mine. A digital seismic array and an array of borehole pressure cells (BPC's) had been installed near the site of a stope undergoing mining and periodic destressing. The instrumentation was being monitored at the time of a <b>destress</b> blast of the 46 - 99 stope.

BPC measurements indicated coseismic ground pressure changes on the order of 200 to 300 kPa associated with the damaging events. Fault plane solutions and dislocation models established that stress changes induced by the event at 034500 may have been significant in promoting the occurrence of the event at 122020.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} facing mining engineers when dealing with deep, hard rock mines is to prevent and/or reduce rockburst hazard around mine openings. Rockburst is a phenomenon which is characterised by violent rock failure. The current research focuses on the assessment and control of rockbursts in deep, hard rock mines. Strainbursts, or strain-type rockbursts, occur {{in the vicinity of}} mine openings and are generally provoked by high stress conditions in a brittle rock mass. A new theory has been developed for the assessment of the potential of violent rock failure by strainburst, in underground hard rock mines. In this theory, the mining-induced energy parameters are used to calculate the so-called burst potential index (BPI). When the BPI reaches or exceeds 100 %, the method predicts a burst prone situation. One of the most commonly used methods to control strainbursts in hard rock mines is <b>destress</b> blasting. Motivated by the lack of a dedicated analysis tool to help assess <b>destress</b> blasting, a new, geomechanical model was developed. The technique employs two newly introduced parameters, alpha, a rock fragmentation factor, and beta, a stress dissipation factor, inside the modelled, fractured zone. Implemented in a 3 -dimensional finite element code developed by the author, the new model simulates the damage zone induced by <b>destress</b> blasting of a mining face to help evaluate the efficiency of <b>destress</b> blasting. Extensive model verification and parametric studies have been undertaken. The effects of the <b>destress</b> blasting pattern, premining stresses and their orientation, and the two <b>destress</b> blasting factors (rock fragmentation factor, and stress dissipation factor) are studied. The model has been applied successfully to Canadian mine case histories. A detailed case study of a cut-and-fill mine stope involving crown and sill pillar destressing has been carried out. It is shown that the new method can be useful in the assessment of <b>destress</b> blasting in deep drift face development and the crown/sill pillar problems in cut-and-fill mine stopes...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} if large-scale choked panel <b>destress</b> blasting can provide sufficient beneficial stress reduction in highly-stressed remnant ore pillar that is planned for production. The orebody is divided into 20 stopes over 2 levels, and 2 panels are choke-blasted in the hanging wall to shield the ore pillar by creating a stress shadow around it. A linear-elastic model of the mining system is constructed with finite difference code FLAC 3 D. The effect of <b>destress</b> blasting in the panels is simulated by applying a fragmentation factor (α) to the rock mass stiffness and a stress reduction factor (β) to {{the current state of}} stress in the region occupied by the <b>destress</b> panels. As an extreme case, the <b>destress</b> panel is also modeled as a void to obtain the maximum possible beneficial effects of destressing and stress shadow. Four stopes are mined in the stress shadow of the panels in 6 lifts and then backfilled. The effect of <b>destress</b> blasting on the remnant ore pillar is quantified based on stress change and brittle shear ratio (BSR) in the stress shadow zone compared to the base case without <b>destress</b> blasting. To establish realistic rock fragmentation and stress reduction factors, model results are compared to measured stress changes reported for case studies at Fraser and Brunswick mines. A 1. 5  MPa immediate stress decrease was observed 20  m away from the panel at Fraser Mine, and a 4  MPa immediate stress decrease was observed 25  m away at Brunswick Mine. Comparable results are obtained from the current model with a rock fragmentation factor α of 0. 2 and a stress reduction factor β of 0. 8. It is shown that a <b>destress</b> blasting with these parameters reduces the major principal stress in the nearest stopes by 10 – 25  MPa. This yields an immediate reduction of BSR, which is deemed sufficient to reduce volume of ore at risk in the pillar...|$|E

Maximum strain energy storage in chain pillars appears to have occurred just prior to the first of four split cuts.

Splitting the chain pillars into two 17. 5 -by 70 -ft wings removed the confinement load, resulting in pillar yield.

40|$|The advance-and-relieve method {{benefits}} from lateral <b>destressing</b> associated with mining in laminated rocks {{and a high}} horizontal stress regime. This stress control method is based on measurements showing that occurrence of rock failure in the roof and floor of an entry (or caving of roof strata in a panel gob) results in redistribution of stresses in adjacent entries. By locating other entries within the shadow zone of the first entry (or gob), improvements in stability can be achieved. Numerical modeling proved useful in studying the basic mechanics of lateral relief while investigating the sensitivity of results to different geologic and mining parameters using controlled experiments. It was shown that failure of rocks near an entry results in redistribution of horizontal stress and shifting of the stress to higher horizons. Measurements from two mines are consistent in showing significant horizontal stress reductions {{in comparison with the}} far-field stress regime within the destressed zone. Although the far-field stress regime is very anisotropic, these measurements show near-equal secondary principal horizontal stresses, or perhaps a switch in orientation, as a result of <b>destressing.</b> Stress relief is achieved through lateral movement and relaxation of rocks along weak bedding planes toward adjacent caved zones (or softened zone). Because of cave geometry in the advancing panel, horizontal stress concentrations occur near the cave line both in front of the face and to the sides. The horizontal stress concentration reaches 1. 7 times the far-field stress ahead of the face. This stress increase is significant and may cause structural damage in this zone benefiting from additional support. In the next advancing panel located within the shadow zone of the gob, horizontal stresses are significantly reduced in the roof (by 50 %). Thus, the stability of future advancing panel can be improved through prudent layout designs and sequencing. The width of the relief zone is significantly influenced by the height of the softened (or cave zone) and rock mass properties...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnderground {{longwall}} mining of coal seams in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin {{is currently being}} carried out under increasingly difficult geological and mining conditions. Mining depth, dislocations and mining remnants are the main factors responsible for the most significant rockburst hazard, which can be minimized via the use of active and passive rockburst prevention. Active rockburst prevention in longwalls is usually based on blasting, in order to either <b>destress</b> local stress concentrations in the rock mass or to fracture the thick layers of strong roof rocks to prevent or minimize the impact of high energy tremors on excavations. The accurate estimation of active rockburst prevention effectiveness is particularly important when mining under disadvantageous geological and mining conditions, which are associated {{with high levels of}} this hazard. The efficiency of blasting applied for this purpose is typically evaluated from the seismic effect, which is calculated based on seismic monitoring data and the weight of the charged explosive.
