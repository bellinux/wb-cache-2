25|$|A week later, United {{had their}} worst {{start of the}} season, falling 2–0 to the Chicago Fire at home, giving the club an 0–3–0 home record, and a 0–2–0 away record. In spite of the poor start, there were some signs of <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come, with United taking in their first victory since the Carolina Challenge Cup during a U.S. Open Cup play-on proper match against Dallas on April 28. There, United took a 4–2 win, and edged closer to Open Cup qualification.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was illegal}} in many states for slaves {{to learn to read}} or write, soul food recipes and cooking {{techniques}} tended to be passed along orally, until after emancipation. The first soul food cookbook is attributed to Abby Fisher, entitled What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking and published in 1881. <b>Good</b> <b>Things</b> <b>to</b> Eat was published in 1911; the author, Rufus Estes, was a former slave who worked for the Pullman railway car service. Many other cookbooks were written by Black Americans during that time, but as they were not widely distributed, most are now lost.|$|E
25|$|Dilthey {{was also}} {{interested}} in what some would call sociology in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. He objected to their dialectical/evolutionist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, {{as well as their}} narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of positivism was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say about the neo-Kantian sociology of Georg Simmel, with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of Max Weber, the primary founder of sociological antipositivism. J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of nonpositivist verstehende sociology and the Verstehen method.|$|E

500|$|In 1881, O'Connell {{published}} Lyrics, a book {{of poetry}} evincing a [...] "Celtic strain." [...] The poetry displays O'Connell's sense of sunt lacrimae rerum, {{that there will be}} tears with trials, and it expresses his bittersweet joy in life's evanescent pleasures. O'Connell wrote an Irish-themed play, The Red Fox, which was staged with moderate success in San Francisco about 1882. O'Connell wrote [...] "Ghoul's Quest" [...] for The Argonaut. In 1891, he published The Inner Man: <b>Good</b> <b>Things</b> <b>to</b> Eat and Drink and Where to Get Them, a collection of anecdotes and advice for the epicurean who finds himself in the San Francisco area, and a cautionary description of common 19th century food adulterants such as chemical dyes and powdered lead.|$|E
500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's a lot of <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel {{it in front of}} you and you want to grab it."

500|$|Writing for The Guardian, the {{journalist}} and broadcaster Lesley Riddoch {{took a different}} view, suggesting that the launch of a pro-independence newspaper {{in a country where}} 45% of the population had recently voted for independence [...] "may be a large but calculated risk and a very sound business move", and that [...] "Perhaps the novelty and sheer boldness of the National newspaper will match the national mood". Kirkpatrick, although critical of its online shortfalls, was positive about the paper's content, describing it as [...] "a lively mix of briefs and longer pieces". Douglas Beattie of the New Statesman said The National [...] "has a clear raison d’etre and will be welcomed by a large number of the 1.6 million Scots who voted Yes". Stephen Daisley of STV News wrote that it was [...] "both frustratingly light [...] stodgily worthy", but drew favourable comparisons with the Scottish Standard, a weekly pro-independence paper launched in 2005 that ceased publication after just seven issues, suggesting The National would succeed because it had more financial backing, and as there was a latent demand for a news sheet supporting independence. Writing in The Guardian, {{the journalist}} and author Peter Preston said there were [...] "many <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say about the National" [...] including its editor, who was leading a newspaper that [...] "helps to reflect public opinion better".|$|E

2500|$|Germain's contemporaries {{also had}} <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say {{relating}} {{to her work}} in mathematics.

2500|$|Director David Livingston {{recalled}} {{that they had}} a difficult time finding somebody to play Ishka; at one point, he even made the unpopular suggestion that Wallace Shawn (Grand Nagus Zek) appear in drag as Quark and Rom's mother. [...] Andrea Martin was cast at the suggestion of episode director René Auberjonois (Odo), who felt the actress could manage the right balance of comedy and good acting that was missing from the applicants he had seen thus far.
