5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to <b>decision-makers</b> that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective <b>decision-makers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} <b>decision-makers</b> {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced {{than they did in}} the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E

25|$|In {{cases where}} the <b>decision-maker</b> is exercising power for {{multiple}} purposes, both proper and improper, the <b>decision-maker</b> will not have acted illegally {{so long as the}} dominant purpose for which the power has been exercised is a proper one. For the <b>decision-maker's</b> exercise of power to be successfully impugned, it has to be shown that the unlawful purpose was the primary object and not just something the <b>decision-maker</b> contemplated.|$|R
5|$|The basic {{principle}} that is applied {{by the courts}} is that where statute grants a power to a <b>decision-maker</b> for purpose A, it is unlawful for the <b>decision-maker</b> to exercise the power for purpose B, because the <b>decision-maker</b> would be using the power for an unauthorized purpose.|$|R
5|$|In the lead-up to the visit, the American Friends of Vietnam (AFV) {{engaged in}} a promotional {{campaign}} encouraging newspapers to cover Diệm's visit and imploring them to give the South Vietnamese president favourable coverage. The AFV also drafted many of Diệm's speeches, making sure that there were analogies made between South Vietnam and various events in American history, {{so that he would}} make a good impression on the American public and <b>decision-makers.</b> For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by <b>decision-makers.</b> Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{preparations}} for Operation Downfall, {{the invasion of}} Japan, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC) in April 1945, assuming command of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific except the Twentieth Air Force. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. During his planning of the invasion of Japan, MacArthur stressed to the <b>decision-makers</b> in Washington that it was essential to have the Soviet Union enter the war as he argued it was crucial to have the Red Army tie down the Kwantung army in Manchuria. The invasion was pre-empted by the surrender of Japan in August 1945. On 2 September MacArthur accepted the formal Japanese surrender aboard the battleship , thus ending hostilities in World War II. In recognition of {{his role as a}} maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

An empirical research was conducted on a sample of 165 SMEs in the mechanical sector. Results of the regression analysis suggest that <b>decision-maker</b> personality characteristics (need for achievement and risk attitude) and the typology of <b>decision-maker</b> exert more influence on international SDMP than <b>decision-maker</b> competencies and socio-demographic characteristics. Moreover, the study permits to find that political behavior is the dimension that is more influenced by the characteristics of the <b>decision-maker</b> (femininity, need for achievement, age, ability to use network) and not by the contextual factors, contrary to other dimensions...|$|R
30|$|Contradictory, {{inconsistent}} information: The {{share of}} information that contradicts the <b>decision-maker’s</b> evaluation so far. On the one hand, the <b>decision-maker</b> might tend to ignore or discard such information [e.g., to avoid cognitive dissonance (Festinger 1954)]. On the other hand, such information might urge the <b>decision-maker</b> to search for further information to obtain a clearer evaluation.|$|R
40|$|We study a <b>decision-maker</b> who is {{presented}} with a menu of three options to consume. The options are such {{that two of the}} bundles are extremely similar, though one is demonstrably inferior to the remaining options. We propose and analyze a model in which the <b>decision-maker's</b> preferences change continuously as he is initially presented with information before learning his true preferences. The <b>decision-maker</b> initially exhibits {{what is known as the}} "attraction effect," whereby he is influenced by the similarity in his choice set. As time passes the attraction effect diminshes and the <b>decision-maker's</b> decision-making is aligned with the Tversky hypothesis, the antithetical counterpart to the attraction effect. The <b>decision-maker's</b> optimal behavior depends on his patience and capacity for learning in addition to his baseline preferences...|$|R
5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on <b>decision-makers</b> subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against <b>decision-makers</b> by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of such initiatives, Romania {{tended to}} give little {{attention}} to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many <b>decision-makers</b> were still uncertain about the devotion of Transylvanians and Bukovinans, and worried that they might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks. Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation. Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of the Romanian Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project. The reversal of fortunes on the Romanian front had brought a Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and the Romanian military authority became pressured into finding new soldiers for the defensive action.|$|E
30|$|Valuable task-relevant {{information}}: The {{value of}} information is determined by its utility for decision-making. Information that increases the <b>decision-maker’s</b> insight and understanding of a decision situation obtains a higher value, whereas information that is useless to the <b>decision-maker</b> in the decision situation obtains a lower value. The valuable task-relevant information is the share of information for which the <b>decision-maker</b> actually searched.|$|R

25|$|Deliberative {{democracy}} {{is based on}} the notion that {{democracy is}} government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among <b>decision-makers</b> that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the <b>decision-makers</b> cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E
30|$|Which of the {{presented}} decision criteria a <b>decision-maker</b> {{should choose}} for {{the solution of}} the formulated problem, depends on his or her ambiguity attitude. For example, a <b>decision-maker</b> who has a strong aversion towards ambiguity and perceives ambiguity as threat would rather choose the i-fuzzy-maxmin criterion. A <b>decision-maker</b> who has a strongly positive perception of ambiguity would rather apply the i-fuzzy-maxmax criterion. The i-fuzzy-Hurwicz criterion is applicable for the formal expression of combinations of extreme attitudes towards ambiguity.|$|R

5000|$|Indirect {{procedures}} {{are referred to}} as preference disaggregation analysis. The preference disaggregation approach refers to the analysis of the <b>decision-maker's</b> global judgments in order to specify the parameters of the criteria aggregation model that best fit the <b>decision-maker's</b> evaluations. In the case of MCP, the <b>decision-maker's</b> global judgments are expressed by classifying a set of reference alternatives (training examples). The reference set may include: (a) some decision alternatives evaluated in similar problems in the past, (b) a subset of the alternatives under consideration, (c) some fictitious alternatives, consisting of performances on the criteria which can be easily judged by the <b>decision-maker</b> to express his/her global evaluation. Disaggregation techniques provide an estimate β* for the parameters of a decision model [...] based on the solution of an optimization problem of the following general form:where X is the set of reference alternatives, D(X) is the classification of the reference alternatives by the <b>decision-maker,</b> D'(X,fβ) are the recommendations of the model for the reference alternatives, L is a function that measures the differences between the <b>decision-maker's</b> evaluations and the model's outputs, and B is the set of feasible values for the model's parameters.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in economic theory, largely motivated by experimental findings, {{have led to}} the adoption of models of human behavior where a <b>decision-maker</b> not only takes into consideration her own payoff but also others’ payoffs and any potential consequences of these payoffs. Investigations of deontological motivations, where a <b>decision-maker</b> makes her choice not only based on the consequences of a decision but also the decision per se have been rare. We propose an experimental method that can detect an individual’s deontological motivations by varying the probability of the <b>decision-maker’s</b> decision having consequences. It uses two states of the world, one where the decision has consequences and one where it has none. We show that a purely consequentialist <b>decision-maker</b> whose preferences satisfy first-order stochastic dominance will choose the decision that leads to the best consequences regardless of the probability of the consequential state. A purely deontological <b>decision-maker</b> is also invariant to the probability. However, a mixed consequentialist-deontological <b>decision-maker’s</b> choice changes with the probability. The direction of change gives insight into the location of the optimand for one’s duty.
