40|$|Research {{was carried}} out aimed at the {{development}} of self-stratifying paints for steel which after application during film formation spontaneously form two well established layers of primer and top coat. The parameters affecting stratification were investigated for combinations of epoxy resins and physically drying binders. Incompatibility of the binders used was {{shown to be a}} necessary, although not a sufficient condition for stratification. The degree of incompatibility of the resins could be characterised reasonably by the extent of overlap of their solubility spheres in the Hansen solubility parameter concept. Very good stratifying paints of two pigmented binders could be formulated, while the pretreatment of the pigments with particular adhesion promoters can favour stratification considerably. During film formation of good stratifying paints, processes are occurring comparable to those resulting in the formation of Bénard cells. Thus, factors affecting the <b>floating</b> <b>process</b> also affect stratification. The presence of pigments of different particle size appeared to be a necessary condition.

The target was to increase the P 2 O 5 recovery to > 90 % at a constant P 2 O 5 grade while separating as much carbonate as possible. Several anionic collectors and combinations thereof were tested.

40|$|Abstract. Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra {{have been}} {{recorded}} from float glass samples and the data {{used to determine the}} depth profile of tin introduced from the <b>float</b> <b>process.</b> The luminescence data were interpreted in terms of intrinsic emission bands at 380 and 410 nm and well resolved extrinsic emission bands resulting from the tin impurities at 575 and 630 nm. Signals were recorded at temperatures from 40 to 300 K. The presence of the tin produces an optical waveguide in the glass surface {{as a result of the}} float production process. It was therefore possible to depth profile the tin by measurement of the waveguide modes. The CL and waveguide methods are in excellent agreement. Overall, the depth of tin diffusion was up to 8 - 9 Nm in the samples studied. The lifetimes and intensity of the signals are temperature dependent, and these parameters are reported for the 380 nm and 575 nm emission lines. Thermal treatments modify the CL spectra and such changes are considered the result of valence or aggregation states of the tin impurities. 1...|$|E

(Operations Management) For any {{organisation}} to {{be effective}} and efficient in achieving its goals, its employees must maintain a shared vision {{of what they are}} striving to achieve, as well as clear aims and objectives of the organisation. Employees may be grouped into teams with which play important roles in an organisation. Companies have discovered that the introduction of teams to the production process, leads to innovative and goal oriented performance, with new products generated at a faster pace. Teams become a force of change when interaction within the group is dynamic. Similarly, effective teams may influence productivity and improve quality. In this context, a study was conducted at the Ferrosilicon Plant of Dense Media Separation (DMS) Pty Ltd located in Meyerton, South Africa, where a sink <b>float</b> <b>process</b> for the separation of mineral particles, involving suspension of dense powders in water is used. The study focuses on team structures, which are currently experiencing job dissatisfaction.

At the root of the study is an attempt by management to resolve job dissatisfaction by facilitating team development, establishing explicit team norms and expectations, fostering a collaborative team climate, exercising leadership skills in pursuit of team goals and encouraging open and candid communication within the production section.

40|$|Float {{glass is}} widely used in {{architecture}} and in the automotive industry. During the <b>float</b> <b>process</b> tin diffuses into and reacts with the glass melt. The presence of tin in the glass surface region causes mismatch in thermoelastic properties between the bulk and the surface. This, in turn, can lead to wrinkling of the surface after the glass is subject to a toughening heat treatment. This project involves {{trying to understand the}} diffusion and reaction mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. A set of partial differential equations describing the important reaction-diffusion mechanisms has been proposed. This mathematical model is based on 3 redox reactions in the glass melt. 6 diffusing and reacting species have been considered, which comprise 3 redox couples, namely stannous and stannic tin, ferrous and ferric iron, and hydrogen atoms and ions. Using guessed parameters, the computer simulation shows the most striking feature of the tin depth profile - the tin hump, which is observed experimentally by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA). It can be observed from the simulations that stannous tin diffusing into the glass is oxidised to stannic tin by ferric iron. The tin hump is due to the immobile stannic tin. The shape and location of the hump can be influenced by the float bath atmosphere and the oxidising species in the glass. These features are in agreement with experimental findings. The simulation also reveals that the tin hump forming process is a dynamic process. The Sn(IV) forms and converts back to Sn(II) simultaneously as the hump moves in the glass melt. However, an inverse method has not been found to recover the parameters of the mathematical model from SIMS data. This is due to SIMS's data being only qualitative, as well as the complexity of the model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

In the present study, feed rods for the <b>float</b> zone <b>process</b> composed of a central slim rod and the deposited silicon from the Siemens process are investigated. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the slim rod has a significant impact on the purity and suitability for further crystallization processes.
