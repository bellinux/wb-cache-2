5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents {{are found to}} reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, <b>it</b> <b>pays</b> the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{people with}} Medicare can get {{prescription}} drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices <b>it</b> <b>pays</b> to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying for prescription drugs undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.|$|E
