This {{results in a}} reduced effective conduction band barrier height for <b>the</b> p-type AlGaN <b>electron</b> blocking layer (EBL) and makes <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> blocking effect relatively ineffective and <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> injection efficiency drops. Here, we show the concept of polarization self-screening for <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> injection efficiency. In this work, the proposed polarization self-screening effect was studied and proven through growing a p-type EBL with AlN composition partially graded along the [0001] orientation, which induces the bulk polarization charges. These bulk polarization charges are utilized to effectively self-screen the positive polarization induced interface charges located at the interface between the EBL and the last quantum barrier when designed properly.

30|$|As {{has been}} {{mentioned}} previously, the efficiency for LEDs is closely associated with <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> level. Therefore, we show the measured EL spectra for LEDs A and B in a semi-log scale (see Fig.  3 c) to indicate the detailed information regarding the parasitic luminescence. The peak emission wavelength for the parasitic luminescence is centered at ~[*] 425  nm, which may arise from the deep levels associated with Mg dopants [26]. The intensity of the parasitic luminescence for LED B is stronger than that for LED A, and it is speculated that more carriers recombine at the deep levels. In our experiment, the p-type hole injection layers for both DUV LED architectures are not engineered, and the hole concentration level in the hole injection layers shall be similar. Therefore, it is identified that electrons that escape from the MQW region possess a higher concentration in the hole injection layer for LED B than those for LED A. Our suggestions are further supported by Fig.  3 d that shows <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> concentration profiles in the p-type hole injection layers for LEDs A and B at the current density of 50  A/cm 2. This also means that <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> current has been significantly reduced thanks to the superlattice p-EBL for LED B.|$|R

30|$|Nitride-semiconductor {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) have been commercialized for solid state lighting [1, 2]. The polar c-plane LED (c-LED) {{suffers from a}} well-known efficiency droop, i.e., quantum efficiency reaching maximum at a very low current density and then gradual reduction under a higher injected current [3 – 13]. Polarization effects induced quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) [3 – 8], <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> [9, 10], poor hole injection efficiency [11 – 13], and nonuniform hole distribution among the quantum wells have been suggested to explain the origin of efficiency droop. Auger recombination [14, 15] and carrier delocalization from indium-rich regions to dislocations [16] have also been proposed. The growth of III-nitrides along the nonpolar m- and a-axes [11, 17, 18], semipolar axis [19], and -c-axis (nitrogen-polar) [20] can overcome polarization effects. Without polarization effects in a nonpolar m-plane LED (m-LED), more uniform hole distribution among the wells and suppressed electron overflow out of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> blocking layer can significantly reduce <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> current and efficiency droop [11].

30|$|Ultraviolet beams in the {{wavelength}} regime of 200  nm~ 280  nm have found potential applications in water purification system [1, 2]. Considering the low DC driving voltage {{and the more}} compatibility with the water purification system, AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV LEDs) are selected as the excellent candidate. It is worthy of mentioning that treating {{the water with a}} big volume requires the purification system to provide the high-power UVC light source. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for AlGaN-based DUV LEDs with the emission wavelength shorter than 280  nm is not satisfied at this moment [3]. The major limiting factor for the poor EQE partly arises from the large threading dislocation density (TDD) in the Al-rich quantum wells [2, 3]. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) quickly decreases once the TDD is in the order of 109  cm− 2 [3]. Even if the TDD is reduced to the order of 108  cm− 2 that can enable the IQE of 60 ~ 80 %, the effect of the efficiency droop may cause the EQE to be lower than 5 % for the bare UVC LEDs when the injection current density exceeds 80 A/cm 2 [4]. Note, the light extraction efficiency (LEE) for bare UVC LED chips is ~[*] 10 % according to FDTD calculations [5]. One of the leading interpretations for the efficiency droop of III-nitride-based LEDs is <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> spillover into <b>the</b> p-type hole injection layer [6]. The Al-rich AlGaN p-type hole injection layer possesses a free hole concentration even lower than 1 [*]×[*] 1017  cm− 3 [7], tending to cause a severer <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> level. Mehnke et al. have measured the parasitic emission that takes place in the p-type hole injection layer and the parasitic emission is well attributed to <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> [8]. To reduce <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> escape from <b>the</b> multiple quantum wells (MQWs), one can increase <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> capture rate by inserting single spike layers in the quantum barriers [9]. The spike layers possess the Al composition higher than the quantum barrier so the polarization induced electric field in the spike layers can well reduce the drift velocity of <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>improved</b> capture efficiency is therefore enabled only if the DUV LED is grown along the [0001] orientation. Another effective method to enhance <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> capture rate is to increase the conduction band offset between the quantum barrier and the quantum well, which can be realized by properly increasing the Al composition [10], while the quantum barrier architecture can be further evolved by having the Al composition graded [11]. As has been mentioned previously, the free hole concentration for the Al-rich p-type AlGaN hole injection layer is low which leads to the poor hole injection capability into the MQW region. The poor hole injection is also regarded as the cause of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> [12]. A promising method for increasing the hole thermionic emission across <b>the</b> p-type <b>electron</b> blocking layer (p-EBL) is to energize the holes by adopting the electric field reservoir [13]. The hole transport can also be favored if the p-AlGaN-based hole injection layer with the stair-cased Al composition is utilized for DUV LEDs [14]. The stair-cased Al composition can be further replaced by the graded Al composition for the AlGaN layer to enhance the hole concentration [15 – 17]. Besides engineering the hole injection layer, alternative p-EBLs have also been suggested to reduce the hole blocking effect, e.g., inserting a thin AlGaN layer with a lower Al composition [18]. A very important structure for the p-EBL candidate is the superlattice p-EBL. Tremendous research efforts have been made to explore the impact of the GaN/AlGaN superlattice for GaN-based blue LEDs [19 – 21]. Nevertheless, the AlGaN p-EBL for blue LEDs has the AlN composition lower than 20 %, making the hole blocking effect for blue LEDs not as severe as that for DUV LEDs. Therefore, the EQE improvement is smaller than 20 % and efficiency droop is still obvious even if the GaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL is adopted for blue LEDs. DUV LEDs employ Al-rich p-EBLs, giving rise to an even more challenging hole injection issue [1]. To solve the Al-rich p-EBL-caused hole blocking effect, superlattice p-EBL is also suggested for DUV LEDs, e.g., AlInGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL [22] and AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL [23]. However, the experimental proof of the superlattice p-EBL that helps to obtain high and nearly efficiency-droop-free EQE lacks for DUV LEDs at this stage. Therefore, this work experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of a specifically designed AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL in enhancing the EQE and significantly suppressing the efficiency droop for DUV LEDs. The enhanced EQE is well attributed to <b>the</b> <b>improved</b> hole injection into the MQW region while <b>the</b> reduced <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> level helps to remarkably suppress the efficiency droop. Detailed mechanism will be presented in this work subsequently.|$|R
