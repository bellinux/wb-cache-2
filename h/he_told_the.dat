5|$|In September 2009, Đuric {{agreed to}} join Sriwijaya of the Indonesian Super League for a {{reported}} US$110,000 a season contract. However, a month later, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> press that he declined the offer in the end because Sriwijaya tried to change {{the terms of the}} contract which was mutually agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of being sidelined, Jobs {{resigned}} from Apple on September 13, 1985. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> board he was leaving {{to set up a}} new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him. He also told the board that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing its designs back to them to market under the Macintosh brand.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{was interviewed}} by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court in 2014 that {{that had been a}} mistake. The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin {{immunity}} from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday. They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Mansour {{assumed the}} {{directorship}} on December 29, 1982, pending Michigan legislative confirmation in the position. Archbishop Szoka hardened his resolve, on February 23, 1983, directed the Detroit Province of the Sisters of Mercy {{to determine whether}} Mansour was {{in violation of the}} teachings of the Church. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Sisters leadership that Mansour no longer had his permission to serve the state, and he ordered them to inform her that she was to resign the state appointment.|$|E
5|$|The French Directory did as well. In mid April, {{suffering}} from an nephritic complaint, Jourdan handed over command to {{his chief of}} staff, general of division Jean Augustin Ernouf, and returned to Paris {{to complain about the}} lack of men, the inexperience of the men he had, their supplies, and the size, experience, and supply of the army he had to face. He found little sympathy there, and when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Directory that he was ill, tendering his resignation, it was accepted.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
60|$|He laughed heartily. Then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her <b>the</b> story. She {{listened with}} grave face.|$|R
60|$|And just as swiftly <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her <b>the</b> {{revelation that}} {{thinking}} {{had brought to}} him.|$|R

5|$|While in Amsterdam Monteux {{conducted}} {{a number of}} operas, including Pelléas et Mélisande (its Dutch premiere), Carmen, Les Contes d'Hoffmann, a Lully and Ravel double bill of Acis et Galatée and L'Heure espagnole, Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride (also brought to the Paris Opéra) and Verdi's Falstaff. Toscanini {{had been invited to}} conduct the last of these, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> promoters that Monteux was his dearest colleague and the best conductor for Falstaff.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he}} had warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E

5|$|George Burley {{took over}} from Redknapp in December 2005, though neither manager {{was unable to}} put {{together}} an effective promotion campaign and Southampton ended the season 12th in the Championship. Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken a pay cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E
5|$|Mark Pennant, aged 15, {{was arrested}} on 9 October 1985 and charged with murder two days later, the first person charged in {{connection}} with the killing. Born in England to West Indian parents, Pennant had been raised in the West Indies until he was nine, after which he returned to the UK; he was diagnosed with learning difficulties and was attending a special school. He was arrested and handcuffed at school, taken to Wood Green Police Station, and interviewed six times over the course of two days with a teacher in attendance. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> police that he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice, and named Winston Silcott as the ringleader and several others, including another juvenile, Mark Lambie.|$|E
5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America {{at the end of the}} year. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E

5|$|The Afghan Emir {{was warned}} by New Delhi of the {{approach}} of the expedition even while efforts were underway to intercept it in the Persian desert. After it crossed into Afghanistan, the Emir was asked to arrest the members. However, Habibullah humoured the British without obeying the Viceroy's requests. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Viceroy that he intended to remain neutral and could not take any actions that were overtly pro-British. Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan. Through British channels, the Russians voiced their concerns about the Emir's tolerance of the German presence and their intrigues with Pro-German Afghan counsellors.|$|E
5|$|After the {{acquisition}} of Jay Cutler, Hester took on the role as the de facto number one wide receiver. In {{the first game of}} the season, Hester caught seven passes from Cutler for 90 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown reception. In the following weeks Hester began to develop a rapport with Cutler and amassed 634 receiving yards and three touchdowns though the first ten weeks of the season. He played the best game of the season on October 25, 2009 against the Cincinnati Bengals, catching eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown. In a game against the St. Louis Rams during the thirteenth week of the season, Hester injured his calf and missed three starts. Hester returned to play in the Bears season finale against the Detroit Lions, catching three passes for 75 yards. Despite missing the three starts, Hester led the team with 757 receiving yards, and finished behind Greg Olsen in receptions. Hester built his reputation around his kick returning abilities, but his kickoff-returning duties decreased significantly following the 2007 season finale. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Tribune that he plans on spending the offseason honing his receiving and returning skills by strengthening in his legs, especially to fully recover from the calf injury he sustained earlier.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 Soviet monetary reform, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet roubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He was succeeded as premier by Ivan Silayev.|$|E

5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not be playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that any move would depend on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|Harry and Debbie punish Annie by not {{allowing}} {{her to go to}} Naomi's party. When they reconsider and decide to let her go, they discover that she has already left. Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy that they have a son together, whom she gave up for adoption over twenty years ago. Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he is trying to be the good guy he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid {{spend the rest of the}} night swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks to the father of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E
