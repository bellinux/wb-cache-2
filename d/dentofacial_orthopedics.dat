30|$|<b>Dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treatment, in {{particular}} rapid maxillary expansion (RME), is indicated {{for a wide}} variety of clinical conditions routinely faced by the orthodontist [1]. Frequently observed morphological problems involve an underdevelopment of the midface, which can be manifested by a constricted high-arched palate and poor transverse and/or sagittal maxillary growth [2].|$|R
30|$|Twelve {{patients}} with BCLP, who showed severely deformed premaxilla, {{were included in}} this study. Eight patients were diagnosed as complete BCLP and four patients were diagnosed as unsymmetrical BCLP. The ages of patients {{at the time of}} premaxillary setback ranged from 5  months to 8  years and 1  month. All patients had not undergone any type of <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treatment, except labial taping.|$|R
30|$|Repair of {{bilateral}} cleft lip concomitant with premaxillary setback and primary rhinoplasty was successfully performed without jeopardizing the premaxillary segment or the philtral flap. Therefore, {{this can be}} a useful strategy for patients with BCLP, who cannot take advantage of social care, or failed to <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treatments. We need to wait to check whether this procedure inhibits the mid-facial growth.|$|R

30|$|Treatment {{modalities}} {{range from}} <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treatments using protraction facemasks [8] and camouflage orthodontic treatments to a combined orthodontic jaw surgery. The extra-oral protraction face mask (PFM) {{is the most}} efficient appliance for short- to long-term use [9 – 11]. Rapid maxillary expansion (RME), in conjunction with PFM, has been claimed to disrupt circummaxillary sutures, which in turn might enhance the skeletal effects [12]. By contrast, some evidence has suggested that RME provides no benefit to the outcomes of PFM [13].|$|R
40|$|In orthodontics, a {{clinician}} {{often has}} {{to evaluate the}} patient’s physiologic and skeletal maturation before conducting the treatment. The most favor-able orthodontic and <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treat-ment outcomes occur when the treatment begins at a patient’s optimal maturation stage. Because there are considerable variations in development among individuals of the same chronological age, it has been advised the chronological age is not reliable for evaluating the skeletal maturation of an individual. Several biologic indicators have been proposed to assess individual physiologi...|$|R
30|$|Rapid maxillary {{expansion}} (RME) is a <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> {{procedure that}} is routinely used by dental clinicians and orthodontists to treat maxillary transverse discrepancies such as “posterior crossbites”; the same technique {{has been reported}} by some researchers to help expand the upper airway and improve breathing function in patients with nasal breathing disorders [1 - 3]. The main objective would be that correcting the existing posterior crossbite and widening of the maxillary dental arch is expected to reduce maxillary constriction and mouth breathing, thereby reliving the symptoms through decreasing the nasal resistance [1 - 5].|$|R

3000|$|According to Ball et al. [11], on average, {{patients}} {{remain in}} CS- 3 for 1.77 years and in CS- 4 for 3.79 years. Often, {{we do not}} know at what time of the stage the cephalogram was taken, thus making it very difficult to assess the exact timing of growth spurt. The cervical vertebral maturation stages should be used along with other methods of biologic maturity assessment when considering both <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treatment and orthognathic surgery.

40|$|Orthodontists and maxillo-facial {{surgeons}} {{are very}} aware of the different therapeutic options for the correction of maxillary transverse deficiencies. But what about mandibular transverse deficiencies? A number of <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> mandibular expansion techniques have been suggested, but they often {{have a tendency to}} relapse. Symphyseal distraction is the easiest solution for the correction of mandibular transverse defects, particularly in cases of a major deficiency such as Brodie’s Syndrome. In addition to recreating a physiologic occlusion, this technique makes it possible to considerably increase the width of the bony and soft tissue that not only improves the patient’s function and esthetics, but also helps to ensure long-term occlusal stability as well...|$|R
40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the precision and accuracy of angular measurements using three-dimensional computed tomography (3 D-CT) volume rendering by computer systems. Study design. The study population consisted of 28 dried skulls that were scanned with a 64 -row multislice CT, and 3 D-CT images were generated. Angular measurements, (n = 6) based upon conventional craniometric anatomical landmarks (n = 9), were identified independently in 3 D-CT images by 2 radiologists, twice each, and were then performed by 3 D-CT imaging. Subsequently, physical measurements were made by a third examiner using a Beyond Crysta-C 9168 series 900 device. Results. The results demonstrated no statistically significant difference between interexaminer and intraexaminer analysis. The mean difference between the physical and 3 -D-based angular measurements was - 1. 18 % and - 0. 89 %, respectively, for both examiners, demonstrating high accuracy. Conclusion. Maxillofacial analysis of angular measurements using 3 D-CT volume rendering by 64 -row multislice CT is established and can be used for orthodontic and <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> applications...|$|R

30|$|Institutional {{review board}} of Gangneung-Wonju National University Dental Hospital {{approved}} this retrospective study (IRB No. 2016 - 015) {{for patients with}} BCLP. Inclusion criteria were as follows: nonsyndromic bilateral cleft lip and palate, the patients who had not underwent previous <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treatments, and {{the distance between the}} central and the lateral alveolar segments was over 5  mm on either side. Surgeries were performed by one surgeon between 2015 and 2017. Data were obtained from medical records and perioperative photographs. The surgical techniques were as follows. Under general anesthesia, primary cheiloplasty was performed concomitantly with premaxillary setback and primary rhinoplasty. Through a midline incision on the inferior border of the vomer, minimal amount of the bone was removed using a bone rongeur, anterior to the VPS, when the premaxilla was predominantly rotating. After bending the premaxilla, the wound was approximated without interosseous fixation. However, when the premaxilla was predominantly protruding, the required bone was removed posterior to the VPS. After premaxillary setback, it was stabilized via suture material or titanium plate and screws. After premaxillary repositioning, we established orbicularis muscular continuity and philtral flap preparation, which was narrow enough to meet the modern surgical concept of bilateral cleft lip repair [6]. Finally, the flattened nasal cartilages were exposed via nostril-rim or reverse U-shaped incision. For all patients, lower lateral cartilages of the nose were approximated using two or three transfixation sutures with 5 – 0 PDS.|$|R
40|$|Mandibular prognathism (MP) or {{skeletal}} Class III malocclusion with a prognathic mandible {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe maxillofacial deformities. Facial growth modification can be an effective method of resolving skeletal Class III jaw discrepancies in growing children with <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> appliances including the chincup, face mask, maxillary protraction combined with chincup traction and the Fränkel functional regulator III appliance. Orthognathic surgery in conjunction with orthodontic treatment is required for the correction of adult MP. The two most commonly applied surgical procedures to correct MP are sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) and intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy. Both procedures are suitable for patients in whom a desirable occlusal relationship can be obtained with a setback of the mandible, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In bilateral SSRO, the intentional ostectomy of the posterior part of the distal segment can offer long-term positioned stability. This may be attributable to reduction of tension in the pterygomasseteric sling that applies force in the posterior mandible. While various environmental factors have been found to contribute to the development of MP, heredity plays a substantial role. The relative contributions of genetic and environmental components in the etiology of MP are unclear. The recent identification of the genetic susceptibilities to MP constitutes the first step toward understanding the molecular pathogenesis of MP. Further studies in molecular biology are needed to identify the gene-environment interactions associated with the phenotypic diversity of MP and the heterogenic developmental mechanisms thought to be responsible for them...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case of}} a 12 -year-old girl with maxillary deficiency, mandibular prognathism, and facial asymmetry, undergoing growth hormone (GH) therapy due to idiopathic short stature. Children of short stature with or without GH deficiency have a deviating craniofacial morphology with overall smaller dimensions; facial retrognathism, especially mandibular retrognathism; and increased facial convexity. However, a complete opposite craniofacial pattern was presented in our case of a skeletal Class III girl with idiopathic short stature. The orthodontic treatment goal was to inhibit or change the direction of mandibular growth and stimulate the maxillary growth of the girl during a course of GH therapy. Maxillary protraction and mandibular retraction were achieved using occipitomental anchorage (OMA) orthopedic appliance in the first stage of treatment. In the second stage, the patient was treated with a fixed orthodontic appliance using a modified multiple-loop edgewise archwire technique of asymmetric mechanics and an active retainer of vertical chin-cup. The treatment led to an acceptable facial profile and obvious facial asymmetry improvement. Class I dental occlusion and coincident dental midline were also achieved. A 3 ½-year follow-up of the girl at age 18 showed a stable result of the orthodontic and <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopedic</b> treatment. Our case shows that the OMA orthopedic appliance of maxillary protraction combined with mandibular retraction is effective for correcting skeletal Class III malocclusion with midface deficiency and mandibular prognathism in growing children with idiopathic short stature undergoing GH therapy...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare skeletal maturation in obese patients and in subjects of normal weight to evaluate the best timing for orthopedic and orthodontic treatment. The null hypothesis was that obese and normal-weight patients show similar degrees of skeletal maturation. Methods: The sample for this retrospective study consisted of 50 white patients (28 boys, 22 girls) whose x-rays (hand-wrist and lateral cephalometric radiographs) were already available. The test group included 25 obese patients (11 girls, 14 boys; average age, 9. 8 ± 2. 11 years), and the control group included 25 subjects of normal weight (11 girls, 14 boys; average age, 9. 9 ± 2. 5 years). Skeletal maturation was determined by using the carpal analysis method and the cervical vertebral maturation method. Results: According to the carpal analysis, there was a significant difference between skeletal and chronologic ages between the test group (11. 8 ± 11. 4 months) and the control group (- 2. 9 ± 3. 1 months). Furthermore, the obese subjects exhibited a significantly higher mean cervical vertebral maturation score (2. 8 ± 0. 7) than did the control subjects (2 ± 0. 6) (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Compared with the normal-weight subjects, the obese subjects showed a higher mean discrepancy between skeletal and chronologic ages according to the carpal analysis and had a significantly higher cervical vertebral maturation score. Thus, to account for the growth in obese patients with skeletal discrepancies, it might be necessary to perform examinations and <b>dentofacial</b> and <b>orthopedic</b> treatments earlier than in normal-weight subjects...|$|R
