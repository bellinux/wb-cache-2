5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did {{not justify}} why he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre {{should be considered}} an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of tissues from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium represented an <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E

5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
5|$|In this {{variation}} White {{tries to}} avoid the move a2–a3 {{in order to gain}} a tempo over the 7.a3 variation. After the standard moves 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.Be2 followed by 10.0-0 it is Black's last chance to exchange the Bb4 for the Nd2. The game will take an <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> structure depending on whether Black gives up the bishop pair or tries to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{considered}} the song his greatest accomplishment. The track incorporates reverse-recorded instrumentation and tape loops, and was created from the editing together of two separate {{versions of the}} song – each one <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> in tempo, mood and musical key. The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP (although not on the British double EP package of the same name).|$|E
50|$|Hear and Now is {{the second}} and final album by Butts Band, {{released}} in 1975. With the exception of founders Robby Krieger and John Densmore, the band consists <b>entirely</b> of <b>different</b> musicians than the band's debut album.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Scott Joplin {{was taking}} ragtime in a new {{direction}} by adding emphasis on form and tonality, and attempting to combine the characteristics of classical Western music and traditional ragtime.

5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their decentralized mode of planning was <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as {{it was difficult to}} extract information from them. Nonetheless, he established a good working relationship with the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Frank Berryman.|$|E
5|$|A {{water polo}} tournament {{was held on}} the Seine on 11 and 12 August 1900 {{as part of the}} 1900 Summer Olympics. Eight teams from four countries, all European, entered the event, {{although}} only seven ended up playing. The Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester, England, which has been listed with two rosters that are nearly <b>entirely</b> <b>different,</b> became the first Olympic water polo champions by defeating the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club of Belgium. Third place went to the two French-based semi-finalists, Libellule de Paris and Pupilles de Neptune de Lille, the latter of whom entered two teams, but merged them together after the first round.|$|E

5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), {{despite the fact that}} the TV movie is about an <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> character.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5000|$|The first Kid Acero was {{the basic}} Big Jim {{standard}} figure from 1974 which came with red {{shorts and a}} dumbbell. The initial series of Kid Acero was composed <b>entirely</b> of <b>different</b> versions of Kid Acero in sport, adventure, and jungle outfits, which belongs to the '72 and 73' Big Jim action figures.|$|R

30|$|As {{it can be}} noticed, the {{equation}} for the transport coefficient differs very slightly from those found by Cleaver and Yates (1975) model; however, they were developed in <b>entirely</b> two <b>different</b> approaches. Hence, in this work we will discuss the Cleaver and Yates (1975) model which can be also representative of Jamialahmadi et al.’s (2009) model.|$|R
5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans are mixed with tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting in an <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E
5|$|Sam Mendes {{directed}} a 1993 RSC production in which Simon Russell Beale's Ariel was openly resentful {{of the control}} exercised by Alec McCowen's Prospero. Controversially, in the early performances of the run, Ariel spat at Prospero, once granted his freedom. An <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> effect was achieved by George C. Wolfe in the outdoor New York Shakespeare Festival production of 1995, where the casting of Aunjanue Ellis as Ariel opposite Patrick Stewart's Prospero charged the production with erotic tensions. Productions in the late 20th-century have gradually increased the focus placed on sexual tensions between the characters, including Prospero/Miranda, Prospero/Ariel, Miranda/Caliban, Miranda/Ferdinand and Caliban/Trinculo.|$|E
5|$|She {{reunited with}} Eguchi {{to create the}} soundtrack to Final Fantasy X-2 in 2003, with Matsueda {{contributing}} most of the setting themes. Having replaced Final Fantasys regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu to create a work <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> from the predecessor Final Fantasy X, their score {{has become one of}} the most criticized soundtracks in the series. However, despite the negative response and a low budget, it was commercially successful. The following year, she worked on Final Fantasy X-2s international version Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission and provided three arrangements to the Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection album. The Piano Collections album was her last credited work, and she has since left Square Enix along with Eguchi.|$|E
50|$|The bone rank system's extreme {{rigidity}} certainly {{helped to}} weaken Silla {{toward the end}} of the Unified Silla period, although numerous other factors were at play. After the fall of Silla, the bone rank system was abolished <b>entirely,</b> although <b>different</b> and somewhat more flexible caste systems persisted until near the end of the Joseon Dynasty in the late 19th century.|$|R

5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> outcome.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar was {{to replace}} the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 in the close air support, {{tactical}} reconnaissance and tactical strike roles, freeing the Phantom {{to be used for}} air defence. Both the French and British trainer requirements had developed significantly, and were eventually fulfilled instead by the Alpha Jet and Hawker Siddeley Hawk respectively. The French, meanwhile, had chosen the Jaguar {{to replace the}} Aeronavale's Dassault Étendard IV, and increased their order to include an initial 40 of a carrier-capable maritime version of the Jaguar, the Jaguar M, for the Aeronavale. From these apparently disparate aims would come a single and <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> aircraft: relatively high-tech, supersonic, and optimised for ground-attack in a high-threat environment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the process of}} behavioral conversion of digital circuits used for signal processing applications into its neural network counterpart [1][2]. The neural network so devised represents simulated digital circuits without any deviation in its input–output characteristics. However, the design of such networks depends <b>entirely</b> on <b>different</b> parameters and thus the design process too. It is believed that, if designed properly, the software format of neural network will be helpful in replacing various important hardware circuits in the digital systems calls for precision [4][5]...|$|R
