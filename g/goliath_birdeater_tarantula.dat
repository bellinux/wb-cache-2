5000|$|This spider is shares its genus to {{the tiny}} (inch long) b. lennoni, the John Lennon tarantula, and has many traits that imply it {{is closely related to}} Theraphosa blondi the <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> spider, largest known extant spider species ...|$|R
5000|$|Though {{very small}} (about 1 inch), this {{tarantula}} shares its genus with relatively large b. horrida, with a five inch legspan, and has many traits that imply it {{is closely related}} to Theraphosa blondi the <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> spider, largest known extant spider species ...|$|R
50|$|Arachnoland houses over 15 {{species of}} spider from black widows to tarantulas. They {{also have the}} world's largest spider species, the <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeater.</b> Arachnoland also {{includes}} a collection of scorpions including Imperial Scorpions that glow in the dark. Once again these are all behind glass.|$|R
50|$|With a legspan {{estimated}} to be 50 cm, this would have made Megarachne servinei the largest spider to have ever existed, far exceeding the <b>goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> (Theraphosa blondi) which has a maximum legspan of only around 30 cm. The discovery quickly became popular and various exhibits with reconstructions of Megarachne servinei as a gigantic spider were set up in museums around the world.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to threats, <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeaters</b> stridulate by rubbing setae on their pedipalps and legs. Also when threatened, they rub their abdomen with their hind legs and release hairs {{that are a}} severe irritant to the skin and mucous membranes. These urticating hairs can be harmful to humans, and the species is considered by some {{to have the most}} harmful tarantula urticating hair of all.|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, it is {{rare for}} the <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> to {{actually}} prey on birds; in the wild, its diet consists primarily of earthworms and toads. However, because of its size and opportunistic predatory behavior, {{it is not uncommon}} for this species to kill and consume a variety of insects and small terrestrial vertebrates. In the wild, T. blondi has been observed feeding on rodents, frogs, toads, lizards, and even snakes.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> (Theraphosa blondi) {{belongs to}} the {{tarantula}} family Theraphosidae. Found in northern South America, {{it is the largest}} spider in the world by mass and size, but it is second to the giant huntsman spider by leg-span. It is also called the Goliath bird-eating spider; the practice of calling theraphosids [...] "bird-eating" [...] derives from an early 18th-century copper engraving by Maria Sibylla Merian that shows one eating a hummingbird. It only rarely preys on adult birds.|$|R
2500|$|Large spiders used in Hollywood movies (e.g., Indiana Jones series, The Mummy Returns) {{are often}} Brachypelma hamorii or Brachypelma emilia {{because they are}} very docile, though the much less {{expensive}} and only moderately more aggressive Chilean rose tarantula is frequently used, as well. [...] While it is almost unheard of for a Brachypelma to bite a human, they are quick to kick urticating hairs in self-defense, though their hairs can be less irritating than those of other species, especially the <b>goliath</b> <b>birdeater.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> is {{native to}} the upland rain forest regions of {{northern}} South America: Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, northern Brazil and southern Venezuela. Most noticeable is in the Amazon rainforest, the spider is terrestrial, living in deep burrows, and is found commonly in marshy or swampy areas. It is a nocturnal species. The spider {{is part of the}} local cuisine in northeastern South America, prepared by singeing off the urticating hairs and roasting it in banana leaves. The flavor has been described as [...] "shrimplike".|$|R
2500|$|Reaction and {{the degree}} of {{irritation}} to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question. [...] Some, such as those of the Chilean rose tarantula (Grammastola rosea) and the Pinktoe tarantula (Avicularia avicularia), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. [...] Others, such as those of the Brazilian giant white knee tarantula (Acanthoscurria geniculata), are moderately irritating. [...] Still others, such as the <b>Goliath</b> <b>Birdeater</b> (Theraphosa blondi), are far more severe. [...] These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.|$|R
50|$|New-world tarantulas (those {{found in}} North and South America) are {{equipped}} with urticating hairs (technically bristles) on their abdomen, and will almost always throw these barbed bristles as a first line of defense. These bristles will irritate sensitive areas {{of the body and}} especially seem to target curious animals who may sniff these bristles into the mucous membranes of the nose. Some species have more effective urticating bristles than others. The <b>Goliath</b> <b>Birdeater</b> is one species known for its particularly irritating urticating bristles. Urticating bristles can penetrate the cornea so eye protection should be worn when handling such tarantulas.|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{species of}} {{arachnid}} by length {{is probably the}} giant huntsman spider (Heteropoda maxima) of Laos, which in 2008 replaced the <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> (Theraphosa blondi) of northern South America as the largest known spider by leg-span. However the most massive arachnids, of comparable dimensions and possibly even greater mass, are the Chaco golden knee, Grammostola pulchripes, and the Brazilian salmon pink, Lasiodora parahybana. The huntsman spider may span up to 29 cm across the legs, while in the New World [...] "tarantulas" [...] like Theraphosa can range up to 26 cm. In Grammostola, Theraphosa and Lasiodora, the weight is projected {{to be up to}} at least 150 g and body length is up to 10 cm.|$|R
50|$|Tarantulas sizes {{range from}} {{as small as}} a {{fingernail}} to as large as a dinner plate when the legs are fully extended. Depending on the species, the body length of tarantulas ranges from 2.5 to 10 cm, with leg spans of 8 - 30 cm. Leg span is determined by measuring from the tip of the back leg to the tip of the front leg on the opposite side. Some of the largest species of tarantula may weigh over 85 g; the largest of all, the <b>goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> (Theraphosa blondi) from Venezuela and Brazil, has been reported to attain a weight of 170 g and a leg-span of up to 30 cm, males being longer and females greater in girth. The fang size of this tarantula reaches a maximum of 1.5 in.|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} for his unorthodox, spontaneous, and daring style of {{presenting}} wildlife documentaries as well as for including factual knowledge in the proceedings. This has led some people to compare him to Steve Irwin. In his first television series for ITV, Giants, he swam with a great white shark without the protection of a cage. Other scenes included a <b>goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> spider, arguably the largest spider in the world, walking over his face, and Marven grappling a fifteen-foot African rock python deep in its underground lair. This style of presenting has won him many viewers and to date he has presented more than 30 wildlife programs and series for TV.In 2002 the Impossible Pictures production company asked him to present the Walking with Dinosaurs episodes Chased by Dinosaurs: The Giant Claw & Land Of Giants, and Sea Monsters. He then moved on to Prehistoric Park on ITV, a fictional series about travelling back in time to rescue examples of extinct creatures such as a Tyrannosaurus, Woolly Mammoth, Arthropleura and others. 2009 saw Marven feature in season 3, episode 4 of hit action drama Primeval, where he is seen playing with a baby Velociraptor before encountering a Giganotosaurus, which, it is implied, eats him off-screen. Both of these series were also made by Impossible Pictures.|$|R
2500|$|Nick Gordon was a film-making explorer, dubbed an Indiana Jones for his {{exploits}} in {{the demanding}} and often dangerous {{environment of the}} Amazon rainforest. [...] He spent 15 years shooting films for Survival, in Africa as well as South America, culminating in a definitive portrait of the jaguar that was seven years in the making. His first Survival one-hour focused on the giant otter, and the sanctuary afforded the animal in Guyana by conservationist Dianne McTurk. Gordon went to Venezuela to film the dinner-plate-sized <b>Goliath</b> <b>birdeater</b> spider that {{became the subject of}} his film Tarantula!, along with the nativePiaroa people who both worship and eat the spiders. He first explored the almost mystical story of the jaguar and its place in the culture and folklore of the native peoples in Creatures of the Magic Water, and completed his study of the shy and elusive big cats by working closely with the Yanamamo and Matis peoples. The title, Jaguar - Eater of Souls, reflected the tribal belief that a jaguar spirit devours the souls of the departed. The Matis formed {{an integral part of the}} film because of the way the jaguar dominates their culture and rituals. Gordon travelled the rainforest by dugout canoe and imported scaffolding into the heart of the forest to build 150-foot filming towers. He had a camp where he looked after orphaned animals, including two jaguars, and shared in some of the rainforest people's unusual rituals during the course of his filming. The debilitating tropical environment took a toll on his health and he resolved to spend time in the UK. He returned to the Amazon to shoot more films for a production company he had set up, and died there from a heart attack aged 51 in 2004.|$|R
