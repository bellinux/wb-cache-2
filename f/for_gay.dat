5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces <b>for</b> <b>gay</b> men.

5|$|In 1974 he {{was ordained}} into the Church of the Eternal Source, a Kemetic Pagan group, but moved on again in 1977, when {{he founded the}} Minoan Brotherhood as a Wiccan {{tradition}} <b>for</b> <b>gay</b> and bisexual men. Turning to academia, from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College, which he followed up with a master's degree in the subject at Bryn Mawr College from 1985 to 1988. Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, and died from a related Toxoplasma gondii infection the following year, converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand. In 2012, the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location <b>for</b> <b>gay</b> men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E
5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out <b>for</b> <b>gay</b> marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails {{to make a distinction}} between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them <b>for</b> <b>gay</b> pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore the integrity of the wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E
5|$|The {{favorite}} for qualification {{in both the}} 100m and 200m at the US Olympic Trials, Gay put in a strong performance in the heats. After a misjudgement {{in the first round}} almost caused him to miss out on qualification, Gay resolved to step up his pace, and he won the 100m quarter-final with a US record-setting run of 9.77s. Breaking Maurice Greene's nine-year-old record, this made Gay the third fastest 100m sprinter ever, after rivals Bolt and Powell. In the final the following day, Gay finished first in a wind-aided 9.68s (+4.1m/s). This was the fastest ever 100m time under any conditions, bettering the 9.69s record which Obadele Thompson had set 12 years earlier. The 200m event was a significant setback <b>for</b> <b>Gay</b> as he suffered a hamstring injury in the qualifiers and was subsequently ruled out of the event for the Olympics. The injury persisted for several weeks and he dropped out of track meetings in order to recover in time for the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation <b>for</b> <b>gay</b> and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of gay men and lesbians by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of gay men and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians.|$|E
