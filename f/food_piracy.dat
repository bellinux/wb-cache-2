50|$|The diet of non-{{breeding}} birds {{is similar}} to that of breeding birds, but food items are more often taken from dry areas. White storks wintering in western India have been observed to follow blackbuck to capture insects disturbed by them. Wintering white storks in India sometimes forage along with the woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus). <b>Food</b> <b>piracy</b> has been recorded in India with a rodent captured by a western marsh harrier appropriated by a white stork, while Montagu's harrier is known to harass white storks foraging for voles in some parts of Poland.|$|E
40|$|DNA barcoding is a {{molecular}} technology {{that allows the}} identification of any biological species by amplifying, sequencing and querying the information from genic and/or intergenic standardized target regions belonging to the extranuclear genomes. Although these sequences represent {{a small fraction of}} the total DNA of a cell, both chloroplast and mitochondrial barcodes chosen for identifying plant and animal species, respectively, have shown sufficient nucleotide diversity to assess the taxonomic identity of the vast majority of organisms used in agriculture. Consequently, cpDNA and mtDNA barcoding protocols are being used more and more in the food industry and food supply chains for food labeling, not only to support food safety but also to uncover <b>food</b> <b>piracy</b> in freshly commercialized and technologically processed products. Since the extranuclear genomes are present in many copies within each cell, this technology is being more easily exploited to recover information even in degraded samples or transformed materials deriving from crop varieties and livestock species. The strong standardization that characterizes protocols used worldwide for DNA barcoding makes this technology particularly suitable for routine analyses required by agencies to safeguard food safety and quality. Here we conduct a critical review of the potentials of DNA barcoding for food labeling along with the main findings in the area of <b>food</b> <b>piracy,</b> with particular reference to agrifood and livestock foodstuffs...|$|E
40|$|The small farming still plays {{crucial role}} within country economic, {{where most of}} the {{inhabitants}} are depend their daily life to agriculture. National political configuration has brought some significant to the agriculture development. In domestic level policy of local autonomy has change the landscape of agricultural policy which different from one region to another region. The local advantage and local culture placed as the foundation to develop the small farming in region. Whilst in the international level,the free trade agreement has change the market landscape for local agriculture product. Coping with these two circumstances dimensions two isse were raised related to farmer rights and <b>food</b> <b>piracy</b> whereas micropolitic of small farming able to manage such issues. Socio-legal approach will be used to strip up the micropolitic of small farming due to its focus of traditional farmers and traditional agricultural system...|$|E
