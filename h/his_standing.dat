5|$|After the Olympics, Evans {{returned}} to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, {{he attempted to}} qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. Evans later stated that he felt his admission of having only trained for ten days had lowered <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> {{in the eyes of the}} selectors. As a result of being overlooked, Evans retired from competitive swimming.|$|E
5|$|Ike {{began to}} fear that word of his {{possible}} cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, and said something to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.|$|E
5|$|The war in Italy had drained Pyrrhus' {{financial}} and military resources. To increase his resources and bolster <b>his</b> <b>standing,</b> he {{declared war on}} King Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedon. He ravaged {{part of the country}} before managing to defeat Antigonus at the Battle of the Aous. This defeat compelled Antigonus to flee to Thessaloniki, where he was protected by his strong navy. Following Antigonus' flight, Pyrrhus was able to gain control of most of Macedon and Thessaly, declaring himself King of Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens {{for almost a}} year before {{returning}} to Twentieth Century-Fox on loan and appearing as Henry M. Stanley in Stanley and Livingstone, his only film of 1939. Curtis maintains that Tracy's non-visibility did little to affect <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> with the public or exhibitors. In October of that year, a Fortune magazine survey to find the nation's favorite movie actor listed Tracy in first place.|$|E

5|$|Achaemenid ruler Cyrus the Great conquered Sogdiana while {{campaigning in}} Central Asia in 546–539 BC, a fact {{mentioned}} {{by the ancient}} Greek historian Herodotus in his Histories.

A contingent of Sogdian soldiers fought in the main army of Xerxes I during his ultimately failed invasion of Greece in 480 BC. A Persian inscription from Susa claims that the palace there was adorned with lapis lazuli and carnelian originating from Sogdiana.|$|E
5|$|During November 1908, Maeda went to Paris, France, {{apparently}} {{to see his}} friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for Mexico City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. <b>His</b> <b>standing</b> offer was 100 pesos (US $50) to anyone he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who could throw him. The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E

5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy when he refused to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he prefers the Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would both be named to the squad. He claimed he would ride only to support Roche, if he rode at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> with the team, and that the feud between him and Roche had been forgotten, so he hoped Gadret would ride the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Hafizullah Amin (Pashto/; born 1 August 1929 – 27 December 1979) was an Afghan {{politician}} {{during the}} Cold War. Amin {{was born in}} Paghman and educated at Kabul University, after which he started {{his career as a}} teacher. After a few years in that occupation, he went to the United States to study. He would visit the United States a second time before moving permanently to Afghanistan, and starting his career in radical politics. He ran as a candidate in the 1965 parliamentary election but failed to secure a seat. Amin was the only Khalqist elected to parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election, thus increasing <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> within the party. He was one of the leading organisers of the Saur Revolution which overthrew the government of Mohammad Daoud Khan.|$|E
5|$|His {{military}} career {{can be traced}} back as far as 1304 when he took part in a campaign in the Scottish Wars. In 1309, he received a royal order to assist Robert de Clifford in the defence of the Marches against Scotland. <b>His</b> <b>standing</b> in local affairs was further advanced in 1311, when he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland, like his father had been before him. This was followed by his election as Knight of the Shire in 1312, and in December 1313, he distinguished himself {{as the leader of the}} defence against a Scottish invasion. He received further acclaim in the summer of 1315, when he successfully defended Carlisle Castle against a siege by Robert the Bruce. For this he was awarded a gift of 1000 marks from the king.|$|E

5|$|In 1860 {{he became}} organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, {{initially}} {{for a period}} of six months, at a salary of £120 per year. His duties included playing for services, training the choir and leading them on Fridays, a day on which the organ was not used. A new organ had been installed five years earlier that was ideal for developing his talent. He proved satisfactory in the post, and his contract was made permanent. He was permitted to study for a degree as long as it did not interfere with his duties, and he chose {{to do so in the}} expectation that it would raise his social status. He gained his BA in 1864 and his MA two years later and was keen to proceed to his Mus Doc, which would raise <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> within the university.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination {{for a third}} term. Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which {{proved to be a}} major critical and financial success. His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring in support of national unity. Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely affect his military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve <b>his</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj {{joined the}} service of the tax {{supervisor}} of the local provinces, Abu'l-Abbas al-Bistam. He soon followed his new master to Egypt, and after al-Bistam's death in June 910 he continued serving the latter's son. Eventually, he gained the attention of the local governor, Takin al-Khazari, who sent him to govern the lands beyond the Jordan River, with his seat at Amman. In 918, he rescued a hajj caravan, among {{which was one of the}} ladies-in-waiting of al-Muqtadir's mother, from Bedouin raiders, thereby improving <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> at the Abbasid court. Two years later, Ibn Tughj gained an influential patron when he briefly served under the powerful Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, when he came to help defend Egypt from a Fatimid invasion. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj commanded the finest troops of the Egyptian army. The two men evidently established a rapport, and remained in contact thereafter.|$|E

5|$|When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without {{surviving}} legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was {{the oldest}} person yet to assume the British throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended {{to spend most of}} his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded <b>his</b> <b>standing,</b> he was very popular among the people, who saw him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{was held}} in Havana, where Castro was {{selected}} as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though <b>his</b> <b>standing</b> in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.|$|E
