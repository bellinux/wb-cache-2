Attempts to identify and bridge the gaps made some headway at the Durham conference, though it was recognized that agreement on a single method of ceramic analysis or a single definition of a type may not be possible. The solution proposed by Dessel and Joffe is for all archaeologists {{in the field to}} provide more explicit descriptions of the objects that they study. The more information provided and shared between those in related sub-disciplines, the more likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be able to identify and understand the commonalities in the different typological systems.|$|E
25|$|Among {{other things}} in the recent update, the band said they were {{extremely}} surprised on how well their last album, Awake?, did in the market considering it had no tour support by them {{and that it was}} thrown onto Ferret's label in the 11th hour. Zao said the best thing to come out of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> learned a lot of the last release and it showed them that fans still enjoy their music and this inspired and motivated them to continue making music. According to social media reports, on July 11, 2014, Zao went into the studio, after a five-year unofficial hiatus and working on side projects like Lonely Ghost Parade and Young Fox, is currently, tracking and recording their 11th album. Guitar tracking began in January 2015. Xenophobe, the band's first EP since 1998, was released on July 10, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Advertisements {{are used}} to attract {{customers}} to a business’ products or services. In doing so, they are also making statements regarding race, social class, gender, values, and [...] family. They not only describe these social categories, they prescribe behaviors or show one how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should act in accordance with social ideals or norms. According to Belk and Pollay, “not only do [...] show us the ideal life, they instruct us [...] how to live.” Through targeting specific groups of people for products and services, advertisements both reflect changes of social norms and are changers of social norms regarding acceptable behavior. Some argue {{that the image of}} family only plays a symbolic role by reflecting the current cultural values. Advertisements may not only reflect changes in social norms, but also be asserting that such behavior is acceptable. As a result, sociologists have challenged the public to study ads containing images of the family not just as marketing messages but also as vehicles for behavior and attitudes towards society.|$|E
