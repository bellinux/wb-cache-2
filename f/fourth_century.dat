5|$|In {{the early}} <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> Armenia, under king Tiridates III, {{became the first}} country to adopt Christianity as a state religion. A large number of Armenian monks are {{recorded}} to have settled in Jerusalem {{as early as the}} <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> after the uncovering of Christian holy places in the city. However, the first written records are from the fifth century. Jerusalem is thus considered the oldest living diaspora community outside the Armenian homeland. Philip Marsden wrote that the survival of Armenians in Jerusalem–"most intense of all cities"—proves their extraordinary resilience.|$|E

5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four ceramic sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated to the <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated to the <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> was a hut that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this hut was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun {{sanctuary}} {{was damaged}} by an earthquake in the <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed {{at the base}} of the podium.|$|E

5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} {{eighteen}} he inherited the baronetcy and became chief of the Clan Cumming; his line had been traced from the <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> through Charlemagne. His inheritance included three Morayshire estates: Altyre near Forres, Gordonstoun near Elgin and Dallas. Though the estates totalled , they yielded poor revenues; the annual income from the estates in around 1890 {{has been described as}} either £60,000 or £80,000.|$|E
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> as the Roman Empire divided, Egypt {{found itself}} in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning years of the Empire, Egypt fell to the Sassanid Persian army (618-628 AD), was re{{captured}} by the Roman Emperor Heraclius (629-639 AD), and then was finally captured by Muslim Rashidun army in 639-640 AD, ending Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties in the <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that {{the top of the}} wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E
5|$|Rituals {{in honor}} of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these texts are found {{on the walls of}} temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the {{deceased}} person—to live again.|$|E

5|$|The Roman fortress' layout {{is similar}} to other {{imperial}} outposts in the region. An official Latin inscription that dates several area strongholds to the 3rd century CE was discovered on a large limestone slab at nearby Yotvata bears.

5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland were {{probably}} among {{the soldiers and}} ordinary Roman citizens {{who lived in the}} vicinity of Hadrian's Wall.

Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from the <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) that existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians.|$|E
