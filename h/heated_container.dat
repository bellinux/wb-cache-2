The mathematical model used is constructed from the Navier-Stokes equations which are solved with a finite-difference method on a digital computer. Results are presented for typical space processing configurations and anticipated g-jitter levels, {{with emphasis on}} sounding rocket applications. The calculations indicate that g-jitter can cause significant temperature oscillations, increase or decrease local heat transfer and produce oscillatory convective flow patterns. These factors can have significant effects on important processes such as crystal growth (banding, for example) and separation techniques...|$|E
40|$|Production of flat {{structured}} ceramic or powder metallurgical constructional parts is claimed, {{in which}} a ceramic or metallic powder with a thermoplastic binder and further known materials is processed to a thermoplastic slip (2), and the evacuated slip (2) is forced from an opening of a <b>heated</b> <b>container</b> (1). Evacuation of the slip (2) is carried out before inserting into the <b>heated</b> <b>container</b> (1) and the temp. of the slip (2) is adjusted below the vaporisation temp. of the thermoplastic binder. The slip (2) is pressed into moulds (4) with negative structuring of the surface of parts to be formed. After cooling the thermoplastic slip (2) the moulding (5) {{is removed from the}} mould (4), the binder driven off, and the moulding sintered. The novelty is that before insertion, a viscosity of the thermoplastic slip is adjusted to 0. 05 - 4. 0 Pa. s, and the mould is evacuated before, during or after inserting the thermoplastic slip to a pressure of 5 Pa - 0. 09 MPa. Insertion of the slip is carried out at 40 - 180 deg. C. An apparatus for carrying out the process is also claimed. The thermoplastic binder is paraffin or wax. The further known materials are stearic acid or oleic acid. The powder metallurgical material is a hard metal. The ceramic material is silicon nitride, aluminium nitride or PZT. USE - The parts are used as cooling elements or as substrates for electronic constructional elements. ADVANTAGE - The ceramic or metallurgical powder has high packing density...|$|E

They cause plant damages at all stages of development, from seedlings until final harvest. Their extinction is difficult and requires usage of pesticides which cause severe soil and underground water pollution. One of the ways for their extinction is the usage of physical resources through the usage of steam or solarization. Steam generators consume much energy, which greatly burdens the economic functioning of the farm, and solarization is a method which can be applied over a limited period (June-August) and over larger areas.

As a consequence an increased risk of bacterial contamination of eggshells is expected. This has lead toward the development of efficient techniques to reduce eggshell contamination by bacterial pathogens, and thus to prevent any potential or additional food safety risk for Human health. The objectives of this research were to develop and validate a numerical model useful to study the physics of treatment with hot air, in natural convection conditions, and then {{to assess the impact of}} the treatment on egg quality and Salmonella Enteritidis inactivation on the shell. As regards the decontamination effectiveness, a reduction in microbial load up to 2. 6 log 10 after 200 minutes was observed. A linear correlation between the time of treatment and the microbial decimal reduction (R 2 0. 92) was also observed. This suggests the opportunity of further study with longer treatment.

All rats except those of control group were housed in a <b>heated</b> <b>container</b> and maintained at 36 °C for 3 hours until the rectal temperature reached 41 - 42 °C.

The leakage of Evans blue-albumin and water content of brain were calculated and morphological changes were investigated. In group with hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution treatment, brain water content and the leakage of Evans blue-albumin were the lowest among the four whole body hyperthermia groups. Compared with the other three whole body hyperthermia groups, in which profound to moderate damages to blood-brain barrier and brain tissue and cells were found, there were only slight morphological changes in the group with hypertonic/hyperoncotic solutionon treatment.

40|$|Studied {{for centuries}} by rhetoricians, metaphor is con-sidered the {{paradigmatic}} {{example of the}} trope—that is, a word used in its figurative sense (Aristotle, trans. 1952; Quintillian, trans. 1921). Itself somewhat metaphoric, trope is the Greek word for twist, or turn. Nonliteral lan-guage has traditionally been viewed as a deviation from normal language use and one that takes extra effort to un-derstand. The standard pragmatic model (Grice, 1975; Searle, 1979) stipulates that (1) metaphors are “special” and consequently are processed with qualitatively differ-ent mechanisms than those for literal language, and (2) the computation of literal meaning precedes that of meta-phoric meaning. Cognitive linguists have attacked the specialness as-sumption by noting that metaphor is pervasive in every-day language and that it plays {{a pivotal role in}} historical language change (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Sweetser, 1990; Turner, 1991). Given systematic relationships be-tween literal and metaphoric uses of the same words, Lakoff (1993) has suggested that metaphors reflect the output of a cognitive process by which we understand a target do-main by exploiting cognitive models from an analogically related source domain. In conceptual metaphor theory, clusters of related expressions (e. g., fuming, boiling, blow-ing one’s top) are the manifestation of underlying concep-tual metaphors (e. g., anger 5 fluid in a <b>heated</b> <b>container).</b> Lakoff has further argued that “the system of conventional conceptual metaphor is mostly unconscious, automatic, and is used with no noticeable effort, just like our linguis-tic system and the rest of our conceptual system ” (pp. 227 – 228). A variety of reaction time measures have indicated that metaphor interpretation is neither slow nor optional, cast-ing doubt on the second tenet of the standard model. When the metaphoric interpretation of a sentence has adequate contextual support, metaphors are read no more slowl...|$|E
