25|$|Throughout the battle, British ships {{experienced}} {{difficulties with}} communications, whereas the Germans {{did not suffer}} such problems. The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was an <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> to advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp, once seen, could also easily be copied in future engagements.|$|E

Gamasutra, writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of Halo, but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot. Mark Binelli of Rolling Stone credited the {{appearance of the}} Flood as an <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> to keep players on their toes by forcing them to adjust their strategies, as well as being a twist as radical [...] "as if, several levels into a game of Pac-Man, the dots suddenly began to attack you".|$|E

[...] Bailey concurred with Hassenger's description of it as bittersweet, writing: [...] "It's an affectionate send-off, bittersweet and kind of wonderful and therefore perfectly in tone with this charming little show." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed described it as the epitome of the show's various themes, including childhood, art, and family, calling it [...] "a slightly nostalgic episode"; he considered it an <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> to close the series, writing [...] "Acting as probably both {{a reflection of the}} show's staff at the time and a final send off, I can't think of a better way to send Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard's creation into the sunset." ...|$|E

[...] Jerry Moore said that [...] "To have the University of Michigan invite us back is the ultimate compliment for us as a program and a university.

[...] Appalachian State played their first year of football in the FBS in 2014 and joined the Sun Belt Conference as full members. The rematch was much different this time around, with Michigan beating Appalachian State 52–14; Appalachian State never held a lead in the game.|$|E

40|$|Writing and {{discussion}} are <b>excellent</b> <b>ways</b> {{for students to}} master content, develop analtical abilities, and become active and collaborative learners. The Writing Across the Curriculum movement offers a theoretical framework {{for the use of}} writing in instruction, maintaining that writing skills are primarily thinking skills, that writing is a dialectical process of developing an understanding of something, and that higher order thinking skills can only evolve through a writing process in which the writer engages in an active, on-going dialogue with him- or herself and others. Research on the use of discussion or peer review groups in instruction indicates that the interaction they provide helps stuuents develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills and improves motivation.

In the mobile city game Frequency 1550 teams -of four students each- {{step into the}} game's world. With help of the Internet, smart phones and GPS technology, Amsterdam changes into a medieval playground, the year 1550. Results of {{an analysis of the}} game as a narrative environment show that the game evokes a mixture of receiving (spectator), constructing (director) and participating in (actor) the story of medieval Amsterdam. Moreover, evaluation of the learning effects reveals that students who played Frequency 1550 acquired significantly more historical knowledge than the students who attended a regular lesson series. A newly designed mobile gaming and learning platform (Games Atelier) is presented, which is based on the technology and the evaluation of Frequency 1550...|$|R
500|$|Giving {{the game}} a 7.5 out of 10, GameTrailers felt that, [...] "While Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX {{certainly}} {{lives up to}} the HD part of its name, the collection {{is not without its}} shortcomings. The original game’s inclusion with all the new revisions and the addition of Final Mix content is a worthy investment on its own, and the inclusion of Chain of Memories is a nice gesture. The card-based battle system might be off-putting, but it’s a unique experiment that deviates from the norm of the series. However, despite the overhauled visuals and new voice work, it’s hard to excuse the reduction of 358/2 Days to a lengthy film rather than an actual game." [...] IGN felt that the collection was [...] "an <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> to replay the series’ first two games in crisp, high-definition splendor" [...] but was disappointed that the box art did not properly distinguish 358/2 Days as a non-playable game. They awarded the collection an 8.5 out of 10. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the collection an 8 out of 10, stating the collection [...] "brings a PS2 classic to the modern age with a noticeably impressive visual update, improved camera controls, and, for added fun, secondary and tertiary Kingdom Hearts content all contained on one disc." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{eleventh}} series saw musical montage or [...] "songtage" [...] segments become {{standard in}} each episode, introduced by McHale {{as a means}} of modernising the show. Although McHale initially considered commissioning original pieces, budgetary constraints limited choices to pre-existing tracks. The use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama Grey's Anatomy, however McHale stated he was unaware of this until Holby City had already adopted the technique. Music was generally selected by each episode's scriptwriter. If the writer was not specific about which songs should be used, the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors also have some input: Hugh Quarshie personally selected the music he believed his character Ric Griffin would listen to in theatre. Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle responded: [...] "Yes – sometimes. On a multi-strand series such as Holby, they are an <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> of telling stories visually – a moment from each – to open or close an episode or create the passing of time in a concise way for the audience." [...] Kris Green of entertainment and media website Digital Spy suggested that the number of songs used per episode could be [...] "very jarring", to which Kyle replied: [...] "We plan to use music carefully in the future – maybe 'songtages', as above – and sourced music within a scene, that is music actually playing in the scene itself, for example on a radio – but less incidental." ...|$|E

In this paper we introduce vector spaces over real and complex non-Newtonian field with respect to the *-calculus which is a branch of non-Newtonian calculus. Also we give the definitions of real and complex inner product spaces and study Hilbert spaces which are special type of normed space and complete inner product spaces in the sense of *-calculus. Furthermore, as an example of Hilbert spaces, first we introduce the non-Cartesian plane which is a nonlinear model for plane Euclidean geometry. Secondly, we give Euclidean, unitary, and sequence spaces via corresponding norms which are induced by an inner product. Finally, by using the *-norm properties of complex structures, we examine Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities...|$|R
