40|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed to}} measure the external drag of fuselage side intakes is described. The scope of the experiment and the techniques employed are discussed and an assessment is made of the accuracy of results. Measurements of the external drag of rectangular intakes installed {{on the sides of}} a fuselage are presented. Results at subsonic speeds show that drag at full flow is independent of compressmn surface geometry, so that substantial flow spillage may be achieved for little drag penalty provided that the <b>intake</b> <b>throat</b> Mach number is kept high by elevation of the compression surface. For a given total turning of the flow by th 2 compression surface, splllage drag is found to be uniquely related to the inlet mass flow ratio (as distinct from capture mass flow ratlo). Radius of the cowl lip 1 s found to affect the drag of the intake at full flow but becomes less Important as flow is reduced. Drag at full flow for Intakes with swept end walls is lower than for a conflguration in which they are unswept but the spillage drag rise is greater. At supersonic speeds the variation in full flow drag with compressio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the flow in a diffusing s-shaped aircraft air intake using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations. Diffusing s-shaped ducts such as the RAE intake model 2129 (M 2129) give rise to complex flow patterns that develop {{as a result of}} the offset between the intake cowl plane and engine face plane. Euler results compare favourably with experiment and previous calculations for a low mass flow case. For a high mass flow case a converged steady solution was not found and the problem was then simulated using an unsteady flow solver. A choked flow at the <b>intake</b> <b>throat</b> and complex shock reflection system, together with a highly unsteady flow downstream of the first bend, yielded results that did not compare well with previous experimental data. Previous work had also experienced this problem and a modification to the geometry to account for flow separation was required to obtain a steady flow. RANS results utilising a selection of turbulence models were more satisfactory. The low mass flow case showed good comparison with experiment and previous calculations. A problem of the low mass flow case is the prediction of secondary flow. It was found that the SST turbulence model best predicted this feature. Fully converged high mass flow results were obtained. Once more, SST results proved to match experiment and previous computations the best. Problems with the prediction of the flow in the cowl region of the duct were experienced with the S-A and k-w models. One of the main problems of turbulence closures in intake flows is the transition of the freestream from laminar to turbulent over the intake cowl region. It is likely that the improvement in this prediction using the SST turbulence model will lead to more satisfactory results for both high and low mass flow rates...|$|E
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan working line {{by using a}} convergent-divergent nozzle with an {{extremely}} low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle {{to act as if}} it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the throat and divergent section, respectively. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan working line slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the <b>intake</b> chokes the <b>throat</b> and causes the nozzle's area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan working line slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic {{integration}} of diverterless air intakes with increasingly compact serpentine shaping and the optimization {{of their performance}} as well as engine/intake compatibility are challenging tasks for innovative design of advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) featuring superior combat or reconnaissance abilities. Within the Aerodynamics Action Group AG- 46 "Highly Integrated Subsonic Air Intakes" of the Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR) various technological aspects were investigated in order to advance intake design solutions. By applying modern hybrid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods flow simulations were carried out for the EIKON UAV configuration which was previously designed and wind tunnel tested at FOI in Sweden. A major objective {{was to assess the}} capability of hybrid methods for the analysis of unsteady phenomena of serpentine air intakes and the accuracy levels of the computations. Numerical results for a variety of wind tunnel conditions were compared with Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and unsteady RANS (URANS) data as well as experimental results. The time evolutions of distortion coefficients (e. g. DC 60) at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP) very well demonstrate the highly turbulent flow in the separated region downstream of the S-duct and allow the comparison of the dynamic intake distortion behavior with steady-state performance as well as experimental data, revealing an improved prediction of the time-averaged DC 60 value with hybrid methods. A numerical study on intake lip shaping was conducted allowing an improved assessment of the sources of the aerodynamic forces. The impact of boundary layer ingestion versus boundary layer diversion was investigated in a trade-off study. Eliminating the boundary layer resulted in improved total pressure recoveries at the <b>intake</b> <b>throat</b> by approximately 2 %. Internal passive flow control was studied by employing numerical models for the simulation of vortex generators in the intake duct, and active flow control was researched by applying devices in form of micro-jets. Results were compared with experimental data. At DLR in GÃ¶ttingen experiments with a generic high aspect ratio diverterless intake model were performed in the cryogenic blowdown wind tunnel DNW-KRG with the goal to contribute to a better understanding and correlation of installed performance predictions of highly integrated innovative intake designs. In a parametric study the combined effects of boundary layer ingestion and an S-shaped intake diffuser on total pressure recovery and dynamic distortion at the engine face were investigated as a function of Mach number, Reynolds number, boundary layer thickness and intake mass flow ratio...|$|E
