In this study, various drying characteristics were examined by using test equipment. The results of the experiment were obtained as follows: 1. The velocity of moisture transportation from the inner part to the outer part of the husk is higher than the reverse. 2. During the paddy tempering stage of intermittent drying, it increases the velocity of moisture transportation if the initial difference in the moisture content of <b>husk</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> and paddy temperature are high.

Although the degree of Hg contamination varied significantly among different mining areas, rice seed showed the highest ability for methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation. Both concentrations of total mercury (THg) and MeHg in rice plants were significantly correlated with Hg levels in soil, indicating soil is still an important source for both inorganic mercury (IHg) and MeHg in rice plants. The obvious discrepancy between the distribution patterns of THg and MeHg reflected different pathways of IHg and MeHg accumulation.

MethodsFifty-one adults residing in Abuja, Nigeria, participated in this study. Using purposeful sampling for focus group discussions (FGDs), participants were enrolled based on their age (19 – 25 vs. 40 – 60 [*]years) and body mass index (BMI) (normal weight vs. overweight/obese). Participants tasted four meals with different constitution of <b>brown</b> and white <b>rice</b> (25 : 75 %, 50 : 50 %, 75 : 25 %, and 100 % <b>brown</b> <b>rice).</b> Twelve FGDs were conducted, six before and six after the food tasting. Two-hour postprandial blood glucose was measured after consumption of each rice meal. ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 39 (± 14) years, their mean BMI was 25. 6 (± 5. 2) and about half of them were male. Most of the participants (61 %) reported that rice was their main source of carbohydrate and 67 % consumed rice at least five times/week. Before the food tasting, participants considered white polished <b>rice</b> superior to <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> with regard to quality, taste, and nutritional value. After the food tasting, most of the participants (49 %) indicated a preference for the 100 % <b>brown</b> <b>rice,</b> 19 % preferred the 25 % <b>brown</b> <b>rice,</b> 18 % preferred the 50 % <b>brown</b> <b>rice,</b> and 7 % preferred the 75 % <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> meals.

Thus, among the five grain vinegars tested, the high-brix nonglutinous <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> black vinegar matured in barrel contained the highest total D-amino acids concentration, by far.

Then I examined a new processing method for rice, and focused attention on sprouted <b>brown</b> <b>rice.</b> I thought that sprouting damage on the hulls of <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> was useful for digesting an albumen by animals. In the previous study, we researched the rumen degradability rate of using cattle by in situ method and found sprouted <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> had higher ruminal degradability rate than <b>brown</b> <b>rice.</b> In addition, sprouted <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> contains high gamma amino butyric acid (GABA).

I aimed to determine the digestibility of sprouted <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> silage (SBRS) in ruminant livestock and changes in blood GABA concentration. Capter 2. In vitro experiment was done using SBRS and rumen fluid (from cows). SBRS is incubated at 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h, and organic matter digestibility was calculated each incubation time.

The digestibility of SBRS was numerically higher than <b>brown</b> <b>rice,</b> but there was no significant difference.

40|$|The {{changes in}} physical, {{rheological}} and enzyme-digestive behaviours of cooked white and <b>brown</b> <b>rice,</b> with similar amylose content, were investigated using a dynamic in vitro rat stomach (DIVRS) model and a static soaking method. The <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> {{had a higher}} resistance on disintegration and lower gastric emptying rate with 53 % of the <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> particles retained in the stomach at the end compared to 32 % for the white rice. Furthermore, the release rate of maltose from the starch hydrolysis was higher in the white rice throughout the digestion suggesting the lower glycemic potency of the <b>brown</b> <b>rice.</b> These differences could be contributed from the rigid bran layer in the <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> which would inhibit the moisture absorption into rice kernels, limit textural degradation, and generate higher gastric digesta viscosity leading to lower mixing and mass transfer efficiency. This study suggests that the structural difference could affect physiochemical properties during gastric digestion...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{object of}} this project was to study the effect of drying {{temperature}} on physical quality and sensory evaluation of germinated <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> soaking with tumeric and roselle. The drying was run under the conditions of drying temperatures of 80 - 100 °C and air velocity of 7. 3 m/s. Initial moisture content of <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> samples was of 54 - 55 % dry-basis and was dried until the final moisture content reached to 20 - 25 % dry-basis. After drying, the rice was tempered and then was ventilated by ambient air until its moisture content reached to 14 - 15 % dry-basis. The experiment showed that highest drying rate is incident at 100 °C. For physical qualities analysis, {{the results showed that}} the drying air temperature does not affect to head rice yield, fissured kernels, chalky grain and color (L*, a*, b * CIE-lab unit) of herbal germinated <b>brown</b> <b>rice.</b> In addition, herbal germinated <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> drying can maintain low percentage of chalky grain compared to commercial <b>brown</b> <b>rice.</b> The soaking solution was not affect to drying rate.
