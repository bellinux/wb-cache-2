5|$|Hatfield {{graduated}} from Salem High School (now North Salem High School) in 1940 and then enrolled at Willamette University, also in Salem. While attending Willamette, Hatfield became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega and Kappa Gamma Rho, which he later helped become {{a chapter of}} Beta Theta Pi. In college he also worked part-time for then Oregon Secretary of State Earl Snell, where {{he learned how to}} build a political base by sending out messages to potential voters after reading about life changes posted in newspapers, such as deaths and graduations. He also sketched out a political career path beginning with the state legislature and culminating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> in the United States Senate, with a blank for any position beyond the Senate. Hatfield {{graduated from}} Willamette in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree after three years at the school. While at the school he lost his only election, for student body president.|$|E
5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with {{a gathering of}} wealthy political allies. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert {{she did not want}} him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert is in love with him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E

25|$|We {{would often}} cross the broad avenue with the martial {{sounding}} name... The one that separated Courbevoie from Puteaux. It {{was in the}} peaceful garden of that welcoming household {{only a few years}} before the terrible year of 1914 that forms were born that, 50 years later, one would still think were new! We returned there often and soon we were spending our Sunday afternoons not merely conversing about aesthetic novelties but rather kicking a ball around or indulging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> of archery.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 and 1980, Tom Baker {{played the}} Fourth Doctor (alongside Lalla Ward's Romana) {{in a series}} of four {{television}} commercials for Prime Computers. Disliking the scripts he was given, Baker agreed to film the advertisements only if he could rewrite them himself, and added a scene where the Doctor follows the computer's instruction to marry Romana in reference to his own recent marriage to Ward. In 1997, Baker reprised the role once again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> for New Zealand's National Superannuation insurance company.|$|E

On his neck was set a round, yellow pumpkin, with a face carved on it such as a boy often carves on a jack-lantern.|$|R

25|$|No batsman reached 50 in the Bermudian innings, but solid {{contributions}} from Brown (48), Blades (45) and Douglas (36) guided {{them to a}} reasonable 231/8 from their 60 overs. Duncan Fletcher was the pick of the Zimbabwean bowlers with 3-34 from nine overs. Zimbabwe looked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> of bother at 30/2 with both openers gone, but the match and the Trophy were decided by half-centuries from Andy Pycroft, who made 82, and Craig Hodgson (57 not out); the Africans won with more than five overs to play with.|$|E
25|$|In reply, Durham were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> of bother at 146 for 6, but a {{partnership}} worth 126 between Gareth Breese and Philip Mustard lifted Durham to 316. With a 62-run deficit on first innings, Yorkshire lost their first seven wickets for only 128 runs, but Anthony McGrath hit a potentially match-saving 133 not out – his second important century of the season, following his 165 not out against Leicestershire a week earlier. He {{was supported by}} Chris Silverwood, who smashed 80 off 66 balls before eventually being bowled by Michael Lewis, who removed the five last batsmen in his five for 80.|$|E
25|$|The batting {{order in}} {{baseball}} must be declared {{before the game}} begins, and can only be changed if a substitution occurs. Batting out of turn is a rule violation resulting in a penalty. When a manager makes a substitution, the new player must occupy the same place in the batting order as the old one. To allow more complicated changes in batting order, managers may use the double switch, substituting for two players simultaneously. This is typically used to replace the pitcher but put the new pitcher <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> in the batting order that will not come up to bat soon, previously occupied by another fielder (pitchers are almost uniformly poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). However, the rule remains that no individual player can ever change his position in the batting order within the same game.|$|E

25|$|Among the European nations, Russia reacted most {{promptly}} to the events. According to Venizelos' biographer Chester, the Russian conscripts {{were particularly}} cruel in their {{treatment of the}} Venizelists. During March and April, a contingent of the Tsar's soldiers marched toward the Lefka Ori accompanied by Cretan gendarmes. At the beginning of June, Russian troops disembarked in Crete and took several villages while the Russian fleet bombarded several others. The British, despite their support of the existing regime, only took a few symbolic actions without real impact. As for the French and the Italians, they avoided taking part in any anti-revolutionary activity. Nevertheless, an international force was assembled at Alikianos, {{on the road to}} Theriso, ready to receive orders. With the arrival of troops at Alikianos, Colonel Lubanski of the French Army organised a first meeting with the insurgents at Fournes, between Alikianos and Theriso, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> where the insurgents could see unmistakably the European force gathered in the valley. The talks took place on 1 April and were attended by Konstantinos Foumis and Konstantinos Manos, with Colonel Lubanski receiving the insurgents' grievances. The following day, the latter went to Theriso with a message for Venizelos: the Powers were unanimous regarding the impossibility of the island's annexation by Greece.|$|E

500|$|Discovery then {{proceeded}} westward {{in search of}} permanent quarters. On 8 February she entered McMurdo Sound and later that day anchored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> near its southern limit which was afterwards christened Winter Quarters Bay. Wilson wrote: [...] "We all realized our extreme good fortune in being led to such a winter quarter as this, safe for the ship, with perfect shelter from all ice pressure." [...] Stoker Lashly, however, thought it looked [...] "a dreary place." [...] Work began ashore with the erection of the expedition's huts on a rocky peninsula designated Hut Point. Scott had decided that the expedition should continue {{to live and work}} aboard ship, and he allowed Discovery to be frozen into the sea ice, leaving the main hut {{to be used as a}} storeroom and shelter.|$|E
500|$|Bahá'ís see the Báb as the {{forerunner of}} the Bahá'í Faith, because the Báb's {{writings}} introduced the concept of [...] "He whom God shall make manifest", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá'ís, was announced in the scriptures {{of all of the}} world's great religions, and whom Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be in 1863. The Báb's tomb, located in Haifa, Israel, is an important place of pilgrimage for Bahá'ís. The remains of the Báb were brought secretly from Iran to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> specifically designated by Bahá'u'lláh. The main written works translated into English of the Báb's are collected in Selections from the Writings of the Báb out of the estimated 135 works.|$|E

Items from Holmes's {{personal}} library—including medical papers, essays, songs and poems—are {{held in the}} library's Special Collections department. In 1915, Bostonians placed a memorial seat and sundial behind Holmes's final home at 296 Beacon Street <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>spot</b> where he would have seen it from his library. King's Chapel in Boston, where Holmes worshiped, erected an inscribed memorial tablet in his honor.
