40|$|Many useful genes {{have been}} {{identified}} in wild forms and distant relatives of important staples but they are often not used in conventional plant breeding. At the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia, scientists have been looking at new ways of transferring important traits that occur in wild forms of Phaseolus vulgaris in to domestic varieties of the bean. The two major pests of stored dried beans in Africa and Latin America are the Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (Zabrotes subfasciatus) and the <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (Acanthoscelides obtectus). By screening thousands of accessions of wild P. vulgaris, CIAT entomologists identified some that were resistant to Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>weevil,</b> others resistant to <b>bean</b> <b>weevil,</b> and two that were resistant to both insects. Among Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>weevils</b> that died in resistant seed, studies conducted in cooperation with the University of Wisconsin pointed to a single cause of death: the protein arcelin, which the insect apparently cannot digest well. (Tie protein's name is based on the town of Arcelia in Mexico where wild bean accessions containing this gene were collected.) Since the biosynthesis of arcelin in resistant genotypes is a simply inherited trait, researchers were able to breed resistance to Z. subfasciatus into experimental lines of domesticated beans. These lines are now being tested in Africa and Latin America.

40|$|A {{proteinaceous}} inhibitor {{with high}} activity against papain {{was found in}} seeds of the xerophytic algaroba tree (Prosopis julifora). The proteinase inhibitor Pj was purified using Sephacryl S- 200 gel filtration followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a Vidac 18 TP. Inhibitor Pj showed a Mr of 20, 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a Mr of 19. 2 K by mass spectrometry. The inhibition of papain by the Pj inhibitor was the noncompetitive type, with a Ki value of 0. 59 3 1029 M. The gelatinase activity of papain was strongly inhibited by Pj too. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Pj inhibitor showed homology with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Kunitzproteinase inhibitor family.

40|$|Simply turning bags {{of beans}} upside down {{twice a day}} is {{the easiest way to}} stop the larvae of the common <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> causing damage. With regular {{disturbance}} the larvae soon die of exhaustion. The larvae of the common <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (Acanthoscelides obtectus) is responsible for causing large losses of beans in storage. Effective control by small-holder farmers in the Tropics has been difficult. Each adult is able to lay many eggs and, once they hatch, the larvae soon bore into the beans. A recent study has shown that the larvae had to wedge themselves between two beans in order to get enough leverage to start boring. It takes a larva between 24 and 48 hours of continuous scraping to get inside a bean. Researchers from Michigan State University argued that if the larvae were repeatedly dislodged they would be unable to bore effectively into the stored beans and might even die of exhaustion. Beans were put in various containers with adult weevils. The containers were turned regularly for two weeks, {{and at the end of}} that time damage was found to have been reduced by 97 %. Some of the mortality was due to exhaustion, as predicted but some larvae were also crushed as the beans moved. The researchers therefore recommend that bags of beans are turned upside down in the morning and again in the evening. It is possible that the technique might work with other pests of stored beans and grain if those pests need leverage in order to bore successfully.
