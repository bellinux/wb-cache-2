40|$|An {{intricate}} web {{of claims}} and obligations ties together the balance sheets {{of a wide}} variety of financial institutions. Under the occurrence of default, these <b>interbank</b> <b>claims</b> generate externalities across institutions and possibly disseminate defaults and bankruptcy. Building on a simple model for the joint determination of the repayments of <b>interbank</b> <b>claims,</b> this paper introduces a measure of the threat that a bank poses to the system. Such a measure, called threat index, may be helpful to determine how to inject cash into banks so as to increase debt reimbursement, or to assess the contributions of individual institutions to the risk in the system. Although the threat index and the default level of a bank both reflect some form of weakness and are affected by the whole liability network, the two indicators differ. As a result, injecting cash into the banks with the largest default level may not be optimal. Contagion; Systemic risk; Financial linkages; Bankruptcy...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{tests of}} {{hypotheses}} that {{a variety of}} interest rates and other measures from financial markets in countries belonging to the European Monetary Union (EMU) were converging prior to the introduction of the euro in January 1999. We expected to find convergence because of i) removal of national barriers to flows of funds, ii) explicit and market-driven harmonization of regulation and supervisory standards, iii) coordinated macroeconomic policies, iv) privatization of state enterprises, and v) fiscal redistribution of resources. The first series of tests (σ-tests) are that standard deviations and/or coefficients of variation of cross-sections of national measures are diminishing over time, relative to a group of non-EMU countries. Evidence of convergence was found for inflation rates, short- and long-term nominal interest rates, and ex post real short-term rates, but not for real per capita GDP. The second series concerned levels and trends in <b>interbank</b> <b>claims</b> and noninterest income at banks. These measures are believed to be larger and growing more rapidly when banks are attempting to escape binding national regulations. <b>Interbank</b> <b>claims</b> were larger at EMU banks than at banks in other countries...|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} interbank (i. e. non-collateralized) {{loans from}} the Colombian large-value payment system by implementing Furfine’s method. After identifying interbank loans from transactional data we obtain the <b>interbank</b> rates and <b>claims</b> without relying on financial institutions’ reported data. Contrasting identified loans with those consolidated from financial institutions’ reported data suggests the algorithm performs well, and it is robust to changes in its setup. The weighted average rate implicit in transactional data matches local interbank rate benchmarks strictly. From identified loans we also build the <b>interbank</b> <b>claims</b> network. The three main outputs (i. e. the interbank loans, the rates, and the claims networks) are valuable for examining and monitoring the money market, for contrasting data reported by financial institutions, and as inputs in models of financial contagion and systemic risk...|$|R
40|$|Central {{banks and}} private banks alike have {{advocated}} {{greater use of}} interbank netting agreements {{in recent years in}} order to reduce potential for transmitting economic shocks through interbank markets. This paper provides a model of an interbank payment market and shows that one sideeffect of greater netting of <b>interbank</b> <b>claims</b> is a redistribution of bank default risk away from interbank claimants toward non-bank creditors of banks, including the deposit insurer. Interbank netting agreements thus involve a trade-off between reduced interbank credit-risk exposure and increased concentration of bank default risk on other sets of bank creditors.

We further postulate that the clearing process satisfies the criteria of proportionality, limited liability, and absolute priority of debt, as outlined by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). Finally, we define a price-payment equilibrium as follows.|$|R

We find that the game played by banks depends upon the intraday credit policy of the central bank and that it encompasses two well-known game theoretical paradigms: the prisoner's dilemma and the stag hunt. The former arises in a collateralized credit regime where we confirm the result of earlier literature that banks {{have an incentive to}} postpone payments when daylight liquidity is costly and that this is socially inefficient. The latter arises in a priced credit regime where we show that the postponement of payments can be socially efficient...|$|R

40|$|<b>Interbank</b> <b>claims</b> are {{a concern}} to {{regulators}} {{as they might}} facilitate the dissemination of defaults and generate spill-over effects. Building on a simple model, this paper introduces {{a measure of the}} spill-over effects that a bank generates when it defaults. The measure is based on an explicit criterion, the aggregate debt repayments, and is bank 2 ̆ 019 s specific, affected by the bank 2 ̆ 019 s characteristics and links to other banks. Such measure can be useful to a regulator to determine in which banks cash should be injected during a default episode or to evaluate the impact of raising capital before the occurrence of default. The approach applies more generally to a system of entities that are linked through financial claims. This is illustrated to evaluate the consolidated foreign claims of 10 EU countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies banks’ {{incentives}} {{to engage in}} liquidity cross-insurance. In contrast to previous literature we view interbank insurance as the outcome of bilateral (and non-exclusive) contracting between pairs of banks and ask whether this outcome is socially efficient. Using a simple model of interbank insurance we find that this is indeed the case when insurance takes place through pure transfers. This is even though liquidity support among banks sometimes breaks down, as observed in the crisis of 2007 – 2008. However, when insurance is provided against some form of repayment (such as is the case, for example, with credit lines), banks {{have a tendency to}} insure each other less than the socially efficient amount. We show that efficiency can be restored by introducing seniority clauses for <b>interbank</b> <b>claims</b> or through subsidies that resemble government interbank lending guarantees...|$|R

However, beyond a certain point, such interconnections start to serve as a mechanism for propagation of shocks and lead to a more fragile financial system. We also show that, under natural contracting assumptions, financial networks that emerge in equilibrium may be socially inefficient due to the presence of a network externality: even though banks take the effects of their lending, risk-taking and failure on their immediate creditors into account, they do not internalize the consequences of their actions {{on the rest of the}} network...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to a growing literature on the pitfalls of diversification by shedding light on a new mechanism under which, full risk diversification can be sub-optimal. In particular, banks must choose the optimal level of diversification in a market where returns display a bimodal distribution. This feature results from the combination of two opposite economic trends that are weighted by the probability of being either in a bad or in a good state of the world. Banks have also interlocked balance sheets, with <b>interbank</b> <b>claims</b> marked-to-market according to the individual default probability of the obligor. Default is determined by extending the Black and Cox (1976) first-passage-time approach to a network context. We find that, {{even in the absence}} of transaction costs, the optimal level of risk diversification is interior. Moreover, in the presence of market externalities, individual incentives favor a banking system that is over-diversified with respect to the level of socially desirable diversification...|$|R
40|$|Systemic risk {{refers to}} the {{propagation}} of a bank's economic distress to other economic agents linked to that bank through financial transactions. Banking authorities often prevent systemic risk through an implicit insurance of <b>interbank</b> <b>claims,</b> or by reducing interbank transactions and centralizing banks' liquidity management. This paper investigates whether the flexability afforded by decentralized bank interactions can be preserved while protecting the central banks from the necessity of conducting undesired rescue operations. It develops a model in which decentralized interbank leading is motivated by peer monitoring. In this context, the paper derives the optimal prudential rules, and, in particular, looks at the impact of interbank monitoring on the solvency and liquidity ratios of borrowing and lending banks. Last, it provides conditions which a Too Big To Fail policy {{is or is not}} justified and studies the possibility of propagation of a bank's liquidity shock throughout the financial system.

This paper analyzes how contagion propagates within the Italian interbank market using a unique data set including actual bilateral exposures.

Based on the data available on actual bilateral exposures for all Italian banks, the results obtained by assuming the maximum entropy are compared with those reflecting the observed structure of <b>interbank</b> <b>claims.</b> The comparison indicates that, {{in line with the}} thesis prevailing in the literature, the maximum entropy method tends to underestimate the extent of contagion.

40|$|Suppose {{there is}} a failure of a bank: Would balance sheet {{connections}} among banks arising from interbank commitments propagate a crisis? Would a bank’s position in the interbank market affect its level of depositor runs? What role would the interbank market play during a crisis? How would the release of public information affect the financial crisis? Though these questions {{are at the heart}} of many debates, answering them has proven difficult because of lack of data on interbank exposures. We use a unique dataset from India that allows us to identify the interbank commitments in order to test contagion in the banking system of an idiosyncratic shock [...] caused due to a fraud in one of the banks. Interestingly, we find that the level of exposure with the failed bank is an important determinant of depositor runs. What makes this result even more intriguing is the fact that information on the exposure with the failed bank was not available to the depositors. We find that despite other controls, exposure level with the failed bank retains its explanatory power. We also find that release of information by media has a destabilizing effect on banks’ deposits. Furthermore, we find that banks that have lower level of exposure with the failed bank voluntarily release information on their exposure level. Finally, we find that outstanding <b>interbank</b> <b>claims</b> among other banks intensify the negative impact of the initia...|$|R
40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} one of the two {{principal}} means (the other being fiscal policy) by which government authorities in a market economy regularly influence the pace and direction of overall economic activity, importantly including not only the level of aggregate output and employment but also the general rate at which prices rise or fall. The ability of central banks to carry out monetary policy stems from their monopoly position as suppliers of their own liabilities, which banks in turn need (either as legally required reserves or as balances for settling <b>interbank</b> <b>claims)</b> in order to create the money and credit used in everyday economic transactions. Important developments both in research and in the actual conduct of monetary policy in recent decades have revolved around the choice of a short-term interest rate versus a reserve quantity as the central bank's direct operating instrument, whether to use some measure of money as an intermediate target, whether to constrain the central bank to follow some fairly simple policy rule, what degree of political independence a central bank should have, and whether to target inflation. Some key areas of ongoing research in this area, as of the beginning of the 21 st century, are whether the behavioral process by which monetary policy affects nonfinancial economic activity centers more on money or on credit, quantitative measurement of whatever is the mechanism at work, the trade-off between price inflation and real aspects of economic activity like output and employment, and just why it is that the public in most industrialized countries is as averse to inflation as is apparently the case. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} impact of the Basel III {{regulatory}} framework on interbank contagion. It focuses on the direct interbank contagion that spreads via <b>interbank</b> foreign <b>claims</b> among national banking sectors. A balance sheet-based network model employs the quarterly consolidated banking statistics, collected by the Bank for International Settlements, to simulate the consequences of credit and funding shock under stressed market conditions. Compared to the Basel II, the Basel III regulatory framework reduces the probability of interbank contagion (following a simulated default of one banking sector) from 31 % to 14 % and lowers {{the impact of}} contagion by 63 % in terms of average loss for a banking sector. The simulations under both regulatory frameworks show that relatively smaller banking sectors can trigger severe interbank contagion comparable to large banking sectors. Throughout the 2005 - 2009 period, the Basel III regulatory framework stabilizes the fluctuations of the scope of interbank contagion...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has {{stressed the need}} to understand financial systems as networks of interdependent countries, where crossborder financial linkages play the fundamental role. It has also been emphasized that the relevance of these networks relies on the representation of changes follow on the occurrence of stress events. Here, from series of <b>interbank</b> liabilities and <b>claims</b> over different time periods, we have developed networks of positions (net claims) between countries. Besides the Minimal Spanning Tree analysis of the time-constrained networks, a coefficient of residuality is defined to capture the structural evolution of the network of cross-border financial linkages. Because some structural changes seem {{to be related to}} the role that countries play in the financial context, networks of debtor and creditor countries are also developed. Empirical results allows to relate the network structure that emerges in the last years to the globally turbulent period that has characterized financial systems since the latest nineties. The residuality coefficient highlights an important modification acting in the financial linkages across countries in the period 1997 - 2011, and situates the recent financial crises as replica of a larger structural change going on since 1997.
