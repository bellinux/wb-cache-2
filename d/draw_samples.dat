Several studies have optimized the growing conditions of Bartonella spp. cultures in these liquid media, with no change in bacterial protein expressions or host interactions in vitro. Insect-based liquid media supports the growth and co-culturing of at least seven Bartonella species, reduces bacterial culturing time and facilitates PCR detection and isolation of Bartonella spp. from animal and patient samples. Research shows that DNA may be detected following direct extraction from blood samples and become negative following enrichment culture, thus PCR is recommended after direct sample extraction and also following incubation in enrichment culture. Several studies have successfully optimized sensitivity and specificity by using PCR amplification (pre-enrichment PCR) and enrichment culturing of blood <b>draw</b> <b>samples,</b> followed by PCR (post-enrichment PCR) and DNA sequence identification.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} the unusual and puzzling {{elasticity}} of <b>drawn</b> sPP <b>samples</b> was investigated. The mechanism responsible of the elasticity was studied for <b>drawn</b> <b>samples</b> characterized by a very simple structural organization, {{where there are no}} involvements of crystallographic modifications with different chain conformation. The elastic behavior of the <b>drawn</b> <b>samples,</b> valued through the hysteresis cycles, was determined at different temperatures. At room temperature the samples show remarkable elastic properties, whereas decreasing the temperature the elastic behavior becomes worse and worse, disappearing at temperatures lower than 0 °C. The elasticity also disappears in <b>drawn</b> <b>samples</b> after a long aging under tension. Thermomechanical and structural investigations, as well as shrinkage as a function of temperature and aging at room temperature of the fixed <b>drawn</b> <b>samples,</b> support the idea that the elastic behavior of sPP {{can be explained by the}} model of the plastic deformation of semicrystalline polymers. The interpretation is based on the presence of "tie" molecules axially connecting the crystals in the oriented samples, whose extension, chain conformation and/or crystallization determine the retractive stress of the oriented sample, as well as other mechanical properties. We show that many experiments on the <b>drawn</b> <b>samples,</b> either fixed or relaxed, are strictly connected to the morphology of the <b>drawn</b> <b>sample,</b> derived by the transition between the lamellar initial and the fibrillar final structure. By applying the model we can answer the questions derived from the experimental facts not yet well clarified, giving a new insight into the interesting elasticity of sPP...|$|R

A couple weeks later when I came in to show my Archie samples, I noticed that the pages were still there, but the bottom panel was cut off of one of my pages. I said, 'What happened'.
