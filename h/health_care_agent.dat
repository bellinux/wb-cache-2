5000|$|Affective {{forecasting}} {{has implications}} in health {{decision making and}} medical ethics and policy. Research in health-related affective forecasting suggests that nonpatients consistently underestimate {{the quality of life}} associated with chronic health conditions and disability. The so-called [...] "disability paradox" [...] states the discrepancy between self-reported levels of happiness amongst chronically ill people versus the predictions of their happiness levels by healthy people. The implications of this forecasting error in medical decision making can be severe, because judgments about future quality of life often inform health decisions. Inaccurate forecasts can lead patients, or more commonly their <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>agent,</b> to refuse life-saving treatment in cases when the treatment would involve a drastic change in lifestyle, for example, the amputation of a leg. A patient, or <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>agent,</b> who falls victim to focalism would fail to take into account all the aspects of life that would remain the same after losing a limb. Although Halpern and Arnold suggest interventions to foster awareness of forecasting errors and improve medical decision making amongst patients, the lack of direct research in the impact of biases in medical decisions provides a significant challenge.|$|E

A living will is a written statement of a person's health care and medical wishes but does not appoint another person to make health care decisions. Depending upon the jurisdiction, a health care power of attorney may or may not appear with an advance health care directive in a single, physical document. For example, the California legislature has adopted a standard power of attorney for health care and advance health care directive form that meets all of that state's legal wording requirements for a power of attorney and advance health care directive in a single document.

40|$|O artigo procurou compreender os significados atribuídos à saúde por adolescentes, na faixa etária entre 11 a 13 anos, e quem eles consideram seu cuidador de saúde. O estudo foi realizado com estudantes de escolas pública e privada, dos municípios de Sapucaia do Sul/RS e Porto Alegre/RS. As informações foram obtidas por meio de um questionário semi-estruturado. Os depoimentos indicaram que os jovens da escola pública consideram a família como o agente de cuidado à saúde, enquanto que os da escola privada consideram apenas a mãe. Observou-se, também, que para os estudantes da escola pública, saúde está relacionada com bem-estar físico e mental, enquanto que para os da instituição privada é somente ausência de doenças. Estes achados auxiliam a um melhor entendimento dos conceitos de saúde dos adolescentes, identificando seus cuidadores e servindo para subsidiar as práticas educativas e sanitárias.

40|$|The {{vision of}} Ambient Intelligence (AmI) presumes {{a plethora of}} {{embedded}} services and devices that all endeavor to support humans in their daily activities as unobtrusively as possible. Hardware gets distributed throughout the environment, occupying even the fabric of our clothing. The environment {{is equipped with a}} diversity of sensors, the information of which can be accessed from all over the AmI network. Individual services are distributed over hardware, share sensors with other services and are generally detached from the traditional single access-point computer (see also the paper of Pantic et al in this volume [51]). ‘Unobtrusive support’ means that where possible the user should be freed from the necessity of entering into an explicit dialog with all these services and devices. The environment shifts towards the use of implicit interaction, that is, “interactions that may occur without the behest or awareness of the user��? [36]. However, not all interactions between user and environment will be implicit. It may not be possible, or it may not be desirable, e. g. because the user does not want to feel a loss of control over certain aspects of his environment. So how does the user achieve the necessary explicit interaction? Will (s) he address every query for information to the specific device or service that ultimately provides the information? Will (s) he give commands to the heating system, the blinds and the room lighting separately? Will each service and each device carry its own interaction interface? Clearly not. Interfaces will come to be developed that abstract from individual services and devices and offer the user access to certain combined functionalities of the system. The interfaces should support the mixture of explicit and implicit, and reactive and proactive, interaction required for a successful AmI environment. Finally, AmI environments are inherently multiuser, so the interface {{needs to be able to}} understand and engage in addressed multi party interaction [48]. We argue that Virtual Humans (VHs) are eminently suited to fulfill the role of such interfaces. An AmI environment can serve various purposes. It can be a home environment, an office environment, a public space or it can be used in an educational setting. Virtual humans can be available, among others, as friend, exercise adviser, health care specialist, butler, conversation partner or tutor. Sometimes they know things better than you do, sometimes they have more control over parts of the AmI environment than you have and sometimes they persuade you to do things differently. You may not always like all aspects of the virtual humans that cohabit your house. Maybe the virtual tutor that is available to monitor your children’s homework sometimes takes decisions that are not liked by your children at all. Your virtual friend is not very interesting if it always agrees with your opinions. A <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>agent</b> has to be strict. A virtual human that acts as a conversational partner for your grandmother may have some peculiar behavior sometimes (like a dog or cat has; remember the Tamagotchi). As in collaborative virtual environments we can have remote participation in activities in AmI environments. Virtual humans can then represent family members (with all their characteristics, including weaknesses) that are abroad and that nevertheless take part in family activities. Transformation of communicative behavior of virtual humans that represent real humans can be useful too [4]. Summarizing, in the AmI environments we foresee that virtual humans can play human-like roles and need human-like properties, including (semi-) autonomous behavior, personalities, individual characteristics and peculiarities. However, the vast majority of existing, implemented applications of Virtual Humans are focused around one clear task, such as selling tickets, learning a skill, answering questions or booking flights and hotels, and are accessed in a clearly explicit manner. There, one can take it as a given that the attention of the user is on the system and the user is primarily engaged with the interaction. In an AmI environment this is no longer true. A dialog with a Virtual Human may be altogether secondary to several other activities of the user. A dialog with a Virtual Human may also be about many different issues, pertaining to different aspects of the environment, in parallel. This has a lot of impact on many aspects of a Virtual Human. In the rest of this paper we will examine a (not necessarily exhaustive) number of aspects to Virtual Humans that we feel as most relevant to their introduction in a complex AmI environment. Some of these aspects relate to the embedding of the Human / Virtual Human interaction in ongoing daily activities: issues of synchronization, turn taking and control. Other points touch upon the fictional/real polemic: how realistic should VHs be? Should a VH interface exhibit ‘socially inspired’ behaviour? Should a VH exhibit also the imperfections and shortcomings so characteristic of human communication? Some of the points will be illustrated with examples from our recent work on Virtual Humans, summarized in Section 4...|$|E

We carried out two surveys in the Province of Chubut, in summer and in spring, 1998. In each survey, we interviewed local <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>agents</b> for triatomine recognition and reports of the bugs, followed by entomological searches in houses and peridomestic and silvatic biotopes.

In agreement with previous studies, all these positive localities were east of the 11 °C isotherm, within the Monte phytogeographic province. Triatomine abundance and infestation levels (in peridomiciles and peridomestic biotopes) were higher in summer than in spring, possibly reflecting adverse environmental conditions such as flood and cold winter weather. In the silvatic environment, we found three adult bugs under rocks in summer. In peridomestic sites bugs were only found associated with chickens, which were also the only blood meal source identified. Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi was not detected. We conclude that T. patagonica at its southernmost distribution limit does not represent a risk to public health due to its low abundance, lack of association with humans, and absence of T. cruzi infection...|$|R

Node analysis revealed that three primary and three backup/probe questions yielded information that minimized misinformation, sampled from all four content areas, led to discussions of importance for good planning and decision-making, and may have led to earlier hospice admission than the national average. Two emerging themes, Generativity (passing on values or assets to the next generation) and essence (simple pleasures in everyday life), and were then quantitatively analyzed. People who mentioned generativity tended to be older, had a longer length of hospice stay, and a longer time to death after interview, compared to those who did not mention the theme.

As we evolve scientifically and technologically, {{and as the}} population of the world rapidly approaches 7 billion and beyond, among the many issues with which we are faced is the continued availability of drugs for future global <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Medicinal <b>agents</b> are primarily derived from two sources, synthetic and natural, or in some cases, as semi-synthetic compounds, a mixture of the two. For the developed world, efforts have been initiated to make drug production "greener", with milder reagents, shorter reaction times, and more efficient processing, thereby using less energy, and reactions which are more atom efficient, and generate fewer by-products. However, most of the world's population uses plants, in either crude or extract form, for their primary <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> There is relatively little discussion as yet, about the long term effects of the current, non-sustainable harvesting methods for medicinal plants from the wild, which are depleting these critical resources without concurrent initiatives to commercialize their cultivation.

Salmonella was most frequently identified (34 %), followed by Campylobacter (23 %) and norovirus (7 %). In 2005, Campylobacter was observed more often as the cause (in 2004 17 %). Simultaneously, norovirus was reported less often in 2005 (in 2004 15 %) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology for creating and employing decision-analytic models {{in order to}} solve problems involving different <b>health</b> <b>care</b> expertises. Several <b>agents</b> may concur in making a choice, each of them having a different role both in building and using the model. As a matter of fact, each agent can provide specialized knowledge {{for the creation of}} parts of this model. Operators may use different sets of data for exploring possible model improvement, and may manipulate different variables influencing final decision. The training example given by the paper will be a model for a therapeutic choice based on the cost/effectiveness ratio. Two agents will be taken into consideration: a physician, able to predict health outcomes and a hospital manager, able to compute costs. They both have access to the hospital data base, but with different logical views, that allow them to validate and improve the relative part of the model. The aim of this work was directed towards demonstra [...] ...|$|R
