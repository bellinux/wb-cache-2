5|$|In , Farber, Ruggiero and Mistysyn {{were given}} regular roles, as were Andrea Lewis (Hazel Aden) and Stepto, who had held {{recurring}} roles {{since the first}} season. Mike Lobel (Jay Hogart), Deanna Casaluce (Alex Nuñez), Ephraim Ellis (Rick Murray) and John Bregar (Dylan Michalchuk) were introduced in recurring roles as new students. Towards {{the end of the}} season, Schmidt's character, Terri McGreggor, was written out of the show when her possessive boyfriend Rick pushed her to the ground and knocked <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a rock, causing her to fall into a coma.|$|E

5|$|Sheila's {{mental health}} {{continued}} to decline, with episodes of banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> walls. In 1983, her family doctor referred her to Dr. Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June. Ferguson {{said she was}} in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility in Northampton, where {{she was diagnosed with}} schizoaffective disorder, although Ferguson said this diagnosis was a mistake and that she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Via a live news report, a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.|$|E
5|$|The senate {{attempted}} to use Caligula's death {{as an opportunity}} to restore the republic. Chaerea tried to persuade the military to support the senate. The military, though, remained loyal to the idea of imperial monarchy. The grieving Roman people assembled and demanded that Caligula's murderers be brought to justice. Uncomfortable with lingering imperial support, the assassins sought out and stabbed Caligula's wife, Caesonia, and killed their young daughter, Julia Drusilla, by smashing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a wall. They were unable to reach Caligula's uncle, Claudius; after a soldier, Gratus, found Claudius hiding behind a palace curtain he was spirited out of the city by a sympathetic faction of the Praetorian Guard to the nearby Praetorian camp.|$|E

60|$|She leaned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> wearily <b>against</b> his shoulder, and {{her body}} shivered with {{recurrent}} nervousness. He waited for a {{time for her to}} speak, and then went on.|$|R

25|$|In May 1970, Norris—on bail for {{his latest}} offense—attacked a female student {{whom he had}} been {{stalking}} {{on the grounds of}} the San Diego State University campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to her knees, before he repeatedly beat <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the sidewalk as he knelt upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the Atascadero State Hospital, where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.|$|E
25|$|For the raid, police wore masks {{to hinder}} identification. Most {{occupants}} of the building were in their sleeping bags, and many raised their arms in surrender when they realised the police were breaking into the building. However, police attacked the crowds with truncheons, beating everyone indiscriminately. A 65-year-old woman's arm was broken. Melanie Jonasch, a 28-year-old archaeology student from Berlin, was attacked by officers set upon her, beating her head so hard that she rapidly lost consciousness. When she fell to the ground, officers circled her, beating and kicking her limp body, banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a nearby cupboard, leaving her {{in a pool of}} blood.|$|E
25|$|Chrissie persuades Zoe {{to abort}} {{the baby and}} tells her they should team up for revenge on Den. They get {{together}} with Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) to do this, meeting up in The Queen Victoria. Chrissie sends for Sharon claiming Den is on his deathbed. She finds out that it isn't true and leaves again. Chrissie planned this {{to get rid of}} Sharon so Den would pay attention to her and love her instead. Right after Sharon leaves, Den realizes Chrissie did this and attacks her smashing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the jukebox. Zoe stops him by attacking him with a metal doorstop, supposedly killing him. She runs off and Sam goes after her to calm her down. However, he is not dead, and he grabs Chrissie. She hits him again with the doorstop, killing him. Zoe is led to believe that she killed Den, though Sam sees Chrissie kill Den and eventually tells Zoe, who punches Chrissie. Zoe leaves for Ibiza after having an emotional goodbye from Kat while Chrissie is charged with Den's murder, and Sam goes on the run after.|$|E
60|$|She had {{nestled in}} his arms, and hoped to avoid notice by keeping <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>against</b> him, as she hastily responded to his questions; but he {{detected}} something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not forget}} {{that you are a}} Tudor and a Queen, and remember," [...] he added quaintly, as <b>her</b> <b>head</b> fell <b>against</b> his shoulder, [...] "remember [...] . . . I am only a man!" ...|$|R
60|$|Joe's arm {{was around}} Nell. She had demurred at first, {{but he gave}} no heed to her slight resistance, and finally <b>her</b> <b>head</b> rested <b>against</b> his shoulder. There was no need of words.|$|R
500|$|When told by Dr. Lynn of her husband's death, Ono started sobbing and said, [...] "Oh no, no, no, no... tell me it's not true!" [...] Dr. Lynn {{remembers that}} Ono {{lay down and}} began hitting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the floor, but calmed down when a nurse gave Lennon's wedding ring to her. In a state of shock, she was led away from Roosevelt Hospital by Geffen Records' president, David Geffen.|$|E
500|$|In January, Dennis catches Den and {{his girlfriend}} Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) in bed {{together}} and tells Chrissie who is stunned. Zoe discovers she is pregnant by Den. Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Chrissie, Zoe and Sam Hunter (Kim Medcalf) plan revenge on Den; Chrissie for his lies and adultery, Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding {{at the other side}} of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock all the doors. A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic." [...] so Chrissie picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.|$|E
2500|$|After Torque defeats the creature, {{he remembers}} the murders. During an {{argument}} with his wife, he pushed her, and she accidentally knocked <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the bedside table. Seeing his mother dead, Torque's eldest son, Cory, drowns his younger brother and then jumps from the upstairs window, telling Torque, [...] "You took her away, I'm taking us away." [...] When the coastguard arrives, Torque knocks him out and commandeers the boat, sailing away from Carnate.|$|E
60|$|The mare {{had raised}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and cocked <b>her</b> ears at the {{rustling}} of a quail in the thicket. Chris {{leaned over and}} rubbed around her ears. Dolly's enjoyment was evident, and she drooped <b>her</b> <b>head</b> over <b>against</b> the shoulder of his own horse.|$|R
60|$|Bert {{surrendered}} the child, {{who looked}} up into the bearded face of the rough fellow, then rested <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on his breast, and went to sleep at last. It made his heart thrill as he felt <b>her</b> little <b>head</b> <b>against</b> his breast. He never had held a child in his arms before.|$|R
60|$|Just then <b>her</b> <b>head</b> struck <b>against</b> {{the roof}} of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{pretended to}} bang <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> {{the sofa in}} mock frustration. [...] "SO {{much has been made}} of that," [...] she groans, noting that it was only done where words had been used that really meant {{something}} very different to Americans. Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper – British for pullover sweater – means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea. [...] "He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater,' which is just as British?" [...] That was fine with Rowling.|$|E
2500|$|According to the prosecution, Knox had {{attacked}} Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a wall, forcefully held her face, {{and tried to}} strangle her. Mignini suggested Knox had taunted Kercher and may have said, [...] "You acted the goody-goody so much, now {{we are going to}} show you. Now you're going to be forced to have sex!" [...] The prosecution theorized that Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans, and held her {{on her hands and knees}} while Guede sexually abused her; that Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound; and that she had then stolen Kercher's mobile phones and money to fake a burglary. On 5December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was {{transferred}} from the Temple to an isolated cell in the Conciergerie as 'Prisoner n° 280'. Leaving the tower she bumped <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the lintel of a door, which prompted one of her guards to {{ask her if she}} was hurt, to which she answered, [...] "No! Nothing now can hurt me." [...] This was the most difficult period of her captivity. She was under constant surveillance, with no privacy. The [...] "Carnation Plot" [...] (Le complot de l'œillet), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards. She was attended by Rosalie Lamorlière, who took care of her as much as she could. At least once she received a visit by a Catholic priest.|$|E
60|$|And {{then her}} eyes closed. The {{voice of the}} Man from Nome had a monotony in its very earnestness. Besides, what dull talk was this of brooms and {{sweeping}} and dust? She leaned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back <b>against</b> the wall.|$|R
50|$|In June 2016, video {{surfaced}} of Morgan supposedly beaching {{herself on}} stage. The video {{was released by}} the animal rights group, the Dolphin Project, along with a video of Morgan banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> repeatedly <b>against</b> a metal gate inside her enclosure.|$|R
60|$|Just at this moment, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> struck <b>against</b> {{the roof}} of the hall: in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and hurried off to the garden door.|$|R
2500|$|Although King David and {{his successors}} sought {{to impose their}} {{authority}} on Moray, resistance continued. King Malcolm IV, David's grandson and successor, uprooted and expelled the local populace. The Chronicle of Holyrood records that in 1163: [...] "King Malcolm transferred men of Moray". It was not until 1229, when William Comyn of Buchan, led a royal army into Moray and finally, brutally, pacified the province for King Alexander II; he was rewarded by a grateful king with the lordship of Badenoch. The final, and most unmerciful, action in the mac Malcolm kings' long campaign against the rival royal dynasty was perpetrated against the infant in whom its claim resided: the three-year-old girl was publicly murdered by King Alexander's men, who, having read a proclamation, smashed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the market-cross in the burgh of Forfar. Moray now finally accepted {{the rule of the}} mac Malcolm kings of Scots.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1989, {{after her}} Sizzling Spectacular concert in Nevada, Gordon {{forcibly}} married Jackson, claiming {{it was for}} her own protection against kidnapping by her family. La Toya Jackson states that this was both unplanned and against her wishes. According to Jackson; [...] "I told him, 'No way, Jack! I can't marry you. You know what marriage means to me. I've never been in love; I don't even date.... It's not right. I don't love you. I don't have feelings for you.'" [...] Jackson tried {{to run out of}} the chapel three times but bodyguard Antonio Rossi grabbed her saying, [...] "There's some things you have to do. Even if you don't want to." [...] Jackson told Ebony magazine the marriage was [...] "strictly in name only. It has never been consummated." [...] Six months into the marriage, Jackson asked Gordon for an annulment when in Rome, Italy. In response, Gordon repeatedly bashed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the corner of the hotel room table saying that he would never let her go. Paparazzi subsequently photographed Jackson with black eyes, which Gordon claimed were caused by an intruder. From this point forward, Jackson lost all contact with her family and wrote an autobiography, , which accused her father of physical abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
6000|$|ALBERTO. In a minute, my darling. There, there, poor Lucrezia. (He puts an arm round her, {{kisses her}} hair and neck. LUCREZIA leans <b>her</b> bowed <b>head</b> <b>against</b> his chest. The sound of {{footsteps}} is heard. They both look up with scared, wide-open eyes.) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{ran up to}} him, flung her parasol on the grass, put <b>her</b> little <b>head</b> <b>against</b> his breast, {{and then}} there began a narrative, disjointed by such a hysterical weeping as was never surpassed for {{intensity}} in {{the whole history of}} love.|$|R
60|$|At this {{juncture}} Annie called them to supper. Later, when Col. Zane {{sat on the}} doorstep smoking, Betty came and sat beside him with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> resting <b>against</b> his shoulder. The Colonel smoked on in silence. Presently the dusky head moved restlessly.|$|R
