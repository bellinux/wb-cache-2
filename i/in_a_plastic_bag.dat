5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso {{were found in the}} same area, also <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag.</b> Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1986, the accused, {{a career}} {{criminal}} named Olaf Dietrich (born 1952), flew from Bangkok, Thailand, to Melbourne Airport. He had imported at least seventy grams of heroin, which he concealed within condoms {{that he had}} swallowed. He was arrested the next morning by the Australian Federal Police, who searched his flat and found one of the condoms in the kitchen, and some heroin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> under a hirug in another room. He was taken into custody, and passed {{the remainder of the}} condoms during the night at the hospital in Pentridge Prison. Dietrich alleged that the drugs had been planted by the police.|$|E
25|$|Agarose gels {{are easily}} cast and handled {{compared}} to other matrices, because the gel setting is a physical rather than chemical change. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> in a refrigerator.|$|E

25|$|If not {{consumed}} immediately, {{there are}} storing techniques {{that can help}} to keep the bagel moist and fresh. First, cool bagels in a paper bag; wrap the paper bag <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> (attempting to rid the bags of as much air as possible without squishing the bagels); then freeze {{for up to six}} months.|$|E
25|$|Temple of Apshai {{was first}} {{released}} in August 1979. The original release contained the program cassette and the manual <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag,</b> an unusually professional packaging for the time. Early advertisements promoted versions for TRS-80 and Comodore PET, but a version for the Apple II followed in 1980. The TRS-80, Apple II, and PET versions were sold for $24.95 on cassette and $29.95 on disk.|$|E

25|$|On June 26, 2011, Beasley {{was driving}} in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka when he was pulled over by a {{policeman}} for speeding. The policeman noticed that the car smelled of a strong odor of marijuana. The officer allegedly found marijuana <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> under the front passenger seat. However, Beasley said the marijuana was not his, but belonged to a friend whom he had just dropped off. Beasley was consequently fined and ticketed.|$|E
25|$|After {{six weeks}} of captivity, {{in an act of}} despair, Pearson deeply bit into Berdella's penis before {{screaming}} he could not continue to tolerate being treated in this manner. In response, Berdella killed Pearson by first bludgeoning him into unconsciousness with a tree limb, then suffocating him with a bag and ligature, before driving to hospital to receive treatment for his wound. Pearson's body was later dismembered in the basement, and his head initially stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> inside Berdella's freezer, before being buried in the backyard.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} {{information on how}} to grow Wollemi Pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.|$|E
50|$|In other countries, like Canada, {{there is}} more variety in packaging. Smarties can be {{purchased}} <b>in</b> rectangular boxes, <b>a</b> giant tube, or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stand-up <b>plastic</b> <b>bag,</b> and <b>in</b> 410 g bags in Australia and New Zealand.|$|R

25|$|Plants can be {{propagated}} by seed, cuttings, {{and tissue}} culture. Seeds are usually sown on damp chopped Sphagnum moss, or on sterile {{plant tissue culture}} media once they have been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or perlite {{has been used for}} germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp Sphagnum moss <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> or tank with high humidity and moderate light. They can begin to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. Tissue culture is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists at reasonable prices. Nepenthes species are considered threatened or endangered plants and all of the are listed in CITES appendices 2, with the exception of N. rajah and N. khasiana which are listed in CITES appendix 1.|$|E
500|$|Bella Neveah Amoroso Bond (August 6, 2012 – May or June 2015), {{previously}} {{known as}} the Deer Island Jane Doe and [...] "Baby Doe", was an American child found dead <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> {{on the shore of}} Deer Island in Winthrop, Massachusetts, on June 25, 2015. Authorities pursued investigation into discovering who the child was until her identification in September 2015.|$|E
500|$|The High Court {{said that}} the trial judge {{did not seem to}} be aware that he had the {{authority}} to adjourn the trial. Another factor which complicated the case was that although the jury found Dietrich guilty of importing the heroin in the condoms, they found him not guilty of owning the heroin which had been hidden <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag.</b> For the High Court, this uncertainty meant that it was possible that Dietrich could also have been acquitted of the other charges, if he had been legally represented: ...|$|E
50|$|Japanese garage kits {{are usually}} cast as {{separate}} parts which {{are packed with}} instructions and sometimes photographs of the final product. Most professionally manufactured kits come <b>in</b> <b>a</b> box while amateur-produced kits sold at conventions come <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags,</b> blank boxes or even boxes with copied sheet information glued onto it. They are not painted, {{but some of them}} do have decals provided by the sculptor or circle. The builder has to paint and assembled the model, preferably with an airbrush. However, they can also be painted with a regular brush using a variety of techniques to achieve similar effects as when painting with a conventional airbrush.|$|R

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} legend that Drake dropped the album off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> at Island Records' {{reception}} {{and then left}} without anyone realising, Drake delivered the master tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island. In an interview for the Nick Drake fanzine Pynk Moon in 1996, Island's press officer David Sandison recalled that Drake's arrival at the record company had certainly not gone unnoticed, although {{there had been no}} indication that he was delivering them a new album: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the storage place, placing manner, and storage time on {{mechanical}} properties of briquettes made from birch chips were laboratorily tested. A unique methodology developed by the present author enabling a relatively easy assessment of mechanical properties of the briquettes is described. The briquettes properties were evaluated by their density and rupture force determination. From the test results it follows that if the briquettes are stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> well closed <b>plastic</b> <b>bag,</b> neither the place nor the storage time influence significantly their life time. When stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> net <b>plastic</b> <b>bag,</b> the briquettes get seriously damaged, namely depending on their storage place and storage time...|$|R
2500|$|... 15 December 2012 – Aaron Carlino murdered {{drug dealer}} Stephen Cookson in his East Perth home by {{shooting}} him {{twice in the}} head and then cut up and dismembered the body.

Cookson's head was later found washed up on Rottnest Island by an 11-year-old girl. Carlino was convicted of the murder and was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Sugar was notably {{critical}} of Revolution's second pitch, {{pointing out that}} their presentation was ruined by them bringing their products to it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag,</b> remarking that it made them {{look as if they}} had [...] "stumbled out of the tip". He also questioned why Arjun had led the pitch, which had received poor feedback compared to the first pitch which Zoe had led, and suspected he did so to stand a chance in the boardroom, though Arjun disagreed, claiming he wanted a chance to prove that he could pitch.|$|E
