40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the significance {{for economic development}} in Devon and Cornwall of the material and business service linkages of manufacturing establishments. Industrial linkages can {{play a key role}} in promoting regional growth, whilst the nature of the relationship between linkages and economic growth is further understood by focusing attention at establishment level. Thus, using data drawn from a survey of 366 manufacturing plants in Devon and Cornwall, the thesis considers the extent to which differing types of establishment possess local suppliers and markets. The primary focus is the importance of key variables as an indicator for variations in linkage patterns- It is found that loca 1 linkage is primarily a reflection of variations in ownership status, firm size, the degree of managerial autonomy in decision making, the nature of the product and the perception of the external environment by chief decision makers. Those plants where local linkage is most marked are the independent firms, relatively small plants and ones with decision making freedom at the local level. A move to self sustaining economic growth requires, therefore, a policy designed to mobilise the <b>indigenous</b> <b>potential</b> of the local area via encouraging growth in small and independent firms, where linkage potential is highest. This will result in more major corporate decisions being taken locally and will yield the benefit of technical advance, new firm formation and employment growth in the long period...|$|E
40|$|Since the Industrial Revolution the {{cyclical}} {{processes of}} {{rise and fall}} of regional economies have been accelerating. Many of the specific problems of the falling part of clustering, that is old industrial areas, are related to path dependency and lock-ins. Particularly political lock-ins hinder the necessary restructuring processes in old industrial areas. They can be considered as thick institutional tissues aiming at preserving existing industrial structures and therefore unnecessarily slowing down industrial restructuring and indirectly hampering the development of <b>indigenous</b> <b>potential</b> and creativity. Of the recently born offspring of the family of territorial innovation models, the learning region concept seems to be most focused on overcoming and avoiding political lock-ins in old industrial areas. Most scholars consider learning regions as regional 2 development concepts in which the main actors are strongly, but flexibly connected with each other and are open both to intra-regional and inter-regional learning processes. Policy-makers in learning regions are involved in learning from institutional errors made in the past and by doing that in avoiding path-dependent development. Empirical evidence shows that the learning region is of limited importance to unlock regional economies from path dependency, due to three weaknesses: its fuzziness, its normative character in its squeezed position between national innovation systems and global production networks. A less normative and more process-oriented concept is proposed in this paper, namely that of the learning cluster. key words: learning region, regional innovation policy, industrial restructuring, path dependency, lock-ins, learning cluste...|$|E

Compared to transfectants expressing authentic HCHV gB, those expressing gB forms with a deletion of hydrophobic domain 1 (hdl; aa 714 - 747) or with deletions of specific segments in the cytoplasmic tail (aa 811 - 825 and 871 - 906) exhibited significantly reduced heterologous fusogenicity. HCHV gBspecific monoclonal antibodies (HAbs) as well as HAb against cellular annexin II prevented fusion of the transfectant expressing authentic gB. Comparable surface exposure of HCHV gB or its derivatives was demonstrated in all transfectants by FACS analysis. Our observations are compatible {{with the notion that}} indigenous fusion activity of HCHV gB depends on the extracellular hdl domain and on the conformation of the cytoplasmic tail. All herpesvirus species analysed to date contain in their envelopes structural homologues of glycoprotein B (gB) of herpes simplex virus (HSV), which thus appears to be highly conserved throughout the herpesvirus family (Albrecht & Fleckenstein, 1990). In the case of HSV, it has been shown by the use of virus deletion mutants (Cai et al., 1987) that gB is essential for infectivity, i. e. virion maturation, host cell entry and cell-to-cell spread (Cai et al., 1988).

The objective was to test whether modern off-shore tuna fattening industries can exert a sustainable organic waste impact on the receiving environment as has been reported for the offshore culture of more traditional Mediterranean species such as sparids. In the water column, the concentration of phytopigments, organic matter, heterotrophic bacteria and the taxonomic abundance of mesozooplankton (at the species level) were assessed. In the sediment, we assessed the concentration of reduced sulphur pools, phytopigments, organic matter, heterotrophic bacteria and the taxonomic abundance of meiofauna (at the taxa level) and nematodes (at the genus level). For most parameters, we found no substantial differences between farm and control sites. Deviations of farm values from control values, when they occurred, were small and did not indicate any significant impact on either the pelagic and benthic environment. Deviations were more apparent in the benthic compartment where lower redox potential values, higher bacterial production rates and a change in nematode genus composition pointed out to early changes in the sediment’s metabolism. In addition, <b>indigenous</b> <b>potential</b> pathogenic bacteria showed higher concentration at the fish farm stations and were a warning of an undesirable event that may become established following aquaculture practice in oligotrophic environments.

Wide collection of Trichoderma and Bacillus was conducted from tomato rhizospheric soil in IIVR farm (Varanasi), IIHR farm (Bangalore), IARI farm (Rajendra Nagar) and farm of APHU (T. P. Gudem) by using Trichoderma Specific Media (TSM) and Nutrient Agar (NA). As a result, total 65 strains were cultured and maintained in which 28 were Bacillus and 37 were Trichoderma, respectively. On the basis of in vitro bioassays viz., dual culture and poisoned food technique {{it was concluded that}} 3 most prominent Trichoderma isolates viz., DPNST- 4, - 8 and - 29 and four most prominent of DPNSB- 2, - 11, - 18 and - 28 from Bacillus were selected...|$|R
