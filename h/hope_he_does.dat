500|$|The [...] "Bale Out" [...] mashup {{incorporates}} audio {{clips of}} Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding [...] "I {{was looking at}} the lights." [...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." ...|$|E
500|$|Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo set his drum kit on the {{concrete}} and the kit went [...] "all over the place" [...] while playing. Lombardo asked Gene Hoglan to hold his kit together, while recording [...] "Chemical Warfare", with Hoglan thinking, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> this {{in one or two}} takes, because this is rough." [...] Hoglan was coaching Lombardo how to use double-bass drums to improve his drumming ability and speed; Lombardo asserts Hoglan was [...] "an amazing double-bass player even back then", although Hoglan played double bass since a short time then. Eddy Schreyer provided audio mastering and digital remastering, with the cover art design created by Vince Gutierrez. Haunting the Chapel was darker and more thrash-oriented than Show No Mercy, and laid the groundwork for the future direction in the band's sound.|$|E
2500|$|Tasmania toured Zimbabwe {{for five}} games {{ahead of the}} 1995–96 Sheffield Shield. Ponting struggled, {{aggregating}} 99 runs at a modest 24.75. By the end of October, he had {{signed a contract with}} the Australian Cricket Board, along with 22 other Australian cricketers. [...] He opened the batting with Boon in Tasmania's first match of the Sheffield Shield season, scoring 20 and 43. Ahead of the following match against Queensland in Hobart, Ponting set himself a goal of scoring a century in each innings; a feat he achieved in a high-scoring draw. His form continued against the touring Sri Lankans in a one-day game in Devonport, scoring 99. He scored another century against the same opposition in Launceston. During the match, the public address system at the NTCA Ground announced that Ponting was making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Perth on 8 December. The following morning saw local newspaper The Examiner headline: [...] "He's Ricky Ponting, he's ours ... and he's made it! Tassie's batting star will play in his first Test." [...] Marsh continued his praise of Ponting, who replaced a dropped Blewett. [...] "I have no doubt Ricky will be trying to get 100 in his first Test game. And I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> You'd back him to. If Ricky carries with him the same attitude that he has seen him succeed at First-class cricket to the next level {{there is no reason why}} he will not continue to score." ...|$|E
60|$|Young John replied, with acknowledgments, that <b>he</b> only <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{what was}} right, and what showed how entirely he {{was devoted to}} Miss Dorrit. He wished to be unselfish; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was. <b>He</b> wished to <b>do</b> {{anything}} as laid {{in his power to}} serve Miss Dorrit, altogether putting himself out of sight; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> It was but little that <b>he</b> could <b>do,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's not agreeable, is it?" [...] pursues Mr. Snagsby, {{coughing}} his cough of mild persuasion {{behind his}} hand. [...] "Mr. Krook ought {{to consider it}} in the rent. I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> I am sure." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes;--Mr. Greystock. He {{has asked}} me. He has {{asked me to}} be his wife. I thought he loved me. I <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> at least. Oh dear, I did so <b>hope</b> it! And <b>he</b> does!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> doesn't. I <b>do</b> <b>hope</b> that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not. I cannot {{understand}} what pleasure {{it is that}} men take in making chimneys of themselves, and going about smelling {{so that no one}} can bear to come near them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not look}} so very ill,' said Genevieve, cheerfully, but this rather hurt the {{feelings}} of both; the one said, 'Oh! but he is terribly pale,' the other coughed, and said, 'Looks are deceitful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Again came bitter vexation in Eustace's way of {{receiving}} the intelligence. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not mean to}} bring her here. It would be so extremely inconvenient--not a widow even! It would just confirm all the scandals I have surmounted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think he'll take us along," [...] whispered Chet to Andy, on {{retiring}} for the night. [...] "And I sincerely <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> It {{may give}} me a chance to find out what became of the Betsey Andrews and my father." ...|$|E
60|$|Winston {{shook his}} head, and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not look as guilty as he felt, when {{he remembered that}} it must have been evident to his {{companion}} that the furs did not get into the position they had occupied themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} signify in the least," [...] said Lily. [...] "Even if I were to meet Mr. Crosbie I don't think I should {{make such a}} fool of myself again. As it is, I can only <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see it." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr Thomas Duncan Greenlees FRSE (1859-1929) was a British {{physician}} strongly {{linked to}} South Africa.

6000|$|... "I shouldn't think so. Not {{unless he}} comes to the dorm. during the night. He's {{sleeping}} over in Wain's part of the house, but I shouldn't be surprised if he nipped out after Wain has gone to bed. <b>Hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> anyway." ...|$|E

60|$|That honest gentleman, though {{somewhat}} abashed by {{the effect}} of his first introduction, advanced with confidence, and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not intrude upon the ladies.

6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} for John and Armine, for {{we have been}} unsettled, and I could not go on so {{steadily}} with them as before," [...] she said eagerly, but faltering a little.

50|$|His move to Doncaster {{did not go}} as well as <b>he</b> {{might have}} <b>hoped.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not feature in {{the first team to}} any great extent, and during the 2005-06 season he spent an {{unsuccessful}} loan spell at Southport, where his only match was a 4-0 loss at Accrington Stanley.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Better {{to keep it}} secret till others tell it. Reserved {{knowledge}} is always reserved strength; and if the man, as I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not, intends evil to the Church, let him commit himself before you use your knowledge against him. True, {{you may have a}} scruple of conscience as to the lawfulness of allowing a sin which you might prevent. To me it seems that the sin lies in the will rather than in the deed, and that sometimes--I only say sometimes--it may be a means of saving the sinner to allow his root of iniquity to bear fruit, and fill him with his own devices.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honour {{is a cold}} word. It is not honour, but love,--downright true, honest love. I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> honour you. I {{believe you}} to be an honest, true woman; and, as he knows you well, he {{probably}} does honour you;--but I am speaking of love." [...] Again Clara was silent. She knew what should be her argument if she were determined to oppose her cousin's pleadings; and she knew also,--she thought she knew,--that she did intend to oppose them; {{but there was a}} coldness in the argument to which she was averse. [...] "You cannot be insensible to such love as that!" [...] said Mary, going on with the cause which she had in hand.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the next}} morning there came a message {{to him as he}} was dressing. Mr. Wharton wished to speak to him. Would he come down before breakfast, or would he call on Mr. Wharton in Stone Buildings? He sent down word that he would do the latter at an hour he fixed, and then did not show himself in the breakfast-room till Mr. Wharton was gone. [...] "I've got to go to your father to-day," [...] he said to his wife, [...] "and I thought it best not to begin till we come to the regular business. I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean to be unreasonable." [...] To this she made no answer. [...] "Of course you think the want of reason will be all on my side." ...|$|E
60|$|P. 413. Burnet. His friend answered, <b>He</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not intend}} {{to make use of}} him to trepan a man to his ruin.

60|$|Thus the man {{of science}} summed up the {{biological}} case of Kurt Dorn. When he had gone Anderson wore the distressed look of one who must abandon his last <b>hope.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not understand, though {{he was forced to}} believe.

6000|$|... "Now by the Grasshopper and all {{the gods}} of Egypt I swear that in payment for this insult I will choke the Nile with {{the army of the}} Great King, and hang that knave to a pole from the prow of the royal ship." [...] Which last thing I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I {{am sorry}} to say I {{have not yet been}} able to read Mr. Martineau’s [...] sermon, which I mean to do with care. I am, as you know, one [...] {{altogether}} attached to dogma, which I believe to be the skeleton [...] that carries the flesh, the blood, the life of the blessed thing [...] we call the Christian religion. But I do not believe that God’s [...] tender mercies are restricted to {{a small portion of the}} human [...] family. I dare not be responsible for Dr. Newman, nor would he [...] thank me; but I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not so believe, and this the more [...] because I have lately been reading Dr. Manning’s letter to Dr. [...] Pusey; and, though Dr. Manning is far more exaggerated in his [...] religion than Dr. Newman, and seems to me almost to caricature it, [...] yet I think even he has by no means that limited view of the [...] mercies of God.|$|E
60|$|The strange illegal Votes declaring several eminent {{persons to}} be Enemies to the King and Kingdom, {{are not so}} strange, he says, but very justifiable. I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean, that illegal Votes are now not strange in the House of Commons: But observe the reason which he gives: for the House of Commons had before address'd for their removal from about the King. It was his {{business}} to have prov'd, that an Address of the House of Commons, without Process, order of Law, hearing any Defence, or offering any proof against them is sufficient ground to remove any person from the King: But instead of this he only proves, that former Addresses have been made, Which no body can deny. When he has throughly settled this important point, that Addresses have certainly been made, instead of an Argument to back it, he only thinks, that one may affirm by Law, That the King ought to have no person about him, who has the misfortune of such a Vote. But this is too ridiculous to require an Answer. They who will have a thing done, and give no reason for it, assume to themselves a manifest Arbitrary Power. Now this Power cannot be in the Representatives, if it be not in the People: or if it be in them, the People is absolute. But since he wholly thinks it, let him injoy the privilege of every Free Born Subject, to have the Bell clinck to him what he imagines.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Jem!' soliloquized Fitzjocelyn. 'At least, I am {{glad the}} trouble is love, not the Ordination. But as to his meaning! He gives me to {{understand}} that we are rivals--It is the most absurd thing I ever knew--I declare I don't know whether he means Mary or Isabel. I suppose he would consider Mary's fortune a barrier--No, she is too serene for his storms--worthy, most worthy--but she would hate to be worshipped in that wild way. Besides, I am done for in that quarter. No clashing there--! Nay, the other it can never be--after all his efforts to lash me up at Christmas. Yet, he was much with her, he made Clara sacrifice the clasp to her. Hm! She is an embodied romance, deserving to be raved about; while for poor dear Mary, it would be simply ridiculous. I wish I could guess--it is too absurd to doubt, and worse to ask; and, what's more, he would not stand it. If I did but know! I'm not so far gone yet, but that I could leave the field to him, if that would do him any good. Heigh ho! it would be en regle to begin to hate him, and be as jealous as Bluebeard; but there! I don't know which it is to be about, and one can't be jealous for two ladies at once, luckily, for it would be immensely troublesome, unless a good, hearty quarrel would be wholesome to revive his spirits. It is a bad time for it, though! Well, I <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean Mary--I could not bear for her to be tormented by him. That other creature might reign over him like the full moon dispersing clouds. Well! this is the queerest predicament I ever heard of!' And on he wandered, almost as much diverted by the humour of the doubt, as annoyed by the dilemma.|$|E
60|$|The {{strength}} of the two struggling old men was sinking fast. The Signor Grimaldi had, thus far, generously sustained his friend, who was less expert than himself in the water, and he continued to cheer him with a <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel himself, nobly refusing to the last to separate their fortunes.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} {{nothing could be}} craving upon him, that he left no room for it; that I <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not give merely to avoid the trouble of being importuned.
