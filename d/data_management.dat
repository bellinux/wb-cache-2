Desktop computers were brought into the classrooms to teach math, language arts, music, art, and computer programming, in 1978.

40|$|First of all, several <b>data</b> version <b>management</b> {{strategies}} in software transactional memory {{have been studied}} in this paper, and both advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. Then a novel <b>data</b> version <b>management</b> strategy named Foresight in software transactional memory is put forward. Its design idea and detailed implementation is given. And its performance is tested in RSTM. The results show that as a <b>data</b> version <b>management</b> strategy Foresight has lower abort rate than any other <b>data</b> version <b>management</b> strategy. As we known, the low abort rate is beneficial to improve system performance. So the <b>data</b> version <b>management</b> strategy Foresight can help improve the whole performance of the software transactional memory system...|$|R

5|$|Roguelike {{games were}} {{initially}} developed for computing environments with limited memory, including shared mainframe systems and early home computers; this limitation prevented developers from retaining {{all but a}} few dungeon levels in memory while the game was running, leading to procedural generation to avoid the memory storage issue. Roguelikes were also often written in languages like BASIC, which are not as efficient in memory and <b>data</b> <b>management</b> compared to modern languages, further limiting the scope the game could cover.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the {{settlement}} agreement, or consent decree, were released on May 26, 2015.

The agreement is not an admission or evidence of liability, nor is it an admission by the city, CDP, or its officers and employees that they have engaged in unconstitutional, illegal, or otherwise improper activities or conduct. Pending approval from a federal judge, the consent decree will be implemented and the agreement is binding.|$|E
5|$|A free {{version was}} {{introduced}} {{for students in}} 2010. SAS Social Media Analytics, a tool for social media monitoring, engagement and sentiment analysis, was also released that year. SAS Rapid Predictive Modeler (RPM), which creates basic analytical models using Microsoft Excel, was introduced that same year. JMP 9 in 2010 added a new interface for using the R programming language from JMP and an add-in for Excel. The following year, a High Performance Computing appliance was made available in a partnership with Teradata and EMC Greenplum. In 2011, the company released Enterprise Miner 7.1. The company introduced 27 <b>data</b> <b>management</b> products from October 2013 to October 2014 and updates to 160 others. At the 2015 SAS Global Forum, it announced several new products that were specialized for different industries, {{as well as new}} training software.|$|E

40|$|Just as {{rules have}} been {{developed}} to measure how well a <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> system conforms to the relational model, the desirable characteristics of a spatial <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> system can be specified. Spatial <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> systems must meet the requirements of conventional <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> systems as well as provide special facilities to handle spatial data. Characteristics such as the independent handling of feature, attribute, topology, and coordinate data and the support for alternative geometric representations are desired. This set of characteristics serves not only as criteria for evaluating existing systems, but also as input for future system design...|$|R
40|$|General {{capabilities}} of <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> technology are described. Information requirements {{posed by the}} space station life cycle are discussed, and it is asserted that <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> technology supporting engineering/manufacturing in a heterogeneous hardware/data base management system environment should be applied to meeting these requirements. Today's commercial systems do not satisfy all of these requirements. The features of an R&D <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> system being developed to investigate <b>data</b> base <b>management</b> in the engineering/manufacturing environment are discussed. Features of this system represent only a partial solution to space station requirements. Areas where this system should be extended to meet full space station information management requirements are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal <b>data</b> <b>management</b> problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Orbital Segment {{contains}} the <b>Data</b> <b>Management</b> System, which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control (ROS GNC) {{for the entire}} station. Initially, Zarya, the first module of the station, controlled the station until a short time after the Russian service module Zvezda docked and was transferred control. Zvezda {{contains the}} ESA built DMS-R <b>Data</b> <b>Management</b> System. Using two fault-tolerant computers (FTC), Zvezda computes the station's position and orbital trajectory using redundant Earth horizon sensors, Solar horizon sensors as well as Sun and star trackers. The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting.|$|E
