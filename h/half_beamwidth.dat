40|$|A {{parabolic}} dish microphone {{is like a}} mirror telescope for sound. A parabolic reflector is used to collect and focus sound waves to a microphone receiver [1, 2]. The parabolic shape has the property that all sound waves impinging parallel to the central axis of the dish are reflected to its focus point. When the dish is aimed at a distant sound source {{it is safe to}} assume that all the sound waves from the source to the dish are parallel to the central axis of the dish. Therefore, a sensitive microphone placed at the focus point will receive an enhanced signal level due to the acoustic energy arriving over the entire aperture of the dish. Since the dish microphone is effective in enhancing sounds from distant objects, it is often used to obtain the sound of animal vocalizations and other nature recordings [1]. This paper describes several theoretical and practical aspects of a conventional {{parabolic dish}} microphone system. 1 Computation of Dish Microphone Parameters In this section we consider the computation of some important theoretical parameters of the dish microphone. 1. 1 Parabolic Dish Gain The inherent acoustical gain of a dish microphone {{is similar to that of}} a dish antenna since the wave physics are essentially the same.
