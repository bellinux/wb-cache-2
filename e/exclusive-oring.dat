40|$|RAID 5 tolerates {{single disk}} {{failures}} by <b>exclusive-ORing</b> (XORing) the blocks corresponding to a requested block on the failed disk to reconstruct it. This results in increased loads on surviving disks and degraded disk response times {{with respect to}} normal mode operation. Provided a spare disk is available, a rebuild process systematically reads successive disk tracks, XORs them to recreate lost tracks and writes them onto a spare disk, thus returning the system to its original state. Rebuild time is important since RAID 5 disk arrays with a single disk failure are susceptible to data loss if a second disk fails. According to the vacationing server model (VSM), rebuild read requests on surviving disks are given a lower priority than external user requests, so as to have less impact on their response time. Given that disk loads are balanced due to striping, rebuild time can be approximated by the time to read the contents of {{any one of the}} surviving disks. The analysis of the M/G/ 1 queueing model of VSM, given in this article, is more accurate and yet simpler than a previous analysis, but it also takes into account the effect of disk zoning explicitly. We also present a heuristic method to estimate rebuild time, which can be combined with the new analysis. The ability to quickly and accurately estimate rebuild time is useful in computing the reliability of RAID 5 systems, especially during design tradeoff studies. The accuracy of the various analyses to estimate rebuild time are checked against detailed simulation results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{first step}} in the {{verification}} of cryptographic protocols is to decide the intruder deduction problem, that is the vulnerability to a passive attacker. We extend the Dolev-Yao model in order to model this problem in presence of the equational theory of a commutative encryption operator which distributes over the <b>exclusive-or</b> operator. These operators are frequently used in cryptographic protocols. For in-stance the well-known RSA encryption is a commutative encryption, and the <b>exclusive-or</b> is used in several cryptographic protocols. The interac-tion between the commutative distributive law of the encryption and <b>exclusive-or</b> offers more possibilities to decrypt an encrypted message than in the non-commutative case.

The most successful methods to verify such protocols are based on rewriting techniques and automated deduction in order to implement or mimic the process calculus describing the execution of a protocol. We are interested in the intruder deduction problem, that is the vulnerability to passive attacks, in presence of the theory of an encryption operator which distributes over the <b>exclusive-or.</b> This equational theory describes very common properties of cryptographic primitives. Solutions to the intruder deduction problem modulo an equational theory are known for the cases of <b>exclusive-or,</b> of Abelian groups, of a homomorphism symbol alone, and of combinations of these theories. In this paper we consider the case where the encryption distributes over <b>exclusive-or.</b> The interaction of the distributive law of the encryption with the cancellation law of <b>exclusive-or</b> leads to a much more complex decision problem. We prove decidability of the intruder deduction problem for an encryption which distributes over <b>exclusive-or</b> with an EXPTIME procedure and we give a PTIME decision procedure relying on prefix rewrite systems for a restricted case, the binary case...|$|R
