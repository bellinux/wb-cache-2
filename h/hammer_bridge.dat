50|$|During the First World War {{the railway}} network {{was at the}} heart of Germany's Lightning war {{strategy}} to attack France through Belgium. After the war on the western front staggered to a military stalemate, the cross border <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge</b> route incorporating the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge</b> remained critical both for supplying fresh troops and munitions to the western front, and for the return home of casualties and exhausted troops. In 1915 work began on a second route across the frontier with Belgium, crossing the Geul a few kilometres to the west at Moresnet, in order to make the logistics of the military operation less vulnerable to congestion at and around the old frontier station at Herbesthal. After the war ended in 1918, the victorious powers imposed a frontier change whereby Eupen-Malmedy, a strip of land between Aachen and Luxembourg, was transferred from Germany to Belgium. The amount of land involved was only 1,036 km² (roughly 5% of the size of Wales, or less than half the size of Long Island) but it included the piece of mainline railway incorporating the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge,</b> which would be strategically vital in the event of any future war involving a German attempt to invade Belgium by rail. The <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge</b> was now in Belgium.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{is part of}} {{the railway}} line {{constructed}} in the 1840s to link the rapidly industrialising Ruhr region in western Prussia with the recently constructed Belgian rail network. The bridge was designed by Chief Construction Director G. Moller from Darmstadt, and construction onsite was managed by Engineer F. Wittfeldt. Work began in 1841 on a double viaduct, entirely of brick construction, across the River Geul [...] The lower half of the viaduct consisted of 13 arches, placed above which were 17 similarly sized arches, of which two at each end were placed on low abutments rather than arches. Until 1897 the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge</b> was the highest railway viaduct in what had, by that time, become the unified German state.|$|E

50|$|Competing for {{firewood}} with glassmakers {{were the}} ironmasters, using continental {{technology in the}} Tudor and Stuart periods, to smelt iron from locally dug ironstone in water powered blast furnaces. The streams fed by springs on Blackdown were dammed to drive waterwheels which worked large twin bellows. Other waterwheels drove large forge hammers which converted the pig iron into wrought iron. There was a furnace north of Frith Wood and a forge hammer by <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge</b> at Mitchell Park.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} sited {{directly}} {{to the south of}} Hergernrath and 5 km (3 miles) {{to the north of the}} point where in the world's first international frontier railway station would open, in 1843, at Herbesthal. It was also in 1843, on 15 October, that the first train crossed the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Bridge,</b> en route from Aachen to Hegernrath. Just two days later a train ran through from Aachen to Verviers in Belgium: Verviers already had a rail connection to Liege, which meant that from 17 October 1843 the bridge was able to fulfill its role as a link on the route connecting the industrial regions of Prussia and Belgium. This bridge was 206.5 m long between abutments and 8.47 m wide. It was 37.7 m above the river, which here corresponded with the valley's deepest point. Construction of the viaduct used more than 8 million bricks and cost 2.5 million Prussian Thalers.|$|E

50|$|In some levels, Lolo {{can obtain}} certain powers to help him. These powers include the <b>Hammer,</b> the <b>Bridge,</b> and the Arrow Turn (sometimes called a One-Way Pass). To obtain a power, Lolo must collect {{a certain amount}} of hearts, which is pre-defined in the data for any level that gives a power. This value varies from level to level. The maximum amount of powers a level can have is three. If the next heart to be {{collected}} will give Lolo a power, all hearts in the room will flash as an indicator.|$|R
5000|$|Pianos {{can have}} upwards of 12,000 {{individual}} parts, supporting six functional features: keyboard, <b>hammers,</b> dampers, <b>bridge,</b> soundboard, and strings. Many {{parts of a}} piano are made of materials selected for strength and longevity. This {{is especially true of}} the outer rim. It is most commonly made of hardwood, typically hard maple or beech, and its massiveness serves as an essentially immobile object from which the flexible soundboard can best vibrate. According to Harold A. Conklin, the purpose of a sturdy rim is so that, [...] "... the vibrational energy will stay as much as possible in the soundboard instead of dissipating uselessly in the case parts, which are inefficient radiators of sound." ...|$|R

Domino followed Deadpool to Rumekistan, where she assassinated the country's dictator, Flag-Smasher, only to find out it was part of a plan to install Cable as leader of that nation. After a conversation with Citizen V, she then attempted to kill Cable, believing that he would lead them to ruin.|$|R

25|$|The Guards Brigade joined Lieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen's 5,000 raid on New Jersey on 7 June 1780. Mathew {{was one of}} six brigade commanders {{employed}} on the expedition. After {{the initial}} attack stalled, the British-Hessian force lunged forward again on 23 June to bring on the Battle of Springfield. While Knyphausen <b>hammered</b> at Springfield <b>Bridge,</b> he sent Mathew with half his force in a flanking move via Vauxhall Bridge. Colonel Israel Angell's 2nd Rhode Island Regiment held back Knyphausen's column for 40 minutes as Brigadier General William Maxwell and Major Light Horse Harry Lee delayed Mathew's envelopment. At length, Major General Nathanael Greene had to commit additional troops to block Mathew's turning movement. In the face of strong resistance, Knyphausen called off the operation {{in the afternoon and}} returned to Staten Island. Mathew left North America for England later in 1780.|$|R
5000|$|A {{committee}} of {{was established in}} 1923, funded jointly by the UK government and the railway companies, to carry out investigations in {{to the effects of}} <b>hammer</b> blow on <b>bridges.</b> The committee under chairmanship of the physicist Sir James Alfred Ewing consisted primarily of railway civil engineers, but Sir Henry Fowler, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London Midland and Scottish Railway was also later invited to join.Among the results was a better understanding of hammer blow and the effects of oscillations in both locomotive springs and bridges. One immediate impact of the investigations was an easing of the axle-load limit for locomotives with both inside and outside cylinders from 20 LT to 22 LT. This enabled successful new designs such as the GWR 6000 Class and the fitting of larger [...] boilers to Gresley A1 class.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of voicing the string instruments {{is well known}} among performers, musicians and violinmakers. Voicing provokes changes in mechanical and acoustical behavior of the sound chest. As a consequence of these changes, the propagation way of mechanical and acoustical propagation in the instrument is different. In this paper the acoustical parameters related to damping, e. g. the loss factor, have been measured in a cello {{before and after the}} voicing of the instrument carried out by the performer, a student of the Faculty of Cultural Musical Heritage Preservation of the University of Bologna. From the measured impulse responses, a slight difference in the propagation of the mechanical wave has been found particularly among the chest, close up to the bridge and to the neck. As a check of the results, also some measurements of driving-point impedance at the bridge, excited in different points, have been carried out, by using a head-impedance <b>hammer,</b> on the <b>bridge...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{collisions}} with bridge piers {{can result}} in significant damage to the support pier and potentially lead to catastrophic failure of the whole structure. The Nation’s aging infrastructure suggests that many structures no longer meet current design standards, placing many bridge susceptible to failure if subjected to an extreme loading event. This research aims to study the structural response of reinforced concrete bridge piers subjected to vehicle collisions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to observe the causes of shear and bending failures of bridge piers subjected to vehicle collision. Parameters, such as pier diameter, transverse reinforcement spacing, vehicle impact velocity, pile cap height, and multi-pier configuration, are investigated in this study. The finite element code LS-DYNA is utilized to simulate and analyze the vehicle collisions to obtain accurate and detailed results. The vehicle models offered by the National Crash Analysis Center and the National Transportation Research Center, Inc. are used to conduct this research. The finite element modeling controls and material properties are validated by conducting an impact drop <b>hammer</b> experiment. The <b>bridge</b> pier collision models are validated by comparing vehicle damage and impact forces with published research results. Conservation of energy is also checked to assure stability within the impact simulation. A sensitivity analysis suggests that different pier parameters {{have a profound effect}} on failure modes and distribution of impact forces. Piers with large stiffness result in high impact forces, low lateral displacements, and high resistance to shear forces and bending moments. A performance-based analysis shows that bridge piers can be designed using damage ratios associated with particular damage states...|$|R
40|$|Structures may be {{subjected}} to damage and deterioration over different time scales and monitoring their health status may allow to perform maintenance actions before the functionality limit is reached. Masonry arch bridges, in particular, {{are sensitive to the}} bearings loss produced by scour of the streambed soil at the pier foundations. In this study we measured the changes in the elastic properties of a 1 : 2 scaled model of a masonry arch bridge built in laboratory to study the evolution of the damage mechanism related to the application of foundation movements. Specifically, the bridge is realized to model the effect of erosion of the ground underneath the central pier. We analysed the accelerometric records acquired along the structure generated by a sledge <b>hammer</b> hitting the <b>bridge</b> walls. We used the method of coda wave interferometry to detect the changes in the elastic properties of the medium. After selecting the specific frequency band exciting coda waves, we progressively measured the time lag between signals acquired in the intact and two damaged stages of the bridge for each source-receiver couple and we fit the data to get the relative wave velocity changes. We found that the average relative velocity changes for the two different damaged steps are v/v = - 5. 08 ± 0. 08 % and v/v = - 8. 2 ± 0. 6 %, consistently measured at all the analysed source-receiver couples. These values correspond to an average estimation of the velocity changes occurred within the structure, because the associated wavelengths are comparable with the bridge size and the damage is spread over {{a large portion of the}} structur...|$|R
