25|$|A {{study done}} by Schindler and colleagues {{examined}} {{the use of}} neck muscle vibration on the contralesional posterior neck muscles to induce diversion of <b>gaze</b> <b>from</b> the subjective straight ahead. Subjects received 15 consecutive treatment sessions and were evaluated on {{different aspects of the}} neglect disorder including perception of midline, and scanning deficits. The study found that there is evidence that neck muscle stimulation may work, especially if combined with visual scanning techniques. The improvement was evident 2 months after the completion of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Rome was now {{the undisputed}} {{mistress}} of the Western Mediterranean, and turned her <b>gaze</b> <b>from</b> defeated Carthage to the Hellenistic world. Small Roman forces had already been engaged in the First Macedonian War, when, in 214 BC, a fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus had successfully thwarted Philip V from invading Illyria with his newly built fleet. The rest {{of the war was}} carried out mostly by Rome's allies, the Aetolian League and later the Kingdom of Pergamon, but a combined Roman-Pergamene fleet of ca. 60 ships patrolled the Aegean until the war's end in 205 BC. In this conflict, Rome, still embroiled in the Punic War, was not interested in expanding her possessions, but rather in thwarting the growth of Philip's power in Greece. The war ended in an effective stalemate, and was renewed in 201 BC, when Philip V invaded Asia Minor. A naval battle off Chios ended in a costly victory for the Pergamene-Rhodian alliance, but the Macedonian fleet lost many warships, including its flagship, a deceres. Soon after, Pergamon and Rhodes appealed to Rome for help, and the Republic was drawn into the Second Macedonian War. In view of the massive Roman naval superiority, the war was fought on land, with the Macedonian fleet, already weakened at Chios, not daring to venture out of its anchorage at Demetrias. After the crushing Roman victory at Cynoscephalae, the terms imposed on Macedon were harsh, and included the complete disbandment of her navy.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{interest}} in female characters, Kon stated that female characters were easier to write {{because he is not}} able to know the character {{in the same way as}} a male character, and [...] "can project my obsession onto the characters and expand the aspects I want to describe." [...] With a frame of reference up to Tokyo Godfathers, Susan J. Napier notes that while the theme of performance is the one obvious commonality in his works, she finds that the concept of the male gaze is the more important topic for discussion. Napier shows the evolution of Kon's use of the <b>gaze</b> <b>from</b> its restrictive and negative aspects in Magnetic Rose and Perfect Blue, to a collaborative gaze in Millennium Actress before arriving at a new type of gaze in Tokyo Godfathers which revels in uncertainty and illusion.|$|E

60|$|After {{having made}} a first false move, which {{separated}} us about three {{yards from the}} wharf--inducing the wearied friends on shore to brighten up and smile, and kiss hands, and wave kerchiefs, with that energy of decision which usually marks a really final farewell--our steamer remained in that position for full half an hour, during which period we <b>gazed</b> <b>from</b> the bulwarks, and our friends <b>gazed</b> <b>from</b> under their dripping umbrellas across the now impassable gulf in mute resignation.|$|R
