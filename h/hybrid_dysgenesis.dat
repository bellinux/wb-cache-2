40|$|Individual P {{elements}} that were genetically isolated from wild-type strains were tested for {{their abilities to}} repress two aspects of <b>hybrid</b> dysgenesis: gonadal <b>dysgenesis</b> and mutability of a double-P element-insertion allele of the singed locus (sn(w)). These elements were also characterized by Southern blotting, polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing. Three of the elements were 1. 1 -kb KP elements, one was a 1. 2 -kb element called D 50, and one was a 0. 5 -kb element called SP. These three types of elements could encode polypeptides of 207, 204, and 14 amino acids, respectively. Gonadal dysgenesis was repressed {{by two of the}} KP elements (denoted KP(1) and KP(6)) and by SP, but not by the third KP element (KP(D)), nor by D 50. Repression of gonadal dysgenesis was mediated by a maternal effect, or by a combination of zygotic and maternal effects generated by the P elements themselves. The mutability of sn(w) was repressed by the KP(1) and KP(6) elements, by D 50 and by SP, but not by KP(D); however, the SP element repressed sn(w) mutability only when the transposase came from complete P elements and the D 50 element repressed it only when the transposase came from the modified P element known as Δ 2 - 3. In all cases, repression of sn(w) mutability appeared to be mediated by a zygotic effect of the isolated P element. Each of the isolated elements was also tested for its ability to suppress the phenotype of a P-insertion mutation of the vestigial locus (vg(21 - 3)). D 50 was a moderate suppressor whereas SP and the three KP elements had little or no effect. These results indicate that each isolated P element had its own profile of repression and suppression abilities. It is suggested that these abilities may be mediated by P-encoded polypeptides or by antisense P RNAs initiated from external genomic promoters...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{and genetic}} {{analysis}} has revealed a specific P factor deletion derivative (the KP element) which {{is able to}} repress P-induced <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> All naturally occurring strains lacking the P cytotype (M') that were examined, throughout the world contain up to 30 copies of KP per haploid genome together with complete P factors.

Genetic crosses show that KP elements preferentially accumulate in the presence of P factors and suppress <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> Suppression is transmitted through both sexes and is thus distinct from the maternally transmitted P cytotype mode of suppression.

40|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> in Drosophila is a {{syndrome}} of gonadal atrophy, sterility, {{and male}} recombination, and {{it occurs in}} the progeny of crosses between males that harbor certain transposable elements (TEs) and females that lack them. Known examples of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> in Drosophila melanogaster result from mobilization of individual families of TEs, such as the P element, the I element, or hobo. An example of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> in Drosophila virilis is unique in that multiple, unrelated families of TEs become mobilized, but a TE designated Penelope appears {{to play a major}} role. In all known examples of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> the paternal germ line transmits the TEs in an active state, whereas the female germ line maintains repression of the TEs. The mechanism of maternal maintenance of repression is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the molecular machinery of RNA interference may function as an important host defense against TEs. This protection is mediated by the action of endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) composed of dsRNA molecules of 21 - 25 nt that can target complementary transcripts for destruction. In this paper, we demonstrate that endogenous siRNA derived from the Penelope element is maternally loaded in embryos through the female germ line in D. virilis.

40|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> is a {{condition}} found in certain interstrain hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster caused by the interaction of chromosomal and cytoplasmic factors. Germ-line abnormalities, including sterility, high mutability and male recombination, appear in the affected individuals. There {{are at least two}} distinct systems of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> We examined a Wisconsin wild population in two consecutive years to determine the distribution of the chromosomal P factor and the extrachromosomal M cytotype that together cause one kind of hybrid dysgenic sterility. The P factor was found to be very common in the population, with all three major chromosomes being polymorphic for it. This polymorphism was strongly correlated with variability for male recombination elements, suggesting that these two traits are part of the same system of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> There was a slight tendency for the P factor to be lost in lines taken from this population and inbred in the laboratory for many generations. A large-scale search for the M cytotype, which causes susceptibility to the P factor, showed that it is present in the population at only very low frequencies. Further evidence that the population is mostly immune to the action of the P factor was our finding of a general lack of dysgenic sterility in the wild flies themselves. However, we were able to isolate several wild strains that consistently showed the M cytotype. In some cases, the frequency of the M cytotype could be maintained in these lines, but it could not usually be increased by artificial selection.

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) {{are virtually}} ubiquitous components of genomes, yet they often impose significant fitness consequences on their hosts.

These latter fitness costs are often assumed to be dosage-dependent, with stronger effects occurring {{in the presence of}} higher TE copy numbers. We test this assumption in Drosophila melanogaster by considering the relationship between the copy number of two active DNA transposons, P-element and hobo element, and the incidence of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> a sterility syndrome associated with transposon activity in the germline. By harnessing a subset of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a group of fully-sequenced D. melanogaster strains, we describe quantitative and structural variation in P-elements and hobo elements among wild-derived genomes and associate these factors with <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> We find that the incidence of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> is associated with both P-element and hobo element copy number in a dosage-dependent manner.

We present evidence that at least four of the traits are not found in nonhybrids. Therefore we have proposed the name <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> to describe this syndrome. —A partition of tested strains into two types, designated P and M, was made according to the paternal or maternal contribution required to produce <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> This classification seems to hold for crosses of strains from within the United States and Australia, {{as well as for}} crosses between strains from the two countries. Strains collected recently from natural populations are typically of the P type and those having a long laboratory history are generally of the M type. However, a group of six strains collected from the wild in the 1960 's are unambiguously divided equally between the P and M types. The dichotomy of this latter group raises interesting questions concerning possible implications for speciation. —Temperature often has a critical effect on the manifestation of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> High F 1 developmental temperatures tend to increase the expression of sterility, sometimes to extreme levels.

The three populations could not be statistically differentiated from one another, but were easily distinguished from populations from Australia and Wisconsin {{on the basis of}} gonadal dysgenesis potential. The California populations had higher levels of M cytotype than did the Wisconsin population. Thirteen X chromosomes and 11 pairs of autosomes were extracted from one of the California populations, using a modification of the standard balancer chromosome technique to suppress <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> during extraction. All lines produced strongly skewed sterility distributions in crosses to M-strain females, and mean levels of sterility were less than 50 %. There was evidence of nonadditive interactions between the autosomes. Most extraction lines had the P cytotype, but M and intermediate cytotypes were observed. Some of the intermediate cytotypes were stable over time. Lines were tested at two different times after extraction. Some lines evolved higher sterility potential as they were kept in the laboratory, even in the presence of P cytotype.

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{female and male}} {{sterility}} were observed among the hybrids {{from one of the}} two reciprocal crosses between a wild strain of D. melanogaster known as π 2 and laboratory strains. The sterility, which is part of a common syndrome called <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> was found {{to be associated with the}} rudimentary condition of one or both of the ovaries or testes. All other tissues, including those of the reproductive system were normal, as were longevity and mating behavior. The morphological details of the sterility closely mimic the agametic condition occurring when germ cells are destroyed by irradiation or by the maternal-effect mutation, grandchildless. We suggest that sterility in <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> is also caused by failure in the early development of germ cells. There is a thermo-sensitive period beginning at approximately the time of initiation of mitosis among primordial germ cells a few hours before the egg hatches and ending during the early larval stages. Our results suggest that <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> which also includes male recombination, mutation and other traits, may be limited to the germ line, and that each of the primordial germ cells develops, or fails to develop, independently of the others. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed frequencies of unilateral and bilateral sterility, with the shape of the thermosensitivity curves and with the fact that males are less often sterile than females. The features of this intraspecific hybrid sterility are found to resemble those seen in some interspecific Drosophila hybrids, especially those from the cross D. melanogaster x D. simulans...|$|E
40|$|The Triplo-lethal locus (Tpl) {{is unique}} in its dosage sensitivity; no other locus in Drosophila has been {{identified}} that is lethal when present in three doses. Tpl is also haplo-lethal, and its function is still a mystery.

We recovered 19 new duplications of Tpl, 15 hypomorphic mutations of Tpl (a previously rare class of mutation), and no null mutations. Surprisingly, 14 of the 15 hypomorphic alleles have no detectable P element sequences at the locus. The difficulty in recovering null mutations in Tpl suggests that it may be a complex locus, perhaps consisting of several genes with redundant functions. The relative ease with which we recovered hypomorphic alleles is in sharp contrast to previous attempts by others to mutagenize Tpl.

40|$|In mammals, {{the most}} {{frequently}} observed <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> effects are growth disturbances and male sterility. Profound defects in placental development have been described and our work on hybrids in genus Mus has demonstrated putative <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> effects that lead to defects in lipid homeostasis and maternal behavior. Interestingly, mammalian interspecies hybrids exhibit strong parent-of-origin effects in that offspring of reciprocal matings, even though genetically identical, frequently exhibit reciprocal phenotypes. Recent studies have provided strong link between epigenetic regulation and growth, behavior and placental development. Widespread disruption of genomic imprinting has been described in hybrids between closely related species of the genus Peromyscus. The studies presented in this thesis aim to investigate the effects of disrupted epigenetics states on altered growth, female infanticide and placental dysplasia observed in Mus hybrids. We showed that loss-of-imprinting (LOI) of a paternally expressed gene, Peg 1, was correlated with increased body weight of F 1 hybrids. Furthermore, we investigated whether LOI of Peg 1 in F 1 females would interfere with maternal behavior. A subset of F 1 females indeed exhibited highly abnormal maternal behavior in that they rapidly attacked and killed the pups. By microarray hybridization, {{a large number of}} differentially expressed genes in the infanticidal females as compared to normally behaving females were identified. In addtion to Peg 1 LOI, we studied allelic expression of numerous imprinted genes in adult Mus interspecies hybrids. In contrast to the study from Peromyscus, patterns of LOI were not consistent with a direct influence of altered expression levels of imprinted genes on growth. Finally, we investigated the allelic interaction between an X-linked locus and a paternally expressed gene, Peg 3, in placental defects in Mus hybrids. This study further strengthened the notion that divergent genetic and epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> in diverse groups of mammals...|$|E

40|$|An {{inbred line}} of the M' strain Muller- 5 Birmingham was studied for its {{abilities}} to affect P-M <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> This strain possesses 57 P elements, {{all of which are}} apparently defective in the production of the P transposase. In combination with transposase-producing elements, these nonautonomous elements can enhance or diminish the incidence of <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> depending on the trait that is studied. Dysgenic flies that have one or more paternally-derived chromosomes with these elements partially repress the instability of the P element insertion mutation, sn w; however, such flies have elevated frequencies of another dysgenic trait, GD sterility, and also show distorted segregation ratios. An explanation is presented in which all of these phenomena are unified as manifestations of the kinetics of P element activation in the germ line. The progeny of Muller- 5 Birmingham females exhibit partial repression of both sn w instability and GD sterility. This repression appears to involve a factor that can be transmitted maternally through at least two generations. This mode of repression therefore conforms to the pattern of inheritance of the P cytotype, the condition that brings about nearly total repression of P element activity in some strains. Models in which this repression could arise from the nonautonomous P elements of Muller- 5 Birmingham are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{a classic}} example of the {{invasion}} of a species by a selfish genetic element, the P-element was horizontally transferred from a distantly related species into Drosophila melanogaster. Despite causing 'hybrid dysgenesis', a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes that include sterility, the P-element spread globally {{in the course of a}} few decades in D. melanogaster. Until recently, its sister species, including D. simulans, remained P-element free. Here, we find a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years; a survey of 181 strains shows that around 20 % of strains induce <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we show that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element. To characterize this invasion temporally and geographically, we survey 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element. We find that the D. simulans P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Importantly, as evidenced by their resistance to the <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> phenotype, strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element...|$|E
40|$|Mobile P {{elements}} in Drosophila melanogaster cause <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> if their mobility is not repressed. One type of repression, termed P cytotype, {{is a complex}} interaction between chromosomes carrying P elements and cytoplasm and is transmitted through the cytoplasm only of females. Another type of repression is found in worldwide M' strains that contain approximately 30 copies per individual of one particular P element deletion-derivative termed the KP element. This repression is transmitted equally through both sexes. In the present study we show that biparentally transmitted repression increases in magnitude together with a rapid increase in KP copy-number in genotypes starting with {{one or a few}} KP elements and no other deletion-derivatives. Such correlated increases in repression and KP number per genome occur only in the presence of complete P elements, supporting the interpretation that they are probably a consequence of the selective advantage enjoyed by flies carrying the highest numbers of KP elements. Analysis of Q strains also reveals the presence of qualitative differences in the way the repression of dysgenesis is transmitted. In general, Q strains not containing KP elements have the P cytotype mode of repression, whereas Q strains with KP elements transmit repression through both sexes. This difference among Q strains further supports the existence of at least two types of repression of P-induced <b>hybrid</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> in natural populations of D. melanogaster...|$|E
