The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E
5|$|To impress Marge, Homer {{joins the}} debate team, of which Marge is a member. At a debate, Homer {{finds out that}} Marge is more {{interested}} in the more articulate Artie Ziff. Therefore, Homer pretends to be a French student so that he can be tutored by Marge and when Homer asks Marge to the senior prom she accepts. However, when Homer confesses that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> French student, Marge is furious at him for making her lose sleep for a debate tournament the next morning. She ultimately loses to Artie, who asks her to be his partner to the prom; she agrees. Homer does not realize that Marge has changed her plans, and so he shows up at her house for prom night to pick her up. Moments later Artie shows up, causing confusion to Marge's family, and a despondent Homer leaves. Undaunted, he decides to go to the prom alone.|$|E

[...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> 'solo' album.

500|$|Radiant Dawn holds a {{score of}} 78/100 on the review {{aggregator}} Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. GameSpot's Lark Anderson noted that, although players can save mid-battle, the difficulty [...] "will easily overwhelm even experienced tacticians." [...] Eurogamer's Keza MacDonald appreciated the depth and refinement of the game, but proceeded to note a lack of accessibility due to greater complication and difficulty as Radiant Dawn progresses. Some reviewers were also critical of the developers' choice {{not to use the}} Wii's motion controls, although RPGamer's Bryan Boulette commented that [...] "the game thankfully delivers a traditional experience that isn't changed {{just for the sake of}} changing it." [...] In general, critics praised the gameplay system recognized in previous Fire Emblem games, but noted that the game felt too similar to its GameCube predecessor, with ONMs Chandra Nair commenting that Radiant Dawn has [...] "refused to move forward." [...] Hypers Yuri Spadeface commends the game for its [...] "deep strategy and for being hard". However, he criticises it for being [...] "unforgiving", noting that it features [...] "permanent death and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> Wii game".|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's why I {{came up with the idea}} of the glove. Obviously an enema <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> glove type of thing. I thought it was a good visual."

500|$|The {{script was}} written by Jerry Gracio, {{influenced}} by the poem The Hound of Heaven, and won first prize at the scriptwriting competition hosted by the Film Development Council of the Philippines in 2000. This {{attracted the attention of}} Laurice Guillen, who bought the script (the first time in her career that she had done so) and signed on to direct the eventual film. The script was brought to Star Cinema, who became interested in producing it, but production stalled due to difficulties finding an appropriate actress to play Malen. Guillen stated that [...] "Since she was a Magdalene, she had to be sexy but she also had to be much more than that....I was shown many sexy actresses, some of them name stars, but I couldn't find my Santa-Santita. I felt that the role should go to someone relatively new, who had no fixed image, so {{that there would be no}} expectations". An additional problem was over the religious content of the film, which met with controversy. Guillen eventually found Angelica Panganiban to play Malen, and after five years without production, work on the film began for Unitel Pictures International, whose CEO stated that [...] "the majority of Filipinos, the so-called masses, are not the targets of this movie. Those who frequent the cineplexes and look for fresh material in the movies are". The title, Santa Santita, translates as [...] "saint who <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> saint".|$|E
