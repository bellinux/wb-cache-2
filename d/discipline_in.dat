5|$|Henry left Monaco in January 1999, {{one year}} before his {{intimate}} and closest teammate David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian Serie A club Juventus for £10.5million.

5|$|In the 1940s and 50s, {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} {{from a variety of}} fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain.

5|$|Musical {{instrument}} classification is a <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> its own right, and many systems of classification {{have been used}} over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses {{the means by which}} they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.|$|E

5|$|A death {{sentence}} {{had to be}} passed unanimously, and confirmed in writing by various officers as the verdict passed up the chain of command. A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals {{tended to be more}} concerned with the type of offence and the state of <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E
5|$|At {{culturally}} conservative BYU, Romney remained {{isolated from}} {{much of the}} upheaval of that era. He {{became president of the}} Cougar Club booster organization and showed a new-found <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> his studies. During his senior year, he took a leave of absence to work as driver and advance man for eventually unsuccessful Senate campaign of his mother, Lenore Romney; together, they visited all 83Michigan counties. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English with highest honors in 1971, giving commencement addresses to both the College of Humanities and to the whole of BYU.|$|E

5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, once owned by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‘La Bagatelle’. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars ‘John Downie’ and ‘James Grieve’. Today, the zoo {{has one of the}} most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France.|$|E
5|$|In early 1940, No. 605 (County of Warwick) Squadron {{moved to}} RAF Drem, as they {{converted}} to Hurricanes. McKellar {{was transferred to}} No. 605 and promoted to flight lieutenant, assuming the responsibilities of a flight leader on 21 June 1940. McKellar imposed strict discipline, both in standard of dress {{on the ground and}} in tactical <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> the air. Despite his strict methods McKellar was held in high regard. His popularity arose from his desire to help mould his unit into a well-disciplined fighting team.|$|E

5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped {{and made}} his way to Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express their concern. Montgomery saw this as a challenge to his authority and this, along with the lack of <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> the army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E

5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force in November 1941 in the artillery. He was sent to Warwick Farm, then on the western {{outskirts}} of Sydney, for training. A non-conformist known for being forthright, Fingleton did not enjoy military <b>discipline.</b> <b>In</b> May 1942, he went AWOL from his post at Double Bay {{on the shores of}} Sydney Harbour to visit his wife. As a result, he was missing when a Japanese midget submarine launched an attack in the harbour. Soon after, he was deployed to Townsville in northern Queensland in anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, which never materialised. He was then transferred to the Press Relations unit. There he did work in intelligence analysis and censorship.|$|E

In March 2007, Neuner won the pursuit and mass start races at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway, and she won the sprint and pursuit events at the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, giving her seven career World Cup wins. She ended her first complete season fourth in the Overall World Cup standings and finished second in the pursuit <b>discipline.</b> <b>In</b> the course of three months, Neuner had emerged from anonymity to become one of Germany's most popular female athletes. At the end of 2007, she had earned an estimated 1.3million euros through sponsorship and endorsement deals.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E

5|$|In 1530 Vermigli was {{appointed}} vicar {{of the monastery}} at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so he could read the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Hutton, now General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces, sent Chauvel to South Australia to organise {{the light}} horse regiments there. On {{returning}} to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He {{was promoted to}} the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff in London was blocked by Hutton's successor Major General Charles Hoad. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas {{on the nature of}} mounted infantry. He recommended that Australian troops improve their <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation.|$|E
5|$|In a Hindu {{caste system}} that was conspicuously present, Brahmins enjoyed a privileged {{position}} as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning {{with the exception of}} a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and <b>discipline</b> <b>in</b> local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (Panchayat).|$|E
