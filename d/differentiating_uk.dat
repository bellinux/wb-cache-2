The activity {{is located in}} Scotland, which forms one distinctive part of the increasingly <b>differentiated</b> <b>UK</b> higher education environment. Following {{a brief description of}} the types of organisations involved in partnership working, there is a brief reflection on the nature of partnership, and how policy and funding drivers in a national context shape and provide opportunities for innovative practice. Four selected case studies are provided to illustrate the development of Open Educational Practice and the paper concludes with some provisional thoughts on the distinctiveness and generalisability of these forms of practice. ...|$|R

However, {{little is known}} about the temporal patterns of population structure for these species. Here, we apply Bayesian inference and data from ancient DNA to assess the structure and dynamics of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) populations in the coastal waters of the UK. We show that regional population structure in UK waters is consistent with earlier studies suggesting local habitat dependence for this species in the Mediterranean Sea and North Atlantic. One genetically <b>differentiated</b> <b>UK</b> population went extinct at least 100 years ago and has not been replaced. The data indicate that this was a local extinction, and not a case of historical range shift or contraction. One possible interpretation is a declining metapopulation and conservation need for this species in the UK...|$|R

40|$|This article explores how a {{political}} economy approach can explicate recent {{events in the}} United Kingdom’s relation to the European Union. The proposition is that neither critical nor comparative approaches {{do justice to the}} extent to which British elites have sought to <b>differentiate</b> the <b>UK</b> from the EU. The UK is here understood as a Eurosceptic political economy, constructed in opposition to European integration and, in particular, Economic and Monetary. The article explores how we have witnessed a hardening of this Eurosceptic political economy in the context of the Eurozone crisis. The most distinctive feature of which, as seen in the referendum campaign, is the extent to which the economic case for withdrawal has been established as part of the mainstream of British political debate...|$|R

I <b>differentiate</b> between <b>UK</b> multinationals that make outward investments in relatively low-wage economies versus {{those that do}} not, and between their activities in high-skill versus low-skill industries in the UK. UK multinationals that invest in low-wage economies typically also invest in {{a large number of}} high-wage economies. I find some evidence that these firms display lower employment growth than other types of firm, in particular in low-skill UK industries, consistent with labour in relatively low-wage economies being a substitute for labour in relatively low-skill industries in the UK. But in high-skill manufacturing industries establishments owned by UK multinationals that invest in low-wage economies are among the largest and most productive. However, my findings suggest {{that this is not a}} result of overseas investment, but rather that only the most productive firms can bear the costs of investing in numerous locations abroad...|$|R
40|$|Mathematics is an {{important}} skill that is taught to all children in the UK in a structured manner from a very early age. The purpose of this thesis was to examine how working memory (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974 a; Baddeley & Hitch, 1994) and UK curricular mathematics are related, if specific components of working memory were more impactful upon performance in mathematics than others, {{and if we can}} predict mathematics outcomes using working memory measures. With reference to the influence of working memory on overall curricular mathematics performance, a cohort of 70 children from two primary schools in the North West of England was tested annually from their Reception year (mean age 5 yrs 1 m) at school to Year Two (mean age 6 yrs 11 m). The study used a number of working memory tasks, a UK curricular mathematics test, and two Performance Measures. This allowed data to be analysed both in a cross-sectional manner and longitudinally (Chapter 5). The thesis also <b>differentiates</b> <b>UK</b> curricular mathematics into four separable “strands”, Number, Calculation, Measures, Shape and Space, and Problem Solving. These strands are described consistently throughout the UK mathematics curricular literature (DfEE, 1999; DfEE & QCA, 1999 a; DfES, 2003 a) and the cohort data was used to statistically analyse the relationships between working memory and each strand in turn using a correlational design in Chapters 6 to 9. Results indicated that working memory is a robust predictor of overall mathematics performance (Chapter 5), and of the Calculation Strand (Chapter 7). This finding was demonstrated in both the cross-sectional analyses and also in the longitudinal regression analyses. Of the working memory measures a distinct pattern of association was revealed. In particular the data imply that there is a strong role for the central executive at each age range, but in Year One verbal short-term memory emerges as {{an important}} predictor variable. Working memory also showed significant predictive influence over the remaining three curricular mathematics strands that were measured, particularly at the youngest age grouping, but working memory was not found to be a robust longitudinal predictor of Number, Problem Solving or Measures, Shape and Space. The overarching conclusion is that working memory, and in particular the central executive, may support the development of early curricular mathematical skills independent of the influence of age and Performance Measures. The practical and theoretical implications are considered...|$|R

Applying hedonic pricing {{models in the}} {{generation}} of interest quality adjusted indices this study would {{suggest the need for}} a 0. 24 percentage point increase in the retail price index (RPI) (which, at an average RPI of 3 %, represents a measurement error of 9 %). Moreover, this study finds that lenders tend to restrain increases in observable initial interest rates, but more than recoup this restraint through quality adjustments. These findings question the practice of removing mortgage interest repayments from macroeconomic inflationary target measures. This indicates the need to recognize the indirect inflationary impact of base rate rises on the price of highly differentiated debt based products. hedonic pricing, mortgage products, inflation measurement, UK, E 31, G 21,...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} pooling data to build [...] "national databases" [...] {{has a very}} {{straightforward}} explanation: law enforcement agencies and forensic services rely on their national population to build reference databases. In most instances offenders and victims stem from the national population, and their genetic profiles should thus be represented in the database. In countries like USA, Brazil, UK or China which are characterized by strong population substructure national reference databases are often built on basis of a historical concept of ethnic affiliation, e.g. the US population is sub-structured in a Caucasian, African, Hispanic, Asian and Native American populations or <b>UK</b> <b>differentiates</b> English, Afro-Caribbean, Indo-Pakistani and Chinese. National databases due to their importance in national legislation are thus searchable in the YHRD. Each national Metapopulation in the YHRD comprises all individuals sampled in a particular country regardless of the ancestry of the individuals.|$|R
40|$|Several recent {{corporate}} governance scandals relate to non-disclosure or high amounts of pension benefits given to executive directors. The lack of disclosure and transparency has gained pensions benefits greater attention {{as a significant}} part of the total remuneration received by executive directors. Due to the associated problems there is a greater need for better disclosure and in turn heightened transparency towards shareholders.   This qualitative case study focuses on general retailers in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Due to the lack of research five general retailers from respective country were chosen to be examined and compared during 2006 - 2010. The aim is to examine the disclosure of individual pension benefits of executive directors and the development in levels of pension benefits in the following general retailers Bilia, Clas Ohlson, Debenhams, Dunelm Mill, Fenix Outdoor, Halfords, JD Sports Fashion,  Kappahl, Mekonomen and N Brown Group. The findings show that the majority of general retailers have complied with their respective {{corporate governance}} code during 2006 - 2010. The level of disclosure has <b>differentiated,</b> where <b>UK</b> general retailers have a higher level of individual disclosure. The development in levels of pension benefits has shown that there are higher amounts of pension benefits in Swedish general retailers. A negative trend in the development of the Chief Executive Officers amounts of pension benefits has mainly been present in 2007 - 2009. Reversal of the negative trend came in the last year of the case study. No distinctive trends were found in the development of pension benefits for all other executive directors...|$|R

IMPF: 01. 25 RONO: 1330 3003 Sponsorship: EU; Grant No: 06628; 06351 Island populations are often {{thought to be}} more {{susceptible}} {{to the loss of}} genetic diversity as a consequence of limited population size and genetic drift, greater susceptibility to detrimental stochastic events and low levels of immigration. However the geographic isolation of islands may create refuges for native crop species whose genetic diversity is threatened from the genetic erosion occurring in mainland areas as a result of crop-wild gene flow and genetic swamping. Many UK islands remain uncharacterised in terms of plant genetic diversity. In this study we compared the genetic diversity of mainland populations and landraces of Trifolium repens with wild populations collected from the islands surrounding the UK, including the island of Hirta in the St Kildan archipelago. Individuals from St Kilda represent a unique conservation resource, with populations both highly <b>differentiated</b> from <b>UK</b> mainland populations and genetically distinct from cultivated varieties, whilst able to retain diversity through limited human influence on the islands. In contrast, there is relative genetic similarity of wild UK populations to cultivated forms highlighted in mainland populations, but with geographic barriers preventing complete homogenisation of the mainland UK genepool. We underline the need for conservation priorities to include common species that are threatened by gene flow from cultivation, and draw attention to the potential of islands to preserve natural levels of genetic diversity.

40|$|Extreme {{sea level}} events are a current global threat, whilst sea-level rise (SLR) {{and climate change}} over the 21 st century will {{increase}} the frequency and severity of flooding in most coastal regions. Numerical model simulations can help to understand and predict coastal floods (e. g. flood mapping and forecasting) but in comparison to flood sources (waves and water levels) coastal flood pathways (defence failures and inundation) are presently less integrated within these models. This thesis develops and demonstrates a methodology to rapidly simulate and understand the consequences of coastal flood events, with an emphasis upon regions where the risks of flooding are not well understood and could change quickly with SLR. The Solent on the south coast of England is the case study, and is prone to frequent flooding. This region is currently <b>differentiated</b> from the <b>UK</b> east and west coasts by experiencing smaller storm surges, and is characterised by undefended sections of shoreline and small floodplains. Within the Solent is Portsmouth, a city of national flood significance (only London and Hull contain more people considered at risk of coastal flooding in the UK). However, life threatening floods have not occurred in living memory. An integrated modelling approach is developed, coupling loads and defence failures with two-dimensional simulations of floodplain inundation. Observations collated from a real storm surge and flood event are shown to generate a validation data set, which indicates that this model can predict floodplain water levels to a good level of accuracy, whilst highlighting implications of such data collection. Solent-wide analysis includes simulations of hypothetical coastal flood events based upon scenarios that cover {{the full range of}} coastal loadings (realistic waves and water levels) and defence failures (overflow, outflanking, overtopping and breaching). More detailed case-studies are also applied at two sites within the region (including Portsmouth). This analysis generates peak flood water depths and an overview of impacts across this spectrum of possible floods. This research improves the existing knowledge of coastal flooding in the case study, and highlights a number of generic concepts that should be applied to others. For example the combination of flood simulation methods with real flood event analysis is essential for optimising the interpretation of model outputs whilst supporting inferences about flood consequences associated with extreme loading events (including how these may change with SLR). Simple methods estimated that > 24, 000 properties are within a 1 in 200 year flood event outline; and incorporating defence failures, flood dynamics, validation and detailed case studies substantially refine the assessment of places likely to experience damages. Breach defence failures generate the worst flood impacts, although in the Solent this failure mechanism is presently less of a threat than outflanking, overflow and wave overtopping. The modelling system includes easily interpreted outputs, whilst being computationally fast; therefore with potential applications including supporting land-use and defence planning, and real-time flood forecasting and warning...|$|R
