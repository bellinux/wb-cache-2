While some industrialists funded student movements and the opposition parties (DMK and Swatantara party) helped move it politically, it is well observed that agitation was a spontaneous reaction, which directly reflected the anger of the common people, especially the students.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether {{the emotions of}} <b>frustration</b> <b>and</b> optimism mediate, fully or partially, the relationship between leadership style and subordinate performance {{in the context of}} structural equation modeling. The findings show that transformational leadership has a significant direct influence on <b>frustration</b> <b>and</b> optimism, with the negative influence of frustration having a stronger effect on performance than the positive influence of optimism. <b>Frustration</b> <b>and</b> optimism are found to have a direct influence on performance, <b>and</b> the emotions, <b>frustration</b> <b>and</b> optimism, fully mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and performance. Thus, the effect of transformational leadership style on performance is significant, but indirect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The investors of the Virginia Company of London {{expected}} to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> made demands upon {{the leaders of}} Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay {{the cost of the}} voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony. It fell to the third president of the Council Captain John Smith to deliver a bold and much-needed wake-up call in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen who could help make the colony more self-sufficient.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution of 1905–07 in Russian Poland, {{the result}} of many years of pent-up {{political}} <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> stifled national ambitions, was marked by political maneuvering, strikes and rebellion. The revolt was part of much broader disturbances throughout the Russian Empire associated with the general Revolution of 1905. In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were Roman Dmowski and Józef Piłsudski. Dmowski {{was associated with the}} right-wing nationalist movement National Democracy, whereas Piłsudski was associated with the Polish Socialist Party. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian Duma. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition left Austrian Galicia as the territory most amenable to patriotic action..|$|E
25|$|Although {{diamonds}} were {{a significant}} motivating and sustaining factor, {{there were other}} means of profiting from the Sierra Leone Civil War. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming {{through the use of}} forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans who did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force. But the most important reason why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. More than twenty years of poor governance, poverty, corruption and oppression created the circumstances for the rise of the RUF, as ordinary people yearned for change.|$|E

Certain other details of Travis are based on Suda, including the sound of a key ring jingling in his pocket and his love of cats. A Ubisoft contest was held to allow one winner's design to be used in Desperate Struggle for one of Travis' T-shirts. In an interview with Nintendo Power, Suda stated that he wanted Travis to become a huge star, stating that {{this was one of the}} reasons he wanted to make Desperate Struggle as interesting as possible. Nintendo Power editors told Joystiq that Suda considers Travis his favorite character. Suda states that No More Heroes 2 will be Travis' last appearance in the series, as his story will be completely finished. The Californian setting of No More Heroes is partially based on Travis, who Suda stated had a variety of <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> emotions that helped him fit in with that setting.|$|E
25|$|Show {{then began}} feuding with Mark Henry after he {{attacked}} and injured {{him on the}} June 17 episode of SmackDown, as Big Show's <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> anger towards Del Rio was redirected unintentionally to Mark Henry. Henry retaliated by attacking Big Show during his match at Capitol Punishment and attacking him with the World's Strongest Slam through an announce table, causing Show to lose by technical knockout. Henry {{did the same thing}} on Kane through the broadcast table the next day on Raw after their arm wrestling match, and again on the June 27 episode. Henry then broke the cage door during the steel cage match between Big Show and Alberto Del Rio, allowing Del Rio to escape. He then attacked Show with the cage door, breaking the cage viciously. On July 17, 2011 at Money in the Bank, Henry defeated Big Show. After the match, Henry fractured Show's fibula, keeping him out of action for almost three months.|$|E
25|$|With no {{constitutional}} amendment done, Annadurai declared 26 January 1965, the 15th Republic Day of India {{and also the}} day the Constitution, which in essence enshrined Hindi as the official language of India, came into practice, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by the then Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, as blasphemous. Hence Annadurai, who by then {{had been trying to}} shake off the secessionist image of his party, declared 24 January as a day of mourning. He also replaced the slogan of the protests to Down with Hindi; Long live the Republic. Nevertheless, violence broke out on 26 January, initially in Madurai which within days spread throughout the state. Robert Hardgrave Jr, professor of humanities, government and Asian studies, suggests that the elements contributing to the riots were not instigated by DMK or Leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> discontentment which lay {{beneath the surface of the}} people of the state.|$|E

This period was not without its <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with I due Foscari, he wrote: [...] "I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for these next three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then addio to everything."

During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. [...] After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. [...] He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. [...] Dr. Dre recalled, [...] "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'"

500|$|MeTV {{described}} Clair's {{parenting style}} as [...] "firm, yet loving." [...] Writing for NPR, Eric Deggans observed that Clair uses a [...] "loving-yet-sardonic" [...] approach to parenting, demonstrated by her line [...] "I {{was a beautiful}} woman once, before the children came". Considered to be the stricter of the two parents, Clair is humorous and sarcastic about the <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> challenges of parenting, often joking about killing or abandoning her children {{but at the same}} time making sure they do not take her exaggerated threats too seriously by demonstrating [...] "obvious loving indulgences". In the pilot, Clair responds to Theo's last minute breakfast request for scrambled eggs after she had already prepared sunny side up eggs for him by using her spatula to [...] "scramble" [...] them. According to The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women author Susan Douglas, Clair sometimes makes the mistake of alternating between stern and overindulgent too abruptly. Equally successful in their respective professions, Clair's relationship with Cliff deliberately mirrors the real-life relationship of Cosby and his wife Camille. Clair occasionally raises her voice but seldom yells or loses her temper, demonstrating calmness and a sense of humor as a [...] "remedy for the trials and tribulations of motherhood." ...|$|E

It has its <b>frustrations</b> <b>and</b> its flaws, despite its brilliance of design". He summarized that [...] "those who are patient will be richly rewarded with a game like no other." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Doug Sencat enjoyed the game's graphics and praised the plot, conversations and 3D world for giving a sense of [...] "being there". However, he noted that the game's movement controls were [...] "a pain" [...] and that navigating the environment was initially [...] "frustrating". Sencat was unfavorable toward the linearity of the plot and dialogue trees, and toward NPCs' inability to take actions independent of the player. He described the game as [...] "a long and grueling quest" [...] that often [...] "seems more frustrating than enjoyable". Although Semcat called it [...] "a relatively high-quality game", he finished, [...] "By the time I finally saw daylight again, emerging from the Labyrinth, I must admit that it wasn't exultation I felt, but sheer relief." [...] The magazine's Scorpia was more positive, calling the game [...] "a good follow-up to the previous entry".|$|E
