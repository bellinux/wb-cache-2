5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. <b>Epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells.</b> There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{elucidate}} molecular mechanisms {{underlying the}} association between respiratory viral infection and predisposition to subsequent bacterial infection, we used in vivo and in vitro models and human samples to characterize respiratory virus-induced changes in airway <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> morphology, gene expression, and mucociliary function. Mouse paramyxoviral bronchitis resulted in airway <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> infection and a distinct pattern of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> morphology changes and altered expression of the differentiation markers β-tubulin-IV, Clara cell secretory protein, and Foxj 1. Furthermore, changes in gene expression were recapitulated using an in vitro <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> culture system and progressed independent of the host inflammatory response. Restoration of mature airway epithelium occurred in a pattern similar to <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and ciliogenesis in embryonic lung development characterized by sequential proliferation of undifferentiated cells, basal body production, Foxj 1 expression, and β-tubulin-IV expression. The effects of virus-induced alterations in morphology and gene expression on <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> function were illustrated by decreased airway mucociliary velocity and impaired bacterial clearance. Similar changes in <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> Foxj 1 expression were also observed in human paramyxoviral respiratory infection. Taken together, these model systems of paramyxoviral respiratory infection mimic human pathology and identify <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> Foxj 1 expression as an early marker of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, recovery, and function...|$|R

40|$|<b>Epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> {{invasion}} by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi {{is enhanced by}} the presence of an enzyme expressed on its cell surface during the trypomastigote life cycle stage. The enzyme, trans-sialidase (TS), is a member of one of the largest gene families expressed by the parasite and the role of its activity in mediating <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> entry has not hitherto been understood. Here we show that the T. cruzi TS generates an eat me signal which is capable of enabling <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> entry. We have utilized purified, recombinant, active (TcTS) and inactive (TcTS 2 V 0) TS coated onto beads to challenge an <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> line. We find that TS activity acts upon G protein coupled receptors present at the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> synapse with the coated bead, thereby enhancing cell entry. By so doing, we provide evidence that TS proteins bind glycans, mediate the formation of distinct synaptic domains and promote macropinocytotic uptake of microparticles into a perinuclear compartment in a manner which may emulate entosis...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of cystic fibrosis, the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> has been {{characterized}} {{in terms of its}} ion transport capabilities. The ability of an <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> to initiate CFTR-mediated chloride and bicarbonate transport has been recognized early as a means to regulate the thickness of the epithelial lining fluid and recently as a means to regulate the pH, thereby determining critically whether or not host defense proteins such as mucins are able to fold appropriately. This review describes how the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> senses the presence of pathogens and inflammatory conditions, which, in turn, facilitates the activation of CFTR and thus directly promotes pathogens clearance and innate immune defense {{on the surface of the}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell.</b> This paper summarizes functional data that describes the effect of cytokines, chemokines, infectious agents, and inflammatory conditions on the ion transport properties of the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> and relates these key properties to the molecular pathology of cystic fibrosis. Recent findings on the role of cystic fibrosis modifier genes that underscore the role of the epithelial ion transport in host defense and inflammation are discussed...|$|R
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells,</b> where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues {{by a host}} cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands.

Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells,</b> which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> {{that make}} up the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. These type I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E

25|$|Polymeric IgA (mainly the {{secretory}} dimer) {{is produced}} by plasma cells in the lamina propria adjacent to mucosal surfaces. It binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells,</b> and is taken up into the cell via endocytosis. The receptor-IgA complex passes through the cellular compartments before being secreted on the luminal surface of the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells,</b> still attached to the receptor. Proteolysis of the receptor occurs, and the dimeric IgA molecule, along with {{a portion of the}} receptor known as the secretory component, are free to diffuse throughout the lumen. In the gut, IgA can bind to the mucus layer covering the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells.</b> In this way, a barrier capable of neutralizing threats before they reach the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> is formed.|$|E
40|$|Increased <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> {{proliferation}} {{is associated}} with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma and {{is associated with}} Helicobacter pylori infection. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess both gastric <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and the influence of H pylori infection on cell kinetics in the progression from normal mucosa to gastric carcinoma. One hundred and forty four subjects were assigned to study groups based on diagnosis and H pylori status: microscopically normal mucosa and H pylori negative (n = 28); chronic active gastritis and H pylori positive (n = 83); atrophic gastritis (n = 9); intestinal metaplasia (n = 19); gastric carcinoma (n = 12). Gastric antral <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation was assessed using the in vitro bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemical technique and expressed as the labelling index per cent (LI%). Subjects with chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia or gastric cancer have increased gastric <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation compared with normal mucosa (LI% mean (SEM) : 5. 14 (0. 6), 4. 68 (0. 3), 6. 50 (0. 5) v 3. 08 (0. 2), p < 0. 001). This increase in gastric <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation was not influenced by H pylori status. Gastritis associated with H pylori had an increased LI% compared with normal controls or subjects with H pylori negative gastritis (4. 98 (0. 2) v 3. 08 (0. 2), 3. 83 (0. 2), p < 0. 01). H pylori infection although {{associated with an increased}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation in subjects with chronic gastritis, does not influence the increased <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation seen in subjects with precancerous lesions or gastric carcinoma.

40|$|In coeliac disease gluten induces an {{immunological}} {{reaction in}} genetically susceptible patients, and influences on <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and differentiation in the small-bowel mucosa. Our {{aim was to}} find novel genes which operate similarly in epithelial proliferation and differentiation in an <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation model and in coeliac disease patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples. The combination of cDNA microarray data originating from a three-dimensional T 84 <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation model and small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples from untreated and treated coeliac disease patients and healthy controls resulted in 30 genes whose mRNA expression was similarly affected. Nine of 30 were located directly or indirectly in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway starting from the epithelial growth factor receptor. Removal of gluten from the diet resulted in a reversion in the expression of 29 of the 30 genes in the small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples. Further characterization by blotting and labelling revealed increased epidermal growth factor receptor and beta-catenin protein expression in the small-bowel mucosal epithelium in untreated coeliac disease patients compared to healthy controls and treated coeliac patients. We found 30 genes whose mRNA expression was affected similarly in the <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation model and in the coeliac disease patient small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples.
