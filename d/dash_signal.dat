5000|$|In Morse code {{the basic}} signals are dots and dashes often verbalized as [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs". According {{to the rules}} of Morse code. The dot {{duration}} is the basic unit of time measurement. The dash duration is equal to three dot durations. At a 20 word per minute (wpm) sending rate the dot duration is approximately 50 milliseconds (0.05 seconds); at faster speeds the dot duration is commensurately shorter. The reciprocal of the dot duration is known as the dotting rate. The length of the <b>dash</b> <b>signal</b> is three dot durations. The Morse code dot and dash signals are always separated from each other by a silent period of at least one dot duration.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} on-off keying (OOK) the Morse code {{consists}} of either signal or no signal respectively either state {{of which may}} persist over time {{in a variety of}} epochs measured in terms of the basic dot signal duration. All Morse code (symbols) information is then seen to be composed of unique sequences of these three basic elements, namely: the dot signal, the <b>dash</b> <b>signal,</b> and the silent period; the time extent of each of these three basic elements being measured in terms of the dot duration. The ubiquitous silent periods or off periods that always occur between Morse signals represent the most important characteristic of Morse code utilized opportunistically by QSK or full break-in operation to facilitate fluid Morse code conversations.|$|E
50|$|Back at the lodge, Dash devises a {{plan with}} Captain Baker over a radio to trap the spiders. He takes his skis and leads the spiders to a {{snowboard}} half-pipe, which Baker {{and his men}} are blocking off. Johnny heads toward an avalanche cannon and waits for <b>Dash's</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the half-pipe, {{the spiders}} are {{captured}} and <b>Dash</b> <b>signals</b> Johnny, who blows the spiders up. Professor Marks, {{who had been}} opposed to killing the spiders, charges at Dash and tries to kill him. Marks falls {{down the side of}} the half-pipe to the last spider, which kills him as Baker shoots the beast.|$|R
50|$|The {{end result}} of extreme {{receiver}} AFE sensitivity to high power levels is that, for most practical purposes, signal reception is impossible during periods when the associated transmitter is actually transmitting the dot and <b>dash</b> <b>signals.</b> Consequently, radiotelegraph operators cannot hear interruptions from remote receiving stations during normal signal transmission periods when the full transmitter power {{is applied to the}} antenna.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to all {{automatic}} control system the time dynamics of AGC operation may be important in many applications. Some AGC systems are slow {{to react to the}} need for gain changes, others may react very rapidly. An example of an application where fast AGC recovery time is required is in receivers used in Morse code communications where so-called full break-in or QSK operation is necessary to enable receiving stations to interrupt sending stations mid-character (e.g. between dot and <b>dash</b> <b>signals).</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the phase}} delays started up again, 2 {{seconds after the}} station {{identifier}} ended, the dot-dash keying started with it. The receiver would normally be located to {{one side or the}} other of the equisignal, so they would hear either dots or dashes - for this example let's say dots. As the pattern was rotated, the dots lobe moved away from the receiver while the <b>dashes</b> <b>signal</b> approached it. So over the 30 second period, the receiver will hear dots, then the equisignal (briefly), and then dashes. By timing the arrival of the equisignal, the navigator could determine their location within the lobe.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the short dot and <b>dash</b> <b>signals</b> and their ever-present adjacent dot duration silent periods, Morse code symbols are of longer duration than signals and are composed of unique dot/dash sequences of Morse signals and silent periods. Morse code symbols are separated from each other by at least a three dot duration inter-symbol silent period. Morse code symbols represent alpha-numeric, punctuation and prosign characters. Each such long duration symbol consists of a unique sequence {{of two or more}} of the three basic elements (dot, dash, silent period), e.g. the unique sequence for the English letter [...] "C" [...] is (...) [...] Each unique symbol represents either: (i) a unique alpha-numeric character (e.g. letters A-Z and numerals 0-9), (ii) a unique punctuation character (e.g. ? or @, etc.), or (iii) a unique procedural symbol.|$|R
5000|$|It {{took the}} Germans {{more than a}} year to {{decipher}} the operation of the system, in an effort led by engineer H. Widdra, who had previously detected the British [...] "Pip-squeak" [...] Identification friend or foe IFF system in 1940. Their first attempt to jam Oboe took place at the end of August 1943 during an attack on the Bochumer Verein steelworks in Essen. A system set up at the Maibaum tracking station in Kettwig broadcast false dot and <b>dash</b> <b>signals</b> on the 1.5 m band, hoping to make it impossible for the pilot to figure out if they were at the right position. This was the same technique that the British had used against German systems during The Blitz. However, by this time the Oboe system had already moved to the microwave-frequency 3 cm Oboe Mk. II, but they deliberately continued broadcasting the older signals as a ruse.|$|R
2500|$|For AIBA, the Lucero system {{sent out}} pulses on 183MHz, and the BABS responded with 8µs pulses on 190.5MHz. These {{were sent to}} yet another display mode, with a single {{vertical}} time base [...] long and the strobe providing markers every [...] along it. No switching {{was used in this}} mode, instead the signal always caused the beam to deflect to the right, causing a fairly wide bar to appear. Depending on which side of the runway the aircraft was on, the operator would either see long bars for 0.2second and short ones for 1, or vice versa. If, for instance, the dot signal was longer, this indicated the aircraft was too far to port as the signal was stronger on that side. Using these signals the aircraft could position itself along the centreline, at which point both the dot and <b>dash</b> <b>signals</b> were the same length, and the bar remained steady.|$|R
5000|$|Although Morse code preceded modern coded {{modulation}} techniques by {{more than}} a century, in terms of Claude Shannon's modern Information Theory, Morse code may be regarded essentially as an encoded method of signaling that simultaneously comprises both: a source code (data compression code) and a channel code (modulation code). The Morse code source code was created by Samuel Morse's assistant Alfred Vail when Vail assigned the shortest Morse code symbols to the most often occurring (English language) source symbols (alpha-numeric characters and punctuation marks), in the style of today's modern data compression codes such as the modern Information Theory based: Huffman, Arithmetic, and Lempel-Ziv-Welsh codes. Morse code symbols are variable length sequences of: dot <b>signals,</b> <b>dash</b> <b>signals,</b> and dot duration silent periods. Vail based his Morse code on the English language source with the shortest Morse symbol, a sequence composed of a single Morse code dot followed by a single dot duration silent period, encoding the most often used English letter [...] "E" [...] with corresponding longer sequences used for less common English letters. Besides assigning Morse code symbols to alpha-numeric and punctuation characters of the information source language symbols the early creators of Morse code also assigned additional procedural symbols to the Morse code related to page formatting of documents and to control and turn over of telegraph communication channels.|$|R
50|$|Most beacons {{operate in}} {{continuous}} wave (A1A) and transmit their identification (call sign and location). Some of them send long <b>dashes</b> to facilitate <b>signal</b> strength measurement. A {{small number of}} beacons transmit Morse code by frequency shift keying (F1A). A few beacons transmit signals in digital modulation modes, like radioteletype (F1B) and PSK31 (G1B).|$|R
30|$|Let us now {{discuss the}} results of the {{application}} of the evolved fuzzy rules to the original microfile M^H. In Fig.  2, we presented both quantity signal (solid line) and auxiliary quantity <b>signal</b> (<b>dashed</b> line) for the state of New York. Values i = 1, 2,..., 38 over the x axis stand for the ith PUMA of the state of New York. The list of PUMAs circa 2013 {{can be found on the}} IPUMS-International website (PUMAs 2010).|$|R
2500|$|During Hood's second {{recuperation}} in Richmond that fall, he befriended Confederate President Jefferson Davis, {{who would}} subsequently promote {{him to a}} more important role. He also resumed his courtship of Buck Preston—a cousin of Breckinridge's—who, despite giving him some ambiguously positive <b>signals,</b> <b>dashed</b> his hopes on Christmas Eve. Hood confided to Mary Chesnut that the courtship [...] "was the hardest battle he had ever fought in his life." [...] In February, Hood proposed again to Buck and this time demanded a specific response, which was a reluctant, embarrassed agreement. However, the Preston family did not approve of Hood, who left for the field unmarried.|$|R
5000|$|Honda marketed the N360 as a two-door sedan, with a three-door wagon (considered a {{commercial}} vehicle in Japan, and therefore called a [...] "Light van") called the LN360 arriving in June {{of the first}} year. It has a horizontally divided rear gate and boxier rear bodywork for maximum load capacity. The LN360 had the same 31 PS engine as the sedan, and {{a top speed of}} 105 km/h. After a January 1970 facelift it became the LNIII 360, with a new non-reflective <b>dash,</b> bigger turn <b>signals,</b> and the same new front end as the sedan. The LNIII 360 was built until late 1971, when the Life Van took over.|$|R
50|$|One electrode, A, of the coherer, (C, in {{the left}} diagram) is {{connected}} to the antenna and the other electrode, B, to ground. A series combination of a battery, B1, and a relay, R, is also attached to the two electrodes. When the signal from a spark gap transmitter is received, the filings tend to cling to each other, reducing the resistance of the coherer. When the coherer conducts better, battery B1 supplies enough current through the coherer to activate relay R, which connects battery B2 to the telegraph sounder S, giving an audible click. In some applications, a pair of headphones replaced the telegraph sounder, being much more sensitive to weak signals, or a Morse recorder which recorded the dots and <b>dashes</b> of the <b>signal</b> on paper tape.|$|R
5000|$|For 1961, the Suzulight TL II was presented. A new {{pressed steel}} grille {{in place of}} the TL's simple mesh and chrome rubbing strips on the bumpers {{enhanced}} its look, and there was also a second windshield wiper. The engine received some improvements such as larger bearings and the gear linkage was change from a cable operated one to a more precise mechanical linkage. The price dropped to ¥360,000. Next year's TL III, introduced in October 1961, continued this trend, dropping down to ¥345,000 while offering a new, fully synchronized four-speed transmission. The TL III also received an updated <b>dash</b> and turn <b>signals</b> integrated into a new grille and taillights instead of on the B-pillar. The sheet metal was changed to accommodate new doorhandles, but the biggest difference was at the rear, where there was a horizontally split two-piece tailgate. The TL III was marketed as the [...] "Suzulight Van 360".|$|R
30|$|As {{depicted}} in Fig.  1, two different patterns of clustering are possible, in which different adjacent cells cooperate with each other. All cells within each thick red <b>dashed</b> hexagon coordinate <b>signals</b> from their BSs {{to form a}} cluster; one example cluster in each pattern is emphasized in the figure for clarity. As Fig.  1 a depicts, those users in a cluster that are located near {{the border of the}} cluster (for example, at location “ 1 ”) experience the poorest channel conditions from the BSs in the cooperating set. By rotating the clustering pattern by 60 ° around any macro site (see Fig.  1 b), those previously poor-coverage users are now {{in the middle of the}} cluster (i.e., they will have better channel gains or higher achievable rates). Therefore, most users will have the opportunity to have a higher chance of being scheduled and to achieve reasonably good data rates for a fraction of the overall transmission time. With users being scheduled primarily during their most favorable clustering pattern, their corresponding rates will be higher than otherwise. Averaging the throughput over all transmission periods and clustering patterns, the overall achievable transmission sum rate of the users will be improved.|$|R
60|$|To {{make matters}} worse, {{all the rest}} of his set were working full time at their various employments, and had no leisure for amusing him. Welch practised hundred-yard sprints daily, and {{imagined}} that it would be quite a treat for Charteris to be allowed to time him. So he gave him the stopwatch, saw him safely {{to the end of the}} track, and at a given <b>signal</b> <b>dashed</b> off in the approved American style. By the time he reached the tape, dutifully held by two sporting Merevalian juniors, Charteris's attention had generally been attracted elsewhere. 'What time?' Welch would pant. 'By Jove,' Charteris would observe blandly, 'I forgot to look. About a minute and a quarter, I fancy.' At which Welch, who always had a notion that he had done it in ten and a fifth that time, at any rate, would dissemble his joy, and mildly suggest that somebody else should hold the watch. Then there was Jim Thomson, generally a perfect mine of elevating conversation. He was in for the mile and also the half, and refused to talk about anything except those distances, and the best methods for running them in the minimum of time. Charteris began to feel a blue melancholy stealing over him. The Babe, again. He might have helped to while away the long hours, but unfortunately the Babe had been taken very bad with a notion that he was going to win the 'cross-country run, and when, in addition to this, he was seized with a panic with regard to the prospects of the House team in the final, and began to throw out hints concerning strict training, Charteris regarded him as a person to be avoided. If he fled to the Babe for sympathy now, the Babe would be just as likely as not to suggest that he should come for a ten-mile spin with him, to get him into condition for the final Houser. The very thought of a ten-mile spin made Charteris feel faint. Lastly, there was Tony. But Tony's company was worse than none at all. He went about with his arm in a sling, and declined to be comforted. But for his injury, he would by now have been training hard for the Aldershot Boxing Competition, and the fact that he was now definitely out of it had a very depressing effect upon him. He lounged moodily about the gymnasium, watching Menzies, who was to take his place, sparring with the instructor, and refused consolation. Altogether, Charteris found life a distinct bore.|$|R
