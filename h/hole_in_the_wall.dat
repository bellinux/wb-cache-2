5|$|In 1952, {{the naturalist}} David Attenborough {{and his wife}} Jane bought a house {{situated}} between the former Mayfield Cottages (which still stand today) and the <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> pub.

5|$|Julia Martha Thomas was {{a former}} schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. Since {{the death of her}} second husband in 1873, she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a garden at the front and back. The area was not heavily {{populated}} at the time, although her house was close to a public house called The <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E
5|$|The civil {{leadership}} of the resistance, represented by lawyer Sven Arntzen, demanded Quisling be treated like any other murder suspect and, on 9 May, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police. Quisling was transferred to Cell 12 in Møllergata 19, the main police station in Oslo. The cell was equipped with a tiny table, a basin, and a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> for a toilet bucket.|$|E

5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns to the office to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. After throwing an extreme tantrum and punching a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> Andy is fired. Meanwhile, Kelly is forced to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy).|$|E
5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball through a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> ends the game.|$|E
5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E

5|$|Also on Nanking's {{eastern side}} but further south, other {{units of the}} SEA faced the {{difficult}} task of fording the large moat standing between them and three of the city gates, Zhongshan Gate, Guanghua Gate, and Tongji Gate, though the speed of Japan's earlier advance played in their favor as key Chinese units slated to be deployed here were not yet in position. That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> A Japanese battalion launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion of the gate, but was immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks. The Chinese brought up reinforcements, including tanks, and they poured down grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese battalion, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. The battalion succeeded in holding its position {{for the rest of the}} battle despite losing eighty of its eighty-eight men.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched {{on the order of}} a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E

25|$|An {{approximate}} {{realization of}} a black surface is a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of a large enclosure. Any light entering the hole is reflected indefinitely or absorbed inside and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. The radiation confined in such an enclosure {{may or may not}} be in thermal equilibrium, depending upon the nature of the walls and the other contents of the enclosure.|$|E

25|$|As {{the stadium}} aged, its {{condition}} deteriorated. A <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> allowed visiting teams' players to peep into the Eagles Cheerleaders dressing room.

25|$|In 1898, Otto Lummer and Ferdinand Kurlbaum {{published}} {{an account of}} their cavity radiation source. Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements {{that led to the}} discovery of Planck's law. A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides. See also Hohlraum.|$|E
25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> It doesn’t need awareness, but it does seem to work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E
25|$|Perforation (a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract) {{often leads}} to catastrophic consequences if left untreated. Erosion of the gastro-intestinal wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of the stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute peritonitis, initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain; an example is Valentino's syndrome, named after the silent-film actor who experienced this pain before his death. Posterior wall perforation leads to bleeding due to the involvement of gastroduodenal artery that lies posterior to {{the first part of}} the duodenum.|$|E
