Palmer orders attacks on the three nations responsible, as revealed by an audio known as the Cyprus Recording. Palmer then reverses course, stating that he believes the recordings to be fake, as advised by Jack, but Mike Novick, his Chief of Staff, and the Vice President, Jim Prescott deem this sudden reluctance to attack as an incapability to hold the office. Earlier in the day however, Sherry warned him that there were people in his administration planning to overthrow his presidency. Prescott gathers the Cabinet members, and by one vote, David Palmer is removed from office under the provisions of the 25th Amendment. He sits in a room as a prisoner {{for the rest of the}} day, until Jack provides CTU with the evidence that the Cyprus Recording is a forgery, and the attacks are called off by Prescott.|$|E

40|$|Epirubicin, a steroisomer of {{doxorubicin}} with suggested lower {{potential for}} cardiotoxicity in animal tumor systems, was evaluated in a disease-oriented phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer. The drug was given {{as a direct}} i. v. injection of 90 mg/m 2 repeated every 3 weeks. Four partial remissions were observed among 75 evaluable patients. Forty-two of the 75 patients had received no prior chemotherapy. The predicted true response rate is equal to 5 % (0. 2 - 10 %). Leucopenia (75 % of patients), gastrointestinal disturbances (76 % of patients) and alopecia (53 % of patients) were common side-effects observed. Four patients had cardiac abnormalities after treatment with epirubicin (one sinustachycardia, two premature beats, one biopsy-proven cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure). One patient developed a peripheral neuropathy possibly related to epirubicin.

Therapy continued up to 10 cycles unless disease progression or excessive toxicity mandated discontinuation. Toxicity, symptom improvement and pain intensity were regularly assessed. With a median relative dose intensity of 97 %, toxicity was moderate with grade 3 or more nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, leucocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile leucocytopenia, arthralgia, infection and fever with infection occurring in 13, 13, 10, 3, 7 and 3 % of patients for the remaining events, respectively. Overall, I objective response was observed (response rate 4 %, 95 % Confidence Interval (Cl) : 0. 1 - 19), Median Survival was 8. 2 months.

40|$|Background: Acanthamoebae, {{in common}} with other protozoa, readily {{endocytose}} particulate material, which in turn {{may lead to the}} spread of infectious disease. Methods: Evaluation and quantification of plain and carboxylate FITC-microsphere association with acanthamoebal trophzoites was undertaken using a combination of flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Trophozoites from strains and species of Acanthamoeba were exposed to plain and carboxylate FITC-microspheres. Microsphere size and aspects such as trophozoite starvation, maturity, and exposure to metabolic inhibitors were assessed. Results: All species and strains of Acanthamoeba readily endocytosed plain and carboxylate microspheres. Starving trophozoites significantly increased binding and potential ingestion of microspheres, whereas trophozoites of increasing maturity lost such abilities. Trophozoites showed a significant preference for 2. 0 - and 3. 0 -μm-diameter microspheres when compared with other sizes, which in turn could occupy much of the cytoplasm. The physiological inhibitors sodium azide, 2, 4 -clinitrophenol, and cytochalasin B reduced microsphere association with trophozoites; however, some microspheres still bound and associated with trophozoites after inhibitor exposure, a manifestation of both active and <b>inactive</b> <b>agent</b> involvement in microsphere endocytosis. Conclusions: Even though the origins of microsphere binding by acanthamoebal trophozoite remains shrouded, the combination of flow cytometry and confocal microscopy supported synergistic quantification and qualification of trophozoite-microsphere endocytosis...|$|E

Two typhoid vaccines are commercially available, Ty 21 a (oral) and Vi polysaccharide (parenteral), but neither is used routinely. Other vaccines, such as a new, modified, conjugated Vi vaccine called Vi-rEPA, are in development. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of vaccines used to prevent typhoid fever.

40|$|AbstractPhencyclidine (PCP) is a dissociative {{anesthetic}} agent which {{blocks the}} excitatory effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{in the central}} nervous system. To investigate {{the role of the}} PCP reactive site in the control of NMDA activation of hippocampal pyramidal cells, we have examined the action of PCP and some of its analogues on the response properties of single NMDA receptors. Application of NMDA (5 – 15 μM) to outside-out patches of membrane elicited bursts of ion channel openings which were greatly reduced in frequency and duration in the presence of PCP (2. 5 – 10 μM) or m-amino-PCP (2. 5 – 10 μM), a behaviorally active derivative of PCP. These effects of PCP were reversed when the membrane potential was shifted from negative to positive values. Application of the behaviorally <b>inactive</b> <b>agent</b> 1 -piperidino-cyclohexanecarbonitrile (⩾ 220 μM) left NMDA-activated currents relatively unaltered. Treatment with another analogue, m-nitro-PCP (5 – 20 μM), resulted in an unexpected increase in frequency of openings. At a higher concentration (100 – 300, μM), however, m-nitro-PCP acted like PCP in reducing frequency of opening and channel life-time. Like PCP, these effects of m-nitro-PCP were reversed at positive potentials. Taken together, these results suggest that PCP and its derivatives block the open state of the NMDA channel. Moreover, the dual effect of m-nitro-PCP shows that excitability is not necessarily decreased by PCP analogues but may instead be enhanced depending on modifications of the PCP molecule...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{experiment}} tested {{whether the}} placebo and nocebo responses could be mediated via modulation of stress. Methods: Ischemic pain was induced in healthy volunteers (N 59). When pain reached “ 7 ” on a 10 -point scale, {{two groups of}} subjects received information that a pain relieving (the Placebo group) or a pain increasing (the Nocebo group) substance was injected. All injections contained physiological saline. A third group received no information and no injection (the Natural History group). Pain ratings and blood samples for analysis of cortisol and beta-endorphin were obtained every 5 minutes after pain equal to seven until the experiment was terminated. Results: Pain increased in all groups, but there were significantly lower pain ratings in the Placebo group at 15 minutes after the injection, compared {{with the other two}} groups. Cortisol increased in all groups, but mostly so in the Nocebo group. Circulating beta-endorphin increased in all groups. Pain-ratings were not correlated with beta-endorphins or cortisol. Conclusions: A placebo response, ie, a reduced pain level, was seen in the Placebo group at 15 minutes after the injection. The placebo response was not related to stress or to beta-endorphin. Expectation of a pain increase in the Nocebo group led to an increase in cortisol, but the expectation of pain increase and the resultant cortisol increase had no effect on pain.

40|$|Cochlear outer {{hair cells}} are {{postulated}} to modulate auditory transduction by their mechanical properties which presumably {{are controlled by}} efferent neurons and regulated by the levels of intracellular calcium. In a number of biological systems these calcium levels are controlled by inositol trisphosphate (InsP 3), the second messenger of the phosphoinositide cascade. We have investigated whether the phosphoinositides function in the signal transfer in mammalian auditory sensory cells. Live isolated outer hair cells synthesize the lipids of the phosphoinositide cycle, phosphatidic acid (Ptd), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PtdInsP) and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2). After one hour of incubation with [32 P]orthophosphate, Ptd constituted 21 +/- 7 % of labeled lipids, PtdIns 19 +/- 5 %, PtdInsP 28 +/- 7 % and PtdInsP, 33 +/- 7 %. Contractions were elicited in isolated cells after their membrane was permeabilized with Triton X- 100. Addition of calcium and ATP resulted in contractions (average, 7. 2 % of initial cell length) in 81 % of the cells studied; the omission of ATP or calcium (i. e. {{the presence of the}} calcium-chelator EGTA) reduced the incidence of contractions to 0 % and 17 %, respectively.

Despite its increasing importance in the clinical research field, the recruitment process {{is very difficult for}} various reasons and may become a serious research limitation. A project was designed and implemented with a view to understanding the perceptions of Turkish participants to clinical trials. Methods: Investigators were given a questionnaire booklet to complete with information about all patients that were potentially eligible for active involvement in international clinical trials. A total of 39 investigators from eight cities participated in the survey and they provided information on 410 patients who were candidates for ongoing international trials. Results: A total of 306 out of 410 patients were eligible for the trials; the remaining 104 patients were ineligible based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and physician estimation on patient’s compliance. Of the 306 eligible patients, 80 refused to sign an informed consent form. The two most common reasons for refusing to participate in a clinical trial were the influence of patients’ relatives (36. 7 %) and the risk of adverse events (27. 8 %). These were followed by the need for additional visits/tests (18. 9 %), the risk of being treated with <b>inactive</b> <b>agents</b> - i. e. placebo- (15. 2 %), and the probability of being randomized to unknown products (12. 7 %).

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} for modeling {{and analysis of}} a number of phenomena of collective behavior. By collectives we mean multi-agent systems that transition from one state to another at discrete moments of time. The behavior of a member of a collective (agent) is called conforming if the opinion of this agent at current time moment conforms to the opinion of some other agents at the previous time moment. We presume that at each moment of time every agent makes a decision by choosing from the set { 0, 1 } (where 1 -decision corresponds to action and 0 -decision corresponds to inaction). In our approach we model collective behavior with synchronous Boolean networks. We presume that in a network there can be agents that act at every moment of time. Such agents are called instigators. Also there can be agents that never act. Such agents are called loyalists. Agents that are neither instigators nor loyalists are called simple agents. We study two combinatorial problems. The first problem is to find a disposition of instigators that in several time moments transforms a network from a state where a majority of simple <b>agents</b> are <b>inactive</b> to a state with a majority of active agents. The second problem is to find a disposition of loyalists that returns the network to a state with a majority of <b>inactive</b> <b>agents.</b> Similar problems are studied for networks in which simple agents demonstrate the contrary to conforming behavior that we call anticonforming. We obtained several theoretical results regarding the behavior of collectives of agents with conforming or anticonforming behavior. In computational experiments we solved the described problems for randomly generated networks with several hundred vertices. We reduced corresponding combinatorial problems to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and used modern SAT solvers to solve the instances obtained...|$|R

The DTPA-based, insoluble, <b>inactive</b> contrast <b>agent</b> was internalized into dendritic cells by phagocytosis.

Uptake and activation of the contrast agent was much reduced in Flt 3 + CD 11 b+ progenitor cells. Detectability limits in the T- 1 -weighted MR images were estimated in phantoms and in vivo in the rat brain. Marginal toxic effects were only observed at very high concentrations of the contrast agent.

This effect is mimicked by an unsaturated fatty acid such as linolenic acid, while palmitic and arachidic acids, two saturated fatty acids, are <b>inactive.</b> Pharmacological <b>agents</b> that increase the endogenous levels of AA by stimulating AA release (melittin) or by inhibiting its reacylation (thimerosal) also promote [3 H] 2 DG uptake by astrocytes.

Consistent with these data, coinjection of adriamycin plus Cremophor into mice carrying a multidrug resistant P 388 transplantable tumour significantly increased the survival time of the mice compared with adriamycin treatment alone...|$|R
40|$|Background: Athamanta sicula L., {{a member}} of Apiaceae, is an annual {{perennial}} herb and it is known in Sicilian popular medicine {{with the name of}} "spaccapietre" (rock splitters), because fresh roots infusions are indicated as diuretic and used in the treatment of diseases of the urinary tract, and to dissolve kidney stones. Materials and Methods: Acetone extracts of leaves, flowers, and stems of A. sicula L. were investigated in vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. Antimicrobial activity was carried out against bacterial and fungal strains and antiproliferative activity against a group of human cancer cell lines (K- 562, NCI-H 460, and MCF- 7). Results: All acetone extracts, apiol and myristicin, resulted <b>inactive</b> as antimicrobial <b>agents</b> at the maximum tested concentration of 200 &# 956;g/mL, but they induced significant antiproliferative activity on the tested cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our study show that both apiol and myristicin could be tested as novel treatment in cancer chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} unnatural 1 -(2 -deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl) - 2, 4 -difluorobenzenes having {{a variety of}} C- 5 substituents (H, Me, F, Cl, Br, I, CF 3, CN, NO 2, NH 2), {{designed}} as thymidine mimics, were synthesized for evaluation as anticancer and antiviral agents. The coupling reaction of 3, 5 -bis-O-(p-chlorobenzoyl) - 2 -deoxy-alpha-D-ribofuranosyl chloride with an organocadmium reagent [(2, 4 -difluorophenyl) 2 Cd] afforded a mixture of the alpha- and beta-anomeric products (alpha:beta = 3 : 1 to 10 : 1 ratio). Treatment of the alpha-anomer with BF 3. Et 2 O in nitroethane at 110 - 120 degrees C for 30 min was developed as an efficient method for epimerization of the major alpha-anomer to the desired beta-anomer. The 5 -substituted (H, Me, Cl, I, NH 2) beta-anomers exhibited negligible cytotoxicity in a MTT assay (CC 50 = 10 (- 3) - 10 (- 4) M range), relative to thymidine (CC 50 = 10 (- 3) - 10 (- 5) M range), against a variety of cancer cell lines. In contrast, the 5 -NO 2 derivative was more cytotoxic (CC 50 = 10 (- 5) - 10 (- 6) M range). A number of 5 -substituted beta-anomers, and some related alpha-anomers, that were evaluated using {{a wide variety of}} antiviral assay systems [HSV- 1, HSV- 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human immunodeficiency (HIV- 1, HIV- 2) viruses], showed that this class of unnatural C-aryl nucleoside mimics are <b>inactive</b> antiviral <b>agents.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A nature {{inspired}} decentralised multi-agent {{algorithm is}} proposed {{to solve a problem}} of distributed task allocation in which cities produce and store batches of different mail types. Agents must collect and process the mail batches, without global knowledge of their environment or communication between agents. The problem is constrained so that agents are penalised for switching mail types. When an agent process a mail batch of different type to the previous one, it must undergo a change-over, with repeated change-overs rendering the <b>agent</b> <b>inactive.</b> The efficiency (average amount of mail retrieved), and the flexibility (ability of the agents to react to changes in the environment) are investigated both in static and dynamic environments and with respect to sudden changes. New rules for mail selection and specialisation are proposed and are shown to exhibit improved efficiency and flexibility compared to existing ones. We employ a evolutionary algorithm which allows the various rules to evolve and compete. Apart from obtaining optimised parameters for the various rules for any environment, we also observe extinction and speciation...|$|R
40|$|The dimeric {{structure}} of seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) is maintained by noncovalent interactions and by two intersubunit disulfide bridges. Another unusual {{feature of this}} enzyme is its antitumour action, consisting in a cytotoxic activity selective for malignant cells. This cytotoxic action is exerted when the protein reaches the cytosol of the affected cells, where it degrades ribosomal RNA, thus blocking protein synthesis and leading cells to death. The current model proposed for the mechanism of antitumour action of BS-RNase {{is based on the}} ability of the protein to resist the neutralizing action of the cytosolic RNase inhibitor, a resistance due to the dimeric {{structure of}} the enzyme. Monomeric RNases, and monomeric derivatives of BS-RNase, are strongly bound by the inhibitor and <b>inactive</b> as antitumor <b>agents.</b> Here we report on monomeric derivatives of BS-RNase that, although strongly inhibited by the cytosolic RNase inhibitor, are cytotoxic towards malignant cells. These monomers are produced by reductive cleavage of the intersubunit disulfides of the native, dimeric protein followed by linking the exposed sulfhydryls to small thiols through formation of mixed disulfides. We found that sulfhydryls from cell monolayers and cell membranes can attack these mixed disulfides in the monomeric derivatives, and reconstitute, through sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange reactions, the native dimeric protein, which is internalized as such, and displays its antitumour action...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{introduction}} of side chains in different molecular compounds takes increasing importance. As recently reported in literature, heterocyclic scaffolds with poor biological activity, if properly decorated with selected side chains, can improve their anticancer activity against a large spectrum of human tumor cell lines. For example, the annelated Pyrrolo[3, 4 -e]Pyrimidines and Pyrrolo[3, 2 -e]Pyrimidines, opportunely functionalized {{with a large number}} of side chains, showed a good increase in the antitumor activity with respect to the starting core structure. New compound thus obtained showed antiproliferative activity against all the human tumor cells, generally in the low micromolar concentration range (1). Furthermore, this increase in activity is confirmed in the new linear derivatives Thieno[3, 2 -d][1, 2, 3]Triazolo [1, 5 - α]Pyrimidines (2) and their angular isomer Thieno[2, 3 -e][1, 2, 3]Triazolo[1, 5 - α]Pyrimidines (3). Another confirmation is provided by the Indolo [3, 2 -e][1, 2, 3]Triazolo [1, 5 - α]Pyrimidines, that resulted <b>inactive</b> as antitumor <b>agent,</b> but when a functionalization with side chains takes place, the anticancer activity has interestingly appeared (4). Here, with the aim to explore the importance of the addition of side chains on smaller molecular scaffolds, of easier synthetic access and decoration, we focused our attention on a new series of substituted “chained” pyrrole derivatives in order to evaluate their anticancer potential...|$|R
40|$|Four {{series of}} C- 10 non-acetal dimers were {{prepared}} from key trioxane alcohol 10 beta-(2 -hydroxyethyl) deoxoartemisinin (9 b). All of the dimers prepared displayed potent low nanomolar antimalarial activity versus the K 1 and HB 3 strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The most potent compound assayed was phosphate dimer 14 a, which {{was greater than}} 50 times more potent than the parent drug artemisinin and about 15 times more potent than the clinically used acetal artemether. In contrast to their potent activity versus malaria parasites, {{virtually all of the}} dimers expressed poor anticancer activity apart from the trioxane phosphate ester dimers 14 a and 14 b, which expressed nanomolar growth inhibitory (GI(50)) values versus a range of cancer cell lines in the NCI 60 human cell line screen. Further detailed studies on these dimers in vitro in HL 60 cells demonstrate that both phosphate ester dimers (14 a and 14 b) are more potent than the anticancer agent doxorubicin. Interestingly, phosphate ester monomers 9 c and 9 d, antimalarially active in the low nanomolar region versus P. falciparum, are <b>inactive</b> as anticancer <b>agents</b> even at concentrations in the millimolar region. This observation emphasizes the importance of two trioxane units for high antiproliferative activity, and we propose that the nature of the linker in dimers of this type plays a crucial role in imparting potent anticancer activity...|$|R
40|$|In three earlier papers, the {{structures}} and biological potencies of numerous mono- and dicyclic antagonists of GnRH were reported. Among these, two families, each containing {{two to four}} members were identified that had very high antagonist potencies in an antiovulatory assay (within a factor of 2 of those of the most potent linear analogues) and high affinities (Ki < 0. 5 nM) for the rat GnRH receptor (rGnRHR). The most favored cycles bridged the side chains of residues (4 - 10), 1, 2 (5 - 8), 2 (4 - 10 / 5 - 8), 2 (1 - 3), 3 and (1 - 3 / 4 - 10). 3 Our goal was to identify a consensus model of bioactive conformations of GnRH antagonists, yet these biocompatible constraints did not sufficiently restrain the spatial location of the N-terminal tripeptide {{with respect to the}} C-terminal heptapeptide, due largely to the rotational freedom about the bonds connecting these regions. Examination of models derived from NMR studies of cyclo(4 - 10) analogues suggested a large number of possible cyclic constraints such as cyclo (0 - 8), (1 - 8), or (2 - 8). All analogues tested with these substitutions were <b>inactive</b> as antiovulatory <b>agents</b> at 1 mg/rat (5 - 9) and had low affinity for rGnRHR. On the other hand, bridging positions 3 and 8 with a [DAsp 3] to [Dbu 8] (12, Ki) 13 nM) or [Orn 8] (13, Ki) 14 nM) in the parent compound cyclo(3 - 8) [Ac-DNal 1,DCpa 2,DXaa 3,Arg 5,DNal 6,Xbb 8,DAla 10]GnRH yielded analogue...|$|R
