50|$|Crop-hail {{insurance}} is generally available from private insurers (in countries with private sectors) because hail is a narrow peril {{that occurs in}} a limited place and its accumulated losses tend not to overwhelm the capital reserves of private insurers. In early 1820s, crop-hail insurance were available to farmers in France and Germany. That is among the earliest forms of hail insurance from an actuarial perspective. It is possible to implement the <b>hail</b> <b>risk</b> into financial instruments since the risk is isolated.|$|E

To explain {{the choice between}} the two alternatives for defence of fruit production against the <b>hail</b> <b>risk,</b> insurance and anti hail-nets, was developed a model that simulates the effects of variations of each component of cost and of the public aid. The quality of the model was then tested on three alpine areas representing different levels of <b>hail</b> <b>risk.</b> The test allows to answer in particular to the following questions. a) Without public aid {{which would be the}} best choice of defence against <b>hail</b> <b>risk?</b> b) How the public aid influence the choice of defence against <b>hail</b> <b>risk?</b> c) The results of the test are confirmed by the choices of alpine fruit farms? d) How can we improve the public policy against the hail risk?Fruit farms. <b>Hail</b> <b>risk.</b> Choice of defence.

40|$|Understanding the spatiotemporal {{distribution}} pattern of <b>hail</b> disaster <b>risk</b> for cotton {{is crucial in}} mitigating hail disaster and promoting the sustainability of cotton farming. Based on such indexes as hail disaster frequency, spatiotemporal exposure, and vulnerability of cotton, we assess <b>hail</b> disaster <b>risk</b> for cotton, and analyze its spatiotemporal pattern and evolution in Mainland China from 1950 to 2009, supported by geographic information system (GIS). The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The proposed risk assessment method reveals the spatiotemporal difference of <b>hail</b> disaster <b>risk</b> for cotton at the county level. (2) <b>Hail</b> disaster <b>risk</b> for cotton is low in China, except for north of the North China Plain and the cotton-planting areas in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. From 1950 to 2009, <b>hail</b> disaster <b>risk</b> for cotton gradually increased. (3) The descending orders of <b>hail</b> disaster <b>risk</b> levels for cotton are bud stage, seedling stage, sowing and seeding stage, boll stage, and boll opening stage. The growth period with the highest risk varies across the cotton-planting areas. (4) The results of this paper are important for developing hail disaster prevention and reduction measures...|$|R

40|$|Alpine fruit farms usually insure their {{production}} (passive defense) against hail damage and rarely use anti-hail nets (active defense). To explain {{the choice between}} two alternatives for <b>hail</b> <b>risk</b> management {{in the case of}} the production of apples, we developed a model that simulates the effects of changes in the costs per hectare with and without public aids. The cost per hectare of insurance (passive defense) increases linearly with the rate of risk hail, ceteris paribus. The cost per hectare of anti hail nets (active defense) is always independent of the rate of risk. We can therefore determine the level of risk hail that leads to the break even point (BEP). To the left of the BEP is the preferred passive defense, active defense on the right. The model was then validated in three areas with different levels of risk hail. Results obtained allow evaluating how the level of <b>hail</b> <b>risk</b> influences the choice between insurance and anti-hail nets in the case of apple production. In alpine areas analyzed, the public aid moves the BEP to the right and then change the choice in favor of passive defense, perhaps because of the negative externalities (effects on the rural landscape) generated by the anti-hail nets. Since the public aid per hectare increases linearly with the rate of <b>hail</b> <b>risk,</b> farmers choose the passive defense even when the environmental matrix is almost adverse. There is, therefore, a lot of scope for improving the efficiency of choice, both in public and private sectors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of rapeseed hail insurance and chemical input decisions using individual panel data set of French farms covering the period from 1993 to 2004.

We propose a theoretical framework that integrates two statistically independent sources of risk faced by farmers of our sample <b>hail</b> <b>risk</b> and pest risk.

40|$|Naples {{metropolitan}} area, one of {{the most}} populous in Italy, is highly affected by severe convective storms all year round. Thunderstorm events are sometimes associated with hail precipitation that can cause severe damage to transport activities, especially to aviation. The aim of this work is to develop a radar-based Probability of Hail (POH) index that can help in <b>hail</b> <b>risk</b> management. To achieve this goal, an analysis of 37 thunderstorm events occurred between April 2012 and December 2014 has been carried out, using single-polarization X-Band weather radar reflectivity measurements and ground observations. In order to identify hail from radar data, a method based on VIL-Density radar product (VLD) was applied. An extensive intercomparison between the outcomes of weather radar and ground verification data has been performed using a 2 × 2 contingency table and statistical scores. The results show that hail is likely to occur when VLD exceed 2. 6 g m- 3 warning threshold. The POH index has been tested for a thunderstorm event occurred on May 26, 2012 and has proven to be particularly reliable in hail core detection...|$|E

40|$|Making {{decisions}} about handling a crop that has incurred major hail damage is difficult at best. Be sure {{to make a}} damage assessment on a block by block basis, consider marketing alternatives available to the individual grower, and re-evaluate insurance options {{as a means of}} reducing <b>risk.</b> <b>Hail</b> damage affected an estimated 7, 453 acres in Ulster, Columbia,Dutchess, and Orange Counties in 2000. Major hail events occurred in May, June, and again in August with some or-chards being affected twice. Many grow-ers faced the decision as to whether to har-vest these blocks for fresh utilization, har-vest for juice, or to leave the fruit unhar-vested. Cornell Cooperative Extension con-ducted damage assessments for the region following the May storm. Initial estimates from a grower survey indicated a loss of more than 2 million bushels of fruit, val-ued at $ 19. 8 million. The {{purpose of this article is}} to conduct a retrospective analysis of the decisions that growers made this past crop year re-garding harvesting hail damaged fruit. The emphasis of the article is to analyze what lessons were learned from the 2000 experience that will help growers make a better decision in the future when faced with the decision about how to handle a crop that has experienced significant hail damage. The economic decision rule in the case of crop damage from hail or other natu-ral disasters is simple. The grower needs to attempt to minimize subsequent losses. Thus, the economic decision is to harvest only if the expected receipts from sale of the fruit exceeds the direct expenses for the remainder of the season. Fixed costs, such as depreciation, interest, and prop-erty taxes are irrelevant to the decision, as are “sunk costs ” such as fertilizer...|$|R
5000|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk of severe weather for May 22 in the Central Plains, including {{a risk of}} strong tornadoes and destructive <b>hail.</b> A slight <b>risk</b> of severe weather was issued from May 23-26 throughout the Memorial Day weekend for various regions across the Great Plains and Midwest, including the risk for further tornadoes. The risk area was upgraded to a high risk for parts of Kansas {{later in the afternoon}} of May 22. The Storm Prediction Center stated that [...] "a regional tornado outbreak appears likely".At about 11:30 am MDT (1730 UTC) on May 22, a powerful tornado touched down in Weld County, Colorado moving between the towns of Gilcrest and Milliken, about 45 miles (72 km) north of Denver. A damage survey indicated that the tornado was a low-end EF3. Weld County officials closed U.S. 85 at Highway 60 after two semi-trailers were blown over at that location. The truck drivers were not believed to be injured. As many as 60,000 customers were without electrical power in Greeley, and a man was killed in a recreational vehicle outside of town. The tornado slammed into a business park in Windsor, reportedly flattening several buildings, and knocked a cut of railroad cars off their axles. The area was described as [...] "total destruction" [...] by an emergency responder. A 52-year-old man was killed at a campground near Greeley, while thirteen people were treated at hospitals, and more than 100 others received medical attention for minor injuries. 596 homes were damaged, with 102 deemed unsafe to occupy An EF2 struck, Laramie, where there was damage to two schools, several homes, an apartment building, a Wal-Mart, and several other businesses. The Governor of Colorado Bill Ritter {{declared a state of emergency}} and activated the Colorado National Guard in Weld County. Many more tornadoes took place in western Kansas and southwestern Nebraska later in the afternoon and evening, but most were in open country and no fatalities were reported. A few tornadoes, including an EF2, touched down as far west as southern California that evening as well.|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{determinants}} of hail insurance use of Swiss farmers, covering the period 1990 - 2009 using FADN panel data. Mixed effect logistic regression models {{are estimated to}} identify the most important farm and farmer characteristics that determine insurance use. In addition, information on local <b>hail</b> <b>risk</b> is {{taken into account in}} these models. It shows that larger farms, with specialization on crop production, and with larger local hail risks are more likely to adopt the hail insurance. Moreover, insurance users are usually older and better educated. Since the early 1990 s, Swiss agricultural policy has reduced price support and introduced general and ecological direct payments. This has led to a much higher importance of direct payments for farmers’ incomes. We find that this development has contributed to decreasing hail adoption rates in Switzerland in the considered period, due to the insurance and wealth effects of direct payments. Our results indicate that the larger the share of direct payments for total farm revenue, the more subsidies would be required to induce hail insurance adoption. Thus, agricultural policy should explicitly consider this interdependency. Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|E
40|$|Natural hazards affect human {{well-being}} {{in several}} ways. They destroy livelihoods, cause huge losses in production, reduce income and damage property. Many {{poor people in}} developing countries are especially vulnerable to natural risks, {{not only because they}} depend on agricultural production as their major source of income, but also because they are often obliged to settle in risk-prone areas such as hillsides, river basins, etc. It has become even more important to find adequate means to manage natural risks because climate change is causing many of them to increase in frequency and degree. Micro-insurance for natural risks has been proposed as a helpful tool to improve poor peoples’ risk management, and several development-cooperation projects have been initiated in order to promote micro-insurance for natural risks. However, it is not yet clear which risks are insurable in micro-insurance and which are not. This paper therefore analyses which natural risks could be covered by micro-insurance and shows how this can be done. In order to determine the natural risks that could be covered by micro-insurance, a conceptual framework has been developed that adapts current work on the insurability of risks to the case of micro-insurance. This framework is then applied to four different natural risks that can serve as examples for most other natural risks. For example, drought risk can be insured similarly to extreme fluctuations in temperature. The insurability of <b>hail</b> <b>risk,</b> in turn, is representative for storm and typhoon risks, while flood risk poses the same difficulties to micro-insurance as the risk of tsunamis, landslides and volcanic eruptions. Finally, the results from analysing the insurability of livestock diseases are equally applicable to other pests and diseases. Six criteria determine if a risk is insurable in micro-insurance or not. Different microinsurance schemes are best suited to cover the risk – depending on {{the degree to which the}} following criteria are fulfilled: First, the loss must be accidental and unintentional. If it cannot be clearly observed, whether or not the loss was unintentional, only community-based schemes can cover the risk because these schemes are better suited to prevent moral hazard. Second, the chance of loss must be calculable – by using a wide range of information about the probability of occurrence and the expected loss. Third, in order to prevent adverse selection, the insurer needs to be able to classify policyholders according to their individual risk profiles. Because community-based schemes have better access to information about the insured, they might have comparative advantages in assessing the risk profile of the insured. Fourth, the losses should be determinable and measurable at relatively low cost. If this is not possible, an index must be used to approximate losses. In most cases, only full-service insurers have the technical capacity to offer index insurance. Fifth, in order to adequately diversify the risk a sufficiently large risk pool must be formed. For highly covariant risks, for example, only large insurance companies with access to international reinsurance are able to guarantee sufficient risk pooling. And sixth, micro-insurance should be the most adequate risk-management strategy, which means that no other risk-management strategy (such as risk prevention, mitigation or coping) should be superior to it in terms of costefficiency and effectiveness. Applying this framework to natural risks shows that only losses in agricultural production can be covered by micro-insurance, while property damages cannot be covered. Differentiating by the cause of risk, the following results are derived: – Drought risk can be insured in micro-insurance by a full-service insurer. The production losses need to be approximated by an index because on-the-ground loss assessment would be too expensive and allows for moral hazard. Due to the high covariance of this risk, only large insurance companies with access to international reinsurance can cover it. – <b>Hail</b> <b>risk</b> is also insurable in micro-insurance but can only be covered by an innovative micro-insurance scheme. Since the loss assessment requires on-the-ground visits, group insurance must be introduced in order to hold down transaction costs. This risk is not currently covered by micro-insurance because large insurance companies prefer providing index-based micro-insurance, as these are easier to manage and because community-based schemes cannot cover this risk. – The risk of river flood is theoretically insurable, but requires very precise topographic data in order to prevent adverse selection: Advanced technologies have to be used in order to assess the losses in agricultural production through remote sensing. Because the precise data and technology required are not yet available in many developing countries, it is still difficult to insure river flood risk in micro-insurance. – Livestock diseases, finally, are not easily insurable, since most of them can be prevented by sound management practices. Only a very few diseases are insurable, and these risks have to be covered by community-based schemes in order to guarantee immediate loss assessment. Despite the fact that different natural risks can be covered by micro-insurance, there is room to improve the outreach and efficiency of micro-insurance for natural risks by creating an innovative micro-insurance scheme. A promising way to organise a more comprehensive scheme is a national micro-insurance scheme that incorporates community-based insurance schemes in a national umbrella organisation. In such a national micro-insurance scheme, idiosyncratic risks could be covered by the community-based schemes, while the national umbrella would be responsible for covering covariant risks. Such a comprehensive micro-insurance scheme would be able to cover a wider range of natural risks by combining the advantages of existing schemes. Idiosyncratic risks such as certain pests and diseases could be covered, as well as covariant risks such as hail, storms, river floods, tsunamis and landslides. Droughts and fluctuations in temperature could still be covered by index-based micro-insurance. That way, the scheme would not only be able to cover in one contract those risks that have already been insured in micro-insurance, but could also extend the range of insurable risks to cover such risks as hail and storms that are theoretically insurable in micro-insurance, but for which no coverage yet exists...|$|E
