However, {{there is a}} lot of controversy over the use and consequences of <b>hidden</b> <b>orders,</b> since they embrace a complex interaction between order exposure risk, market liquidity and transparency. Our study focuses on the motives of submitting undisclosed limit orders to trade as well as on the market response when the presence of these orders is publicly revealed. Using data from the Spanish Stock Exchange, we find that <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> emerge in periods of intense trading activity and extremely high liquidity. Our results find no evidence that the undisclosed volume is used as a defensive strategy against parasitic traders. On the contrary, we provide support to the notion that liquidity suppliers use <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> to mitigate adverse selection costs.

40|$|This paper investigates why traders <b>hide</b> their <b>orders</b> and {{how other}} traders respond to hidden depth. Using a logit model, we provide {{empirical}} findings suggesting that traders use <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> to manage both exposure risk and picking off risk. Using probit models, {{we show that}} <b>hidden</b> depth increases <b>order</b> aggressiveness. Our interpretation of this empirical evidence is threefold. First, hidden depth detection is possible and frequent. Second, when traders detect hidden volume at the best opposite quote, they strategically adjust their order submission to seize the opportunity for depth improvement. Third, traders' response when hidden depth is detected suggests either {{that they do not}} associate <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> with informed trading or that the risk of trading with an informed trader is widely offset by the opportunity for depth improvement...|$|R

40|$|Large {{trades in}} a {{financial}} market are usually split into smaller parts and traded incrementally over extended periods of time. We address these large trades as <b>hidden</b> <b>orders.</b> In order to identify and characterize <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> we fit <b>hidden</b> Markov models to the time series of {{the sign of the}} tick by tick inventory variation of market members of the Spanish Stock Exchange. Our methodology probabilistically detects trading sequences, which are characterized by a net majority of buy or sell transactions. We interpret these patches of sequential buying or selling transactions as proxies of the traded <b>hidden</b> <b>orders.</b> We find that the time, volume and number of transactions size distributions of these patches are fat tailed. Long patches are characterized by a high fraction of market orders and a low participation rate, while short patches have a large fraction of limit orders and a high participation rate. We observe the existence of a buy-sell asymmetry in the number, average length, average fraction of market orders and average participation rate of the detected patches. The detected asymmetry is clearly depending on the local market trend. We also compare the hidden Markov models patches with those obtained with the segmentation method used in Vaglica et al. (2008) and we conclude that the former ones can be interpreted as a partition of the latter ones. ...|$|R

40|$|Competitive {{international}} financial exchanges can distinguish themselves by offering {{different types of}} trading features, {{such as the ability}} to partially <b>hide</b> an <b>order</b> 2 ̆ 7 s quantity. Although <b>order</b> <b>hiding</b> is generally assumed to be an advantageous mechanism, it has undergone very little empirical analysis, due in part to a lack of appropriate data. The Paris Bourse does provide limit order trading records on a second-by-second basis, but its data set omits such critical elements as the time of order cancellation and the electronic order book 2 ̆ 7 s composition. In this dissertation, I develop a method to reconstruct the internal states of the Bourse, then explore the role and impact of <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. ^ In Chapter One, I discuss the reconstruction itself: the Bourse 2 ̆ 7 s electronic trading system is reverse-engineered and a working model is constructed. By running historical streams of orders through this model, it is possible to simulate the internal state of the system over time, replicating the markets hidden microstructural dynamics. ^ In Chapter Two, I conduct an empirical analysis of a year 2 ̆ 7 s worth of reconstructed second-by-second data for representative French stocks, testing a series of hypotheses relevant to <b>order</b> <b>hiding.</b> I find that <b>order</b> <b>hiding</b> decreases the immediate impact that a limit order has on the market while reducing the amount of undercutting; however, <b>order</b> <b>hiding</b> also increases the probability that the order will not execute in full. Because it slows down the interaction of orders with the market, <b>order</b> <b>hiding</b> can be a useful tool for limit order traders wishing to mitigate adverse selection risk. ^ In Chapter Three, I construct a theoretic model of a limit order market in which traders use <b>order</b> <b>hiding</b> as a strategic mechanism in the struggle for liquidity. Their interaction can be represented as a dynamic game of incomplete information, or signaling game, in which traders try to deduce the true depths contained in the book, information which has a critical effect on their probabilities of execution. I show that the equilibrium of this game is consistent with observed facts. ...|$|R

Several recent experiments on the electronic structure have shown that the Fermi surface in the <b>hidden</b> <b>order</b> phase is quite close to the result of band-structure calculations within the framework of itinerant electron picture assuming the antiferromagnetism. This provides strong evidence for the band folding along the c-axis with the ordering vector of (0 0 1), corresponding to broken translational symmetry. In addition to this, there is growing evidence for fourfold rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden-order phase from measurements of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy and the effective mass anisotropy in the electronic structure, as well as the orthorhombic lattice distortion. This broken fourfold symmetry gives a stringent constraint that the symmetry of the <b>hidden</b> <b>order</b> parameter should belong to the degenerate E-type irreducible representation.

40|$|It {{is known}} {{that the impact of}} {{transactions}} on stock price (market impact) is a concave function {{of the size of the}} order, but there exists little quantitative theory that suggests why this is so. I develop a quantitative theory for the market impact of <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> (orders that reflect the true intention of buying and selling) that matches the empirically measured result and that reproduces some of the non-trivial and universal properties of stock returns (returns are percent changes in stock price). The theory is based on a simple premise, that the stock market can be modeled in a mechanical way - as a device that translates order flow into an uncorrelated price stream. Given that order flow is highly autocorrelated, this premise requires that market impact (1) depends on past order flow and (2) is asymmetric for buying and selling. I derive the specific form for the dependence in (1) by assuming that current liquidity responds to information about all currently active <b>hidden</b> <b>orders</b> (liquidity is a measure of the price response to a transaction of a given size). This produces an equation that suggests market impact should scale logarithmically with total order size. Using data from the London Stock Exchange I empirically measure market impact and show that the result matches the theory. Also using empirical data, I qualitatively specify the asymmetry of (2). Putting all results together, I form a model for market impact that reproduces three universal properties of stock returns - that returns are uncorrelated, that returns are distributed with a power law tail, and that the magnitude of returns is highly autocorrelated (also known as clustered volatility) ...|$|R
