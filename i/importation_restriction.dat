5000|$|However, the Supreme Court did {{not decide}} the issue where gray-market {{products}} are initially manufactured abroad and then imported into the US. The Court indicated that {{importation of goods}} made outside the US could perhaps be barred under ยง602(a), since such goods would not be [...] "lawfully made under this title." [...] Such products might be lawfully made, either by the copyright owner or a licensee, but {{they would not be}} lawfully made under US copyright law. Rather, they would be lawfully made under the copyright laws of the other country; and the first-sale doctrine would therefore not limit the ยง602 <b>importation</b> <b>restriction.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some {{countries}} may have parallel <b>importation</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{that allow the}} copyright holder to control the aftermarket. This may mean for example that {{a copy of a}} book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as exhaustion of rights in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to patent and trademark rights.
