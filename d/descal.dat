5000|$|Captain Barder: Leader of the <b>Descal</b> Fleet, was {{eventually}} {{revealed to be}} a robot before his ship was destroyed in a battle with Sazer-X.|$|E
50|$|When Neo <b>Descal</b> appears, {{they begin}} by {{flattering}} Aqual as their honored descendant to gain her trust, {{but this is}} simply because they cannot kill her without erasing themselves from history. As time goes on, she is relentlessly bullied and humiliated by Neo Descal- especially Grouza until Aqual snaps and attempts to assassinate both leaders. She fails in killing Grouza, and only manages to wound Garade. She is saved from a vengeful Garade {{by the arrival of}} King Neo <b>Descal</b> himself.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Enrique <b>Descals</b> {{described}} an aquatic hyphomycete Tricladiopsis flagelliformis growing from submerged leaves {{found in the}} shoreline of Windermere (Cumbria, England), which he tentatively assigned as the anamorph state of Coccomyces dentatus. The specific epithet flagelliformis (from the Latin flagellum [...] "whip" [...] and formis [...] "shape") refers to the [...] "whip-like" [...] form of the conidium.|$|R
50|$|Space Pirates {{from the}} future, who forced {{their way through}} the {{wormhole}} in order to back up <b>Descal's</b> Three Shoguns after Barder was destroyed and ensure that their plan to take over the Earth in the past was successful. Although they had open disdain for the Three Shoguns, they risk not killing them as it would erase themselves from history.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is {{supporting}} gain relevance of vocational guidance {{into the frame}} of University Education. In order to a better planning of this guidance {{we need to know}} his contents evaluating student vocational interests of each center. The aim of the study is to analyze the indicators of Psychology students vocational behavior and his evolution and comparing those results with data of another students population. Methodology. The 329 psychology students participants from the University of Salamanca (248 in the second year and 81 in the fifth) answered the questionnaire of university biodata (Rocabert, 2005). In all cases we took a significance level of ? = 0. 05 carrying out samples comparison tests using U de Mann-Whitney techniques and contingency analysis. Results: The present study found significant differences between second and fifth psychology grade students and with general university population data collected by Rocabert, <b>Descals</b> and Gomez (2007). In general, psychology students begin their degrees with a high level interest and motivated; they are making decisions based on the academic specialty they want to work in. However, for last year students group (fith year students) we detected a lower satisfaction in their studies, more difficulties in deciding {{what they want to do}} and a greater demand of information in order to choose the advisablest option for them. Conclusions. Despite the high motivation of psychology students, the nearer is his integration into the job market the higher is the need of guidance to help them to take decisions concerning specialization or the professional world...|$|R

5000|$|Garade (Gareido): Garade was the {{commander}} of the fleet, and an extremely powerful, though grumpy warrior. He possessed the ability to split into three clones of himself, each equal in power to a member of Sazer-X. He is killed when King Neo <b>Descal</b> arrives from the future and kills Garade for his failures.|$|E
5000|$|King Neo <b>Descal</b> (Neo Desukaru): Neo Descal's ruler, he sent Garade and Grouza to {{the past}} to ensure the Neo <b>Descal</b> fleet's existence. But due to their failures, he {{personally}} travelled {{back in time to}} ensure a future of darkness. Instead of using the Cosmo Capsules to plunge the world into darkness as history dictated, he planned on constructing a massive machine on the Moon called the Dark-Alumer (Dark Armor in Filipino dubbed version) to accomplish this task. He transformed into Black Lio to battle against Lio-Sazer inside the giant monster. He was defeated by Lio-Sazer but however his memory was still alive. Lio-Sazer, Eagle-Sazer, Beetle-Sazer, and Blaird destroyed the inside part of the monster (Neo Descal's memory) while Remy piloted Great Lio to use the finishing move [...] "Howling Crush" [...] to destroy Neo Descal's monster to make darkness disappear.|$|E
40|$|Les auteurs comparent les communautés d'hyphomycètes aquatiques récoltés dans l'écume de 7 cours d'eau du Béarn et des Landes. L'abondance de spores observées dans les deux régions diffère considérablement (174 - 1175 spores/µl en Béarn et 2 - 57 spores/µl dans les Landes) {{tandis que}} les {{variations}} de richesse spécifique apparaissent faibles. L'influence de la végétation riveraine et du pH de l'eau est discutée. Des expériences de dégradation in vitro montrent que des souches isolées de Tetracladium marchalianum, Heliscus lugdunensis et dans une moindre mesure Anguillospora longissima présentent une activité cellulolytique. T. marchalianum et H. lugdunensis, participent activement à la décomposition de litière de saule blanc, avec respectivement 21, 7 et 18, 2 % de dégradation après 5 semaines à 18 °C. Aquatic hyphomycete communities from the foam of seven streams in the Bearn and Landes regions of France were compared at four different dates. The {{total number of}} species was similar in the two regions, but common species (> 5 spores/µl) in the Bearn were twice as abundant as in the Landes. Mean spore concentrations in the Bearn and Landes streams were in a ratio of 10  : 1. In the Bearn, spore concentration {{and the number of}} fungal species increased considerably in autumn, subsequent to the fall of leaf litter into the streams. Analysis of variance of spore concentrations (original or transformed data) in the two regions showed that date, station and the interaction of these two factors were highly significant parameters (P ANOVA < 0. 0001). Alatospora acuminate was the commonest species both in the Bearn (77 % annual mean) and in the Landes (41 %). After A. acuminata, Clavatospora stellata (7 %) and Tetracladium marchalianum (4 %,) in the Bearn, Flagellospora curvula (28 %) and Clavastospora longibrachiata (20 %) in the Landes were the dominant species of the mycoflora. Five species new to France were noted : Actinospora megalospora Ingold, Camposporium pellucidum (Grave) Hugues, Diplocladiella scalaroides Arnaud, Flabellospora acuminata <b>Descals</b> and Triscelophorus monosporus Ingold. The difference in fungal richness between the two regions was suggested to be due to the composition of the riparian vegetation, the phenology of the litter fall, the presence (or absence) of plant matter accumulation in the stream, and the pH of the stream water. Litter deposits in the Landes streams were rare and made up exclusivey of pine needles, the few deciduous leaves which fall being exported to surrounding lakes and to the ocean. Water pH was always low (5. 0 - 5. 5). The riparian vegetation of the Bearn streams, on the contrary, was abundant and varied Cash, common locust-tree, alder, willow, oak, chestnut, poplar). Moreover the neutral or weakly acid pH of the Bearn streams (6. 3 - 7. 0) seemed to favour fungal diversity (cf. BÄRLOCHER and ROSSET, 1981; WOOD-EGGENSCHWILLER and BARLOCHER, 1983). Single spore isolates of Anguillospora langissima (de Wild.) Ingold, Heliscus lugdunensis Saccardo et Therry and Tetraclacium marchalianum De Wild were obtained from decomposing leaf litter in the Bearn streams. In laboratory experiments, the degradation activity of each species was tested both on sterilized paper cellulose and white willow leaf litter. The cellutolytic activity of fungal cultures was significant when compared with controls (t test). After 5 weeks at 18 °C, mass loss was 8. 6 % for A. longissima and 10. 0 % for H. lugdunensis and T. marchalianum. Aeration stimulated cellulose degradation for T. marchalianum (16. 6 %) only. With willow leaves as substrate, degradation was greater for T. marchalianum (22. 7 %) than for N. lugdunensis (11. 8 %) and A. longissima (6. 2 %, non-significant) ...|$|R

Ad and Kane are joined by Takuto Andou, whose grandfather met Captain Shark, leader of the resistance, as a young man and was left with a Knuckle Cross to allow his grandson in 2005 to become the third member of the team known as Sazer-X.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a Decentralized Shared Calendar (abbreviated as <b>DeSCal),</b> a distributed application which provides users a decentralized infrastructure to share their calendar events with selected users in a dynamic group. Although being a distributed application, <b>DeSCal</b> is as responsive as a personal calendar. It achieves this high responsiveness by keeping a local copy of the shared calendar at each participating user. Consistency of these replicated copies of the shared calendar is carried out in a decentralized fashion using Operational Transformation (OT) approach. OT allows users to concurrently modify the shared calendar and exchange their updates in any order since it ensures the convergence of copies of shared calendar in all cases. To prevent unauthorized access by illegal users, <b>DeSCal</b> is endowed with access control mechanism on the local copy of the shared calendar. It employs a flexible access control model based on replicating the access data-structure at each user site to overcome the latency problem. Also, access control on shared calendar events is dynamic i. e. users are able to change the access rights on their shared calendar events at any point of time after {{the creation of an}} event. In short, <b>DeSCal</b> is totally decentralized, scalable and self-configurable i. e. no need of a third party to manage it...|$|E
