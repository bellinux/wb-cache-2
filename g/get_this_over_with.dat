40|$|Transcription begins] Sunday 19 November 1944 In Germany My adorable one, Today I {{received}} {{your letter}} dated 6 November 1944. Darling, will you also include in your letters the date when you received my letters? I presume {{you are doing}} this. It seems that my getting on the “Red Ball Express” and then reverting back to the outfit confused you and I can’t see as I blame you. No doubt the air mail will be beating the V-mail since you used the “Red Ball” address on the V-mail {{and it will take}} time to catch up. Today was a beautiful day as far as weather was concerned. I might add it was a good day even for our military activity. The temperature was in the 70 s and I went outside merely in a jacket. I can laugh when I think of you back in Shaker Hts., Ohio with that wonderful weather, and I hope, bubsie, you don’t have car trouble again. I’ve still to receive your cablegram. You know my address is “Ammody. ” Do you want me to send you cablegrams? This morning I went on a little trip to get some information for my Division Artillery Comander. I hob-knobbed with Col’s of different outfit[s] and even spoke with an English Brigadier (Brig-Gen.). By Joe, he was a pleasant chap with a good-sized pot belly. Sweetheart, I’m very muched [sic] surprised at the division in general. It’s a darn good outfit in spite of itself. You know that our infantry consists primarily of A. S. T. P. college boys which remind[s] me I’ve got to run down Nate Morris and see how he’s getting along. I know that my finances account was all “screwed up” but I’ve gotten it straighten[ed] out finally. The allotment[s] have been straightened out once and for all. You see, I hadn’t been paid for close to 2 months which added to the general confusion. I hope now things will run more smoothly[;] however, if by the next payment things don’t straighten out with you, let me know, darling. ETO stands for European Theatre of Operations, O. K. ? Sweetheart, I’m making a request for film No. 127 for my camera. Get me as much as you can. (My new camera hasn’t shown up yet.). I’ve given up all ideas of promotion and honestly I don’t care one way or another. My main concern is <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> and coming back to you to raise little ones.

40|$|This is a {{personalized}} review of {{programs designed to}} assess student learning outcomes (SLOs) in higher education. In the last 30 þ years, {{there have been few}} changes in the basic principles and premises. We assess SLOs for the purpose of improving teaching and learning. Although content area knowledge is important, other goals such as enhancing critical thinking skills, understanding diversity of all types, acting ethically, and communicating in appropriate ways for different audiences are equally important. Rapid increases in the use of technology have created a renewed emphasis on understanding how students learn best and thus the assessment of SLOs has moved to the center of contemporary educational debate. In addition, the goal of creating psychologically literate citizens is propelling a broad range of outcome measures. Keywords assessment, student learning outcomes, value-added assessments Which of the following images comes to mind when you hear the term assessment? A. Bubble-in scantron forms that are damp and smeary from sweat and erasures. B. Tall stacks of essay questions waiting for you to grade, and grade, and grade. C. Anxious students writing furiously before ‘‘time is up. ’’ D. The specter of a bad grade. E. All of the above except C. F. Either two of the above or none of the above. G. Just shoot me now and <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> No one should {{be surprised to learn that}} faculty (in general) have not enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to see if their students measure up to those at other universities or to the expectations of their professors. The assessment of student outcomes is one of the most contentious topics in higher edu-cation. In this article, I look back at my involvement in student outcomes assessment that spans close to 30 years, and I use my cloudy crystal ball to look forward to what I expect to be major trends in the coming decades.

5000|$|Lilly {{was brought}} in as an elderly {{companion}} for the long-running character Dot Cotton, played by June Brown; the characters move in together following the destruction of their block of flats. Described as [...] "the silver-haired gossip", Lilly {{was intended to be}} a [...] "comedy double act" [...] <b>with</b> Dot, taking <b>over</b> the place of Dot's former sparring partner, Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). Storylines concentrate on the obvious personality differences between Dot and Lilly, and the problems this causes. The majority of Lilly's storylines are comic, for which she has been praised by Merle Brown, critic for the Daily Record. She is also used to highlight a more serious issue, when in 1999 she is mugged by a criminal called Gareth, and subsequently becomes agoraphobic, refusing to go out. Though she eventually <b>gets</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> Dot's assistance.|$|R
5000|$|Janine {{returns in}} 1999 {{to live with}} Frank and his new wife, Peggy (Barbara Windsor). She sets about coming between them, {{constantly}} trying to antagonise Frank with rebellious behaviour. She sleeps with Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) to infuriate her father then humiliates Jamie by spreading rumours about his inadequate prowess in bed. Frank abandons Janine in 2000 after the breakdown of his marriage to Peggy. Homeless, Janine is taken in by Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards); they start a business together as estate agents. Terry sees Janine as a surrogate daughter but her constant manipulation tests his patience. Janine uses him for money, deliberately dresses like his late daughter Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), ruins his relationships with women and tries to seduce him. Janine also has a relationship with Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) until he runs out of money. This behaviour infuriates Terry but Janine starts using cocaine, pestering Terry for money to feed her habit. When he refuses, she resorts to sex with her drug dealer, Lee Vickers (Dermot Keaney), in exchange for cocaine; Vickers beats Terry up {{when he tries to}} warn him off. When he sees Janine's lack of remorse, Terry throws her out and leaves Walford, ignoring her pleas for him to stay. Owing Vickers money for drugs, Janine turns to prostitution under the pseudonym [...] "Blonde Bombshell". One of her clients, Matt Lindsay (Matthew Steer), falls in love with her and proposes but attempts suicide when he learns she is still a prostitute. Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) begins using her services but she blackmails him, threatening to tell his wife Laura (Hannah Waterman) unless he pays her. Depressed, Janine begins drinking heavily and nearly dies of alcohol poisoning. She gives up prostitution, but when Laura discovers that she has been having sex with Ian, she throws a pan of boiling milk in Janine's face. Janine becomes agoraphobic as a result — she eats dog food because she is too afraid {{to go out and buy}} groceries. She eventually <b>gets</b> <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> Billy's help. Janine hopes to rekindle their relationship but is devastated when he tells her that he is in love with Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth). Her attempts to ruin their blossoming romance fail.|$|R
