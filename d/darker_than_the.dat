5|$|M. c. cyaneus, the {{nominate}} subspecies {{described in}} 1782, is found throughout Tasmania. Birds are larger and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> mainland subspecies, with males having a deeper azure blue coloration.

5|$|S. t. jewetti {{is smaller}} and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other subspecies. It occurs on the coastal {{slope of the}} Cascade Mountains from {{southern}} British Columbia to central California, overlapping with the range of C. t. pallidus.|$|E
5|$|P. c. sanfordi {{is found}} in Newfoundland. Harry C. Oberholser {{described}} it in 1914 from a specimen collected by a Dr. Sanford, whom he named it after. Oberholser reported that it was smaller and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> nominate race P. c. canadensis and more closely resembled P. c. nigricapillus.|$|E

5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill {{shape of the}} young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E
5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of A.subrubescens are not much <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E
5|$|Join Hands {{took the}} topic of the First World War as its inspiration. Musically, it is <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> band's debut album The Scream: it sounds more claustrophobic and more haunting. It was the last album with the band's first {{recorded}} line-up, as guitarist John McKay and drummer Kenny Morris quit the group after a disagreement {{at the beginning of the}} British Join Hands tour, on the day of the album's release.|$|E

5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> common impala; melanism {{is responsible for}} the black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E
5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It {{is found in}} animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Batman Forever {{went through}} a few major edits before its release. Originally <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> final product, the movie's {{original}} length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous Batman films were given special edition DVD releases {{on the same day}} as the Batman Begins DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{discovered}} the holotype female from an M. vindex nest on 23 March 1955 northwest from Wagin at Badjanning Rocks, Western Australia. The specimen is currently {{housed in the}} Western Australian Museum in Perth. Two dealated paratype females were also collected with the holotype, looking very similar to each other except for the mandibles and colouration. The mandibular dentition varies among the three, {{and one of the}} paratypes is <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> holotype. In 1991, a published journal reviewing the species groups assigned M. inquilina to the M. cephalotes species group. However, entomologists placed it in the M. gulosa species group one month after placing it in the M. cephalotes species group.|$|E
5|$|Development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 began around March and April 2010 {{and lasted}} about {{one and a}} half years. The game was {{unveiled}} at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in January 2011. Many of the key designers remained in their roles from the previous game, and developer tri-Ace was hired to help with the game's design, art, and programming. The development team wanted to exceed Final Fantasy XIII in every aspect while making the story's tone mysterious and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous game. The game builds upon the Paradigm Shift battle system used in Final Fantasy XIII and includes a less linear overall design.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E

Overall, the chemical composition of the surface, especially in the dark areas, may be close to that seen on D-type asteroids, whose surfaces are made of carbonaceous material.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat was}} a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, {{which was not}} contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The {{forehead}} was brown, <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> face, and the upper lip and patch {{in front of the}} eyes were lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.|$|E
5|$|The muzzle is {{narrow and}} long. The lower eyelid {{contains}} a large, transparent disk. The head is olive-brown. There are black scales {{with a white}} border between the eyes and the ears. The body is somewhat <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> head and covered with irregular black and white spots above and is bluish white below. The limbs are yellowish white below. The tail is light brown above, but has two rows of darker spots, and yellowish white below. Snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in), head length 10mm (0.39in), head width 6.5mm (0.26in), length of the body 33mm (1.3in), length of the forelimb 15mm (0.59in), length of the hindlimb 23mm (0.91in), and length of the (incomplete) tail 40mm (1.6in).|$|E

5|$|With a forearm {{length of}} 50 to 56mm (2.0 to 2.2in) in males and 46 to 53mm (1.8 to 2.1in) in females, {{this is a}} {{medium-sized}} bat. Its fur color is variable, ranging from reddish brown to gray, but it is generally <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> species in the closely related genus Paratriaenops which also occur on Madagascar. The skull contains a pronounced swelling around the nose and the second upper premolar is displaced outside the toothrow. The maximum frequency of the echolocation call averages 94.2kHz and the species can easily be recognized {{on the basis of}} its call.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, {{in the hope of}} reducing the risk of being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E
