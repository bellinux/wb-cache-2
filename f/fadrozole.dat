Eggs in the rhIGF-I-injected groups showed the mode of hatching time at the 480 th hour of incubation, 12 hours earlier compared to the other groups, with no statistically significant difference in mortality and hatchability. On Day 1 and 42 of production, 90 % of genetically female chicks were masculinized using <b>Fadrozole</b> treatment, while 100 % female-to-male phenotypic sex reversal was observed in the Fadrozole+rhIGF-I group. <b>Fadrozole</b> equalized the body weight of both genders, although rhIGF-I was effective on the body weight of male chicks only.

40|$|Background: In a phase III {{randomized}} trial, {{we compared}} the effectiveness and tolerability of <b>fadrozole</b> (CGS 16949 A), a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, to tamoxifen as first-line endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Patients and methods: Two hundred twelve eligible patients were randomized to receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily, or <b>fadrozole</b> 1 mg twice daily orally until disease progression or the advent of undue toxicity. The treatments were to be discontinued upon disease progression. Results: Prognostic factors were well balanced between the treatment groups, except for sites of metastatic disease. Fadrozole-treated patients had significantly more visceral, especially liver, involvement and less bone-dominant disease. Response rates for <b>fadrozole</b> and tamoxifen were similar, 20 % and 27 % (95 % Confidence Limits (CL) : 13 %- 29 % and 21 %- 35 %), respectively. Time to treatment failure was longer in patients randomized to tamoxifen (8. 5 months for tamoxifen vs. 6. 1 months for <b>fadrozole),</b> but did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for prognostic factors (P= 0. 09). <b>Fadrozole,</b> for which a significantly lower percentage of clinically relevant toxic effects (WHO toxicity gradeĳ 2) was recorded (27 % vs. 13 % respectively; P= 0. 009), was better tolerated than tamoxifen. Severe cardiovascular events including 3 fatalities were seen only in patients treated with tamoxifen. Eighty-two patients crossed over to tamoxifen and 66 patients to <b>fadrozole.</b> Crossover endocrine therapy led to response or stable disease in 64 % of the patients. The overall survival times of the two treatment groups were similar.

40|$|Both 17 pestradiol (E 2) and {{testosterone}} (T) {{were shown}} to inhibit in vitro pituitary LH secretion in the turtle Trachemys scripta. Since T was approximately 500 times less potent than E 2, and S 5 x-dihydrotestosterone was even less active than T, the inhibitory action of T may result from its aromatization to estrogen. We utilized both in vivo and in vitro approaches to elucidate the roles of T and estrogen in the negative feedback of pituitary LH secretion. Gonadectomy of adult (vitellogenic) females signif-icantly elevated plasma LH. Adult females treated with <b>fadrozole</b> (an aromatase inhibitor) with or without daily injections of keox-ifene (an antiestrogen) also showed an increase in plasma LH to a level comparable to that observed in gonadectomized females, whereas plasma LH levels of juvenile females treated with <b>fadrozole</b> remained undetectable. In vitro LH secretion in response to GnRH in juvenile females was significantly inhibited by 48 -h exposure to 50 ng/ml T or 100 pg/ml E 2. Both <b>fadrozole</b> (200 t.

Reproductive measures, plasma vitellogenin and gene expression data for the brain isoform of aromatase (cytP 19 B), vitellogenin precursors and transferrin provided evidence supporting the efficacy of the <b>fadrozole</b> exposure.

40|$|The Fish Sexual Development Test (FSDT) is a non-reproductive test {{to assess}} {{adverse effects of}} {{endocrine}} disrupting chemicals. With the present study {{it was intended to}} evaluate whether gene expression end-points would serve as predictive markers of endocrine disruption in a FSDT. For proof-of-concept, a FSDTaccording to the OECD TG 234 was conducted with the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor <b>fadrozole</b> (testconcentrations: 10 µg/L, 32 µg/L, 100 µg/L) using zebrafish (Danio rerio). Gene expression analyses using quantitative RT-PCR were included at 48 h, 96 h, 28 days and 63 days post fertilization (hpf, dpf). The selection of genes aimed at finding molecular endpoints which could be directly linked to the adverse apical effects of aromatase inhibition. The most prominent effects of <b>fadrozole</b> exposure on the sexual development of zebrafish were a complete sex ratio shift towards males and an acceleration of gonad maturation already at low <b>fadrozole</b> concentrations (10 µg/L). Due to the specific inhibition of the aromatase enzyme (Cyp 19) by <b>fadrozole</b> and thus, the conversion of C 19 -androgens to C 18 -estrogens, the steroid hormone balance controlling the sex ratio of zebrafish was altered. The resulting key event is the regulation of directly estrogen-responsive genes. Subsequently, gene expression of vitellogenin 1 (vtg 1) and of the aromatase cyp 19 a 1 b isoform (cyp 19 a 1 b), were down-regulated upon <b>fadrozole</b> treatment compared to controls. For example, mRNA levels of vtg 1 were down-regulated compared to the controls as early as 48 hpf and 96 hpf. Further regulated genes cumulated in pathways suggested to be controlled by endocrine mechanisms, like the steroid and terpenoid synthesis pathway (e. g. mevalonate (diphospho) decarboxylase (mvd), lanosterol synthase (2, 3 -oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase; lss), methylsterol monooxy-genase 1 (sc 4 mol)) and in lipid transport/metabolic processes (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (star),apolipoprotein Eb (apoEb)). Taken together, this study demonstrated that the existing Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) for aromatase inhibition in fish can be translated to the life-stage of sexual differentiation.

40|$|The {{specific}} role of oestrogen in follicular maturation, ovulation and early embryonic development was investigated using <b>Fadrozole</b> (CGS 16949 A), a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, to block oestrogen synthesis specifically and effectively in experimental animals. Induced and normal cyclical follicular maturation {{as well as}} normal and hCG/LH-induced ovulation were relatively unaffected by significantly depleting oestrogen in all animals (hamsters, rabbits, monkeys) studied other than rats. <b>Fadrozole</b> treatment significantly {{reduced the number of}} healthy antral follicles produced and the ovulatory response to exogenous hCG of immature rats primed with pregnant mares' serum gonadotrophin. The effect was specific, in that exogenously administered oestrogen reversed the blockade. Depletion of oestrogen, starting early in pro-oestrus in hamsters, had no effect on ovulation, oocyte maturation and fertilization, as normal implantation sites were seen on day 6 after coitus. In rabbits, oestrogen depletion during the periovulatory phase affected oviductal morphology and function. Although fertilization was not impaired, early embryo development {{did not appear to be}} normal. In monkeys, oestrogen depletion during the follicular phase did not lead to a block of follicular maturation or ovulation but resulted in a significant reduction in secretion of cervical mucus. Administration of either <b>Fadrozole</b> or Tamoxifen during the early luteal phase in cyclic monkeys that were allowed to mate prevented implantation and this appears to be due to impaired fertilization or faulty embryo development.

40|$|The {{expression}} of aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens from precursor androgens, is {{increased in the}} brain after injury, suggesting that aromatase {{may be involved in}} neuroprotection. In the present study, the effect of inactivating aromatase has been assessed in a model of neurodegeneration induced by the systemic administration of neurotoxins. Domoic acid, at a dose that is not neurotoxic in intact male mice, induced significant neuronal loss in the hilus of the hippocampal formation of mice with reduced levels of aromatase substrates as a result of gonadectomy. Furthermore, the aromatase substrate testosterone, as well as its metabolite estradiol, the product of aromatase, were able to protect hilar neurons from domoic acid. In contrast, dihydrotestosterone, the 5 α-reduced metabolite of testosterone and a nonaromatizable androgen, was not. These findings suggest that aromatization of testosterone to estradiol may be involved in the neuroprotective action of testosterone in this experimental model. In addition, aromatase knockout mice showed significant neuronal loss after injection of a low dose of domoic acid, while control littermates did not, indicating that aromatase deficiency increases the vulnerability of hilar neurons to neurotoxic degeneration. The effect of aromatase on neuroprotection was also tested in male rats treated systemically with the specific aromatase inhibitor <b>fadrozole</b> and injected with kainic acid, a well characterized neurotoxin for hilar neurons in the rat. <b>Fadrozole</b> enhanced the neurodegenerative effect of kainic acid in intact male rats and this effect was counterbalanced by the administration of estradiol. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of testosterone against kainic acid in castrated male rats was blocked by <b>fadrozole.</b> These findings suggest that neuroprotection by aromatase is due to the formation of estradiol from its precursor testosterone. Finally, a role for local cerebral aromatase in neuroprotection is indicated by the fact that intracerebral administration of <b>fadrozole</b> enhanced kainic acid induced neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of intact male rats. These findings indicate that aromatase deficiency decreases the threshold for neurodegeneration and that local cerebral aromatase is neuroprotective. Brain aromatase may therefore represent a new target for therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative diseases. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons. Inc. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

PHYSIOL BEHAV 64 (5) 723 – 731, 1998. —Sexual behaviors in green anoles are regulated by steroid hormones. Androgens activate the display of masculine courtship and copulatory behaviors, and estradiol activates feminine receptivity. Testosterone can also facilitate receptivity in females. The present {{study was conducted to}} test the role of converting testosterone to estradiol (aromatization) in the regulation of sexual and aggressive behaviors. Adult males and females were gonadectomized and implanted with a Silastic capsule containing either testosterone propionate (T) or estradiol benzoate (E) or with an empty (blank, BL) capsule. T- and BL-treated animals were then given injections of either <b>Fadrozole</b> (FAD, an aromatase inhibitor) or saline (SAL). E-treated animals received saline injections. Each individual was then tested alternately with male and female stimulus animals. Overall, T stimulated masculine sexual behaviors and receptivity, but the androgen had little effect on the display of aggressive behaviors. The inhibition of aromatase activity by treatment with <b>Fadrozole</b> eliminated the effect of T on receptivity. In contrast, <b>Fadrozole</b> treatment had no effect on mounting behavior or the frequency of courtship bouts. The inhibition of aromatase activity did increase the number of dewlap extensions (the display of a red throat fan) during courtship. These results suggest that the metabolism of testosterone to estradiol is a mechanism through which androgens can facilitate receptivity, and that such aromatization of testosterone is not required for the display of masculine sexual behaviors. In addition, females performed courtship and mounting behaviors less frequently than males, suggesting that an organizational component to steroid hormone regulation of sexual behaviors may exist in the anole. © 1998 Elsevie...|$|E

We investigated the effects of finasteride and <b>fadrozole</b> known to induce female- and male-biased sexual development on Silurana tropicalis brain mRNA levels. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of transcript levels of sex steroid- and thyroid hormone-related genes in the brain demonstrated that in finasteride-induced intersex animals, the mRNA levels of aromatase, estrogen receptor α, thyroid hormone receptor β and deiodinase type 3 were higher compared to both control males and females. Furthermore, finasteride-induced intersex animals expressed higher mRNA levels of both androgen receptor and estrogen receptor β compared to control females and to control males, respectively. Furthermore, <b>fadrozole</b> did not affect any of the genes analyzed in the brain but was effective at reducing aromatase activity. Intersex animals display different profiles of transcript levels in the brain whether the intersex condition was induced by an anti-androgen or anti-estrogen treatment.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests a neuroprotective role for oestrogens following {{damage to the}} vertebrate brain. Aromatase (oestrogen synthase) is rapidly transcribed and translated in glial cells around areas of neural damage in several vertebrates. However, the potential neuroprotection afforded by locally upregulated glial aromatase immediately surrounding the injury remains to be tested. Towards this end, individual birds sustained penetrating mechanical injuries via a needle that contained either vehicle or the aromatase inhibitor <b>fadrozole</b> into contralateral hemispheres. Seventy-two hours later, the size of neural injury (as assessed by the extent of necrotic tissue) {{and the number of}} apoptotic cells around the injuries were evaluated. The size of injury in the hemisphere injected with <b>fadrozole</b> was significantly larger than the injury caused by vehicle injection. Furthermore, a greater number of apoptotic nuclei were found around the fadrozole-associated lesion relative to vehicle. Finally, constitutively expressed, neuronal aromatase close to the injury site did not differ between hemispheres. We conclude that local inhibition of glial aromatase immediately around the site of injury plays a neuroprotective role in the songbird brain and this protection involves apoptotic pathways. Local up-regulation of glial aromatase may play a pivotal role in the limitation of secondary damage and/or the acceleration of restorative processes following injury to th...|$|E
40|$|Sex steroids {{are major}} drivers of sexual {{development}} and {{also responsible for}} the maintenance of the established gender. Especially fishes exhibit great plasticity and less conservation in sex determination and sexual development compared to other vertebrate groups. In addition, fishes have a constant sex steroid production throughout their entire lifespan, which makes them particularly susceptible to interferences with the endogenous sex steroid system. This susceptibility has recently been used to show that inhibition of the key enzyme of estrogen synthesis, aromatase Cyp 19 a 1, can induce functional sex reversal even in adult fish.

The objective response rate was 17 % (95 % CI 8. 9 - 27. 3 %) with no complete responders. Fifteen patients (21 %) had stable disease (NC) and 45 patients (63 %) had progressive disease (PD). The median duration of objective response was 36 weeks. The median time to treatment failure was 12. 7 weeks. The log-rank test showed no statistical difference between the dosage groups. The main adverse events reported were mild to moderate severity: nausea in 11 patients (15 %), hot flashes in four (5 %) and somnolence in three (4 %). No serious adverse events were reported. In conclusion, <b>fadrozole</b> is a clinically active aromatase inhibitor with a low incidence of side-effects and phase III clinical trials in post-menopausal women are currently under way...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} thought that in amphibians, thyroid hormones (THs) regulate metamorphosis, while sex steroids (estrogens and androgens) regulate gonadal differentiation. However, inhibition of TH synthesis in frogs alters gonadal differentiation, suggesting instead {{that these two}} endocrine axes interact during development. Specifically, THs {{may be involved in}} male development, while estrogens may inhibit tadpole metamorphosis. However, we do not currently know the mechanisms that account for these interactions, let alone how such mechanisms may differ between species. To develop and test new hypotheses on the roles of sex steroids and THs, I first examined transcriptional profiles (mRNA) of enzymes and receptors related to sex steroids and THs during embryogenesis and metamorphosis in Silurana tropicalis. Tadpoles were exposed to either an estrogen synthesis inhibitor (<b>fadrozole)</b> or TH (triiodothyronine, T 3) during early larval or tadpole development. Acute exposures of S. tropicalis to <b>fadrozole</b> or T 3 during early development resulted in increased expression of androgen- and TH-related genes in whole body larvae, while chronic exposure to <b>fadrozole</b> during metamorphosis affected gonadal differentiation but did not affect tadpole development. On the other hand, acute exposure to T 3 during metamorphosis increased the expression of androgen-related transcripts both in the brain and gonad. In S. tropicalis, the results suggested that cross-talk is primarily in one direction (i. e., effect of THs on the reproductive axis) with a strong relationship between TH and androgen status. Lastly, I established developmental transcript profiles and investigated T 3 regulation of brain and gonad transcripts in Engystomops pustulosus. I then compared these results with S. tropicalis and an earlier study in Lithobates pipiens. While each species developed with similar profiles, they differed in their response to T 3. Exposure to T 3 resulted in either an increase in androgen-related genes (S. tropicalis) or a decrease in estrogen-related genes (E. pustulosus and L. pipiens). In conclusion, these data demonstrated that cross-talk mechanisms differ among these three evolutionary separate species, but in all cases, T 3 appears to affect the balance of sex steroids, stimulating the androgen system and providing potential mechanisms of the masculinising effects of THs. These results will contribute to understanding the mechanisms of hormone interactions and their evolutionary basis in frogs...|$|E
40|$|Pregnenolone and {{dehydroepiandrosterone}} (DHEA) are {{sex hormone}} precursors and neuroprotective steroids. Effects of pregnenolone and DHEA {{may be in}} part mediated by their conversion to testosterone and by the consecutive conversion of testosterone to estradiol by the enzyme aromatase. This enzyme is induced in reactive astrocytes after different forms of neurodegenerative lesions and the resultant local production of estradiol in the brain {{has been shown to}} be neuroprotective. The participation of aromatase in the neuroprotective effect of pregnenolone and DHEA has been assessed in this study. The protective effect of different doses (12. 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) of pregnenolone or DHEA, against systemic kainic acid (7 mg/kg b. w.), was assessed on hippocampal hilar neurons in gonadectomized Wistar male rats. To determine whether the neuroprotective effect of pregnenolone and DHEA was dependent on their conversion to estradiol, the aromatase inhibitor <b>fadrozole</b> (4. 16 mg/mL) was administered using subcutaneous osmotic minipumps. The number of Nissl-stained neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation was estimated by the optical disector method. The administration of kainic acid resulted in a significant decrease in the number of hilar neurons compared to rats injected with vehicles. Pregnenolone and DHEA showed a dose-dependent protective effect of hilar neurons against kainic acid. The administration of the aromatase inhibitor <b>fadrozole</b> blocked the neuroprotective effect of pregnenolone and DHEA. These findings suggest that estradiol formation by aromatase mediates neuroprotective effects of pregnenolone and DHEA against excitotoxic-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Reversal {{of cardiac}} {{fibrosis}} {{is a major}} determinant of the salutary effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure. Recently, R-fadrozole was coined as an aldosterone biosynthesis inhibitor, offering an appealing alternative to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to block aldosterone action. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of R- and S-fadrozole on plasma aldosterone and urinary aldosterone excretion rate and to compare their effectiveness vs. the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist potassium canrenoate to reverse established cardiac fibrosis. Male lean spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats (40 wk) were treated for 8 wk by sc infusions of low (0. 24 mg/kg·d) or high (1. 2 mg/kg·d) doses of R- or S-fadrozole or by potassium canrenoate via drinking water (7. 5 mg/kg·d). At the high dose, plasma aldosterone levels were decreased similarly by R- and S-fadrozole, whereas urinary aldosterone excretion rate was reduced only by S-fadrozole. In contrast, whereas at the high dose, R-fadrozole effectively reversed preexistent left ventricular interstitial fibrosis by 50 % (vs. 42 % for canrenoate), S-fadrozole was devoid of an antifibrotic effect. The low doses of the <b>fadrozole</b> enantiomers did not change cardiac fibrosis or plasma aldosterone but similarly reduced urinary aldosterone excretion rate. In conclusion, R-fadrozole may possess considerable therapeutic merit because of its potent antifibrotic actions in the heart. However, the observed discordance between the aldosterone-lowering and antifibrotic effects of the <b>fadrozole</b> enantiomers raises some doubt about the mechanism by which R-fadrozole diminishes cardiac collagen and about the generality of the concept of lowering aldosterone levels to treat the diseased heart...|$|E
40|$|While the {{endocrine}} role of oestrogen is well established, {{its function}} in follicular maturation as an autocrine or paracrine regulator is less well understood. This {{study was designed}} to delineate the requirement of oestrogen for follicular development in immature rats. Exogenous gonadotrophin (25 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) per rat) was administered to 21 - to 23 -day old female rats to induce follicular growth and development. In the experimental animals, synthesis of oestrogen was blocked by implanting an Alzet pump containing the aromatase inhibitor (AI) CGS 16949 A (<b>fadrozole</b> hydrochloride; 50 mu g/rat per day). The treatment resulted in blockade of the PMSG induced increase in both serum and intrafollicular oestrogen (> 95...|$|E
40|$|Neuroendocrine and {{reproductive}} systems are strictly regulated {{by a series}} of sex hormones, especially 17 -beta estradiol (E 2). Through specific membrane or nuclear receptors, E 2 initiates a series of diverse signaling pathways that regulates the expression of target genes. This transcriptomic output shapes the specific spatial (cell or tissue level) and temporal (seasonal level) E 2 actions. In this study, I attempted to define estrogen-related gene expression changes in the neuroendocrine {{and reproductive}} systems. Firstly, I targeted the physiological period of E 2 action when gonad size is large just prior to spawning (March and April) in the goldfish (Carassius auratus) model. The effect of the aromatase inhibitor <b>fadrozole</b> and the resultant decline in E 2 on neuroendocrine gene expression and reproductive development was determined using microarray analysis. Several regulatory themes for physiological E 2 action in fish brain have been revealed from these novel E 2 regulated genes, including regulation of the calcium signaling pathway and auto-regulation of nuclear estrogen receptor action. Secondly, I aimed to define the seasonal gene expression characteristics that are associated with hormone profiles, typically E 2 blood level change, during a breeding cycle in the goldfish. By using both theoretical and experimental strategies, I have identified a core set of genes in fish neuroendocrine brain that were differentially expressed between physiologically distinct stages including sexually mature prespawning, sexual regression, and early gonadal re-development. Moreover I demonstrated that gene expression changes between stages can be regulated by photoperiod. Thirdly, to further understand the mechanism underlying <b>fadrozole</b> effects on gonadal development, I used a frog model (Xenopus tropicalis) to show that a germline specific piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) pathway may be involved in the E 2 /testosterone regulation of gonadal development in the tadpole. Here, I investigated the effect of <b>fadrozole</b> or finasteride (5 alpha-reductase inhibitor), which are known to influence gonadal development, on the gene expression of a piRNA-specific protein Maelstrom (MAEL) and showed both treatments increased MAEL mRNA expression. Moreover, since the specific function of MAEL is unknown, I conducted a bioinformatics analysis to infer its putative function and evolutionary history. This is one case study for our efforts to annotate some functionally unknown genes which are related to or regulated by E 2 actions. In conclusion, the physiological stage or seasonal specific gene expression information defined in this study provides a series of new functional insights into regulatory mechanisms of E 2 and related hormones in the vertebrate neuroendocrine and reproductive systems...|$|E
40|$|Aromatase, {{the enzyme}} that aromatizes {{androstenedione}} (A) to estrone and testosterone (T) to estradiol (E), affects androgen control of male sex behavior in many vertebrates. In male monkeys, rats and quail, E mimics {{the ability of}} T to promote mating, and aromatase inhibitors block mating induced by T but not E. Aromatase inhibitors include androgens with different A-rings than T and A, e. g., 1, 4, 6 -androstatriene- 3, 17 -dione (ATD), azoles, e. g., <b>fadrozole,</b> and androgens alpha-halogenated at carbon 6, e. g., 6 alpha-bromoA, 6 alpha-fluoroA and 6 alpha-fluoroT. 6 alpha-FluoroT is the only 6 alpha-halogenated androgen studied in regard to mating. It promotes mating in male rats and quail and was studied, before it was known to inhibit aromatase, because it cannot be aromatized yet has the same A-ring as T. 6 alpha-FluoroT might promote mating by binding estrogen receptors (ER) directly, i. e., unassisted, or by metabolism to an androgen that binds ER. Since neither process would require aromatase, this study tested both hypotheses by determining how mating induced in castrated male rats by 6 alpha-fluoroT is affected by ATD and <b>fadrozole.</b> Both aromatase inhibitors inhibited the effects of 6 alpha-fluoroT on mating. Thus, 6 alpha-fluoroT does not promote mating by direct ER binding or metabolism to another androgen. Since aromatase underlies {{a process in which}} 6 alpha-fluoroT, unlike most nonaromatizable androgens, mimics T effects on male sex behavior, the process must involve a feature that 6 alpha-fluoroT shares with T but not other nonaromatizable androgens. A-ring structure is a candidate. A hypothesis is also offered for how aromatase may participate without aromatizing the androgen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
