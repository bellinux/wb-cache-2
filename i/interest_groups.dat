40|$|Lobbying a {{coalition}} government is different than lobbying a single-party government, since {{in the case of}} {{a coalition}} government, the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> can intervene in the intragovernmental decision process. In the case where the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> likes the status quo more than the surplus maximizing policy, the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> influences the policy without any contribution thanks to its credible threat to block unfavorable proposals. We show further that when, say, a leftist coalition government may be replaced by a rightist coalition government, the final policy reflects a rightist <b>interest</b> <b>group's</b> preferences more heavily due to the <b>interest</b> <b>group's</b> forward-looking considerations...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{model of}} {{competition}} between two political parties with policy compromise. There is aspecial <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> with well-defined preferences on political issues. Voters are of two kinds:impressionable and knowledgeable. The impressionable voters {{are influenced by the}} electioncampaigns. The objective of the parties is to obtain the maximum votes. Parties compete forfinancial support from a given <b>interest</b> <b>group.</b> Each party proposes a plataform in exchange for anamount of campaign funds, and the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> decides whether to accept or reject each ofcampaign funds, and the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> decides whether to accept or reject each of theseproposals. We show that parties competition resembles, to a certain extent, Bertrandcompetition. Furthermore, in equilibrium only one party gets funds from <b>interest</b> <b>group.</b> This resultdiffers from the one obtained in a similar model by Grossman and Helpman (1996 a) (1996 b), inwhich, in equlibrium, both parties are financed by the <b>interest</b> <b>group.</b> This differnce asisesbecause Grossman and Helpman assume that it is the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> who makes the proposalsto the political parties.

5|$|After the 1943 Argentine coup d'état, Juan Perón, {{a member}} of the United Officers Group that {{engineered}} the plot, became Minister of Labor. Campaigning among workers with promises of land, higher wages, and social security, he won a decisive victory in the 1946 presidential elections. Under Perón, the number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish the powerful General Confederation of Labor. Perón turned Argentina into a corporatist country in which powerful organized <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> negotiated for positions and resources. During these years, Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> mobilization in EU legislative politics is heavily focused on organizations {{as much attention}} is concentrated on groups’ organizational characteristics, their activities towards different institutional venues, and their attempts to influence policies in one or a small set of policy cases. Yet, despite our growing knowledge about <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics, we know little about the pervasiveness of lobbying or the patterns of conflict and mobilization in EU <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics. How are conflict and mobilization in EU <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics structured? Can we speak of structural patterns of <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> conflict and mobilization or is the EU rather a balkanized lobbying arena? In order to analyze these questions we adopt a policy-centered account, instead of an organization-centered perspective, of <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics. More precisely, for a sample of 116 pieces of legislation we analyze the scope of <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> mobilization, the divisiveness of mobilization processes {{and the nature of}} conflict that is mobilized through the activities of lobbyists. For our empirical analyses, we triangulate evidence from different sources including media-analyses, interviews with 80 experts in the European Commission, interviews with 143 lobbyists and consultations. We conclude with a discussion of how our understanding of conflict structures complements policy field- and organization-based explanations of <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics...|$|R

40|$|We outline a {{conceptual}} framework that identifies and characterizes the contextual nature of <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics in the European Union (EU) to better understand variation in <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> mobilization, lobbying strategies and <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> influence. We focus on two sets of contextual factors that affect EU <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> lobbying. First, we argue that <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> activities are shaped by several policy-related factors, namely the complexity, the policy type, the status quo, the salience {{and the degree of}} conflict characterizing legislative proposals and the associated issues. Second, we posit that lobbying in the EU is affected by institutional factors that vary within the EU political system, such as the institutional fragmentation within the European Commission and the European Parliament and across different national political systems depending on the patterns of interest intermediation or the vertical and horizontal distribution of powers. Finally, we theorize about the interrelationship between contextual features and <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> properties and summarize the findings of the collection...|$|R

This provoked the reaction of various provincial governors {{as well as that}} of powerful <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in Baghdad itself, such as the caliphal bodyguards. Against them, Ibn Ra'iq employed Bajkam and his Turkish supporters. With their aid, he managed to neutralize the Hujari and Saji guard units, after which, in February 937, Bajkam was rewarded with the posts of sahib al-shurta (chief of police) and governor of the eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|More than 40years {{before the}} {{creation}} of the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first national park. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with poaching, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource, and along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park.|$|E
