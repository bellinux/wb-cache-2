50|$|In February 1937, they {{produced}} what they claimed {{was the first}} all-electric mobile fish-and-chips saloon. Beneath a serving counter was an oven, which was fitted with two sets of electric elements. One set could be plugged into a <b>mains</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>socket,</b> and was used to bring the oven up to temperature. Once it was hot, the second set were powered from the vehicle's battery, but the amount of current drawn was somewhat lower, as it only had to maintain the temperature. Two months later, they showcased a mobile milk bar, complete with egg-whisking machines, fountains and a refrigerator, again powered from the vehicle battery. A milk tank held 16 to 20 imp gal of milk. Later in the year they held a competition for ideas to improve or develop their products. Prizes of 10, 5 and 3 guineas were offered.|$|R

30|$|Our idea is {{to develop}} a {{low-power}} wireless system for energy consumption analysis at <b>mains</b> <b>sockets,</b> which can be installed into every household or office. By providing traceability of power consumption for every load in a household, it is possible to give end consumers the opportunity to see, understand, and thereby optimize their own energy consumption behavior. As such, we developed a system to measure energy consumption directly at <b>mains</b> power <b>sockets</b> and transfer the data to a server were it can be viewed and analyzed by the end user. The systems back-end and infrastructure shall also serve as a platform for other smart home metering and home automation devices, presenting a variety of possible applications.|$|R

It weighed 10.7 kg (24.5 lb), cost $1,795 US, and ran the CP/M 2.2 operating system. Powered directly from a <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> as it had no on-board battery, it was still classed as a portable device since it could be packed away and transported by hand to another location.|$|R

50|$|Initially {{the system}} had one channel that was {{transmitted}} as direct audio. The wires and plugs {{for the system}} {{were the same as}} for standard power wires and plugs which could cause receivers to burn out by attaching to <b>mains</b> <b>socket.</b> During World War II, all RF receivers were confiscated , but cable radio continued operating and, in particular, was used to transmit warnings of aerial bombing. The 1960s saw an enhancement with the addition of two additional channels, using AM on carrier frequencies of 78 and 120 kHz. The installation of this system became mandatory for all new buildings. The system, along with usual broadcasting, was created to inform people of emergencies.|$|R
30|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} and reducing energy wastage is an important topic of our time. But it is quite difficult {{to figure out how}} much of our total electricity bill can be mapped to which device or at what time the device used it. We believe {{energy efficiency}} of normal households can be improved, if this kind of transparency would be available. In this article, we present a system for energy measurement at <b>mains</b> <b>sockets</b> to gain a transparent view of energy consumption for each device in a household. It consists of several smart energy measuring devices (SEMDs) that use a low-power radio protocol to dynamically build and connect to a radio network to transfer power usage date to a server. At the server, the data is stored and can be accessed via web interface.|$|R

5000|$|A radio {{transmitter}} is an electronic circuit which transforms electric power from a battery or <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> into a radio frequency alternating current, which reverses direction millions to billions of times per second.

50|$|A <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> mounted transformer/rectifier {{provided}} 9V DC to {{the speed}} controller board, which used tachometer feedback from the DC motor to regulate its speed. A small brass pulley drove the platter assembly using a flat rubber belt wrapped around a recessed face machined into {{the underside of the}} one-piece acrylic platter, another unconventional material chosen for its vibration dissipation qualities. The thrust element of the bearing was formed by a tungsten carbide sphere mounted in the bearing spindle pressing against a synthetic ruby cup in top of the aluminium support sleeve for the platter. The bearing was positioned close to the centre of gravity of the platter with side load being carried by a lower PTFE sleeve against the bearing spindle. The next product, referred to as the PT1, is often mistakenly assumed to be their first product. The PT1 was an easier to manufacture version of the 'Original' having the glass top plate replaced by a black painted steel plate. Later versions of the PT1 moved the motor from its original 'one o'clock' position to 'seven o'clock', {{on the opposite side of}} the spindle to the tonearm to mounted it on the top plate. This turntable was in production from 1979 until 1985.|$|R
50|$|This section {{describes}} a work session on this computer, at one typical installation in 1975. The programmer might arrive, {{to work on}} a Fortran-II program that he had already started writing in the previous session, carrying a teleprinter paper listing of that program that has been annotated with the new changes that are to be made, and the punch tape that contains the machine-readable source code of the program. He would first need to turn on the computer at the switch on the conventional <b>mains</b> <b>socket</b> on the wall, and then at the front-panel on/off switch. Since the magnetic core memory, which is non-volatile memory, would generally still contain the previous user's program, the programmer might need to load the punched tape called Minisystem (containing the object code of a small, memory monitor program). This tape, which was stored in a small cardboard box on a shelf near the computer, would be entered from the left of the tape-reader. The tape-reader {{was an integral part of}} the front panel of the computer, and would spill out the tape that it had read, on to the floor, on the right-hand side. Once read, the Minisystem could be started by flicking the Run switch on the front panel.|$|R
5|$|The stadium's {{interior}} comprises {{a continuous}} oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end.

5000|$|Most current-clamp {{amplifiers}} provide {{little or}} no amplification of the voltage changes recorded from the cell. The [...] "amplifier" [...] is actually an electrometer, {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "unity gain amplifier"; its main job is to change the nature of small signals (in the mV range) produced by cells {{so that they can be}} accurately recorded by low-impedance electronics. The amplifier increases the current behind the signal while decreasing the resistance over which that current passes. Consider this example based on Ohm's law: A voltage of 10 mV is generated by passing 10 nanoamperes of current across 1 MΩ of resistance. The electrometer changes this [...] "high impedance signal" [...] to a [...] "low impedance signal" [...] by using a voltage follower circuit. A voltage follower reads the voltage on the input (caused by a small current through a big resistor). It then instructs a parallel circuit that has a large current source behind it (the <b>electrical</b> <b>mains)</b> and adjusts the resistance of that parallel circuit to give the same output voltage, but across a lower resistance.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the amplitude, frequency, and phase {{of an unknown}} sinusoidal signal from a noisy-biased measurement is addressed in this paper by a family of parallel prefiltering schemes. The proposed methodology consists in using a pair of linear filters of specified order to generate a suitable number of auxiliary signals {{that are used to}} estimate—in an adaptive way—the frequency, the amplitude, and the phase of the sinusoid. Increasing the order of the prefilters improves the noise immunity of the estimator, at the cost of an increase of the computational complexity. Among the whole family of estimators realizable by varying the order of the filters, the simple parallel prefilters of orders 2 C 2 and 3 C 3 are discussed in detail, being the most attractive from the implementability point of view. The behavior of the two algorithms with respect to bounded external disturbances is characterized by input-to-state stability arguments. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is shown both by comparative numerical simulations and by a real experiment addressing the estimation of the frequency of the <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> from a noisy voltage measurement...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{possible}} effects of occupational levels of 50 Hz magnetic fields (MF) on human performance it is preferable to monitor performance during rather than subsequent to MF exposure. We previously reported studies of heart rate and cognitive behaviour where the issue of contamination was not a serious one. Our present study involves electrophysiological measures, which have a greater capacity to identify the effects and assist in localising them. The contamination of EEG signal by the MF exposure is clearly a problem {{in this type of}} study. Previous investigators have not reported these types of measurement concurrent with MF exposure due to the contamination difficulty; but this paper reports means of accomplishing this. Overall a combination of 12 methods for reducing pickup were employed. These were: 1) Distancing recording instruments from the MF source; 2) Shielding the devices and wiring; 3) Appropriate choice of cables; 4) Grounding the instrumentation; 5) Orientation of conduits; 6) Isolation of <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> power supplies; 7) Balancing the input impedances; 8) Applying a driven shield technique; 9) Improved electronics design incorporating pre-amplification and circuit impedance level control; 10) Analogue filtering; 11) Signal Averaging; and 12) Post acquisition digital filtering using frequency and time domain techniques...|$|R
50|$|In the 19th and 20th century, Quinten did {{not change}} much, as the absence of road {{connections}} made industrialization and commerce very difficult. One major change was {{the construction of the}} walking track that connects Quinten and Au in the early 20th century which made the life of the children of Au much easier, as they no longer had to climb steeply up and then down into Quinten, but could use the lovely and flat new track on their way to school. In the early 1930s it looked like Quinten's fate was about to change, when the construction of a road from Weesen at the western end to Walenstadt at the eastern end of the Walensee was discussed. Two projects were discussed, one along the northern side of the lake through Quinten, the other along the southern side. In the end the road was built on the southern side and Quinten was left to stay the quiet place it still is.
