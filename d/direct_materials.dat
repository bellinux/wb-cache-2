Manufacturing adds value to raw materials by applying a chain of operations to maintain a deliverable product. There are many operations that can be applied to raw materials such as welding, cutting and painting. It is important to differentiate between the <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> and indirect materials.|$|E

30|$|Product costs {{consist of}} the costs {{involved}} in the purchase or production of goods, including the <b>direct</b> <b>material,</b> <b>direct</b> labor cost and manufacturing overhead. <b>Direct</b> <b>material</b> includes raw materials that can be processed into products. In power plants, <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> cost {{is directly related to}} fuel price. Direct labor cost is the wages paid to workers who produce the products and is directly related to social average wages of the industry. The remaining cost belongs to the manufacturing overhead, which is mainly influenced by the price level.|$|R

50|$|Material costs include {{everything}} that is connected to materials that are purchased by the business, be it raw materials, parts and components, or manufacturing supplies. Expenses for insurance and freight can also be accounted as material costs. Accounting separates <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> from indirect <b>material</b> by defining <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> as having only one specific cost objective while indirect material can have multiple cost objectives.|$|R
40|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> cost {{variance}} can be subdivided into a price variance, a quantity variance and a price-quantity interaction variance. The price-quantity interaction variance is rarely {{mentioned in the}} literature because the traditional price variance does not acknowledge an interaction variance. For a number of pragmatic reasons, this approach may be justified for the <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> price variance. The direct labor {{cost variance}} is conceptually similar to the <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> cost variance. Accordingly, the traditional direct labor rate variance also includes a rate-efficiency interaction variance. However, the justifications for incorporating the interaction variance into the <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> price variance {{do not apply to}} the direct labor rate variance. This paper explores the possibility of separating the rate-efficiency interaction variance from the direct labor rate variance. This approach may be more aligned with the concept of responsibility accounting than the traditional method of calculating the direct labor rate variance. Thus, it may provide more reliable information feedback for decision-making purposes...|$|R
50|$|Manufacturing {{overhead}} includes {{other costs}} in manufacturing that are neither <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> costs nor direct labor costs.

5000|$|Costs {{incurred}} in Maytag's {{acquisition and}} integration of Amana and an increased corporate debt load led to aggressive internal cost-cutting efforts in <b>direct</b> <b>materials,</b> manufacturing, and distribution costs. [...] Maytag introduced a value-priced appliance line under a separate label, Performa by Maytag. To increase sales, the company also marketed Maytag-branded 'Legacy Series' washing machines that were otherwise identical to low-end Amana models, and built at the formerly Amana assembly plant in Herrin, Illinois. The rebranded Maytag models, later termed Amanatags by dissatisfied owners, received poor customer reviews after reports surfaced of major mechanical and/or durability problems. [...] The company also consolidated warehouse operations and {{cut the number of}} Maytag vendors. Between 2002 and 2004, Maytag corporate management cut new-product investment by 50%.|$|E
50|$|In business, {{overhead}} or overhead expense {{refers to}} an ongoing expense of operating a business; it {{is also known as}} an operating expense. Overheads are the expenditure which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any particular cost unit. Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important cost element along with <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> and direct labor.|$|E

5000|$|Nasaka {{said about}} her Gutai initiation: [...] Everyone fell silent, but he (Yoshihara) {{repeated}} his question {{three times and}} everyone clapped their hands. At first there wasn't a sound.Nasaka was admitted as a Phase Two Gutai artist (19562-1972). While Phase One, Gutai artists (1954-62) focused on responding to the postwar period in Japan, and engaging with <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> to critique wartime militarism. Alternatively, Phase Two Gutai artists were more solicitous about Japan's burgeoning economic and technological growth. The Phase Two artists employed materials and techniques including advanced technology that were germane {{to the theme of}} industrialism. Nasaka gained sizable recognition after winning the Ashiya Mayor's Prize in 1962. In 1964, Nasaka put on a solo show at the Gutai Pinacotheca, in which she expanded her work to a larger school by completely covering an entire wall with a grid of proliferating concentric circles. Nasaka was featured in the April 1965 Issue of Art International, was asked to be a judge for the Ibaraki exhibition, and showed her work in the Female Artists' Association exhibition. Nasaka went on a hiatus and did not create art for two decades. However, in the 2000's she began creating artwork again, and held solo exhibitions in 2014 in Tokyo, and in 2015 in Antwerp, Belgium.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTOC's basic {{vocabulary}} emphasizes its philosophy and its three performance measures. Throughput equals sales revenue minus <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> cost [...] it measures {{the speed at}} which the company makes money. Inventory is the raw materials value tied up in work in process and finished goods. Large amounts of inventory are undesirable because it means that the company has spent money for production that hasn’t generated revenue yet. Operating expenses are all of the costs of operations other than <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> costs. Under the Theory of Constraints, operating expenses are fixed and therefore irrelevant to any TOC decision. Of the three terms, throughput is the most important. It tells the company that it is achieving its goal of making money. Moreover, increases in throughput mean that {{the rate at which the}} company is making money is increasing. So far, we’ve discussed increasing speed and output and improving quality, but we haven’t mentioned any of the conventional management accounting performance measures (i. e., productivity, cost per unit, etc.). TOC won’t suggest using any of them, either. Moreover, according to TOC, not only are conventional management accounting performance measures unnecessary, but focusing on them can make things worse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have {{traditionally}} been used to measure and manage direct material suppliers. <b>Direct</b> <b>materials,</b> by their very nature, lend themselves more easily to KPIs – <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> are more tangible and can be measured fairly easily. Supply chain professionals managing indirect material suppliers and service providers are challenged with developing KPIs that specifically address the differences associated with these suppliers. Fundamentally, the approach to measure and managing direct and indirect suppliers is the same; however, {{there are differences between}} direct and indirect suppliers. In order to effectively measure and manage indirect suppliers and service providers, a different set of KPIs, one that factors both the objective and subjective nature of indirect materials and services must be developed. Case for Measuring Indirect Suppliers. Indirect spend, as used {{in the context of this}} discussion, is defined as any purchased good or service that does not end up in the product or service delivered to a customer. Direct spend is defined as a purchased good that is required to manufacture a finished good or a service that is provided to a customer. Companies {{have traditionally}} measured direct suppliers ’ performance as a way to contro...|$|E
