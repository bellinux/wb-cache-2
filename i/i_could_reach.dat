500|$|In 1967, Marshall Chess formed Cadet Concept Records as a {{subsidiary}} of Chess Records. The label's first release was the self-titled debut album of the psychedelic band Rotary Connection, whose members Chess described as [...] "the hottest, most avant garde rock guys in Chicago". As {{a result of the}} album's success, Chess felt that he could revive the career of bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf by recording two albums of experimental, psychedelic blues, producing the albums Electric Mud and The Howlin' Wolf Album. [...] Chess hoped the new albums would sell well among fans of psychedelic rock bands influenced by Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. According to Muddy Waters, [...] "Quite naturally, I like a good-selling record. I was looking at it because I played for so many of these so-called hippies that I thought probably <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> them." ...|$|E

[...] The album features {{the voices of}} Élise Velle (René Dupéré's wife), Ella Louise Allaire (vocalist, arranger and vocal coach) and a young soprano boy named Philippe Lapan-Vandal.

2500|$|Prince of Wales raised {{anchor and}} {{returned}} to sea, sailing aimlessly north and east {{in the hope of}} finding a more hospitable village from which to seek a guide. Shortly after midnight on 22 January she collided with a Chinese ship, striking the Chinese vessel amidships and crushing her under Prince of Wales bow. The English vessel suffered damage to her hull and the loss of her jib-boom, which fell over the side into the Chinese vessel. The smaller Chinese craft was more heavily damaged and began to sink, her crew scrambling overboard to avoid being dragged down with her. Several Chinese sailors sought to climb aboard Prince of Wales, panicking Milner's crew. Paine recorded in his journal that [...] "the Alarm caused me to jump from my cot and run to the arms chest, but such was the call for cutlasses that {{it was not until the}} third or fourth attempt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the deck, being accosted each time in the companionway with [...] "O give me that cutlass sir, and get another for they are coming on board." ...|$|E

60|$|I turned briskly upon my heels, but Massena {{recalled}} {{me before}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> {{the opening of}} his tent.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile I {{could hear}} the {{creaking}} of the pulleys as the jolly-boat was let down into the water. Would they leave before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> them? ...|$|E
6000|$|Tony {{smiled a}} little. “Well,” he said slowly, “it seemed even chances that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> {{him with the}} butt, and I owed you a good deal, you see.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes! my legions," [...] {{cried the}} Cæsar in a hoarse whisper. [...] "I had nigh {{forgotten}} them. They are not far ... if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>reach</b> them...." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{very long}} time elapsed before we had seen a dozen bonefish, any one of which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>reached</b> with my rod. But not a bite! I reeled in to find my bait gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "The wall is {{too high}} for us to climb, Mike," [...] Desmond said. [...] "Even if I stood on your head, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>reach</b> the top. Let us go round to the front again." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sprang from}} my chariot, but before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the lioness hunters had run up with spears and stabbed her, which was easy {{as she could}} not move.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I shoot, my lord?" [...] Long Tom asked. [...] "They {{are some}} {{two hundred and}} fifty yards away, but from this height methinks that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> a {{house of}} some sort it wouldn't be so bad," [...] he murmured to himself. [...] "But being out here alone isn't any fun, that's certain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think you}} have been a little unkind to me, Stella. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>reached</b> the bell and stopped you, only I hated to seem rude in your father's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Sultan!" [...] I cried, breathlessly, {{recognizing}} that the tracks {{had been made by}} a giant lion we had named Sultan. They were huge, round, and deep, and with my spread hand <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>reach</b> across one of them.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Mahavamsa, {{in about}} 1169, Kulasekhara besieged Madurai forcing the Pandyan king Parakrama Pandya {{to appeal to}} the Sri Lankan king Parakramabahu I for help.

6000|$|... "It will be colder soon {{when the}} ice comes down, {{and if the}} skip's to be got out, we must get her now. I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> her by swimming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll stick together," [...] {{replied the}} lad. [...] "Bella's to stay over here some months, {{and if she}} decides to join Miss Gladwyne she'll leave Glacier long before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I am glad!" [...] I said, {{giving the}} warm {{pressure}} to the pelican's leg that I would have given to Euphemia's hand, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>reached</b> her. Euphemia {{looked up at me}} so confidently that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but believe that in some magnetic way that pressure had been transmitted through the bird.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know hundreds! for I {{was born}} of a fancy, and my head is full of lovely ones, and I sing such merry songs all the birds used {{to listen to me}} for hours.

6000|$|... "I {{came down}} the hill from the Hradschin. I have had {{business}} there. It did not occur to your simplicity that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> you otherwise than by the direct road from my own home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are horribly unjust. Lillian's Duty is a {{powerful}} acting drama, and has its audience if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> it. Perhaps I'm not the one to do Mr. Douglass's work, after all," [...] she added, humbly.|$|E
6000|$|... "You should pray to the horse, too," [...] she said, [...] "for had it {{not been}} for his legs, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never have <b>reached</b> you in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had I been {{stronger}} I {{would have}} searched for him; I would have clambered among the ruins {{to see if}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> discover his mangled form.

But excitement, fatigue, and want of food had made me so weak that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing but sit upon the ground with my back against the tree.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>reach</b> them in {{the swamp}} on horseback, {{and was in the}} act of {{dismounting}} when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the rear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.

60|$|I was {{appealed to}} for the latest news by a full score before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the rendezvous; but to all I had the same reply, that I was in {{government}} service and could not delay.|$|E
6000|$|... "The stretch is {{awkward and}} you can't steady me," [...] he said. [...] "Still I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the slab and {{slide into the}} gully. Before we bring the others, perhaps I ought to try." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{knew that}} my only hope lay in escape {{from the city of}} Zodanga, for the matter of the four dead guardsmen would have to be explained, and as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>reach</b> my {{original}} post without a guide, suspicion would surely rest on me so soon as I was discovered wandering aimlessly through the palace.|$|R
60|$|I ran {{below to}} an open place in the willows. Here the stream was shallow and very swift. In the white water I caught a {{flashing}} gleam of red. Then I saw the shine of the leader. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>reach</b> it without wading in. When I did this the trout lunged out. He looked crimson and silver. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have put my fist in his mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because none of {{the younger}} ones can reach to undo the doors," [...] said Elizabeth. [...] "It was as much as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to <b>reach</b> the upper bolt, though I stood upon a chair." ...|$|R
