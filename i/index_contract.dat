40|$|We examine market {{volatility}} across an automated periodic auction mechanism and a continuous automated auction, using data on five futures contracts {{traded on the}} GLOBEX trading system. The analysis is supplemented by {{a comparison of the}} periodic market with floor trading. Our data permit virtually no lag between the close of continuous trading and the periodic auction just preceding further continuous trading, avoiding ambiguities in results due to periods of non-trading. Theoretical results are summarized, which suggest greater volatility in the continuous market, but which also imply equality of price volatility across periodic and continuous mechanisms for some market conditions. The empirical analysis consists both of direct comparisons via variance ratios and variance ratio tests conditional on a model of price and value adjustment previously suggested by Amihud and Mendelson (1987). We show how to directly estimate the structural parameters of the model, and derive a test of market efficiency conditional on the model's structure. Our results indicate that the periodic auction yields the same volatility as the automated continuous market for a stock <b>index</b> <b>contract,</b> but that the periodic market is associated with relatively lower volatility for currency futures.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the background and}} nature of the credit default index swaption (CDIS) and presents relevant methods for modelling credit risk. A CDIS is a credit derivative contract that gives the buyer right to enter into a credit default index swap (CDS <b>index)</b> <b>contract</b> at a given point in time. A CDS index, in turn, is a multi-name credit default swap (CDS). Within the eld of research, this thesis identi es the CDIS pricing models presented by Jackson (2005), Rutkowski & Armstrong (2009) and Morini & Brigo (2011) as the most recognized and developed. These models are evaluated by reconstruction in a numerical software environment. Although the considered models are well-behaving under economic interpretation, they di er in constructional features regarding whether to model the so-called Armageddon event inside or outside the Black (1976) model. An Armadageddon event refers to a total default of the CDS index up to the expiry of the CDIS. Based on the criteria of required assumption boldness and calculation transparency, the model presented by Morini & Brigo (2011) have been evaluated in depth. The expected value of the front-end protection, i. e. the insurance against default events during the lifetime of the CDIS, is found to increase with pairwise correlation among reference names and the e ect of the Armageddon scenario is only observable as the pairwise correlation approaches one. This implies that the choice of pricing model is found to be crucial during stressed economic climates and of less importance during calm economic climates...|$|E
40|$|A {{small number}} of {{countries}} have issued real indexed sovereign debt in recent years. This type of contracts could improve risk sharing between debtor countries and international creditors and diminish the probability of occurrence of debt crises. However, {{the structure of the}} optimal GDP <b>indexed</b> <b>contracts</b> is not obvious and neither is the magnitude of its welfare e¤ects. This paper addresses these issues. We characterize the optimal features of <b>indexed</b> debt <b>contracts</b> in a dynamic stochastic equilibrium framework with incomplete markets and compare these features to existing ones. We show that the optimal <b>indexed</b> debt <b>contract</b> can not be studied abstracting from the total portfolio of the issuing country.

30|$|The {{scientific}} and development community (including politicians) are somewhat polarized whether weather index insurance really works – particularly {{in terms of}} performance so far, and the inherent problems related {{to the accuracy of}} indices used. The advocates can be further divided into those eager {{to learn more about the}} ‘index’ and proposing ideas for further analysis (testing of weather index insurance); and those who trust the current indices and advocate scaling up and promotion. Critics argue that weather index insurance is costly to administer and suggest developing better insurance products such as using an area-yield approach (Herbold 2013). They further argue that since the current indices are far from representing the situation on the ground and are affected by basis risk, an insurance product (e.g. area-yield <b>index</b> <b>contract)</b> based on proper sampling of individual farm yields is far more realistic. This idea may be reasonable considering the large number of area-yield index based Indian crop insurance programs compared to the small number of weather based crop insurance contracts (Mahul and Stutley 2010; Rao 2010). However, the Indian programs that focus on area-yield indices are not free from basis risk 5 and the high administrative costs including the need for better infrastructure and manpower to undertake yield samples across remotely located farms (Rao 2010). In fact, an insurance company would have to undertake such studies in order to prove that there is, in fact, an insurable covariate risk between a proposed weather insurance product and a targeted loss. However, in less developed economies with limited historical yield data with which to measure covariate risks, taking random samples for yield estimation is expensive and may not provide a true yield distribution that can be generalized to the farming community, nor is random sampling robust enough to capture and price specific event risks. This is most important in capturing the extreme tails of the weather index insurance that is coupled with extreme losses in farm production. Unfortunately, there have been no empirical studies comparing the administrative costs of traditional crop insurance, versus weather index insurance schemes.|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we address}} practical issues in designing weather insurance contracts for risk management {{in developing countries}} in three different scenarios. First, we develop an innovative contract design strategy based on agronomic considerations that can be implemented in situations where only short and/or aggregate data series are available. We attempt to mitigate both the aggregate nature of yield data {{and the need for}} data-demanding analysis by looking at areas sharing the same growing conditions and using agronomic requirements to specify contract parameters. We find that the proposed contracts do not achieve the same degree of risk reduction as the contracts that can be constructed using no data limitations, but they do provide meaningful risk protection and typically at lower premiums. The implication is that the proposed methodology can be used to design weather derivatives for developing countries, where paucity of data often renders the conventional design approaches unworkable. The second essay aims to derive a general-form optimal payoff of an <b>index</b> <b>contract</b> that takes into account potentially nonlinear dependence between the index underlying the contract and the loss that is insured. We find that the quasi-linear contract payoff structure may not be the optimal choice if the dependence between the index and the yield/revenue is nonlinear. The implication is that the proposed methodology can help to improve risk-reducing capabilities of weather derivatives particularly in situations where the effect of weather on yield is complex and not obvious. The third essay analyzes the use of weather derivatives in managing water supply risk arising in making water allocation decisions. The specific application is developed for the Alto Rio Lerma Irrigation District (ARLID) in the state of Guanajuato in Mexico. We argue that incorporation of weather derivatives in water allocation decisions can improve overall well-being of producers and allow shift water allocations from the wet to the dry season with the assumption that the wet season farmers can cope with the risk of water shortages by using weather derivatives. We find that use of weather derivatives does lead to better water allocation policies that allow the representative farmer to reach higher levels of utility. The implication is that introduction of weather derivatives can help to improve water management decisions in developing countries where agriculture heavily depends on irrigation and can be severely affected by extreme weather events...|$|E
40|$|According to the Taiwan Council of Agriculture, frost was {{responsible}} for approximately 30 percent of aquaculture losses in Taiwan during the period 1999 - 2008. Farmed milkfish, the most important aquaculture crop in Taiwan, is particularly sensitive to temperature variations, and can experience widespread kills whenever temperatures fall below 14 °C for sustained periods of time. Temperatures below this critical minimum, however, are not uncommon during the January-March winter months. The purpose of our study is to analyze the possible benefits and the actuarial properties of temperature-based index insurance for the farmed milkfish industry in Kaohsiung County, Taiwan. Weather-based index insurance has been promoted as a cost-effective means of managing risk associated with catastrophic weather events, examples of which include risk transfer products as varied as rainfall insurance in Mali and El Nino-Southern Oscillation insurance in Peru. Of special interest here will be performing accurate assessments of the actuarial properties of a temperature <b>index</b> <b>contract</b> that would indemnify Kaohsiung County farmed milkfish producers based {{on the value of}} lower-quadrant daily temperature, which {{has been shown to be}} highly correlated with extreme production losses. To assess the actuarial properties of such a contract, we will develop a time series model of daily temperatures lows in Kaohsiung County. Daily temperatures exhibit some special features that must be observed by any reasonable time series model. For example, daily temperatures exhibit strong seasonality with small perturbations. Moreover, seasonal variations exist not only with the mean daily temperatures, but also their variance. Specifically, daily low temperatures are more volatile in winter than in summer. To capture the special features of daily temperatures, we estimate a nonlinear nonstructural time series model of the quantiles of the conditional distribution of daily temperature lows given the observed covariates based on Campbell and Diebold (2005). A simple low-ordered polynomial function is used to capture the deterministic trend and autoregressive lags are used to capture cyclical dynamics of the daily temperature. Also, a Fourier series is applied to model the seasonal components in daily temperature and its variance. However, in contrast to Campbell and Diebold (2005), we model and forecast the lower quantile rather than mean of the daily temperature. We also introduce a phase angle in the low-order Fourier series to allow the peak of daily average temperature to occur at any point in time within a year. The algorithm for computing the nonlinear quantile regression estimates is based on an interior point method described in Koenker and Park (1996). Once the estimates are computed, we invoke bootstrap methods to compute confidence intervals for the contract’s fair premium rate. Our research employs 1974 - 2008 daily surface temperature data, which is collected and published by Central Bureau, Taiwan, for a weather station located in Kaohsiung County. The farmed milkfish production data in Kaohsiung County also obtained from Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, is used to examine the risk-reduction effectiveness of the temperature contracts with different trigger and stop-loss points. The contribution of our paper is not only to provide an alternative method in modeling temperature risk, but also to provide an empirical basis for further, more general discussion regarding the potential benefits of weather index insurance contracts in Taiwan. nonlinear quantile, temperature risk, weather index insurance, Agricultural Finance, Financial Economics, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{explanation}} for the explosive growth in the popularity of Stock <b>Index</b> Futures <b>contracts.</b> In our economy there are three broad classes of traders that place orders with a competitive market maker that sets a bid-ask spread arising from adverse selection.

We show that the Stock Index is the efficient trading vehicle for this last class of traders, who abandon the spot securities markets with consequences for the liquidity of individual stocks. The reason is that the costs faced by diversified traders will be lower in the Index market than in markets for individual stocks, because any idiosyncratic information flowing in the Index market is substantially lower than that brought by insiders to the spot market. Stock <b>Index</b> Futures <b>contracts</b> are, therefore, convenient innovations for financial institutions that trade large portfolios of securities to match the liquidity needs of their clients.
