25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics {{in the press and}} Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

500|$|While a large {{majority}} of critics praised the main trivia storyline, many reviews criticized the Dwight and Robert plot. McNutt wrote that, [...] "As the trivia storyline was building momentum, the Florida storyline was killing that same momentum, a push-and-pull that the trivia ended up winning." [...] Forcella explained that [...] "the titular storyline of the gang playing 'Trivia' in Philadelphia worked really well, but the forced trio in Florida definitely did not." [...] Jill Mader from InsidePulse.com wrote, [...] "All in all, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> inconsistent episode – I liked the trivia storyline, but the Dwight stuff really fell flat for me." ...|$|E

500|$|The media showed {{concern over}} the film's title, deeming it [...] "odd", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be {{translated}} into English as [...] "mean". However, the makers said that [...] "kaminey" [...] is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment. According to Bhardwaj, {{the idea for the}} title came from a scene from Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), in which the lead actor (Naseeruddin Shah) refers to the actress in a loving manner; {{it was the first time}} that he heard the word used that way. Bhardwaj told Rediff, [...] "when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> apt title for the film".|$|E
500|$|Connie Smith's {{sound is}} defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, {{primarily}} during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "prominent". Smith's steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called [...] "The Connie Smith Sound". In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing, Myrick recalls how Smith's producer (Bob Ferguson) wanted the guitar to sound, [...] "He came out and said he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> awfully thin sound, but it wound up being very popular." ...|$|E
2500|$|His first theft came in March 1995 {{during a}} visit to the medieval castle at Bonn, Germany, with his then-girlfriend Anne-Catherine Kleinklauss. He became entranced with a small {{painting}} by Christian Wilhelm Dietrich, later saying, [...] "I was fascinated by her beauty, by the qualities of the woman in the portrait and by her eyes. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> imitation of Rembrandt." [...] With his girlfriend keeping watch, he worked out the nails holding the painting in its frame and slipped it under his jacket. He would use similar methods for at least 170 other museums for his thefts in the ensuing years. He would visit small collections and regional museums, where security was lax, and Kleinklauss would serve as his lookout as he cut the paintings from their frames.|$|E

Oddly enough I had {{no doubt in my mind}} that they would be glad to see me... Yes, I must have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career.|$|E
60|$|Of all my {{experiences}} this was, I think, the strangest, after that night of hell, {{to find myself}} alone upon this field of death, staring everywhere at the distorted faces which on the previous morn I had seen so full of life. Yet my physical needs asserted themselves. I was very hungry, who for twenty-four hours had eaten nothing, faint with hunger indeed. I passed a provision wagon that had been looted by the Zulus. Tins of bully beef lay about, also, among a wreck of broken glass, some bottles of Bass's beer which had escaped their notice. I found an assegai, cleaned it in the ground which it needed, and opening one of the tins, lay down in a tuft of grass by a dead man, or rather between him and some Zulus whom he had killed, and devoured its contents. Also I knocked the tops off {{a couple of the}} beer bottles and drank my fill. While I was doing this a large rough dog with a silver-mounted collar on its neck, I think of the sort that is called an Airedale terrier, came up to me whining. At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> hyena, but discovering my mistake, threw it some bits of meat which it ate greedily. Doubtless it had belonged to some dead officer, though there was no name on the collar. The poor beast, which I named Lost, at once attached itself to me, and here I may say that I kept it till its death, which occurred of jaundice at Durban not long before I started on my journey to King Solomon's Mines. No man ever had a more faithful friend and companion.|$|E

6000|$|Then had {{the earth}} beneath me yawning given [...] Sign of convulsion; and tho' horrid rifts [...] Sent up the moaning of unhappy spirits [...] Imprison'd in her centre, {{with the heat}} [...] Of their infolding element; had the angels, [...] The watchers at heaven's gate, push'd them apart, [...] And from the golden {{threshold}} had down-roll'd [...] Their heaviest thunder, I had lain as still, [...] And blind and motionless as then I lay! [...] White as quench'd ashes, cold as were the hopes [...] Of my lorn love! What happy air shall woo [...] The wither'd leaf fall'n in the woods, or blasted [...] Upon this bough? a lightning stroke had come [...] Even from that Heaven in whose light I bloom'd [...] And taken away the greenness of my life, [...] The blossom and the fragrance. Who was cursed [...] But I? who miserable but I? even Misery [...] Forgot herself in that extreme distress, [...] And with the overdoing of her part [...] Did fall away into oblivion. [...] The night in pity took away my day [...] Because my grief as yet was newly born, [...] Of too weak eyes to look upon the light, [...] And with the hasty notice of the ear, [...] Frail life was startled from the tender love [...] Of him she brooded over. Would I had lain [...] Until the pleached ivy tress had wound [...] Round my worn limbs, and the wild briar had driven [...] Its knotted thorns thro' my unpaining brows [...] Leaning its roses on my faded eyes. [...] The wind had blown above me, and the rain [...] Had fall'n upon me, and the gilded snake [...] Had nestled in this bosomthrone of love, [...] But I had been at rest for evermore. [...] Long time entrancement held me: all too soon, [...] Life (like a wanton too-officious friend [...] Who will not hear denial, vain and rude [...] With proffer of unwished for services) [...] Entering all the avenues of sense, [...] Pass'd thro' into his citadel, the brain [...] With hated warmth of apprehensiveness: [...] And first the chillness of the mountain stream [...] Smote on my brow, and then I seem'd to hear [...] Its murmur, as the drowning seaman hears, [...] Who with his head below the surface dropt, [...] Listens the dreadful murmur indistinct [...] Of the confused seas, and knoweth not [...] Beyond the sound he lists: and then came in [...] O'erhead the white light of the weary moon, [...] Diffused and molten into flaky cloud. [...] Was my sight drunk, that it did shape to me [...] Him who should own that name? or had my fancy [...] So lethargised discernment in the sense, [...] That she did act the step-dame to mine eyes, [...] Warping their nature, till they minister'd [...] Unto her swift conceits? 'Twere better thus [...] If so be that {{the memory of that}} sound [...] With mighty evocation, had updrawn [...] The fashion and the phantasm of the form [...] It should attach to. There was no such thing.-- [...] It was the man she loved, even Lionel, [...] The lover Lionel, the happy Lionel, [...] All joy; who drew the happy atmosphere [...] Of my unhappy sighs, fed with my tears, [...] To him the honey dews of orient hope. [...] Oh! rather had some loathly ghastful brow, [...] Half-bursten from the shroud, in cere cloth bound, [...] The dead skin withering on the fretted bone, [...] The very spirit of Paleness made still paler [...] By the shuddering moonlight, fix'd his eyes on mine [...] Horrible with the anger and the heat [...] Of the remorseful soul alive within, [...] And damn'd unto his loathed tenement. [...] Methinks I could have sooner met that gaze! [...] Oh, how her choice did leap forth from his eyes! [...] Oh, how her love did clothe itself in smiles [...] About his lips! This was the very arch-mock [...] And insolence of uncontrolled Fate, [...] When the effect weigh'd seas upon my head [...] To twit me with the cause. [...] Why how was this? [...] Could he not walk what paths he chose, nor breathe [...] What airs he pleased! Was not the wide world free, [...] With all her interchange of hill and plain [...] To him as well as me? I know not, faith: [...] But Misery, like a fretful, wayward child, [...] Refused to look his author in the face, [...] Must he come my way too? Was not the South, [...] The East, the West, all open, if he had fall'n [...] In love in twilight? Why should he come my way, [...] Robed in those robes of light I must not wear, [...] With that great crown of beams about his brows? [...] Come like an angel to a damned soul? [...] To tell him of the bliss he had with God; [...] Come like a careless and a greedy heir, [...] That scarce can wait the reading of the will [...] Before he takes possession? Was mine a mood [...] To be invaded rudely, and not rather [...] A sacred, secret, unapproached woe [...] Unspeakable? I was shut up with grief; [...] She took the body of my past delight, [...] Narded, and swathed and balm'd it for herself, [...] And laid it in a new-hewn sepulchre, [...] Where man had never lain. I was led mute [...] Into her temple like a sacrifice; [...] I was the high-priest in her holiest place, [...] Not to be loudly broken in upon. [...] Oh! friend, thoughts deep and heavy as these well-nigh [...] O'erbore the limits of my brain; but he [...] Bent o'er me, and my neck his arm upstay'd [...] From earth. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> adder's fold, [...] And once I strove to disengage myself, [...] But fail'd, I was so feeble. She was there too: [...] She bent above me too: her cheek was pale, [...] Oh! very fair and pale: rare pity had stolen [...] The living bloom away, as tho' a red rose [...] Should change into a white one suddenly. [...] Her eyes, I saw, were full of tears in the morn, [...] And some few drops of that distressful rain [...] Being wafted on the wind, drove in my sight, [...] And being there they did break forth afresh [...] In a new birth, immingled with my own, [...] And still bewept my grief. Keeping unchanged [...] The purport of their coinage. Her long ringlets, [...] Drooping and beaten with the plaining wind, [...] Did brush my forehead in their to-and-fro: [...] For in the sudden anguish of her heart [...] Loosed from their simple thrall they had flowed abroad, [...] And onward floating in a full, dark wave, [...] Parted on either side her argent neck, [...] Mantling her form half way. She, when I woke, [...] After my refluent health made tender quest [...] Unanswer'd, for I spoke not: for the sound [...] Of that dear voice so musically low, [...] And now first heard with any sense of pain, [...] As it had taken life away before, [...] Choked all the syllables that in my throat [...] Strove to uprise, laden with mournful thanks, [...] From my full heart: and ever since that hour, [...] My voice hath somewhat falter'd--and what wonder [...] That when hope died, part of her eloquence [...] Died with her? He, the blissful lover, too, [...] From his great hoard of happiness distill'd [...] Some drops of solace; like a vain rich man, [...] That, having always prosper'd in the world, [...] Folding his hands deals comfortable words [...] To hearts wounded for ever; yet, in truth, [...] Fair speech was his and delicate of phrase, [...] Falling in whispers on the sense, address'd [...] More to the inward than the outward ear, [...] As rain of the midsummer midnight soft [...] Scarce-heard, recalling fragrance and the green [...] Of the dead spring--such as in other minds [...] Had film'd the margents of the recent wound. [...] And why was I to darken their pure love, [...] If, as I knew, they two did love each other, [...] Because my own was darken'd? Why was I [...] To stand within the level of their hopes, [...] Because my hope was widow'd, like the cur [...] In the child's adage? Did I love Camilla? [...] Ye know that I did love her: to this present [...] My full-orb'd love hath waned not. Did I love her, [...] And could I look upon her tearful eyes? [...] Tears wept for me; for me--weep at my grief? [...] What had she done to weep--let my heart [...] Break rather--whom the gentlest airs of heaven [...] Should kiss with an unwonted gentleness. [...] Her love did murder mine; what then? she deem'd [...] I wore a brother's mind: she call'd me brother: [...] She told me all her love: she shall not weep.|$|E
