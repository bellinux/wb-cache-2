40|$|Migration is {{a feature}} of social and {{economic}} life across many countries, but the profile of migrant populations varies considerably.

30|$|Let’s {{start by}} {{claiming}} that transport has been a central issue of European political and social debate post Second World War. Freedom of movement <b>for</b> <b>Europe’s</b> <b>citizens</b> {{has been a source}} of political struggle, in which the potentiality of a border-free continent should have initiated an era of peace, prosperity and development. The lack of restrictions on movement <b>for</b> EU <b>citizens</b> (and goods) is indeed a pillar of European Union existence, a fundamental issue for its political legitimation and self-representation [27]. For those blessed with an EU passport, visa requirements are today often trivial, whilst border controls inside of the Schengen area are regarded as no more than a historical instance. The ability of goods to move around is even more extensive, considering how nowadays, roughly only 30  % of any final product contains local inputs [39]. In other words, transport is at the core of our everyday life, whatever we perform it as daily commuters, new hyper-mobile nomads or goods’ consumers. Transport embeds every interstice of our life, even when we don’t move at all.|$|R

40|$|In February 2017 Romania made {{headlines}} in major international media across the globe: during an entire month massive anti-corruption protests took place almost daily across the country. There were the largest protests {{since the fall}} of the communist regime in December 1989 and were triggered by a government’s decree to decriminalize abuse in office by officials if the sums were less than circa 45. 000 euro. In reporting about the protests, the international media covered extensively aspects such as: (1) the civic nature of the protests (high rate of engagement among citizens in order to make their voice heard); (2) the use of social media for the organization of the protests (Facebook events, #rezist, etc); (3) the creative use of digital technologies during the protests (wall projections, mobile phone lights to recreate the national flag and the EU flag); (4) the creativity of the posters created by protesters (initially in Romanian, then in English in order to be understood by international audiences); (5) setting an example in <b>Europe</b> <b>for</b> how <b>citizens</b> stand up <b>for</b> democratic values, fight corruption and mobilize (Romania was considered the last country in the region to fight populism, while protests in France are legitimizing from the Romanian ones, etc). Main research question: Can protests be a form of citizen diplomacy, generating alternative discourses about the country image and identity? Methodology: Historical reconstitution & chronology of events; Exploratory corpus of data for January 18 - February 28, 2017 in the Facebook community “Coruptia ucide” (posts and events). Findings: Protests became a form of citizen diplomacy, indirectly, through a gradual process of social construction (stages intersect & influence each other) Conclusion: Protests gain international relevance due to appeal to universal democratic values. Protesters become aware of their symbolic soft power and strategically instrumentalize creativity and humour to gain international benevolence. They generate alternative discourses about Romania - creative country, the hope from East Europe. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of how non state actors are increasingly engaging in strategic campaigns of promoting their country and how social movements become opportunities for generating alternative discourses about a country and about its national identity...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} about good governance, as {{presented}} in the 2001 EC White Paper, in relation to environmental legal policy making in Europe. First a concise analysis is made {{of the concept of}} good governance. Then, in a ``tour d’horizon’’, environmental policy programmes, legal cornerstones and instruments are described {{on the basis of the}} five main principles of good governance: openness; participation; accountability; effectiveness; and coherence. This overview illustrates the move toward good governance, fitting with the wording of the fifth Environmental Action Programme of 1993 : ``Whereas previous environmental measures tended to be prescriptive in character with an emphasis on the `thou shalt not’ approach, the new strategy leans more towards a `let’s work together’ approach. ’’ However, much is yet to be done, if a true shift in governance is to be brought about. A further analysis is therefore made of the possibilities of enhancing the concept of good environmental governance under the future European Constitution. Major improvements are within grasp if there is a willingness to place a ``clean’’ <b>Europe</b> <b>for</b> <b>citizens</b> before the single market, introduce basic citizens’ rights on basic environmental standards, further support for environmental NGO’s and allow for more competition between Member State...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{relations}} between Portuguese-speakers living in London. It takes {{the experience of}} Lusophones {{as a case study}} in illuminating how intragroup diversity is negotiated and transnational, multi-ethnic identities constructed and performed in everyday life. Through critical ethnography and interviewing, I provide an account of the varied experience of ‘belonging’ in <b>Europe,</b> <b>for</b> <b>citizens</b> and migrants who connect through similar language and cultural affinities and a shared, albeit contentious, history. By exploring daily rituals in workplaces, bars, cafes, and shops owned, operated, and patronized by Lusophones, I unpack postcolonial reconfigurations of citizens and migrants in their everyday experience of ‘open’ Europe and provide insight into the discursive processes of emergent and complex diasporic identities. The study found that while Portuguese and Brazilian individuals connect in daily ritual, often to consume similar goods and/or work together in similar roles, language ideology plays a central role in mediating interaction and relations remain superficial and often contentious. For Portuguese, narratives of their own ‘rightness’ – when it comes to stories of migration, doing business, and conducting everyday life – along with the privilege of European citizenship, are tropes employed to distinguish themselves from other Lusophones, especially Brazilians, with whom they are often compared to by other groups. Luso Africans share less connection in every day life with both Portuguese and Brazilians despite living in close proximity, and express more affinity with migrants from other African points of origin than fellow Lusophones. The study suggests that for Portuguese and Brazilians especially, language, identity politics and the citizen-migrant distinction {{play a central role in}} mitigating meaningful interaction around shared concern and social issues impacting both groups as ‘non-native’ to the UK. Furthermore, important questions of race – which since colonial times have been at the very core of determining social privilege - are sidestepped by the drawing of moral boundaries of ‘right versus wrong’ and the ‘European vs. non-European’...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cancer Registries (CRs) {{remain the}} gold {{standard}} for providing official epidemiological estimations. However, due to CRs' partial population coverage, hospitalization records might represent a valuable tool to provide additional information on cancer occurrence and expenditures at national/regional level for research purposes. The Epidemiology of Cancer in Italy (EPIKIT) study group has been built up, {{within the framework of the}} Civic Observers for Health and Environment: Initiative of Responsibility and Sustainability (COHEIRS) project under the auspices of the <b>Europe</b> <b>for</b> <b>Citizens</b> Program, to assess population health indicators. Objective: To assess the burden of all cancers in Italian children and adults. Methods: We analyzed National Hospitalization Records from 2001 to 2011. Based on social security numbers (anonymously treated), we have excluded from our analyses all re-hospitalizations of the same patients (n = 1, 878, 109) over the entire 11 -year period in order to minimize the overlap between prevalent and incident cancer cases. To be more conservative, only data concerning the last five years (2007 - 2011) have been taken into account for final analyses. The absolute number of hospitalizations and standardized hospitalization rates (SHR) were computed for each Italian province by sex and age-groups (0 - 19 and 20 - 49). Results: The EPIKIT database included a total of 4, 113, 169 first hospital admissions due to main diagnoses of all tumors. The annual average number of hospital admissions due to cancer in Italy has been computed in 2362 and 43, 141 hospitalizations in pediatric patients (0 - 19 years old) and adults (20 - 49 years old), respectively. Women accounted for the majority of cancer cases in adults aged 20 - 49. As expected, the big city of Rome presented the highest average annual number of pediatric cancers (n = 392, SHR = 9. 9), followed by Naples (n = 378; SHR = 9. 9) and Milan (n = 212; SHR = 7. 3). However, when we look at SHR, minor cities (i. e., Imperia, Isernia and others) presented values > 10 per 100, 000, with only 10 or 20 cases per year. Similar figures are shown also for young adults aged 20 - 49. Conclusions: In addition to SHR, the absolute number of incident cancer cases represents a crucial piece of information for planning adequate healthcare services and assessing social alarm phenomena. Our findings call for specific risk assessment programs at local level (involving CRs) to search for causal relations with environmental exposures...|$|E

40|$|This article {{outlines}} the changing role {{of culture in}} modern economy. According to European examinations and researches (including the European Commission), culture {{is one of the}} biggest and most dynamically developing employers of Europe, supporting increasingly domestic economies, particularly at the regional level. According to many economists, for instance David Throsby (Professor of Economics at Macquarie University in Sydney), countries, which are not investing in culture at the age of innovative economies cannot function properly. Culture is no longer perceived only in terms of some aesthetic values but is more often regarded as an economical motor. Moreover, the definition of culture applies now to a very broad range of activities, including creative sectors, which are using cultural resources. Culture becomes a web of different sectors. Culture has a direct and indirect impact on economy, especially in the social sphere, it may also strongly affect economic transformations of areas, characterized by low level of general investments. Furthermore, it becomes an object of scientific and economical analyses. Many European countries are demonstrating an interest in the economics and culture, Great Britain or Germany for example – adapting widely culture for economic and social purposes. However this process needs a great deal of support, it is not possible without coherent promotional and educational system, deeply hierarchical model, active participation of non-government organizations, a huge amount of plans and assistance programs dedicated to culture at the local, regional and domestic level, as well as wide non-profit social contribution into the bloom of this increasingly important branch. The idea of profitable culture should be attached to national development strategies. We should create appropriate mechanisms, changing the social attitude towards culture, harnessing informative and educational campaigns raising public awareness of the notion of National Heritage (already at the level of basic education). Long-term programs aiming cultural education are compulsory, within different aspects of its activity. Culture fulfills multiple purposes important for the economy, it stimulates : the labour market, the entrepreneurship of private, public institutions and the society, development of new technologies, tourism, development of professional qualifications (in particular shaping the idea of lifelong learning), other industries. The proportion of well-educated employees in the cultural & creative sector is significant, what was proven in British examinations. Finally, culture allows Poland to apply for a huge financial aid from the EU funds: Culture Programme, European Capital of Culture, Media 2007 Programme, Digital Libraries initiatives, Lifelong Learning Programme or <b>Europe</b> <b>for</b> <b>Citizens</b> project. The role of culture shouldn’t be underestimated at the time of economic chaos in Europe, when governments are deciding on budget cuts. To some extent the article is answering a question, whether the culture should undergo additional funding now, so when the national debts are growing, or it would be illogical...|$|E
