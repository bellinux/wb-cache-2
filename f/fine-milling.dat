40|$|<b>Fine-milling</b> is {{a crucial}} {{objective}} for lignocellulosic biomass valorization. Co-milling {{appears to be a}} promising technique to improve its efficiency. However, the mechanisms occurring while co-milling remain poorly understood. In this study, an experimental work was performed to produce co-milled powders from both lignocellulosic (wheat, straw or pine sawdust) and mineral materials (limestone, quartzite or tile) with very contrasted physicochemical properties. The main consequences of co-milling were studied for both materials. A two-component mixing law for the prediction of the blend properties was proposed (particle sizes and true densities) to highlight the gain of this single processing step compared to separate milling and mixing. The predicted values were compared with experimental data for co-milled powders at 7 biomass contents from 0 % to 100 %. In all cases, co-milling leads to a reduction in particle size of lignocellulosic materials and create strong interweaving with mineral particles...|$|E

Crassostrea angulata shell characterized by a natural microporous structure (2 - 10 mu m) was used as raw material. Firstly, plate-like nanocrystals of AB-type carbonated hydroxyapatite (HA) were produced by hydrothermal conversion of <b>fine-milled</b> oyster shell powders. Secondly, interconnected macroporous scaffolds were prepared with the polymer replication method. The obtained scaffolds presented a biphasic structure of hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate (HA/beta-TCP) with a porosity of 91. 4 +/- 1. 2 %, and showed an excellent permeability due to the open macropores (200 - 500 mu m) and interconnected micropores (100 - 500 nm) in macropore walls. The synthetic scaffolds {{were found to be}} non-cytotoxic and displayed better biocompatibility than pure HA scaffolds when seeded with pre-osteoblasts cells (MC 3 T 3 -E 1). Therefore, the macroporous scaffolds derived from oyster shells would offer promising alternatives for bone tissue engineering applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty day-old broiler chicks {{were used for the}} study. 30 chicks were {{assigned}} to each dietary treatment, which was replicated thrice. The chicks were reared on a deep litter system with feed and water supplied ad-libitum. The experiment lasted for 5 weeks. The poultry offal used for the study was collected from a broiler processing farm in Ikorodu, Lagos. The boiled, cooled and dried poultry offal was crushed and <b>fine-milled.</b> Five experimental diets were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric with graded levels of poultry offal meal replacing fishmeal as follows: 0 %; 100 % (control), 25 %; 75 %, 50 %; 50 %, 75 %; 25 % and 100 %; 0 %. The average dry matter intake of chickens fed with poultry offal meal (POM) as replacement for fish meal (FM) increased as more poultry offal meal replaced fishmeal from 1210. 60 grammes in diet I (100 %FM) to 1289. 00 grammes in those fed diet V (100 %POM). However, there were no significant (P> 0. 05) differences in dry matter intake between the treatment means. The average body weight gain of broiler starters in the study which ranged between 603 grammes for chickens fed diet II (25 %POM) and 703. 80 grammes for those fed diet V (100 %POM) did not significantly (P> 0. 05) differ as the level of replacement of fishmeal by poultry offal meal increased. With the feed conversion ratio, though broiler chickens fed diets IV (75 %POM) and V (100 %POM) respectively showed negligible superiority (1. 83 and 1. 84) over others, there were no significant (P> 0. 05) differences among treatment means...|$|R
