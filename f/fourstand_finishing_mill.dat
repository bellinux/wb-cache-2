30|$|When <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> the Al alloy, {{the most}} intuitionistic {{criterion}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of the milling cutter is the surface quality of the workpiece, which is associated with not only the initial condition of the milling cutter, but also the wear or fracture in the machining process. Surface roughness Ra and Rz values of as-machined workpieces are both measured. It is well acknowledged that the Ra value is the most commonly-used parameter, which can fully reflect micro-geometrical features of the surface. Besides, the Rz value is also widely used for evaluating the surface quality of the Al alloy workpiece during the <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> process, since it can reflect the existence and the severity of the surface texture caused by the milling cutter to a certain extent. The surface texture is one of the critical criteria for evaluating the machining quality of many Al alloy workpieces after the <b>finish</b> <b>milling,</b> such as the mobile phone shells, and such the surface texture is mostly parallel to the feed direction. As a result, when measuring the surface roughness by the surface profilometer, the scanning direction is selected to be perpendicular to the surface texture (the feed direction), and thus the Rz value that can fully reflect the surface texture can be obtained.|$|R

40|$|Hot strip rolling {{production}} is a high-speed process which requires high-speed control and communication system, {{but because of}} the long distance between the delivery stand of the <b>finishing</b> <b>mill</b> and the gauge meter, dead time occurs when strip is transported from the site of the actuator to another location where the gauge meter takes its reading, which seriously affects the thickness control effect.

40|$|International audienceLubrication {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{for improving}} the <b>finishing</b> <b>mill</b> process in hot rolling. The lubrication changes the contact interface between the work rolls and the hot strip. The lubrication can reduce the rolling force, the rolling torque, the energy consumption, the work rolls consumption and the work rolls wear. Lubrication is also a lever to optimize <b>finishing</b> <b>mill</b> capability. That is why understanding the lubrication effect is important. A way to study the lubrication is thanks {{to the analysis of}} the friction coefficient between the work rolls and the strip, which characterizes the contact at the interface. The lubrication reduces the friction coefficient which has an impact on the mass flow disturbing the thickness reduction and the interstand strip tension. The understanding of the lubrication effect goes through a design of a model that relies on lubrication and friction. ArcerlorMittal R&D performed industrial lubrication trials in the pilot plant’s <b>finishing</b> <b>mill.</b> For this purpose, R&D designed a dedicated mobile dosing unit (oil in water concentration control and portable system).

40|$|Thesis (M. Eng. (Electrical Engineering) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Eskom is {{currently}} experiencing problems with its electricity supply because of rapidly increasing electricity consumption in Southern Africa. One {{of the relatively}} short-term solutions to this problem is demand side management (DSM) through load shifting. DSM load shifting occurs when large electricity-consuming equipment is stopped during the peak hours of each weekday. In the cement industry, the two largest electricity users in a cement manufacturing plant are the raw <b>mill</b> and the <b>finishing</b> <b>mill.</b> When load shifting is applied to cement plants for testing, because of the complex system, production can be lost. A cement plant will not tolerate any loss in production hence {{the need for a}} simulation model to simulate the effects of load shifting in a cement plant. In this study, a new simulation model was developed to determine the viability of a DSM project in the raw <b>mill</b> and <b>finishing</b> <b>mill</b> sections of South African cement plants. For a DSM project to be possible there must be no loss in production. In the production process, the silos store the milled products. If the silo runs empty, there is no material for the kiln or packaging plant to process, which will result in a loss in production. The level of the silo is therefore vital in the simulation model. The simulation model consists of two parts. The first part simulates the silo level over a period of one month to determine whether the level remains within the specified limits. The second calculates the optimised baseline versus the historical baseline, load shifting potential and possible annual cost savings. It is critical that the correct inputs to the simulation model are obtained to acquire accurate results. The second part of the simulation can only be applied if the silo level is within specifications. The simulation was applied to the raw milling section of two different cement plants and also to the <b>finishing</b> <b>milling</b> section of two different cement plants. Both raw milling sections showed a potential for DSM intervention. For confidentiality purposes, the cement plants will be referred to as Plant A, B, C, and D. In Plant A, five hours of load shifting, realising a maximum potential of 2. 08 MW in morning peaks and 2. 05 MW in evening peaks, were possible per weekday. Plant B had a possible 0. 79 MW in morning peak hours and 1. 96 MW evening peak hours load shifting potential per weekday for two hours each day. An annual cost saving of R 474, 000 for Plant A and R 293, 000 for Plant B could be realised. There was possible load shifting potential of 3. 52 MW in morning peaks and 3. 94 MW in evening peaks in the <b>finishing</b> <b>milling</b> section of Plant C. Five hours of load shifting per weekday means an annual cost saving of R 898, 000. The silo simulation on the <b>finishing</b> <b>milling</b> section of Plant D showed that the silo level could not remain within the limits when load shifting was applied. Hence there is no scope for a DSM project in the <b>finishing</b> <b>milling</b> section of Plant D. The simulation model developed in this thesis provides an accurate indication of the silo level over a period of one month and projects the possible load shifting and annual cost savings where a cement plant is found to have a viable DSM load shift potential.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to predict the {{front-end}} curvature in hot strip <b>finishing</b> <b>mills</b> and to prevent it by controlling the rolling conditions. A theoretical model based on the slab method is developed for predicting the front-end curvature by taking into account the entrance angle of the strip, the friction condition and the back tension. To validate the developed theoretical model, the theoretically obtained curvature value is compared with the results of finite element analysis. Consequently, it is shown that the calculation results of the theoretical model are in good agreement with the measured results of the finite element analysis. Furthermore, a curvature control model based on geometrical and mathematical approaches that can reduce the front-end curvature by the control of the roll speed ratio of the upper to lower rolls is proposed. The proposed curvature control model is verified by finite element analysis, and it is shown that the front-end curvature can be reduced considerably using the proposed model. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed control model for reducing the front-end curvature in a hot strip <b>finishing</b> <b>mill</b> can be used to improve the quality of the rolled product...|$|R
