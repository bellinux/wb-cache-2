Currently, the center features national chains, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Great Clips, and Subway.|$|E
50|$|Other {{matters that}} are {{scattered}} through the book, correspond to matters that other unwritten volumes of Lo Crestià should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> They speak for instance about marriage and penance (and the Desè, or tenth volume, should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> sacraments), religious vows and contemplation (and the Onzè, or eleventh volume, should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> clergy) {{or about the}} final chapters, that deal with eschatological (and the Tretzè, or thirteenth volume, should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> Eschatology {{and the end of}} the world, and the reward or punishment that people will then receive, according to medieval mentality.|$|R
50|$|This {{work could}} {{correspond}} maybe with the Onzè (eleventh volume) of Lo Crestià, that Eiximenis did not write, that should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> priests.

25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{relation}} between {{the language of the}} Minoan Linear A scripts was taken into consideration as the main hypothesis by Michael Ventris before he discovered that, in fact, the language behind the later Linear B script was Mycenean, a Greek dialect. Giulio Mauro Facchetti, a researcher who <b>has</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> both Etruscan and Minoan, put forward this hypothesis again in 2001, comparing some Minoan words of known meaning with similar Etruscan words.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{the final}} part, the one {{dedicated}} to nuns, {{which is the}} longest one, is a short treatise on theology. In this part Eiximenis gathers many of the materials (even though they are explained in a basic and schematic way), {{that were going to}} be used in the unwritten volumes of Lo Crestià. So this part deals with the theological virtues (and the Cinquè, or fifth volume should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> them), the cardinal virtues (and the Sisè, or sixth volume should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> them), and about the ten commandments (and the Setè, or seventh volume should <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> them).|$|R

25|$|Chapter 7 is a {{description}} of covenant theology, which holds that God <b>has</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> humans through various covenants. In the first covenant, a covenant of works, Adam and his descendants were promised life {{on the condition of}} perfect obedience. The fall made it impossible for man to keep this covenant, so God made another covenant, this one called the covenant of grace. In the covenant of grace, God freely offered sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ. As part of this covenant, God promises to give the elect the Holy Spirit to make them willing and able to believe.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Macon Dead Jr.'s sister, Pilate, {{is seen as}} nurturing—an Earth Mother character. Born {{without a}} navel, she is a {{somewhat}} mystical character. It is strongly implied that she is Divine—a female Christ—in spite of her name. Macon (Jr.) has not spoken to his sister for years and does not think highly of her. She, like Macon, has had to fend for herself {{from an early age}} after their father's murder, but she <b>has</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> her past in a different way than Macon, who has embraced money as the way to show his love for his father. Pilate has a daughter, Reba, and a granddaughter named Hagar. Hagar falls desperately and obsessively in love with Milkman, and is unable to cope with his rejection, attempting to kill him at least six times.|$|E
25|$|Much {{analysis}} of the experiment <b>has</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain. This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a power law model {{much better than the}} hyperbolic models that had been used earlier. As a power law model describes an ever-slowing increase that has no upper limit, while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations. Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed power law model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, adaptation and adaptive divergence can potentially increase indefinitely, even in a constant environment.|$|E

25|$|The 21st {{century has}} {{witnessed}} a vigorous {{revival of the}} idea of human nature in the hands of authors like Edward Wilson, Steven Pinker and Jesús Mosterín. The successful sequencing of the human genome and the ongoing research on the function of genes and of regulatory sequences, together with the insights on the workings of the brain, have brought a new actuality and significance to this classical notion. According to Mosterín, the nature of our species Homo sapiens is the information genetically transmitted and present in the human genome (in the genetic pool). Your individual nature lies in your own genome, present in the chromosomes of your cells. The human genome has a layered structure and (up to a point) recapitulates the history of our human lineage. The oldest and deepest strata of our nature represent the living functions common to all life on Earth. Subsequent strata reflect later novelties. The newest layers are devoted to the most recent acquisitions, like bipedalism, grip of precision, large brain cortex, language and other abstract or recursive cognitive processes. Mosterín <b>has</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> the methods and criteria for distinguishing natural from cultural aspects of human capacities and behaviors and has provided a solid basis to theoretical anthropology. He has also engaged in the discussion and clarification of bioethical issues, like research with embryonic stem cells, birth control, abortion and euthanasia, taking always a scientific point of view and a position in favor of human freedom.|$|E
