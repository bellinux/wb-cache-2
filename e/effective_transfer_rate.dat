Yet an understanding of the role of pore size, attraction to pore walls and of the release mechanism in general has still been elusive. Here we address these issues by means of a simple 2 -dimensional (2 D) model of ordered porous matrices with various pore sizes and strengths of molecule-wall attractions. The system dynamics are described with a 2 D Fokker-Planck equation which is solved numerically for various cases of initial concentration distribution. We show that the interactions with walls play an essential and fundamental role in controlled release from mesoporous materials, regardless of whether they are additionally functionalized or not. They affect the relative cross-section where the local flux has a non-vanishing axial component and accordingly the <b>effective</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> into bulk solution.

The aim of the paper {{is to determine the}} packet length effect on the effective radio networks transmission rate with taking into account the parameters, formats, and procedures of the physical and link levels at using the MAC protocol with a rigid strategy of competitive access to the radio channel. Methods. The goal is achieved by creating and analyzing the mathematical model of the effective transmission rate in radio networks. The model is described by the equation for the effective transmission rate, which is the function of both the probability of the conflict-free transmission of the MAC protocol and the coefficient of the data packet size deviation from the optimal for LLC protocol. Results. It is proved that there is the optimal deviation of the data packet length for each MAC protocol traffic intensity value, which provides the most <b>effective</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b> This makes the possibility for adaptive management of the radio bandwidth by applying a pre-calculated deviation of the data packet size in dependence on the traffic intensity.

The molecules can self-assemble to form quasi 1 -dimensional conducting columns, in which electrons can be temporarily trapped. Given the short mean free path of conducting electrons, due to surface and impurity scattering, the long range transport is modelled using a diffusion scheme through a discrete lattice, whose sites are defined by the locations of the self-organised molecular columns.

These media have become a part ofeveryday life including not only electronic consumer products but also online streaming media services on the Internet. Due to 1) successful standards forcompression and file formats, such as MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group), 2) increased network capacity for local area networks (LAN) and the Internet, and 3) advanced streaming protocols (e. g., Real Time Streaming Protocol, RTSP), more and more multimedia database applications, combined with the Internet,are providing streaming media services such as remote viewing of video clips. Streaming media (SM) have two main characteristics. First, SM data mustbe displayed at a pre-specified rate. Any deviation from this real-time requirement may result in undesirable artifacts, disruptions, and jitters, collectivelytermed hiccups. Second, SM objects are large in size. For example, the size of a two-hour MPEG- 2 encoded digital movie requiring 4 Mb/s for its display i...|$|R

The <b>effective</b> heat <b>transfer</b> requires large substrate area that is in contact with the flowing liquid and availability of large mass of fluid to carry away the heat.

However, there is a practical maximum limit on the number of channels that can be imbedded in the back surface of the substrate by bulk etching. A collection of parallel ladder shape micro channels with rectangular cross section have been introduced and extensively studied by the authors for heat sinking in ULSI circuits. It has been shown that the substrate area extended by the link channels effectively decrease the thermal resistance and increases heat transfer coefficient. The flow performance of these ladder shape micro channels have also been studied using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS with three different geometrical dimensions (Device -A, Device -B, Device -C) and the comparison of the flow and thermal performance indicating parameters of the collection of ladder shape micro channels show that the high performance heat sinking can be designed using only when the aspect ratio is smalle...|$|R

In view of selecting the optimum oxygen requirements for extractive fermentation in aqueous two-phase system (ATPS), the k(L) a values in a typical ATPS medium were compared in this work with those in distilled water and in a simple fermentation medium. in the absence of biomass. Aeration and agitation were selected as the independent variables using a 2 (2) full factorial design. Both variables showed statistically significant effects on k(L) a, and the highest values of this parameter in both media for simple fermentation (241 s(- 1)) and extractive fermentation with ATPS (70. 3 s(- 1)) were observed {{at the highest levels of}} aeration (5 vvm) and agitation (1200 rpm). The k(L) a values were then used to establish mathematical correlations of this response as a function of the process variables. The exponents of the power number (N(3) D(2)) and superficial gas velocity (V(s)) determined in distilled water (alpha = 0. 39 and beta = 0. 47, respectively) were in reasonable agreement with the ones reported in the literature for several aqueous systems and close to those determined for a simple fermentation medium (alpha= 0. 38 and beta= 0. 41). On the other hand, as expected by the increased viscosity in the presence of polyethylene glycol, their values were remarkably higher in a typical medium for extractive fermentation (alpha= 0. 50 and beta= 1. 0).

Beyond this point, the heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> is higher for an Ag-water nanofluid as compared to a Cu-water nanofluid, while the wall mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> increases monotonically with ξ to a maximum values before reducing. It is shown that the mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> is higher for a Cu-water nanofluid than for an Ag-water nanofluid. The opposite behavior is observed in the case of suction when f_w = - 1. The mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> for an Ag-water nanofluid is higher than that for a Cu-water nanofluid up to a certain value of ξ, and beyond this critical value, the mass transfer in an Ag-water nanofluid is less than that in a Cu-water nanofluid, Figure  11 (b).|$|R

Numerical results for friction factor, surface heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> and mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> have been presented for parametric variations of the buoyancy ratio parameter Nr, Brownian motion parameter Nb, thermophoresis parameter Nt and Lewis number Le. The dependency of the friction factor, surface heat <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (Nusselt number) and mass <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> on these parameters has been discussed...|$|R
