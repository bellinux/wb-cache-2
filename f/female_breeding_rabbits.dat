30|$|The {{prevalence}} of coccidian oocysts in local meat and Rex rabbits {{was not significantly}} different (P >  0.05), {{which suggests that the}} breed may have little influence on the {{prevalence of}} coccidiosis in rabbit production. The prevalence of coccidian oocysts in weanling rabbits (74  %) was higher than that in growing rabbits (45  %) and <b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits</b> (42  %), and the intensity of infection in young animals (weanling rabbits) was significantly higher (P <  0.05) than in adults (<b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits),</b> This could be due to lower resistance or less immunity to coccidian oocysts in young rabbits compared to elder animals as described previously (Pakandl et al. 2008 a, b).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Placing an {{elevated}} platform {{in the cage}} of rabbits is an option to increase its area. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether raised platform affected the overall activity of <b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits</b> and to evaluate the influence of used material (wire-mesh or wood). Two experimental groups of three male Californian rabbits at four months of age, equal body mass and condition were formed. Their activity was examined in three cage types: without, with platforms wire-mesh and with platforms wooden platforms using camera traps. Separation of cage volume by means of {{an elevated}} platform increased the activity of <b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The rabbit activity was also influenced by the platform material. It was almost three times higher when the platform was made from wood than from wire-mesh. ...|$|R

40|$|Grooming is {{the most}} common form of affiliative {{behavior}} in primates that apart from hygienic and hedonistic benefits offers important social benefits for the performing individuals. This study examined grooming behavior in a cooperatively breeding primate species, characterized by single <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> per group, polyandrous matings, dizygotic twinning, delayed offspring dispersal, and intensive helping behavior. In this system, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> profit from the presence of helpers but also helpers profit from staying in a group and assisting in infant care due to the accumulation of direct and indirect fitness benefits. We examined grooming relationships of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with three classes of partners (breeding males, potentially breeding males, (sub) adult non-breeding offspring) during three reproductive phases (post-partum ovarian inactivity, ovarian activity, pregnancy) in two groups of wild moustached tamarins (Saguinus mystax). We investigated whether grooming can be used to regulate group size by either ‘‘pay-for-help’’ or ‘‘pay-to-stay’’ mechanisms. Grooming of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males and nonbreeding offspring was more intense and more balanced than with potentially breeding males, and most grooming occurred during the breeding females’ pregnancies. Grooming was skewed toward more investment by the <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males during the phases of ovarian activity, and with potentially breeding males during pregnancies. Our results suggest that grooming might be a mechanism used by female moustached tamarins to induce mate association with the breeding male, and to induce certain individuals to stay in the group and help with infant care...|$|R

50|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} meerkats (Suricata suricatta) {{the dominant}} <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> {{is the oldest}} and heaviest female who is highly aggressive toward subordinate <b>females</b> during the <b>breeding</b> season and temporarily evicts subordinate females from the group.

Approximately 3 days after their birth, subordinate females return to the group to help rear the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> pups, at which time the dominant female is no longer aggressive toward them. By inducing the stress response in subordinates the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> disrupts the ovulatory cycle and prevents mating of the subordinate females, or causes the pregnancies of subordinates to fail if they do occur. If her social group is small the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> evicts all subordinate females, {{but if it is}} large she targets older females, pregnant females and non-kin.|$|R

Scars remain visible on uterus for at least 9 months. In <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> once or twice the number of scars exceeds the actual number of young born; in <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> three times the cumulative number of young exeeds scars count thus resulting secondarily in approximation of the mean number of scars and young born. Up to the 10 th day of pregnancy it is possible to determine if the female bred previously.

40|$|Resource {{polygyny}} incurs {{costs of}} having to share <b>breeding</b> resources for <b>female</b> breeders. When <b>breeding</b> with a relative, however, such costs may be lessened by indirect fitness benefits through kin selection, while benefits from mutualistic behaviour, such as communal defence, may increase. If so, females should be less resistant to sharing a territory with a related female than with a non-related one. We investigated whether kin selection may lower the threshold of breeding polygynously, predicting a closer relatedness between polygynous <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> on the same territory than between <b>females</b> <b>breeding</b> on different territories. Northern lapwings, Vanellus vanellus, are suitable for testing this hypothesis as they are commonly polygynous, both sexes take part in nest defence, and the efficiency of nest defence increases {{with the number of}} defenders. Using an index of relatedness derived from DNA fingerprinting, we found that female lapwings that shared polygynous dyads were on average twice as closely related as were random females. Furthermore, relatedness did not correlate with distance between breeders, indicating that our findings cannot be explained by natal philopatry alone. Our results suggest that the polygyny threshold in lapwings may be lowered by inclusive fitness advantages of kin selection...|$|R

Similarly, the appearance of DDT resistance in various forms of Anopheles mosquitoes, and the appearance of myxomatosis resistance in <b>breeding</b> <b>rabbit</b> populations in Australia, are both evidence of the existence of evolution in situations of evolutionary selection pressure in species in which generations occur rapidly.|$|R
