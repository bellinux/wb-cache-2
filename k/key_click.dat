50|$|The {{spurious}} noise {{emitted by}} a transmitter which abruptly switches a carrier {{on and off}} is called <b>key</b> <b>clicks.</b> The noise occurs {{in the part of}} the signal bandwidth further above and below the carrier than required for normal, less abrupt switching. The solution to the problem for CW is to make the transition between on and off to be more gradual, making the edges of pulses soft, appearing more rounded, or to use other modulation methods (e.g. phase modulation). Certain types of power amplifiers used in transmission may aggravate the effect of <b>key</b> <b>clicks.</b>|$|R

5000|$|By the 1990s and 2000s {{digital signal}} {{processing}} and sampling technologies allowed for better imitation of the original Hammond sound, {{and a variety of}} electronic organs, emulator devices, and synthesizers provided an accurate reproduction of the Hammond tone, such as the Kurzweil K2600 and Clavia Nord Electro keyboard. Hammond Suzuki USA currently markets numerous home, church, and professional models that digitally reproduce the sound of vintage Hammond tonewheel organs. Some sophisticated emulation devices have algorithms that recreate many of the nuances of vintage Hammonds, such as the [...] "crosstalk" [...] or [...] "leakage" [...] between tonewheels, the sound of dirty key contacts, <b>key</b> <b>click,</b> a growling tube amplifier, and digital simulations of the rotating Leslie speaker cabinet.|$|E
5000|$|The use of Hammond clones and {{the merits}} of using clones versus the vintage {{electromechanical}} Hammond {{is the subject of}} lively debate amongst musicians. The argument that digital simulations cannot recreate the complex interplay of variables that create the [...] "Hammond sound" [...] (tonewheel leakage, Leslie speaker rotation, etc.) is supported by a review of clones in [...] Keyboard Magazine. The article, entitled [...] "Clonewheel Heaven", reviewed electronic simulations of the traditional Hammond sound, and claimed that some aspects of the vintage electromechanical Hammonds' sound are not accurately reproduced by clones and emulation devices. Nevertheless, the increasing use of clonewheel organs on recordings by jazz and blues organ solo players is testimony to their sound and tone quality; it is also worth noting the wide variety of tonal variations that exist even among genuine vintage tonewheel Hammond organs. Owing to any number of causes — not least of which are the age of its components and the amount of use a tonewheel organ has had — variations in volume levels between tonewheels, varying levels of <b>key</b> <b>click,</b> and other tonal differences are more common than not.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As touch based input {{becomes more}} popular in mobile devices, {{there is an}} {{increasing}} need for haptic feedback on key-less input surface. Four experiments were conducted to design and evaluate identifiable emulated key-click signals using a piezoelectric actuator. Experiments I and II assessed the information transmission capacity for the amplitude, frequency, and number of cycles of raised cosine waveforms used to drive the piezo actuators under fixed- and roving-background conditions, respectively. Experiment III estimated the total information transfer for all three parameters. The results were used {{to reduce the number}} of stimulus alternatives in the key-click signal set with the goal to achieve perfect identification performance. Experiment IV verified that up to 5 to 6 identifiable key-click signals could be achieved with the experimental setup. The present study outlines an information theoretic approach to conducting identification experiments to guide the design of and to evaluate a perfectly identifiable stimulus set. The methodology can be applied to other applications in need of perceptually identifiable stimulation patterns.

40|$|International audienceWith eye gaze {{tracking}} technology entering the consumer market, {{there is an}} increased interest in using it as an input device, similar to the mouse. This holds promise for situations where a typical desk space is not available. While gaze seems natural for pointing, it is inherently inaccurate, which makes the design of fast and accurate methods for clicking targets (“click alternatives”) difficult. We investigate click alternatives that combine gaze with a standard keyboard (“gaze & <b>key</b> <b>click</b> alternatives”) to achieve an experience where the user’s hands can remain on the keyboard all the time. We propose three novel click alternatives (“Letter Assignment”, “Offset Menu” and “Ray Selection”) and present an experiment that compares them with a naive gaze pointing approach (“Gaze & Click”) and the mouse. The experiment uses a randomized, realistic click task in a web browser to collect data about click times and click accuracy, as well as asking users for their preference. Our results indicate that eye {{gaze tracking}} is currently too inaccurate for the Gaze & Click approach to work reliably. While Letter Assignment and Offset Menu were usable and a large improvement, they were still significantly slower and less accurate than the mouse...|$|E
