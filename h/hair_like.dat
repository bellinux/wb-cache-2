5|$|The {{art critic}} Hugh Davies has {{suggested}} that of the three figures, that on the left most closely resembles a human form, and that it might represent a mourner at the cross. Seated on a table-like structure, this limbless creature has an elongated neck, heavily rounded shoulders, and a thick mop of dark <b>hair.</b> <b>Like</b> its affiliate objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.|$|E
5|$|While {{the goddess}} is a mature sixteen-year old who has conquered her ego and awakened her kundalini, the attendants are {{described}} as spiritually immature twelve-year olds who are sustained on the goddess's blood and have not become liberated from the delusion of duality. In portrayals where the goddess's hair is tied like a matron and her attendants have free-flowing <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> young girls, the goddess is treated as a motherly figure of regal authority and power; the tied hair and headlessness represent contrasting ideas of controlled and uncontrolled nature, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

5|$|In one of {{earliest}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images {{dating from}} the Gupta era - c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), {{the positions of the}} boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration. The central front face may be smiling. Sometimes, the back face may be omitted. The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu). The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a large knot - a jata (matted <b>hair)</b> <b>like</b> a sage; rarely he may wear a crown.|$|E
5|$|Shantae is a {{platform}} adventure game, in which players play as the eponymous Shantae, a half-genie who must travel across various areas {{in order to}} stop the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. Shantae's default attack involves using her <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> a whip. Shantae can also use gems obtained from defeated enemies to purchase items, such as life-restoring potions and damaging items with various uses, as well as learn upgraded combat moves. The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between them. In order to progress through the game, Shantae must seek out various characters who will open up dungeons, with each dungeon containing a guardian genie that will teach Shantae a new dance. By using these dances, Shantae can transform herself into different animals, including a monkey that can climb on walls, an elephant that can smash objects such as boulders and tree stumps, a spider that can climb across webbing in the background, and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. Shantae must use these abilities to reach new areas or find hidden items.|$|E

Hair beds {{and groups of}} small <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> sensilla, determine proprioreception or information about {{the position of a}} limb, and are found on the cuticle at the joints of segments and legs. Pressure on the body wall or strain gauges are detected by the campiniform sensilla and internal stretch receptors sense muscle distension and digestive system stretching.|$|E
25|$|He met {{the first}} serious love of his life, Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and {{although}} 21-year-old Anna was recently married, they began an affair. Anna was tall (as Modigliani was only 5 foot 5inches) with dark <b>hair</b> (<b>like</b> Modigliani's), pale skin and grey-green eyes, she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other. After a year, however, Anna returned to her husband.|$|E
50|$|Melaleuca hollidayi is a shrub {{growing to}} 1.3 m, usually less but often {{spreading}} {{to more than}} 1 m wide and which has papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately, linear in shape, oval in cross section, 5-12 mm long, 0.5-0.8 mm wide with a rounded end and a covering of fine <b>hairs</b> <b>like</b> spider silk.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} stage, the pale grey {{body of the}} larva has {{longitudinal}} brown lines, a number of black-knobbed <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> structures, a brown head with no horns, and a rear with no fork. In the following stages, the rear develops a fork, the longitudinal lines become green, and the larva itself becomes green. The mature larva is green and about 28mm long. The feeding habits for the larva extend from winter through early spring. It feeds on grasses like slender tussock grass, kangaroo grass, and false brome.|$|E
25|$|Now {{imagine that}} this woman grows up and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these children have a chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> their grandfather.|$|E

25|$|To be sure, {{the ethnic}} {{definitions}} were loose categorisations. Overarching politico-ethnic identities {{were still in}} their early stages of development. In the western mainland, even the so-called major ethnic groups—such as Burmans, Mons, Shans—were themselves divided into rival centres, with distinctive local traditions {{and in many cases}} different dialects. The same was true for smaller minorities still—indeed, terms like Kachins, Karens, and Chins are exonyms given by Burmans that summarily group several different groups. In the central mainland, the main Siamese, Lao and Yuan ethnicities were still in an embryonic stage, and a chiefly elite concept. In Siam, the Siamese language and ethnicity were the “preserve” of the aristocracy called the munnai, and most commoners in Ayutthaya, according to an early 16th-century Portuguese observer, still spoke Mon dialects rather than still emerging Siamese, and cut their <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> the Mons of Pegu.|$|E
25|$|Among the Aztecs, the god Xolotl was {{a monstrous}} dog. During the {{creation}} of the Fifth Sun, Xolotl was hunted by Death and escaped him by transforming himself first into a sprout of maize, then into maguey leaves and finally as a salamander in a pool of water. The third time that Death found Xolotl, he trapped and killed him. Three important foodstuffs were produced from the body of this mythological dog. Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Dead, had the bones of man in the underworld, kept over from the previous creations. Xolotl descended to the underworld to steal these bones so that man could be reborn in the new creation of the Fifth Sun. Xolotl managed to recover the bones and brought man to life by piercing his penis and bleeding upon them. Xolotl was seen as an incarnation of the planet Venus as the Evening Star (the Morning Star was his twin brother Quetzalcoatl). Xolotl was the canine companion of the Sun, following its path through both the sky and the underworld. Xolotl's strong connection with the underworld, death and the dead is demonstrated by the symbols he bore. In the Codex Borbonicus Xolotl is pictured with a knife in his mouth, a symbol of death, and has black wavy <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> the hair worn by the gods of death.|$|E

500|$|Social {{pressures}} at {{the time}} were heavily influencing these Americans (women) to have, straight <b>hair,</b> <b>like</b> white people did. This resulted in the Black is beautiful movement, wherein African Americans wore their long natural hair, that was however, untreated and unmodified. More recently, hair-extensions have become widespread. Scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have straight smooth hair. Amelia Jones points out that dolls for children, such as Barbies, add to this pressure, citing as an example a new, black Barbie with straight hair. Blacks, she believes, should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to [...] "tame" [...] their hair.|$|E
500|$|The head is {{long with}} an overall shape similar to an {{equilateral}} triangle, a strong chin, and a muzzle of medium length; a square or round-shaped head {{is considered to be}} a defect.

The ears are large, wide at the base, and high set, have a tufted top, are placed in the extension of the triangle formed by the head, and end with a tuft of <b>hair</b> <b>like</b> the ears of the lynx.

The earliest surviving written account of Silkies comes from Marco Polo, who wrote of a [...] "furry chicken" [...] in the 13th century during his travels in Asia.
