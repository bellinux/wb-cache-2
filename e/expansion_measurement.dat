40|$|Cumulus {{expansion}} of the cumulus-oocyte complex is necessary for meiotic maturation and acquiring developmental competence. Cumulus expansion is based on extracellular matrix synthesis by cumulus cells. Hyaluronic acid is the most abundant component of this extracellular matrix. Cumulus expansion takes place during meiotic oocyte maturation under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Quantification and measurement of cumulus expansion intensity is one possible method of determining oocyte quality and optimizing conditions for in vitro cultivation. Currently, subjective methods of expanded area and more exact cumulus <b>expansion</b> <b>measurement</b> by hyaluronic acid assessment are available. Among the methods of hyaluronic acid measurement {{is the use of}} radioactively labelled synthesis precursors. Alternatively, immunological and analytical methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), spectrophotometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in UV light, could be utilized. The high sensitivity of these methods could provide a precise analysis of cumulus expansion without the use of radioisotopes. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize and compare available approaches of cumulus <b>expansion</b> <b>measurement,</b> respecting special biological features of expanded cumuli, and to suggest possible solutions for exact cumulus expansion analysis...|$|E

The YVO 3 orders antiferromagnetically at T-N = 116 K and orbital ordering was reported to appear below Too = 196 K.
