25|$|The {{origins of}} the Type 432 lay with a {{requirements}} set out in 1939 for twin-engined fighters with 20 or possibly 40mm cannon. Vickers had set out {{a proposal for a}} Griffon-engined aircraft, equipped with a 40mm cannon in a <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting.</b> This was subsequently encouraged by the Air Ministry. Further development was carried out for a design that could also meet F.6/39 for a fixed gun fighter with 20mm cannon. Specification F.22/39 was drawn up to cover the 40mm project as the Vickers 414 to meet Operational Requirement (OR) 76.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of the World Cruiser, the Army Air Service ordered six similar {{aircraft}} as observation aircraft, retaining the interchangeable wheel/float undercarriage, but with much less fuel and two machine guns on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting</b> in the rear cockpit. [...] These aircraft were initially designated DOS (Douglas Observation Seaplane), but were redesignated O-5 in May 1924.|$|E
2500|$|The Seiran's wings rotated 90 {{degrees and}} folded {{hydraulically}} against the aircraft's fuselage (with the tail also folding down) {{to allow for}} storage within the submarine's [...] diameter cylindrical hangar.

50|$|Besides the gunnery students, Buckingham AAF {{was also}} the primary {{training}} center for gunnery instructors at the Army's other flexible gunnery schools, the term meaning that the aerial gunner had a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> at the station or in the turret of the aircraft, rather than the fixed aerial gun of fighter aircraft.|$|R

It had a brief career as a training aircraft before modified bombers took over this role.|$|R
50|$|The {{chassis frame}} was quite new and now also {{contained}} a cruciform shape. It was longer {{as well as}} stronger with <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting</b> for the (continued) 2062 cc engine. New shaped coachwork incorporated improved running boards, a new pattern of brake lever, draught excluders over the slots for the pedals and gear lever and interior sun visors, twin rear and reversing lights, fog light, occasional table folded behind the front seats, new pattern armrests are place front and rear and a folding footrest provided for rear seat passengers.|$|E
5000|$|Te-4 - a {{modified}} Type 11 {{which was designed}} to replace the Type 89 [...] "flexible" [...] due to the excessive weight of the latter. It used a different <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting,</b> had a shorter wooden stock and a straight pistol grip with an enlarged trigger guard, the barrel had no cooling fins. It was chambered for the 7.7x58mmSR Type 89 cartridge and fed from 70-round pan magazine. It is uncertain whether the Te-4 was made by splitting the Type 89 [...] "flexible" [...] or was a direct derivative of Type 11.|$|E
5000|$|The Villier XXIV's {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around six longerons, positioned by glued formers, and plywood covered behind the nose where its [...] Lorraine 12Eb Courlis water-cooled W-12 engine was under an aluminium cowling which followed {{the outlines of}} the three cylinder banks. [...] The engine was cooled by a retractable, ventral Lamblin radiator between the undercarriage legs. There was a second open cockpit for the gunner, equipped with a pair of machine guns on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting.</b> The pilot controlled a pair of fixed, forward firing synchronised 7.7 mm guns.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the {{intended}} mount, the ShVAKs were marked with [...] "MP" [...] for the tank version (total gun length 2122 mm; weight 44.5 kg), [...] "KP" [...] for the wing-mounted version (1679 mm total length; 40 kg), [...] "TP" [...] for <b>flexible</b> <b>mounts</b> (1726 mm length; 42 kg), and [...] "SP" [...] for synchronized installations.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Benchmark Models Program is {{to provide}} data useful in the {{development}} and evaluation of aeroelastic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To that end, a series of three similar wing models are being flutter tested in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. These models are designed to simultaneously acquire model response data and unsteady surface pressure data during wing flutter conditions. The supercritical wing is the second model of this series. It is a rigid semispan model with a rectangular planform and a NASA SC(2) - 0414 supercritical airfoil shape. The supercritical wing model was flutter tested on a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount,</b> called the Pitch and Plunge Apparatus, that provides a well-defined, two-degree-of-freedom dynamic system. The supercritical wing model and associated flutter test apparatus is described and experimentally determined wind-off structural dynamic characteristics of the combined rigid model and <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> system are included...|$|R

5000|$|Type 89 [...] "flexible" [...] - two Type 11 actions {{mounted on}} a <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting</b> for {{anti-aircraft}} use and as a rear-defense aerial gun. The machine gun was chambered for the 7.7x58mmSR Type 89 cartridge. It was equipped with a metallic Y-shaped stock and two spade grips, the barrels had no cooling fins. It was fed from two 45-round quadrant-shaped pan magazines (each magazine had a place for nine five-round stripper clips). The double-barrelled machine gun weighted about 28 kg and had a rate of fire of around 1,400 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{design work}} on the PD2 had started during wartime under the working title [...] "9.8-litre TD9" [...] {{it was much more}} than a PD1 with a bigger engine, the frame was {{completely}} redesigned, with the longitudinal members carefully graded in depth so that no part was overstressed nor over-engineered. The 600 was fitted into the chassis on a three-point <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting</b> and after a larger clutch unit the new gearbox which still had helical gear trains in second and third now also had synchromesh operation on all but first and reverse, a pioneering feature in a full-size production British bus chassis.|$|E
50|$|A typical pop filter is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} layers of acoustically semi-transparent material such as woven nylon stretched over a circular frame, and often includes a clamp and a <b>flexible</b> <b>mounting</b> bracket. Metal pop filters use a fine mesh metal screen in place of the nylon. An improvised pop shield, functionally identical to the professional units, can be made with material from tights or stockings stretched over a kitchen sieve, embroidery hoop or a loop of wire such as a bent coat hanger. It is important that the pop shield not be attached directly to the microphone as vibrations will be transmitted from the shield to the mic.|$|E
25|$|Short of funds, Hawks {{decided not}} to rebuild the {{aircraft}} and sold {{the rights to the}} design, including engineering data to Tri-American Aviation, a concern that wanted to convert the design into a fast two-seat attack/observation aircraft.

50|$|The size {{required}} {{above and}} below deck {{and the weight of}} this turret are not much different from the OTO Melara 76mm gun system, the standard naval gun of the German Navy. But to deal with the much greater recoil of the 155 mm artillery piece on such a vessel, a <b>flexible</b> <b>mount</b> with damping elements had to be designed.|$|R
50|$|The M1919A4 {{was used}} in both fixed and <b>flexible</b> <b>mounts,</b> by {{infantry}} and on vehicles. It was also widely exported after World War II {{and continues to be}} used in small numbers around the world. Two variants were developed specifically for vehicular use, the M1919A5, with an extended charging handle, and the M1919A4E1, a sub-variant of the M1919A4 refitted with an extended charging handle.|$|R
