5|$|Leicester possessed one of {{the largest}} {{collections}} of paintings in Elizabethan England, being the first great private collector. He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard, as well as interested in all aspects of Italian culture. The Earl's circle of scholars and men of letters included, among others, his nephew Philip Sidney, the astrologer and Hermeticist John Dee, his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean Hotman, as well as John Florio and Gabriel Harvey. Through Harvey, Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand, the Earl's palatial town house, where he wrote his first works of poetry. Many years after Leicester's death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his Prothalamion, and in 1591 <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> late Earl with his poem The Ruins of Time.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} about either Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided {{that it was a good}} idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases. The President then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House's permission.|$|E

25|$|In 1831, 14-year-old Charlotte was {{enrolled}} {{at the school of}} Miss Wooler in Roe Head, Mirfield. Patrick could have sent his daughter to a less costly school in Keighley nearer home but Miss Wooler and her sisters had a good reputation and <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> building which he passed when strolling around the parishes of Kirklees, Dewsbury, and Hartshead-cum-Clifton where he was vicar. Margaret Wooler showed fondness towards the sisters and she accompanied Charlotte to the altar at her marriage. Patrick's choice of school was excellent – Charlotte was happy there and studied well. She made many lifelong friends, in particular Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor who later went to New Zealand before returning to England. Charlotte returned from Roe Head in June 1832, missing her friends, but happy to rejoin her family.|$|E
25|$|Speirs' platoon {{spent the}} night of 6 June being shuffled in {{position}} with other platoons as the company was arranged for battle to begin early the next morning. A rolling artillery barrage had been coordinated {{in support of the}} ground assault on the morning of 7 June, to initiate the attack. It was here that PFC Art DiMarzio, who is also referenced in the book “Beyond Band of Brothers”, was eyewitness to an event. He stated that a replacement sergeant disobeyed a direct order while in a combat situation, thereby risking the lives of the other soldiers in the company. According to DiMarzio, Speirs, commanding 2nd platoon, Dog Company was given orders to halt their attack on Ste. Come-du-Mont, to hold position while regimental headquarters coordinated a rolling barrage shelling fifteen targets in the vicinity of Ste. Come-du-Mont. DiMarzio, who was lying in a prone position next to a sergeant, stated <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> sergeant being drunk. An order to hold position was given and relayed down the line which the sergeant refused to obey, wanting to rush forward and engage the Germans. Once again, Speirs gave him the order to hold his position. Speirs told the man that he was too drunk to perform his duties and that he should remove himself to the rear. The sergeant refused and began to reach for his rifle. Speirs again warned the sergeant, who now leveled his rifle at Speirs. Art DiMarzio says he then saw Speirs shoot the sergeant in self-defense. The entire platoon also witnessed the event. Lieutenant Speirs immediately reported the incident to his commanding officer, Captain Jerre S Gross. Eyewitness DiMarzio says that Captain Gross went {{to the scene of the}} shooting and after receiving all the information, deemed it justifiable self-defense. Captain Gross was killed in battle the next day, and the incident was never pursued.|$|E

500|$|Kipling {{apparently}} {{wrote the}} various Barrack-Room Ballads in early 1890, {{about a year}} since he had last been in India, and three years since Flaxman's execution. Though he wrote large amounts of occasional verse, he usually added a note beneath the title giving {{the context of the}} poem. Danny Deever does not have any such notes, but [...] "Cleared" [...] (a topical poem on the Parnell Commission), written in the same month as Danny Deever, does. This suggests that it was not thought by Kipling to be inspired by a specific incident, though {{it is quite possible that}} <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> Flaxman case.|$|E

He remembered that in photographs of the bank robbery in which Patty Hearst participated that DeFreeze was only partially visible, hidden under a large hat. What he looked like was based on guesses made by people who only saw a portion of him. This inspired King, who then wrote [...] "A dark man with no face".

500|$|The {{next day}} they arrived in Florence, where Pallavicini's {{recommendation}} gained them {{a meeting at the}} Palazzo Pitti with the Grand Duke and future emperor Leopold. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> Mozarts from 1768 in Vienna, and asked after Nannerl. In Florence they encountered the violinist Pietro Nardini, whom they had met at the start of their grand tour of Europe; Nardini and Wolfgang performed together in a long evening concert at the Duke's summer palace. Wolfgang also met Thomas Linley, an English violin prodigy and a pupil of Nardini's. The two formed a close friendship, making music and playing together [...] "not as boys but as men", as Leopold remarked. Gutman reports that [...] "a melancholy Thomas followed the Mozarts' coach as they departed for Rome on 6 April". The boys never met again; Linley, after a brief career as a composer and violinist, died in a boating accident in 1778, at the age of 22.|$|E
500|$|On April 13, 1921, the Arizona Republican ran {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with Thomas Raines, a former resident of Tombstone. Raines described the gunfight as an ambush.

He recalled that the Cowboys [...] "were leading their horses out of the gate when they were confronted, almost from ambush, by four of the Earps, Virgil. Wyatt, Morgan and Jim and by Doc Holliday. Virgil Earp, armed with a sawed off express shotgun, and accompanying his demand with profanity, yelled [...] "Hands up!" [...] But he didn't wait for the action demanded and shot almost as soon as he spoke. Tom McLowery showed his empty bands, and cried. 'Gentlemen, I am unarmed.' Holliday answered with the discharge of his shotgun. Ike Clanton fell at the first fire, mortally wounded, but he rolled over and fired two shots from his pistol between his bent knees." ...|$|E

500|$|Lindblom {{found his}} task of {{translating}} an [...] "outsider's {{view of the}} U.S." [...] for an American audience {{the hardest part of}} the localization. Nintendo did not want a direct translation, but a more American version of the script. He recalled that he was given latitude to make the script [...] "as weird as [...] wanted" [...] but also sought to stay true to the original text's translation, though he never communicated with Shigesato Itoi (the game's creator) directly. Lindblom's own humor and office in-jokes worked their way into the script alongside cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny, comedian Benny Hill, and This Is Spinal Tap. Outside the game's script, Lindblom's in-game text includes the item and weapon names as well as the combat prompts. His writing contains multiple Easter eggs, such as in some of the character's names. One character is named for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. After taking the day off for her birthday, Lindblom recalled working for the next 30 days straight, without weekends off. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> workload as large, and recalled [...] "grinding-out" [...] for about 14 hours a day. The localization process took four months.|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare.

[...] <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E
