Therefore, the longer the cord, the larger {{the diameter of the}} conductors need be to minimise voltage <b>drop</b> (<b>wire</b> gauge numbers are smaller for larger diameter wire).

40|$|This {{contribution}} considers adding customer end-point separation in {{spectrum management}} calculations in Annex A {{of the draft}} Spectrum Management Standard. It is shown that a model with customer endpoint separation on a distribution cable decreases the performance of guarded services. A model with customer end-point separation on drop and inside-wire increases the performance of guarded services, but only very slightly because the separation is only about 100 ft. A model with customer end-point separation on both the distribution cable and the <b>drop</b> <b>wire</b> is briefly examined and its impact is mixed, sometimes the performance of guarded services increases slightly, and sometimes it decreases slightly.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} potential difference technique is frequently used to monitor crack size propagation in fatigue testing. Crack size is indirectly measured by the change of the electrical field, due to the crack discontinuity, when the component on test is exposed to an electric current flowing through it. The potential difference {{can be related to}} crack size through experimental, analytical or numerical calibration curves. When experimental calibration curves can not be obtained or if calibration curves are necessary before performing the experimental test, analytical or numerical calibration curves should be used. These calibrations are based on solutions of the Laplace’s equation for specific boundary conditions of a given test piece geometry. Analytical solutions for Laplace’s equation are only limited to a small number of simpler geometries. Nowadays, {{with the use of the}} finite element method, Laplace’s equation can be solved for any geometry. This paper presents a study of the potential drop for a special specimen representing a critical feature of a gas turbine disc. The potential drop was calculated by the finite element method using a mesh similar to the one used to determine the stress intensity factor. The lose of sensitivity and non-linearity of calibration curve with the distance as the potential <b>drop</b> <b>wires</b> are welded from the crack is evaluated. Finally numerical results of calibration curves are compared with experimental data taken from tests at elevated temperature...|$|R

50|$|The bathythermograph, or BT, {{also known}} as the Mechanical Bathythermograph, or MBT; is a small torpedo-shaped device that holds a {{temperature}} sensor and a transducer to detect changes in water temperature versus depth down to a depth of approximately 285 meters (935 feet).

While the instrument is being <b>dropped,</b> the <b>wire</b> is paid out until it reaches a predetermined depth, then a brake is applied and the BT is drawn back to the surface.
