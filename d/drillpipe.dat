[...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted.

[...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of <b>drillpipe</b> that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E

40|$|Drill-strings are slender {{structures}} used {{to drill}} the oil-well {{in searching for}} oil and gas. Failures of drill-strings cause the loss {{of time and money}} and therefore predicting fatigue damage induced by vibrations is of benefit. In this thesis, fatigue calculation of drill-strings is conducted in both time domain and frequency domain, considering axial and torsional vibrations. In time domain analysis, the stress time histories at any specific location of the drillstring are obtained from a finite element model. Both deterministic and random excitations are taken into account. Then using a rainflow counting method, the damaging stress cycles are extracted. Based on the linear cumulative damage law, fatigue damage is then calculated and fatigue life of the drill-string is therefore predicted. Results under both deterministic and random excitations are compared against each other. Time domain fatigue analysis gives accurate predictions at the cost of long calculating time. For the sake of time-saving, a method in frequency domain is developed. The drill-string vibration model is built using continuous parameter method. Power spectral densities (PSD) of the random excitation are assumed. In the process to gain expected damage, equivalent stress spectra are calculated based on Mocha’s random fatigue failure criterion. Then the expected fatigue damage and predicted life are estimated by a spectral method: Dirlik’s method. Further, the drill-pipe threaded connection, which is used to connect numerous <b>drillpipes</b> collars to form a drill-string, is investigated. With the help of ANSYS workbench 15. 0, a standard 4. 5 ” API line pipe threaded connection model is built. Random excitation is considered mainly due to the unevenness of rock formation being drilled. Firstly, a static stress analysis is conducted considering "make-up" and "tensile load" steps. Then modal analysis and random vibration analysis are conducted, assuming acceleration PSD as input. Finally, based on three-band technique, the fatigue damage is calculated. Computer simulations are run and results are given by the above three fatigue damage calculation methods. Results show the critical positions of both the drill-string and the threaded connection, where attention should be paid to by the manufacturers and the drilling operators. Although some limitations exist, this thesis proposed two ways to evaluate fatigue damage of a drill-string. The threaded pipe connection, which is a complex structure, is also analyzed. Further research work will aim at the validation of the simulations...|$|R

50|$|Shut-in {{drill pipe}} {{pressure}} (SIDPP), which is recorded when a well is shut in on a kick, {{is a measure}} of the difference between the pressure at the bottom of the hole and the hydrostatic pressure (HSP) in the <b>drillpipe.</b> During a well shut-in, the pressure of the wellbore stabilizes, and the formation pressure equals the pressure at the bottom of the hole. The <b>drillpipe</b> at this time should be full of known-density fluid. Therefore, the formation pressure can be easily calculated using the SIDPP. This means that the SIDPP gives a direct of formation pressure during a kick.|$|E

50|$|On 26 November 1981, Ocean Ranger {{commenced}} drilling well J-34, {{its third}} {{well in the}} Hibernia Oil Field. Ocean Ranger was still working on this well in February 1982 when the incident occurred. Two other semi-submersible platforms were also drilling nearby: Sedco 706, 8.5 mi NNE, and Zapata Ugland, 19.2 mi N of Ocean Ranger. On 14 February 1982, the platforms received reports of an approaching storm linked to a major Atlantic cyclone from NORDCO Ltd, the company responsible for issuing offshore weather forecasts. The usual method of preparing for bad weather involved hanging-off the <b>drillpipe</b> at the sub-sea wellhead and disconnecting the riser from the sub-sea blowout preventer. Due to surface difficulties and {{the speed at which}} the storm developed, the crew of Ocean Ranger were forced to shear the <b>drillpipe</b> after hanging-off, after which they disconnected the riser in the early evening.|$|E
5000|$|Drilling {{is another}} means of {{sampling}} the seabed. It {{is used to}} obtain {{a record of the}} seabed stratigraphy or the rock formations below it. The set-up used to sample an offshore structure's foundation is similar to that used by the oil industry to reach and delineate hydrocarbon reservoirs, with some differences in the types of testing. The drill string consists of a series of pipe segments 5 in in diameter screwed end to end, with a drillbit assembly at the bottom. As the dragbit (teeth extending downward from the drillbit) cut into the soil, soil cuttings are produced. Viscous drilling mud flowing down the <b>drillpipe</b> collects these cuttings and carry them up outside the <b>drillpipe.</b> As is the case for onshore geotechnical surveys, different tools can be used for sampling the soil from a drill hole, notably [...] "Shelby tubes", [...] "piston samplers" [...] and [...] "split spoon samplers".|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of top drives exist, and are usually classified based on the [...] "Safe Working Load" [...] (SWL) of the equipment and the size and type of motor used to rotate the <b>drillpipe.</b> For offshore and heavy duty use, a 1000 short ton unit would be used, whereas a smaller land rig may only require a 500 short ton device. Various sizes of hydraulic motors, or AC or DC electric motors, are available.|$|E
50|$|The {{floor is}} a {{relatively}} small work {{area in which the}} rig crew conducts operations, usually adding or removing <b>drillpipe</b> to or from the drillstring. The rig floor is the most dangerous location on the rig because heavy iron is moved around there. Drill string connections are made or broken on the drillfloor, and the driller's console for controlling the major components of the rig are located there. Attached to the rig floor is a small metal room, the doghouse, where the rig crew can meet, take breaks and take refuge from the elements during idle times.|$|E
50|$|Swabbing {{occurs when}} bottom hole {{pressure}} is reduced {{due to the}} effects of pulling the drill string upward in the bored hole. During the tripping out of the hole, the space formed by the <b>drillpipe,</b> drill collar, or tubing (which are being removed) must be replaced by something, usually mud. If the rate of tripping out is greater than the rate the mud is being pumped into the void space (created by the removal of the drill string), then swab will occur. If the reduction in bottom hole pressure caused by swabbing is below formation pressure, then a kick will occur.|$|E
50|$|These tools {{incorporate}} {{an electrical}} insulator in the drillstring. To transmit data, the tool generates an altered voltage {{difference between the}} top part (the main drillstring, above the insulator), and the bottom part (the drill bit, and other tools located below the insulator of the MWD tool). On surface, a wire {{is attached to the}} wellhead, which makes contact with the <b>drillpipe</b> at the surface. A second wire is attached to a rod driven into the ground some distance away. The wellhead and the ground rod form the two electrodes of a dipole antenna. The voltage difference between the two electrodes is the receive signal that is decoded by a computer.|$|E
5000|$|An annular-type blowout {{preventer}} can close around the drill string, casing or a non-cylindrical object, {{such as the}} kelly. Drill pipe including the larger-diameter tool joints (threaded connectors) can be [...] "stripped" [...] (i.e., moved vertically while pressure is contained below) through an annular preventer by careful control of the hydraulic closing pressure. Annular {{blowout preventer}}s are also effective at maintaining a seal around the <b>drillpipe</b> even as it rotates during drilling. Regulations typically require that an annular preventer be able to completely close a wellbore, but annular preventers are generally not as effective as ram preventers in maintaining a seal on an open hole. Annular BOPs are typically located {{at the top of}} a BOP stack, with one or two annular preventers positioned above a series of several ram preventers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{top drive}} allows the {{drilling}} rig to drill the longer section of a stand of drill pipe in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill 30 ft (single drill pipe) sections of drill pipe whereas a top drive can drill 60 - 90 ft stands (double and triple drill pipe respectively, a triple being three joints of <b>drillpipe</b> screwed together), depending on {{the drilling rig}} size. Handling longer sections of drill pipe enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to 90 ft can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer [...] "connections" [...] to add another 30 ft of drill pipe. Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency. When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore {{for the length of}} the kelly in order to add one more length of drill pipe. With a top drive, the draw works only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints. Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while drilling fluid is not being pumped.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, a new {{approach}} to wireline logging was introduced in the form of logging while drilling (LWD). This technique provides similar well information to conventional wireline logging but instead of sensors being lowered into the well at the end of wireline cable, the sensors are integrated into the drill string and the measurements are made in real-time, whilst the well is being drilled. This allows drilling engineers and geologists to quickly obtain information such as porosity, resistivity, hole direction and weight-on-bit and they can use this information to make immediate decisions {{about the future of the}} well and the direction of drilling. In LWD, measured data is transmitted to the surface in real time via pressure pulses in the well's mud fluid column. This mud telemetry method provides a bandwidth of less than 10 bits per second, although, as drilling through rock is a fairly slow process, data compression techniques mean that this is an ample bandwidth for real-time delivery of information. A higher sample rate of data is recorded into memory and retrieved when the drillstring is withdrawn at bit changes. High-definition downhole and subsurface information is available through networked or wired <b>drillpipe</b> that deliver memory quality data in real time.|$|E
5000|$|Well {{cuttings}} examination is {{a learned}} skill. During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about 1/8 inch (6 mm) across, are {{cut from the}} bottom of the hole by the bit. Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole. During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning <b>drillpipe,</b> mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction. They then are screened out of the mudstream by the shale shaker and fall on a pile at its base. Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the 'lag time' between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the wellsite geologist (or mudlogger as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material. Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a [...] "bit trip" [...] when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit. At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (cavings), making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.|$|E
5000|$|A {{magnitude}} 6.3 earthquake {{occurred in}} Yogyakarta at ~06:00 local time 27 May 2006, approximately 250 kilometres Southwest of Sidoarjo. It {{has been suggested}} that a small (20 barrel) mud loss occurred in the Banjar Panji-1 well seven minutes after the Yogyakarta earthquake (consistent with the time taken for the earthquake seismic waves to reach the Lusi location), though there is no clear reports of these losses in the drilling data, and it has also been alternatively reported that these losses occurred one hour before the earthquake. The well suffered a complete loss of circulation at 12:50pm local time on the 26th May 2006, which was between 1.5-4.75 hours after three large aftershocks. A loss of circulation happens when drilling mud—necessary for maintenance of wellbore stability—that is pumped down a shaft does not return to the surface but is lost into some opening or a fault system. This mud loss problem was finally stopped when loss circulation material was pumped into the well, a standard practice in drilling an oil and gas well. A day later the well suffered a ‘kick’, an influx of formation fluid into the well bore. The kick was reported by Lapindo Brantas drilling engineers as having been killed within three hours, though alternative interpretations of drilling records, specifically ongoing fluctuations in downhole <b>drillpipe</b> pressure, indicate that the kick continued for at least 24 hours. Early the next day, on 29 May 2006, steam, water and mud began erupting up to 200 meters above the well, a phenomenon that is now known as the Lusi mud volcano. Dense drilling mud and cement were pumped down the Banjar Panji-1 well at various times in the 48 hours after the mud flow started, in an attempt to kill the surface mud eruption. Lapindo Brantas daily drilling records state that [...] "bubbles intensity reduced and elapse time between each bubble is longer" [...] after pumping dense drilling mud down the well, indicating direct communication between Banjar Panji-1 and the Sidoarjo mudflow. A detailed review of the timing of key events in the drilling of Banjar Panji-1 and the first days of the Sidoarjo mudflow can be found in reference.|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringTorque {{and drag}} {{calculations}} performed {{on a new}} liner drilling design indicate that a very high grade <b>drillpipe,</b> up to S- 135, is {{required in order to}} satisfy the requirements which both axial and torsional loading place upon the system. High torque connections for the <b>drillpipe</b> may also be required. The torque values found both with simulations and manual calculations, indicate that the proposed standard VAM TOP liner connections may not be strong enough to be used in this well. It is therefore recommended that VAM HTF, or similar high torque liner connections, are used in order to meet torsional loading requirements. The use of 6 5 / 8 ” <b>drillpipe</b> and 5 ½” <b>drillpipe</b> above the top of the liner is also considered. Based on the calculated recommended flow rates with regards to hole cleaning for the two systems, compared with the resulting ECD values, it is suggested that 6 5 / 8 ” <b>drillpipe</b> provides a better compromise between hole cleaning and ECD values. Simulations indicate that the <b>drillpipe</b> connections are strong enough, while manual calculations indicate that hightorque <b>drillpipe</b> connections should be considered. The lifting force caused by the circulation of fluid is examined, but is not found to be of significant magnitude compared to the mechanical friction. It is important to examine this force, in order {{to determine whether or not}} the system will have problems related to buckling, although it does not appear to present a problem in this case. A general approach which can be used in order to determine the fatigue loading and longevity of the liner connections is shown. However, since the actual data for the liner connections are kept confidential by the manufacturer, no specific recommendations are made. It should be noted that the conclusions of this thesis are valid for the wellpath and well conditions presented in this thesis only, and that different wellpaths and well conditions may impose other limits, either more or less stringent, on the design and use of the steerable liner drilling system...|$|E

30|$|A {{numerical}} model and transmission characteristic analysis of DPSK (differential phase shift keying) pressure signals in mud channels is introduced. With the control logic {{analysis of the}} rotary valve mud telemetry, a logical control signal is built from a Gate function sequence according to the binary symbols of transmitted data and a phase-shift function is obtained by integrating the logical control signal. A mathematical model of the DPSK pressure signal {{is built based on}} principles of communications by modulating carrier phase with the phase-shift function and a numerical simulation of the pressure wave is implemented with the mathematical model by MATLAB programming. Considering <b>drillpipe</b> pressure and drilling fluid temperature profile along drillpipes, the <b>drillpipe</b> of a vertical well is divided into a number of sections. With water-based drilling fluids, the impacts of travel distance, carrier frequency, <b>drillpipe</b> size, and drilling fluids on the signal transmission were studied by signal transmission characteristic analysis for all the sections.
