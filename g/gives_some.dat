5|$|Rain World {{setting is}} {{destroyed}} by ecological catastrophe and illustrated in pixel art. Its story is communicated through {{details in the}} environment, images during hibernation, and holograms from a worm that monitors the Slugcat. The game offers little to guide the player, apart from the worm, who <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> hints about where to go and what to collect towards {{the beginning of the}} game. The player can view a map to check their progress through the large in-game world, and this can help to reach the game's multiple endings.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Tibbers Castle is undocumented, {{and it may}} have been founded in the 12th or 13th century as a timber castle. It was first {{recorded}} in 1298 when Sir Richard Siward, either built the stone enclosure castle or enhanced one which had already been added to the timber structure. King Edward I of England visited the castle the same year. Siward was the Sheriff of Dumfries when the area was {{under the control of the}} English and documentation from this period <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> evidence for activity at the castle. In 1302, £100 was spent on the structured while it was manned by a 23-strong garrison.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{magnetosphere}} around Venus {{means that}} the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, {{are more likely to}} be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed. The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.|$|E
5|$|Early Gaelic law tracts, first {{written down}} in the ninth century, reveal a society highly {{concerned}} with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. Scottish common law {{began to take shape}} {{at the end of the}} period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent. In the twelfth century, and certainly in the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as Canon law and various Anglo-Norman practices. Pre-fourteenth century law among the native Scots is not always well attested, but extensive knowledge of early Gaelic Law <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> basis for its reconstruction. In the earliest extant Scottish legal manuscript, there is a document called Leges inter Brettos et Scottos. The document survives in Old French, and is almost certainly a French translation of an earlier Gaelic document. It retained a vast number of untranslated Gaelic legal terms. Later medieval legal documents, written both in Latin and Middle English, contain more Gaelic legal terms, examples including slains (Old Irish slán or sláinte; exemption) and cumherba (Old Irish comarba; ecclesiastic heir).|$|E

5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E

25|$|Cantor's proofs are {{constructive}} {{and have}} been used to write a computer program that generates the digits of a transcendental number.

25|$|For non-oriented {{manifolds}} {{the easiest}} way to state a geometrization conjecture is to first take the oriented double cover. It is also possible to work directly with non-orientable manifolds, but this <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> extra complications: {{it may be necessary to}} cut along projective planes and Klein bottles as well as spheres and tori, and manifolds with a projective plane boundary component usually have no geometric structure.|$|E
25|$|Before each round, Tony {{shows the}} team {{one or more}} {{historical}} artefacts and <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> background to the objects. The team is then asked to answer seven questions relating to the artefacts in three minutes.

25|$|Written around 1080, one of {{the oldest}} written sources on pre-Christian Scandinavian {{religious}} practices is Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. Adam claimed to have access to first-hand accounts on pagan practices in Sweden. He refers to Freyr with the Latinized name Fricco and mentions that an image of him at Skara was destroyed by the Christian missionary, Bishop Egino. His description of the Temple at Uppsala <b>gives</b> <b>some</b> details on the god.|$|E
