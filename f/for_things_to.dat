An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high.

5|$|In {{the opening}} {{weekend of the}} season Manchester United faced Leicester City at Old Trafford, and went a goal down within seven minutes; Muzzy Izzet’s cross was met by Emile Heskey to scuff {{the ball into the}} net before Tony Cottee– the scorer in the {{previous}} season’s corresponding fixture– added a second with fifteen minutes remaining. Teddy Sheringham’s intervention and a last gasp free kick by David Beckham helped the home side salvage a point, setting a precedent <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come. The team's first away game at West Ham followed, but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke, United were held to a goalless draw. Beckham, who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal in the World Cup, received a torrid reception by the home supporters, with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at. Bottles and stones were directed at the team coach prior to kick-off. After the game Ferguson, his players, and the Manchester United staff refused to be interviewed by the press or television.|$|E

God's creation by speech also suggests that he is being compared to a king, who has merely to speak <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> happen.|$|E

The usual {{manifestation of the}} distinction {{was the use of}} the prefixes t- for high-class nouns and s- for low-class ones, so that tesá meant [...] "human eye", and sesá meant [...] "the eye of an animal". Some authors argue that it is a type of gender inflection.|$|R
25|$|The {{growth of}} eSports in South Korea {{is thought to}} have been {{influenced}} by the mass building of broadband internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do while out of work. Instrumental to this growth of eSports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate eSports in the country.|$|E
25|$|This play {{portrays a}} family in a ferociously {{negative}} light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments – qualities which are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> be otherwise. The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as they see it, {{and an ability to}} boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother’s addiction to morphine, the family’s addiction to whiskey, the father’s miserliness, the older brother’s licentiousness, and younger brother’s illness.|$|E

25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There might be some space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E

How did you get along so well?"). Codreanu's resurgence brought arrest and prosecution under the martial law imposed in the country; he was acquitted yet again. Despite Codreanu's attacks on the elite as hopelessly corrupt and self-serving, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. The Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party's foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the Romanian fascist that was the main beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu's rival Octavian Goga who lacked Codreanu's mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu's statements that Romania had too many minorities for its own good, which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the volksdeutsch minority if he came to power. But the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard, as limited as they were, did add to the Legion's appeal as the Iron Guard was associated in the public mind with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.|$|E

[...] Mathieson described the LSO as [...] "the perfect film orchestra".

During the crisis and its immediate aftermath, the British government came under pressure from opposition politicians to end the deployment to Sierra Leone, and Dorman suggested that {{the success or failure of}} Operation Barras was [...] "inextricably linked" [...] to the fate of the wider British operation. He suggested that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{progresses}} mostly through footage streamed from a fixed {{camera in}} booth {{nine of the}} call centre setting. Streams from other cameras are displayed {{on the side of}} the screen, in the style of a CCTV feed. The idea was inspired by a clip of a serial killer's interview with the CIA which Shearsmith had seen online; this, too, had a main feed with three smaller feeds giving different views of the scene. The writers felt that the multiple screens both served a narrative function and raised the tension. For much of the episode, viewers simply watch characters taking calls. Extras are seen moving back and forth in the smaller screens, with Pemberton having initially been keen <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> be happening away from the main feed. However, he was somewhat frustrated with the result, with the same extra moving on numerous occasions throughout the episode. Shearsmith felt that a whole series filmed in the same manner [...] "would be a bit wearing on the eye", but that the style could be used for a single episode.|$|E

It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation.

Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties where they felt the cause was just. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that [...] " [...] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [...] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept {{the rule of law and}} the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have [...] "raised questions" [...] regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.|$|E

[...] Keller also disapproved of unprotected use of weapons in the bout, commenting that TNA management needed to start fining [...] "wrestlers for taking unprotected chairshots to the skull" [...] because it was [...] "just not worth the long-term cumulative risks associated with blunt trauma to the skull over years of wrestling." [...] He gave the Last Man Standing bout 4 stars and said it was a [...] "superb match" [...] with a [...] "scaring finish" [...] since the [...] "potential for something going wrong given Angle's legit neck problems was substantial" [...] even if [...] "everything was planned" [...] to work out that way. Keller rated the Street Fight 1 1/2 stars and stated it [...] "was pretty clunky late and early on the crowd brawling got a little repetitive" [...] and that it felt [...] "like yet another weapons match." [...] "The match was okay, but nothing more. The tuxedos and chain served as more of a circus-like distraction than a valuable prop for the match", said Keller in his coverage of the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match, which he gave 1 1/4 stars. Keller gave the World Tag Team Championship match 2 stars, but did not give his opinion outside the rating on the contest. He did comment on the X Division Championship match, saying it was a [...] "very good match" [...] and gave it 3 stars.|$|E
