6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy, reflectively, [...] "if it's the {{one that}} was Barbara last time, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You have been finding out the rest of it since you met her at the ranch? She was up yonder ten minutes ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess I do!" [...] was the snorted-out reply. [...] "They {{came around}} to my place yesterday, and stole my apples and pears, and talked sassy to my darter an' the hired man. I saw 'em, but they ran, away before I could git my hands on 'em. I vowed I take 'em down a peg when I met 'em, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> it," [...] added the old farmer, with evident satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{the major}} motif," [...] he hurriedly explained, [...] "the big underrunning motif, the cosmic and {{universal}} thing. I {{tried to make it}} keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all. I was on the right scent, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it badly. I did not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at. But I'll learn in time." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bolton sighed deeply, and {{continued}} in a strain whose diffusiveness at last became perceptible to Miss Kilburn through her own humiliation. [...] "There's some in every community that's bound to complain, I don't {{care what you}} do to accommodate 'em; and what I done, I done as much to stop their clack as anything, and give him the right sort of a start off, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But Mis' Bolton she didn't know but what you'd look at it in the light of a libbutty, and I didn't know but what you would think I no business to done it." ...|$|E

60|$|We circled him {{and drew}} the flying-fish bait {{so that he would}} swim near it. As it was, I had to reel in some. Presently we had the bait some twenty yards ahead of him. Then Captain Dan slowed down. The broadbill wiggled his tail and slid out of sight. Dan said he was going for my bait. But I did not believe so. Several moments passed. I had given up any little hope I might have had when I {{received}} a quick, strong, vibrating strike--different from any I had ever experienced. I suppose the strangeness was due to the shock he gave my line when he struck the bait with his sword. The line paid out unsteadily and slowly. I looked at Dan and he looked at me. Neither of us was excited nor particularly elated. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not realize what was actually going on.|$|E
5000|$|Neil Storey, Dragon's drummer, died of {{a heroin}} {{overdose}} in September 1976. The group considered disbanding but continued with Kerry Jacobson on drums as their single, [...] "This Time", reached the Kent Music Report top 40 singles chart. Hunter later detailed their performance style, [...] "its hard to describe Dragon because what the songs were and what the band did live on stage were so opposed to each other, it was quite schizo really. We had nice happy songs but mock rape scenes happening on stage, people vomiting into buckets. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> approach performing in a living theatre way. I {{used to think that}} if people wanted something then give it to them and let them decide if they like it or not." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of Disco Demolition Night, Dahl {{attained}} national recognition and his popularity increased significantly. He established a syndicate and the Steve and Garry show began airing in Detroit and Milwaukee, where it performed well. However, in February 1981, WLUP fired Dahl, citing [...] "continued assaults on community standards". [...] "It {{was going on in}} El Paso and Los Angeles, like, on Monday, and on Friday they fired me," [...] Dahl later said. Meier was offered the opportunity to continue the show by himself, but he refused. I always used to get ticked off when I would get lumped in with Howard Stern as being a shock jock. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> shock people, but I did it unintentionally. It comes out of who I am. Steve Dahl ...|$|E

5000|$|None of {{the teens}} showed any remorse or {{apologized for the}} murder. Paul Sweeney, the victim's father, {{addressed}} Domenic Coia, saying, [...] "Look at me, Domenic, with your evil eyes". Domenic Coia responded, [...] "I never thought I had evil eyes, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> And I'm cool." [...] The judge, in denying defense counsel's motion for a sentence that could allow for parole, said: [...] "There is a level of inhumanity that exists in these facts. This was a totally depraved act." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was a bit}} {{surprised}} to go early {{because there are a}} lot of great players here, but I'm a pretty happy kid right now," [...] Ward said. [...] "I was hoping to go in the first round but you never know what's going to happen. It was a pretty open field and I guess Devils liked me. They flew me to Toronto for a physical test and an interview month and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well." [...] Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello was impressed with Ward's potential to be yet another hard-hitting New Jersey blueliner, stating [...] "We liked Ward's potential as far as his upside is concerned," [...] Lamoriello said. [...] "We have guys like Scott Stevens and Ken Daneyko on our team and this young man like them. He's strong now, he's mean, and he's got skills." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I had my ways {{of hiding}} my pain. Laughing {{when there was}} nothing to laugh at. Smiling when there wasn't {{anything}} to smile about. That was just my way of getting through life. Pretending like everything was okay. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it so well that I really began to believe it. I fooled myself. Using my escapism's was my thing to not feel my pain—whatever would numb the pain." [...] — Janet on the repressionof various traumas throughout her adolescence. During her Janet World Tour, Jackson experienced an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There were times when I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by the demands of the entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world.'" [...] Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "The Cultural Ambassador", a {{piece on}} her album The Ugly One with the Jewels, Anderson {{explained}} some of her perspective on the character: (Anderson:) I was carrying a lot of electronics so I had to keep unpacking everything and plugging it in and demonstrating how it all worked, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> seem a little fishy—a {{lot of this stuff}} wakes up displaying LED program readouts that have names like Atom Smasher, and so it took a while to convince them that they weren't some kind of portable espionage system. So I've done quite a few of these sort of impromptu new music concerts for small groups of detectives and customs agents and I'd have to keep setting all this stuff up and they'd listen for a while and they'd say: So uh, what's this? And I'd pull out something like(Bergamot:) this filter, and say, now this is what I like to think of as the voice of authority. And it would take me a while to tell them how I used it for songs that were, you know, about various forms of control, and they would say, now {{why would you want to}} talk like that? And I'd look around at the SWAT teams, and the undercover agents, and the dogs, and the radio in the corner, tuned to the Super Bowl coverage of the war. And I'd say, take a wild guess.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> it. But <b>I</b> haven't tramped {{that far}} for sixteen years. Most {{of the sports}} go by boat. But <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> it if you say so--I guess." [...] Joe walked away in sadness.|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins]: Friday 2000 Dear Mom, I [am] {{racking up}} the time now, honey. Yesterday I got an hour dual and one solo, {{and the same}} today. I’ve got almost 16 hours now! Boy how I love that solo work. Man it’s really something. No kiddin’ it’s another world. Today I climbed up to 4500 ’. About 8 o’clock it was. And smooth as glass. The clouds were just hanging on the horizen [sic]. The sun just {{breaking}} through them. On my dual time today Balko gave me some new stalls from climbing and gliding turns. Boy they’re tricky by [sic] a lot of fun. He also gave me Chandelles. In this maneuvers [sic] you dive the ship at 1850 R. P. M. ’s to about 110 m. p. h the[n] bring the nose up and around 180 ° {{to a position of}} steep climb. You do one after another alternating from left to right, like sliding up and down a steep tobagan [sic]. They’re really fun. Then to top it off he demonstrated a loop followed by a snap roll. When we got off of that I didn’t know where the hell I was. Balko said that he was watching me in the mirror. He said I had a smile from ear to ear. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I loved it. In the loop he dived the ship to about 120 and then brought the nose up, up, up. The horizen [sic] drops down and clear blue is ahead of you. I looked up and watched the other horizen come up in back of me while we were upside down. Man what a thrill. Then that hairy snap roll, and I nearly blew a gut. He sure is an H. P. I got a letter from Dud today. He’s fine. Can’t tell me where he is. Says it’s hell. He just go one of my letters dated May 9 th. The invasion held up all his mail. He got about fifty letters at once. Thank Nan for her letter, hon. Tell her I’ll write her as soon as possible, and that I love her. Give my love to Bob, and a kiss to Rickey. I love you and think about you so often. Your devoted son Judd [Transcription ends...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{can they}} be going to do now?" [...] Tom said. [...] "Some fresh piece of homage, <b>I</b> should <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wish they would leave us alone.

2500|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and <b>I</b> am <b>doing</b> Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must be that}} <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> though <b>I</b> {{never had}} such a thought. Wheat is so wonderful. No one can guess who does not know it!... The clean, plump grain, the sowing on fallow ground, the long wait, the first tender green, and the change day by day to the deep waving fields of gold--then the harvest, hot, noisy, smoky, full of dust and chaff, and the great combine-harvesters with thirty-four horses. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love it all.... I worked in a Spokane flour-mill, too, just to learn how flour is made. There {{is nothing in the}} world so white, so clean, so pure as flour made from the wheat of these hills!" ...|$|R
500|$|... "After a while I {{got sick}} of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted to clean myself off. I see my new look as very {{innocent}} and feminine and unadorned. It {{makes me feel}} good. Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it to entertain myself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Well, {{throughout}} my career I {{have turned to}} mythological figures, who went away from conformity and the collected {{to make up their}} own mind about stuff, to put it {{in a bit of a}} mundane way. It's more of a scenario and also very much an escape from conformity and the collected. Nietzsche has been a huge influence on me, in particular during the years that I've been doing my solo stuff. He was a hermit, he wrote about hermits and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this in a kind of hermit-like way myself. I am here in my hermit’s cave, a studio, doing my stuff alone. On different levels it just reflects aspects of the album itself and probably aspects of how I see things and how I work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I got {{something}} that can get us into the circus. Maybe someday we can even have a circus of our own. We could be the biggest circus-fellows in the world.

Landwaves undulated before me, rolling out humps for me to bounce on, speckled in green and yellow, and green again. I heard the music of the hills laud my name awaiting my triumphant return. I heard bumblebees like windmills, never wanting any less than to come to my hand and lead me off. Most of all, the sky weighed me down. It weighed on me like magnet sucking and pushing me at the same time. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> remember the first time {{the weight of the world}} destroyed a little May field all in the name of progress. I remember it well. 2 ̆...|$|R

5000|$|Henderson {{adopted an}} exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power. Sportswriter Jim Murray {{described}} Henderson's strike zone as being [...] "smaller than Hitler's heart". In 1982, {{he described his}} approach to Sports Illustrated: I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't {{have much of a}} strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, [...] "Stand up and hit like a man." [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that to people.|$|R
