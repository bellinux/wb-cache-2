Rules 1.10 and 6.06 were later changed to reflect the intent of Major League Baseball, as exemplified by the league president's ruling. Rule 1.10 now only requires that the bat be removed from the game if discovered after being used in a game; it no longer necessitates any change to the results of any play which may have taken place.

40|$|Wild parsnip is a nonnative, {{invasive}} {{plant that}} is rapidly increasing {{in many areas}} of Wisconsin. This plant, native to Europe and Asia, is in the Umbelliferae family (also known as the Apiaceae family or in common terms, the parsley or carrot family) and {{is believed to have been}} introduced as a vegetable plant as the taproots are edible. As wild parsnip has spread within Wisconsin, so has the realization that human exposure often leads to serious burns and blisters on the arms and legs. Being able to readily identify wild parsnip will minimize inadvertent and excessive exposure to this plant and the often painful results that follow. During much of July, wild parsnip is one of the dominant yellow-flowered weeds in many roadsides and other right-of-ways, fence rows, prairie restorations, CRP sites and poorly managed pastures. Plants are most abundant in sites dominated by perennial grasses that are mowed once or twice annually. Description. The seedling leaves are small and ovate while the first true leaves are arranged in spiral fashion, forming the typical rosette observed in the first year of growth. Fully developed rosettes have 10 to 15 pinnately compound leaves with broad ovate to oblong leaflets.

Stems are erect, hairy, <b>hollow,</b> <b>grooved,</b> branched at top {{and may be}} reddish at the base. Leaves are basal, alternate, pinnately compound with 1 to several finely divided, fernlike leaflets. Leaves increase in size toward {{the base of the}} stem and have carrot-like odor. Basal rosettes remain green over winter. Upper leaves of second-year plants are stalkless with white sheathes at leaf bases. Flowers are small, 5 -petaled, white, and occur in a terminal, umbrella-shaped cluster at the ends of the stems. The plant produces a succession of flowering stalks until it dies with the first frost. The primary umbel curls inward representing a bird’s nest. The small brown fruits are dry and ribbed with bristly hairs. Fruits have hooked spines that attach to clothing or animal fur and aid in dispersal. One plant can produce 1, 000 to 40, 000 seeds. The root system is comprised of a long slender white taproot and fibrous secondary roots. Roots may become woody with age and have a carrot-like odor and taste. Reproduction is by seed. Habitat: It grows in disturbed dry grasslands, fields, meadows, pastures, ditches, waste places, and railroad and highway rights-of-ways. It prefers well-drained, fine-particle soil and full sun.
