500|$|Penalties {{for violating}} weight limits vary between states (bridge <b>formula</b> <b>weight</b> {{violations}} {{are treated as}} gross weight violations), as the states are responsible for enforcement and collection of fines. Some states, such as Connecticut, issue fines on a percentage basis (e.g. 20% overweight at $10 per [...] ), which means larger trucks pay higher fines. For example, a truck with a legal gross limit of [...] that violates the limit by [...] would pay a fine of $500, while a truck with a legal gross limit of [...] that violates the limit by 5,000pounds would pay a fine of $250. Other states, such as New York, issue fines on a per-pound basis (e.g., 5,000pounds overweight equals a $300 fine). Others, such as Massachusetts, impose a less complicated fine schedule whereby a vehicle that violates the limits by less than [...] is fined $40 per , while a violation over [...] pays $80 per [...] (e.g. [...] overweight equals a $200 fine).|$|E

With adequate <b>formulae</b> <b>weighting</b> of data was dependent on error expectation. With inadequate <b>formulae</b> <b>weighting</b> should be focused on representativeness. Some other pitfalls were discussed. Correlation analysis was contrasted with regression analysis. These two models had in common that items of a universe were stochastically dependent on a functional relationship. Essential for correlation was that both correlated variables obeyed a probability distribution; for regression analysis this {{did not need to}} be true. In correlation the principal axis was a sound base for understanding relationships, while the regression line was a sound base for predictions. The contrast between understanding and prediction was discussed at large. Special problems of pooling experiments were discussed. In principle a transformation of yield data was advisable if the interaction variety x experiment could be thus reduced. Yet the transformed yields remained inadequate. So weighting, if used, had to improve representativeness. A missing-plot technique for pooling was given. A separate part deals with the reduction of residual error by drawing freehand fertility maps. This may be much more effective than the corrections provided by the design. A criterion was developed for avoiding undue detail in free-hand curves. /HTML>...|$|R

In the structure, six oxygen atoms are coordinated octahedrally to both the bismuth and lead atoms. The bismuth and oxygen atoms form negatively charged layers by creating repeating octahedral geometries.
