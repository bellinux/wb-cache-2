40|$|Objective　To {{probe into}} the early effect of {{surgical}} treatment in coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD) patients with moderate-to-severe ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR). Methods　A total of 175 CAD patients with moderateto- severe IMR undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from December 1999 to December 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Based on the method applied during surgery, 108 patients were assigned to CABG group, undergoing CABG alone, and 67 to CABG+MVP/R group, undergoing CABG plus concomitant mitral valvuloplasty/repair (MVP/R). Differences between groups were compared in age, gender, numbers of the conduits, application of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and ventricular assist device (VAD), perioperative mortality, and other concomitant procedures (i. e. aortic valve replacement, resection of the heart wall aneurysm, repair of the septal defect repair). Differences within the groups were looked for in terms of left atrial diameter (LA), left ventricular <b>ending</b> <b>diastolic</b> diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), mitral regurgitation degree, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), and cardiac function (NYHA classification), pre-operatively and post-operatively.

40|$|There is an {{established}} tradition of cardiovascular simulation tools, but {{the application of}} this kind of technology in the e-Learning arena is a novel approach. This paper presents an e-Learning environment aimed at teaching the interaction of cardiovascular and lung systems to health-care professionals. Heart-lung interaction must be analyzed while assisting patients with severe respiratory problems or with heart failure in intensive care unit. Such patients can be assisted by mechanical ventilatory assistance or by thoracic artificial lung. "In silico" cardiovascular simulator was experimented during a training course given to graduate students of the School of Specialization in Cardiology at 2 ̆ 7 Sapienza 2 ̆ 7 University in Rome. The training course employed CARDIOSIM(C) : a numerical simulator of the cardiovascular system. Such simulator is able to reproduce pathophysiological conditions of patients affected by cardiovascular and/or lung disease. In order to study the interactions among the cardiovascular system, the natural lung and the thoracic artificial lung (TAL), the numerical model of this device has been implemented. After having reproduced a patient 2 ̆ 7 s pathological condition, TAL model was applied in parallel and hybrid model during the training course. Results obtained during the training course show that TAL parallel assistance reduces right ventricular <b>end</b> systolic (<b>diastolic)</b> volume, but increases left ventricular <b>end</b> systolic (<b>diastolic)</b> volume.

A leftward shift of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (i.e. decreased left ventricular distensibility) can occur both in those with normal and those with decreased left ventricular systolic function. Likewise, heart failure may occur in those with dilated left ventricular and normal systolic function. This is often seen in valvular heart disease and high-output heart failure.

The associations of cystatin C with LV mass, LV <b>end</b> systolic and <b>diastolic</b> volumes (LVESV and LVEDV), concentricity (LV mass/LVEDV), LV wall thickness, and LVEF were evaluated.

50|$|The Frank-Starling law of {{the heart}} (also known as Starling's law and the Frank-Starling mechanism) {{represents}} the relationship between stroke volume and <b>end</b> <b>diastolic</b> volume.

As a larger volume of blood flows into the ventricle, the blood stretches the cardiac muscle fibers, leading to an increase in the force of contraction.

Our study was an effort at establishing the role of Umbilical artery (UA) and Middle cere bral artery (MCA) Doppler indices in predicting the adverse perinatal out come in clinically suspected IUGR pregnancies, and to determine the role of Doppler velocimetry in clinical management of such pregnancies. Elevation of the umbilical artery systolic /diastolic ratio or of the pulsatility index (PI); absent or reversed <b>end</b> - <b>diastolic</b> flow in the umbilical artery and decreased systolic/diastolic ratio or pulsatility index in the fetal internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries are the predictors of ab normal perinatal outcome.

The objective {{of this study is to}} describe the opening kinetics of a monoleaflet Medtronic Hall 27 -mm mechanical valve in mitral position and to determine the flow pattern within the left ventri-cle using particle image velocimetry (PIV) for different in-stants during the cardiac cycle. At the onset of diastolic phase, the flow goes through the major orifice and then through the minor orifice. The two jets generated induce two counterclockwise vortices within the ventricle, which can lead to a partial closure of the valve during mitral E wave deceleration. During diastasis and mitral A wave, only one vortex persists in the ventricle and pushes the valve disk backward at the <b>end</b> of the <b>diastolic</b> phase. The valve disc never reached its maximum opening (65 ◦ vs. 75 ◦). This study underscores that the flow past a monoleaflet valve in mitral position is highly dependent on the complex inter-action between the inflow, the vortices development within the left ventricle, and the gravity.

We aimed to analyze the transcriptomic profile of adhesion molecules in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and relate the changes uncovered with the hemodynamic alterations and functional depression observed in these patients. Twenty-three left ventricular tissue samples from patients diagnosed with ICM (n = 13) undergoing heart transplantation and control donors (CNT, n = 10) were analyzed using RNA sequencing. Forty-two cell adhesion genes involved in cellular junctions were differentially expressed in ICM myocardium. Notably, the levels of protocadherin PCDHGA 3 were related with the stroke volume (r = - 0. 826, P = 0. 003), ejection fraction (r = - 0. 793, P = 0. 004) and left ventricular <b>end</b> systolic and <b>diastolic</b> diameters (r = 0. 867, P = 0. 001; r = 0. 781, P = 0. 005, respectively).

40|$|We {{investigate}} the behaviour of a dynamic fluid-structure interaction {{model of a}} chorded polyurethane mitral valve prosthesis, focusing on the effects on valve dynamics of including descriptions of the bending stiffnesses of the valve leaflets and artificial chordae tendineae. Each of the chordae is attached at {{one end to the}} valve annulus and at the other to one of two chordal attachment points. These attachment points correspond to the positions where the chords of the real prosthesis would attach to the left-ventricular wall, although in the present study, these attachment points are kept fixed in space to facilitate comparison between our simulations and earlier results obtained from an experimental test rig. In our simulations, a time-dependent pressure difference derived from experimental measurements drives flow through the model valve during diastole and provides a realistic pressure load during systole. In previous modelling studies of this valve prosthesis, the valve presents an unrealistically large orifice at beginning of diastole and does not close completely at the end of diastole. We show that including a description of the chordal bending stiffness enables the model valve to close properly at the <b>end</b> of the <b>diastolic</b> phase of the cardiac cycle. Valve over-opening is eliminated only by incorporating a description of the bending stiffnesses of the valve leaflets into the model.
