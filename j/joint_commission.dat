40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> has assumed an {{important}} {{place in the}} policy and practice of English health and social care. Yet, despite much being claimed for this way of working {{there is a lack}} of evidence to demonstrate the outcomes of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning.</b> This paper examines the types of impacts that have been claimed for <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> within the literature. Method: The paper reviews the extant literature concerning <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> employing an interpretive schema to examine the different meanings afforded to this concept. The paper reviews over 100 documents that discuss <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning,</b> adopting an interpretive approach which sought to identify a series of discourses, each of which view the processes and outcomes of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> differently. Results: This paper finds that although much has been written about <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> there is little evidence to link it to changes in outcomes. Much of the evidence base focuses on the processes of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> and few studies have systematically studied the outcomes of this way of working. Further, there does not appear to be one single definition of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> and it is used in a variety of different ways across health and social care. The paper identifies three dominant discourses of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> – prevention, empowerment and efficiency. Each of these offers a different way of seeing <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> and suggests that it should achieve different aims. Conclusions: There is a lack of clarity not only in terms of what <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> has been demonstrated to achieve but even in terms of what it should achieve. <b>Joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> is far from a clear concept with a number of different potential meanings. Although this ambiguity can be helpful in some ways in the sense that it can bring together disparate groups, for example, if <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> is to be delivered at a local level then more specificity may be required in terms of what they are being asked to deliver...|$|R

In this paper we adopt a Q methodology approach to understand the different meanings of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> that those involved in these arrangements hold.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the role of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> in health and social care policy and practice in England. This paper provides an empirical examination of the three discourses of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> developed from an interpretative analysis of documents by Dickinson et al (2013) and applied to data from our study exploring the role of knowledge in commissioning in England. Based on interviews with 92 participants undertaken between 2011 and 2013 our analysis confirms that the three discourses of prevention or empowerment or efficiency are used by professionals from across health and social care organisations to frame their experiences of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning.</b> However, contrary to Dickinson et al, we also demonstrate that commissioners and other stakeholders combine and trade off these different discourses in unexpected ways to present a compelling case. Moreover, at sites where the service user experience was central to the <b>commissioning</b> process (<b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> as empowerment) a greater sense of agreement about commissioning decisions appeared to have been established, even when the other discourses were also in play...|$|R

Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century, the central {{government}} became increasingly involved in local affairs. The feud was limited and regulated, local taxation became much more intrusive and from 1607 regular, local commissions of Justices of the Peace on the English model were established to deal with petty crimes and infractions. Greater control was exerted over the lawless Borders through a <b>joint</b> <b>commission</b> with the English, set up in 1587. James VI was much more hostile to the culture and particularism of the Highlands than his predecessors. He sent colonists from Fife to parts {{of the region and}} forced the Highland chiefs to accept Lowland language and culture through the Statues of Iona of 1609.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that public sector organisations should work together more effectively to deliver the best services. In recent years this notion of partnership-working has been stressed {{in terms of the}} <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> of services. Commissioning is the activity that decides of the services to be provided to local populations and who shall provide and pay for them. The concept of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> is used here to describe the ways in which health and social care agencies work together to determine this. There is little evidence which describes either the processes or provides clear messages about outcomes it produces. This project proposes an approach which builds on previous experience of evaluating public sector collaborative activities to investigate ways in which <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> operates and the types of outcomes these processes produce for service users. The approach proposed incorporates a range of stakeholders, but in particular front-line staff members and service users within the case-study areas, a factor which has been lacking in previous evaluations. The project aims to produce practical knowledge about the types of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> activities taking place in England and the outcomes this produces - with the aim that these practical lessons may provide useful learning for other health and social care communities...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{government}} {{suggestions that}} <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> between {{health and social}} care is (or at least should be) {{a key element of}} attempts to improve {{the health and well-being of}} local populations, the evidence to support this notion has lagged behind this aspiration. Although there is a wealth of different partnership arrangements in place around the country, there are a number of limitations to our existing knowledge relating to how these operate in practice and the types of impacts that these produce. Underpinning this study is a desire to explore a working hypothesis common in current policy and practice: that partnerships lead to better services and hence better outcomes for service users and their carers. Thus, this research seeks to investigate whether <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> leads to improved services and subsequently improved outcomes for service users. To test this link in greater detail, this research seeks to provide a theoretically and empirically robust understanding of the dynamic relationship between <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning,</b> services and outcomes. Eight case study sites will be incorporated into this research, representing a range of the different types of commissioning activities which are in place around the country. This research project seeks to add to and complement existing and future SDO and Department of Health research projects to produce more clarity in relation to the types of activities and outcomes which <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> is producing around England and make generalisable statements relating to what works for whom and within what circumstances' (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) ...|$|R

During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the <b>Joint</b> <b>Commission</b> for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} grass-roots movement of making <b>joint</b> <b>commissions</b> among {{the common people}} in early medieval China. Stone inscriptions associated with various lay socio-religious groups from the second century to the seventh century C. E. are the primary vehicles {{for the study of}} this subject. By reading through these primary sources, I argue that the widespread lay Buddhist societies have an indigenous Chinese root. In the second century C. E., the commoners were already actively involved in religious or sacrificial events held among their communities. When the teachings of Buddhism, Daoism, and other beliefs were disseminating in early medieval China, the need for making <b>joint</b> <b>commissions</b> and establishing religious societies among the local communities persisted. Although the teachings and the iconography of these beliefs vary, the practices and the format of these <b>joint</b> <b>commissions</b> were basically the same. Furthermore, these lay socio-religious societies and their local monasteries were closely connected and supported each other as patrons and religious teachers. Throughout this dissertation, I hope to shed some light on the social and religious life of the ordinary people, who are often neglected and overlooked in official historical documents. ...|$|R

5|$|The war policy 1547–1549 had entailed an {{extraordinary}} expenditure of about £350,000p.a. against a regular Crown income of £150,000p.a. It {{was impossible to}} continue in this way, and Dudley quickly negotiated a withdrawal of the besieged English garrison at Boulogne. The high costs of the garrison could thus be saved and French payments of redemption of roughly £180,000 were a most welcome cash income. The peace with France was concluded in the Treaty of Boulogne in March 1550. There was both public rejoicing and anger at the time, and some historians have condemned the peace as a shameful surrender of English-held territory. A year later {{it was agreed that}} King Edward was to have a French bride, the six-year-old Elisabeth of Valois. The threat of war with Scotland was also neutralised, England giving up some isolated garrisons in exchange. In the peace treaty with Scotland of June 1551, a <b>joint</b> <b>commission,</b> one of {{the first of its kind}} in history, was installed to agree upon the exact boundary between the two countries. This matter was concluded in August 1552 by French arbitration. Despite the cessation of hostilities, English defences were kept on a high level: nearly £200,000p.a. were spent on the navy and the garrisons at Calais and on the Scottish border. In his capacity as Warden-General of the Scottish Marches, Northumberland arranged for the building of a new Italianate fortress at Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E

Behaviour could be regulated through kirk sessions, composed of local church elders, which replaced the church courts of the Middle Ages, and which dealt with moral and religious conduct. The local court baron remained important in regulating minor interpersonal and property offences. They were held {{at the behest of the}} local baron when there was a backlog of cases and could appoint birleymen, usually senior tenants, who would resolve disputes and issues.

5|$|Savimbi, {{unwilling to}} {{personally}} sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the Lusaka Protocol in Lusaka, Zambia on 31 October 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of}} the protocol on 20 November. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would cease fire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan national police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on 15 November 1994 to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said {{they would be willing to}} meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a <b>joint</b> <b>commission,</b> consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement that granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the collapse of the protocol.|$|E
