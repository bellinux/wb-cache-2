40|$|Food-dependent exercise-induced {{anaphylaxis}} (FDEIA) {{is a type}} of exercise-induced anaphylaxis {{associated with}} postprandial exercise. We describe a 19 -year-old man with FDEIA. Our patient complained of urticaria, angioedema, dizziness and hypotension associated with exercise after ingestion of walnut-containing foods <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> environment. Skin prick test and prick to prick test were positive for walnut antigen. The attack didn't occur by free running outside for 10 min 2 h after taking walnuts, and the temperature was about - 2 ℃. Food-exercise test was done again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> environment based on prior history. Anaphylaxis was developed after exercise for 10 min <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> environment after taking walnuts. Some environmental factors such as high temperature and high humidity or cold temperature may influence exercise-induced anaphylaxis. In our case, the cofactor was <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> environment: the challenge test done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold environment was negative, but positive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> environment. Physicians should be aware that the challenge test of FDEIA can show different results depending on temperature...|$|R

40|$|The Section for Climate Therapy {{offers a}} 4 -week {{in-patient}} rehabilitation programme <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> and sunny climate for some selected chronic diseases. The {{main purpose of}} this PhD thesis {{was to investigate the}} effect of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme, and to compare the effect of this intervention given <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> versus <b>a</b> cold climatic setting. One randomised controlled trial included patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n= 124) and ankylosing spondylitis (n= 107), they were randomised to rehabilitation either <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Norwegian or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Mediterranean rehabilitation centre, and followed up after 3 and 6 months. Patients with postpolio syndrome (n= 88) and heredital neuromuscular diseases (n= 60) were included in two other studies with a similar design. Immediate improvements were demonstrated in different aspects of health in both climatic settings for all included diagnoses. In general, most improvements were larger and sustained longer when rehabilitation was performed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> climatic setting. When the attained reductions in pain and fatigue were sustained after therapy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> climatic setting only, improvements in the physical capacity were sustained more independently of the climatic setting. Some more specific effects of the treatment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> climate, were <b>a</b> larger reduction <b>in</b> disease activity parameters <b>in</b> rheumatoid arthritis, <b>a</b> sustainable increase <b>in</b> spinal mobility in 91 % of the ankylosing spondylitis patients, and reduced depression in the postpolio patients. In conclusion, our studies show improvements of an in-patient rehabilitation programme at different levels of health for all included diagnosis, and support an additional effect when this intervention is performed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> climatic setting. This PhD thesis is written within the rehabilitation and rheumatology field, and the studies have been conducted at the Section for Climate Therapy at Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet in cooperation with Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital...|$|R
