5|$|The four bulleted lists below {{summarise}} {{the known}} participants to 1725 under each heading. The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 {{and the traditional}} county soon became the <b>key</b> <b>unit</b> of organisation. Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of the country. In a similar vein, although not always in association {{with one of the}} above matches, those players, venues, clubs and teams known to have been active or in use by 1725 are also listed.|$|E
500|$|When {{developing}} Shadow Dragon, {{the team}} {{did not see}} it as a simple remake, but rather a [...] "renewal" [...] of the original on a new platform with new and updated mechanics. The most difficult part was balancing this with maintaining the original version's atmosphere. Numerous features were added to the experience, such as displays for movement and attack range, the ability to change classes and unit recruitment if too many of the original army fell in battle. Expanded difficulty options and tutorials were also added to help ease newcomers into the series. The by-then well established Weapon Triangle was also introduced, replacing the unbalanced systems from the original. The addition of a single mid-battle save was intended to help ease newcomers into the series, so they would not need to restart the entire battle if a <b>key</b> <b>unit</b> fell. The dual screen display of both map and unit placement and status was indirectly inspired by the original version, which allowed players to view character stats without dropping out of the map.|$|E
2500|$|Under Magdoff's direction, the Monthly Review {{focused more}} and more upon imperialism as the <b>key</b> <b>unit</b> of {{analysis}} for global development and the forces challenging neocolonialism in the Third World. [...] This perspective put the magazine and its press squarely on the New Left intellectual agenda since the late 1960s. [...] His work also kept him {{in the forefront of}} socialist thought in the U.S. from the 1930s to this day. [...] The Great Depression left a strong impact on Magdoff's perspective on capitalism, as Magdoff recalls a sense of doom felt in the mid-century by pro-capitalists, holding that nothing since 1929 led him to believe that the economy has become immune to cycles of severe crisis. Until his death, Magdoff co-edited the Monthly Review with John Bellamy Foster.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{modeling}} and simulation of high-pressure urea synthesis loop has been studied. The extended electrolytic UNIQUAC equation {{has been used to}} describe the nonideality of liquid phase of NH 3 -CO 2 -H 2 O-urea system under high pressure and high temperature, and the perturbed-hard-sphere (PHS) equation of state has been used to predict the vapor fugacity coefficients. The vapor-liquid equilibrium has been treated simultaneously with chemical reactions due to the complex features of the urea synthesis system. A concrete procedure for simulation of the <b>key</b> <b>units</b> and flowsheet of the high-pressure urea synthesis loop has been developed. The equilibrium-stage model has been applied to {{modeling and}} simulation of the urea reactor, CO 2 stripper and other <b>key</b> <b>units</b> in the high-pressure loop for urea synthesis, and the simultaneous-modular approach has been adopted to simulate the flowsheet. The simulation results {{have been found to be}} in good agreement with the design data from the industry-scale plant.
