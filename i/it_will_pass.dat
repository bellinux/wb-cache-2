5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} this process, {{refer to the}} illustration on the right. It is absolutely identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the polarizer from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the leftward horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the vertical component and that when the horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated {{at the bottom and}} <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is oriented so that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> one linear polarization and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate. This brings the two components back into their initial phase relationship, reestablishing the selected circular polarization.|$|E

2500|$|While a {{planetary}} system may enjoy a location favorable to complex life, {{it must also}} maintain that location for a span of time sufficiently long for complex life to evolve. Hence a central star with a galactic orbit that steers clear of galactic regions where radiation levels are high, such as the Galactic Center and the spiral arms, would appear most favourable. If the central star's galactic orbit is eccentric (elliptic or hyperbolic), <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through some spiral arms, but if the orbit is a near perfect circle and the orbital velocity equals the [...] "rotational" [...] velocity of the spiral arms, the star will drift into a spiral arm region only gradually—if at all. Therefore, Rare Earth proponents conclude that a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular about the center of its galaxy. The required synchronization of the orbital velocity of a central star with the wave velocity of the spiral arms can occur only within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center. This region is termed the [...] "galactic habitable zone". Lineweaver et al. calculate that the galactic habitable zone is a ring 7 to 9 kiloparsecs in radius, that includes no more than 10% of {{the stars in the}} Milky Way. Based on conservative estimates {{of the total number of}} stars in the galaxy, this could represent something like 20 to 40 billion stars. Gonzalez, et al. would halve these numbers; he estimates that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall in the galactic habitable zone.|$|E
2500|$|Voyager 1 {{completed}} {{the phase of}} termination shock in December 2004 {{at a distance of}} 94 AU while Voyager 2 completed it in August 2007 at a distance of [...] 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath the spacecraft are in an area that is dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind particles. The thickness of the heliosheath is not known clearly so the time required to traverse this space is not quite clear. Scientists estimate this space to be tens of AU thick and that it could take several years to cross. After passing through the heliosheath the two Voyagers will begin the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause which is where the spacecraft are headed now. This is the region where the Sun's influence begins to decrease and the interstellar space can be detected. The heliopause has never been reached by any spacecraft so far and the Voyagers may be the first spacecraft to reach it. Currently, Voyager 1 is escaping the solar system at the speed of 3.6 AU per year, while Voyager 2s speed is about 3.3 AU per year. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about 40,000 years, Voyager 1 will be within 1.6 light years of AC+79 3888, which is a star in the constellation of Camelopardalis. In 40,000 years Voyager 2 will be within 1.7 light years from star Ross 248 and in 296,000 years <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> within 4.6 light years of Sirius which is the brightest star in the night sky. The main objective of the Voyager Interstellar Mission is interstellar exploration.|$|E
