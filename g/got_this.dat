5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally <b>got</b> <b>this</b> thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
5|$|A {{month before}} his capture, U.S. {{authorities}} had been passing down information to {{their counterparts in}} Mexico that Treviño Morales was making frequent visits to the Nuevo Laredo border area to see his newborn baby. They <b>got</b> <b>this</b> intelligence from wiretaps, conversations, and informants' tips. Treviño Morales was apprehended by the Mexican Marines in Anáhuac, Nuevo León, near the border of Tamaulipas state, at around 3:45 a.m. on 15 July 2013 without a single shot fired. The truck he was traveling in was intercepted on the road by a Black Hawk helicopter from the Navy; when the Marines got off the helicopter and tried to apprehend him, the capo attempted to escape by running through some bushes but was later caught. He was in possession of US$2 million ($25,316,100 MXN) in cash, eight weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition; two other men were arrested with him and taken into custody. Rumors of Treviño Morales's arrest and a mugshot of him in custody began to circulate through Twitter and other social media outlets around noon that day, but the Mexican government did not confirm the arrest, nor did the U.S. authorities receive a formal confirmation until hours later.|$|E

In 2010 the Eels <b>got</b> <b>this</b> chance.|$|E

25|$|CVR {{transcript}} contains {{details of}} extensive discussion amongst {{the crew members}} about the weather en route and over Kinshasa. First indication of Crew's realization {{of the presence of}} bad weather en route to Kinshasa was evident at 12:37, when the aircraft was between position GURUT and UDRID, over 100 NMs from Kinshasa. The crew <b>got</b> <b>this</b> indication through their on-board weather radar. At 12:38, the crew again discussed the weather when the Captain said that the (radar) beam was clearly showing the clouds. extended communication amongst the crew of extreme bad weather being present at and around Kinshasa and the way to avoid it, is heard on the CVR. The co-pilot exclaimed at 12:45 that the weather return being picked up on their radar was very big. Crew also discussed that the clouds were moving, so in next 10 minutes needed to reach the airfield, the clouds would have moved off the airfield. They also seemed to have a doubt whether the returns being picked up on the weather radar were ground echoes or were severe weather (Magenta) indications. The co-pilot confirmed that the returns were not ground echoes but were radar returns (Magenta) from very severe weather.|$|E
25|$|As the war {{entered the}} final stages, {{the nation was}} forced to confront the reality of how many of its people had behaved under German rule. In France, {{collaborators}} were more severely punished than in most other occupied countries. Immediately after the liberation, countless women accused of aiding, abetting, and taking German soldiers as lovers were subjected to public humiliations such as being shaved bald and paraded through the streets in their underwear. Women who <b>got</b> <b>this</b> treatment were lucky as many others were simply attacked by lynch mobs. With so many of their former members having been hunted down and killed by the Nazis and paramilitary Milice, the Partisans had already summarily executed an estimated 4,500 people, and the Communists in particular continued to press for severe action against collaborators. In Paris alone, over 150,000 people were at some time detained on suspicion of collaboration, although most were later released. Famous figures accused included the industrialist Louis Renault, the actress Arletty, who had lived openly with a German officer in the Ritz, the opera star Tino Rossi, the chanteuse Édith Piaf, the stage actor Sacha Guitry and Coco Chanel, who was briefly detained but fled to Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|Maricello {{was pushing}} hard but {{lost control of}} his car at the R Bend and {{collided}} heavily with the barriers. He retired from the race and this put pressure off Félix da Costa who made use of his situation {{to close the gap}} to Lynn. Sims was running strongly but backed off at about lap ten {{as a result of an}} engine temperature sensor problem which he corrected by short shifting and pulling out off Derani's slipstream. Félix da Costa reduced the deficit to Lynn to just over one second with four laps left in the event. He <b>got</b> <b>this</b> gap down to 1.3 seconds under yellow flag conditions for Wolf's stranded car at Lisboa corner, but was unable to get close to affect an pass on Lynn who maintained the lead for the remainder of the race to win. Lynn became the seventh driver to have won the Macau Grand Prix for Theodore Racing. The previous year's winner Félix da Costa finished second, 1.173 seconds in arrears, while Derani completed the podium in third place. Off the podium, Sims finished in fourth position. King led Carlin teammates Jaafar and Sainz in the next three places. Blomqvist came from the back of the field to finish eighth with Latifi ninth. Ocon recovered from his race start stall to complete the top ten. Outside the top ten, Sekiguchi was eleventh and led fellow countryman Nakayama in twelfth. The British pairing of Buller and Tincknell followed in 13th and 14th with Chiyo, Giovinazzi, Mason, Van der Laar, Jones, Wolf and Korjus the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

He's <b>got</b> <b>this</b> weird face, with a broken nose and greasy hair. He's starting to bald, but he's always got a very white separation in the middle of it. He's just so greasy, he's great to draw. And he still has to be seductive at the same time, so you can't make him repulsive... He's such a great character." ...|$|E
