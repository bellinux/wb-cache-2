5|$|The {{first new}} {{interchange}} opened at Dixie Road in 1953, beginning a seven-year program {{to make the}} Hamilton–Toronto section into a <b>full-fledged</b> freeway.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{widespread}} support from various countries, the Philippines finally changed its policy. After Timorese Independence, the Philippines contributed medical and logistics personnel to Interfet, rather than ground troops. The UN named a Filipino, Lieutenant General Jaime delos Santos, {{to command the}} <b>full-fledged</b> UN peacekeeping force which takes over from Interfet on Tuesday.|$|E
5|$|The fairies mock {{the drunken}} poet and drive him away. With its quick repartee and its broadly “realistic” {{portrayal}} of the poor victim, the Masque of the Drunken Poet is the closest episode in Purcell’s London stage works to <b>full-fledged</b> opera as the Italians knew it.|$|E
5|$|This episode {{marks the}} first <b>full-fledged</b> {{appearance}} of Kent Brockman, and Kelsey Grammer makes his first guest appearance on the show {{as the voice of}} Sideshow Bob. The episode was well received by critics, and it was the highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|As the reconstituted Central Bank of Somalia fully assumes its {{monetary}} policy responsibilities, {{some of the}} existing money transfer companies are expected {{in the near future}} to seek licenses so as to develop into <b>full-fledged</b> commercial banks. This will serve to broaden the scope of the national payments system to include formal cheques, which in turn is expected to reinforce the effectiveness of the use of {{monetary policy}} in domestic macroeconomic management.|$|E
5|$|For {{a period}} of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo {{material}} live. In 1998, {{after the release of}} Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his <b>full-fledged</b> solo band.|$|E
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} in his diary, Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a <b>full-fledged</b> Confucian scholar.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl was a late-season {{and unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that formed during the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season. A minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, Karl {{developed at the}} center of another, larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic. After being classified a subtropical cyclone on November 25, it became more independent of its parent storm and grew into a <b>full-fledged</b> hurricane. It peaked in intensity on November 26, and ultimately dissipated as it merged with another system.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Russian-American {{interaction}} resumed {{with the}} Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, {{this time a}} <b>full-fledged</b> space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as {{two of the biggest}} partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.|$|E
5|$|Incorporated in April 1992 as {{a limited}} {{liability}} company, the airline began operations as an air taxi operator in 1993. It began <b>full-fledged</b> operations in 1995 with international flights added in 2004. The airline {{went public in}} 2005 and in 2007, it acquired Air Sahara. It became the largest carrier by passenger market share in the country by 2010, a position it held till 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} {{almost two years}} of work, the film follows Ash Ketchum and his friends years after {{the events of the}} {{original}} anime series, and their struggle against criminal organization Rocket Industries. Deciding on using the subject of Pokémon after considering several possibilities such as Grand Theft Auto and Dragon Ball Z, the producers were surprised by fan reaction to the material. Despite praises for the content, they have stated they have no intention to produce a <b>full-fledged</b> film.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{attained}} tropical characteristics near 0000UTC while situated {{south of}} Louisiana and was subsequently designated a tropical depression. Ship communications {{off the coast}} on July24 relayed winds of 23–50knots and a barometric pressure of 1007.5mbar (29.75inHg), which indicated it was a tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Radar imagery taken near 0733CST (1333UTC) from a Dow Chemical plant in Freeport, Texas evidenced that Debra was a <b>full-fledged</b> Category1 hurricane on the scale, with a prominent spiral appearance that was not perceived by the radar the previous afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's operas {{comprise}} 22 musical dramas in {{a variety}} of genres. They range from the small-scale, derivative works of his youth to the <b>full-fledged</b> operas of his maturity. Three of the works were abandoned before completion and were not performed until many years after the composer's death. His mature works are all considered classics and have never been out of the repertory of the world's opera houses.|$|E
5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a <b>full-fledged</b> inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a <b>full-fledged</b> checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the band}} was joined by vocalist Mark Lanegan, and {{released}} their third album, Songs for the Deaf in 2002. The album brought the band {{to a new level}} of commercial success, and a <b>full-fledged</b> tour followed in support of the album. Queens of the Stone Age released a follow-up album, Lullabies to Paralyze, in 2005. The album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 97,000 copies during its first week. Two years later, the band released its fifth studio album, Era Vulgaris, which debuted and peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Sony {{released}} the first useful and fully functioning operating {{system for a}} video game console, after the Net Yaroze experiment for the original PlayStation. The kit, which included an internal hard disk drive and the necessary software tools, turned the PlayStation 2 into a <b>full-fledged</b> computer system running Linux. Users can utilize a network adapter to connect the PlayStation 2 to the internet, a monitor cable adaptor to connect the PlayStation 2 to computer monitors {{as well as a}} USB Keyboard and Mouse which can be used to control Linux on the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|In Linz, Kepler's primary {{responsibilities}} (beyond {{completing the}} Rudolphine Tables) were {{teaching at the}} district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow happening only a few years after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the <b>full-fledged</b> assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle {{group who}} {{were looking for}} someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could {{transition}} from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a <b>full-fledged</b> rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Thanjavur was {{connected}} with Chennai via the Vayudoot flight service, which was stopped due to poor patronage. A <b>full-fledged</b> air force station is operational at Thanjavur. Thanjavur Air Force Station {{was to become}} a major air base by 2012, to handle Fighter, Transport aircraft and also refuelling aircraft. However, the establishment and activation of air base has been delayed as of March 2013. The IAF will base a squadron of its Sukhoi Su-30 Supermaneuverability Fighter aircraft at Thanjavur, making it the first fighter squadron in Tamil Nadu. The nearest airport is Tiruchirapalli International Airport. The nearest Seaport is located at Nagapattinam.|$|E
5|$|Levine founded his {{own record}} label, 222 Records, in February 2012. He {{stated that he}} was {{inspired}} to start the label to sign on Rozzi Crane, an USC music student he discovered through a mutual friend. She became the first singer {{signed on to the}} label, followed by Glee actor Matthew Morrison, Mexican artist Diego Boneta and The Voice season 2 contestant and part of Team Adam, the singer Tony Lucca. It was reported that he was negotiating further with potential distributors, as well as organizing staff, to operate as a <b>full-fledged</b> record company with departments such as marketing, radio and publicity.|$|E
5|$|Miles' father also reappears, and {{relates to}} his son that as a young man, he and Aaron {{went to work for}} a {{criminal}} named Turk after Jefferson was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a spy in order to infiltrate the organization of the then-up-and-coming international criminal Wilson Fisk. Jefferson did this for a time, but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes, and Jefferson offered a chance to be a <b>full-fledged</b> S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, he refused, not wanting any part of his brother's world. He met Rio a week later {{and fell in love with}} her. Jefferson fled after learning that Miles was Spider-Man because it brought back unresolved issues from that earlier time in his life, and tells Miles that he does not blame Miles for his mother's death, and regrets abandoning him.|$|E
5|$|Other than {{establishing}} new rail corridors, GO Transit {{introduced the}} Bi-Level coaches in 1979, {{in order to}} increase the number of passengers carried per train. These unique rail cars were developed in partnership with Bombardier Transportation. In that same year, the current GO concourse at Union Station was built to accommodate these additional passengers. GO Bus service also started on September 8, 1970, extending the original Lakeshore line to Hamilton and Oshawa, as well as providing service north to Newmarket and Barrie. It eventually became a <b>full-fledged</b> network in its own right after 1989, feeding rail service and serving communities beyond the reach of existing trains.|$|E
5|$|Overwatch {{announcement}} video, in 2014, {{contained a}} stray {{reference to a}} gauntlet. Following its obsessive popularity with fans, the developer, Blizzard Entertainment, expanded the gauntlet into a <b>full-fledged,</b> playable character. This period included a series of teasers from the developer and a campaign by actor Terry Crews to voice the character. Doomfist was ultimately voiced by Sahr Ngaujah. In Doomfist's fictional backstory, the playable character became the third generation to wield the gauntlet, and {{is presented as a}} villain after killing his predecessor and becoming a leader of Talon, the game's nemesis group. A digital comic accompanied the character's release.|$|E
5|$|Route64 was {{designated}} originally as an alignment of Route31A, a spur off of State Highway Route31 (currently U.S. Route206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route33. The state planned on turning the alignment into a <b>full-fledged</b> expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route31A to Route64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed {{to become part}} of the PrincetonHightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route92), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of a planet {{is that it has}} cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from <b>full-fledged</b> planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed {{to show off}} the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo decided to make the demo into a <b>full-fledged</b> video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} no public university campuses in Kuching, {{apart from the}} Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences building situated next to the Sarawak General Hospital. The Sarawak state government moved the last remaining public university campus (Universiti Teknologi MARA) from Kuching to Kota Samarahan in 1997 in a long-term initiative to transform Kota Samarahan into an education hub. Kuching is home to two <b>full-fledged</b> private university campuses: the Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus, the only branch campus of Swinburne University of Technology outside Australia; and UCSI University, Sarawak Campus which houses the Faculty of Hospitality and Management. A polytechnic and community college, both known as Politeknik Kuching Sarawak and Kolej Komuniti Kuching are also located in the city.|$|E
5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} <b>full-fledged</b> rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore {{is a major}} {{educational}} hub. The first {{college of}} Coimbatore, Government Arts College, was opened in 1875. The first engineering college in the city, the Arthur Hope College of Technology (now known as the Government College of Technology, Coimbatore), was started by G.D. Naidu in 1945 followed later by private engineering colleges PSG College of Technology and Coimbatore Institute of Technology in the 1950s. The Air Force Administrative College, established in 1949, is the oldest training institute of the Indian Air Force. Coimbatore Medical College was opened in 1966 and also city has another Government run ESIC Medical College. The Government law college started functioning from 1978. The agricultural school established in 1868 was converted into a <b>full-fledged</b> agricultural university Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in 1971 and the Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History was opened in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting Argentine and Chilean {{claims to}} Patagonia, a {{geographic}} {{region in the}} southernmost portion of South America, {{went back to the}} 1840s. In 1872 and again in 1878, Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by Argentina. An Argentine warship did the same to an American ship in 1877. These actions nearly led to war in November 1878, when Argentina dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. Chile responded with the same, and war was only avoided when the Fierro–Sarratea treaty was hastily signed. Both countries were distracted {{in the next few years}} by Argentina's internal military operations against the indigenous population and Chile's War of the Pacific (Guerra del Pacífico) against Bolivia and Peru, but by 1890 a <b>full-fledged</b> naval arms race was underway between the two.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{the fifth}} season's {{production}} period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate – {{especially among the}} production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – {{about the future of}} the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or <b>full-fledged</b> substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.|$|E
