40|$|The {{adsorption}} isotherms of <b>fenuron</b> (1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -phenylurea) on three smectites (SWy and SAz montmorillonites and SH hectorite) differing in their layer charge (SH<SWy<SAz) and saturated with several inorganic and organic cations were determined. The isotherms and sorption parameters from Freundlich equation indicate low adsorptivity on inorganic clays, but medium sorption in organoclays (OCls). <b>Fenuron</b> adsorption on homoionic smectites increases with decreasing layer charge and hydratation {{power of the}} inorganic exchangeable cation (except Fe 3 +), indicating that <b>fenuron</b> adsorbs as neutral molecule on uncharged siloxane surface by hydrophobic bonding, with some contribution of polar bond (<b>fenuron</b> C=O group and water associated to exchangeable cation). In the case of Fe 3 +-saturated smectite fenurony protonation, provided by the interlayer acidic environment, promotes further sorption of <b>fenuron</b> as cationic form. The sorption on organoclays is enhanced via hydrophobic interaction with organocations, which is favoured for high layer charge and basal spacing and organocation saturation close to CEC. Quaternary alkylammonium is more efficient in high layer charge smectite, whereas primary alkylammonium is more efficient in medium charge smectite. The low values of the maximum sorption obtained with homoionic inorganic and organic smectites (100 and 5000 μmol/Kg) represent one <b>fenuron</b> molecule for each 2000 - 200 exchange sites and indicate that <b>fenuron</b> sorption is mainly associated to the outer exchange sites. This low adsorptivity of <b>fenuron,</b> as consequence of its high water affinity (high water solubility) would suggest high mobility of <b>fenuron</b> in natural soil and water systems.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, two {{different}} imprinted polymers were synthesised by precipitation polymerisation using methacrylic acid (MAA) or 4 -vinylpyridine (VP) as monomer and <b>fenuron</b> (FEN, a phenylurea herbicide) as template. After template removal, {{their ability to}} recognise <b>fenuron</b> was evaluated and the optimum loading, washing and elution conditions were established. From this study, {{it was concluded that}} imprinted binding sites were not formed in the vinylpyridine-based polymer. However, methacrylic acid-based polymer was able to recognise <b>fenuron</b> with high affinity and to selectively retain it from a mixture of several phenylurea herbicides. In addition, different rebinding experiments were carried out and the experimental binding isotherms were fitted to the Langmuir-Freundlich (LF) isotherm in order to assess the binding site distribution. It was concluded that the methacrylic acid-based polymer possesses a homogeneous binding site distribution and permits to achieve quantitative recoveries in a wide concentration range in molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) processes. The developed MISPE procedure using methacrylic acid-based polymeric micro-spheres was evaluated for the trace-enrichment and clean-up of <b>fenuron</b> from plant sample extracts.

40|$|Four {{different}} methacrylic acid-based, molecularly imprinted, polymers, using <b>fenuron</b> or isoproturon as template and acetonitrile or toluene as porogen, {{were prepared}} {{in order to}} evaluate the template size effect on the selectivity and the porogen effect on the affinity of recognition in molecular imprinting solid-phase extraction. The results of different tests applied to both polymers have shown that fenuron-polymers were highly selective whereas isoproturon-polymers were able to recognise several structurally related compounds (metoxuron, <b>fenuron,</b> metobromuron, chlortoluron, linuron and chlorbromuron). On the other hand, the polymers prepared using toluene as porogen showed a higher affinity for the tested compounds than those prepared in acetonitrile. Accordingly, the isoproturon-imprinted polymer prepared in toluene has been evaluated as a new sorbent in solid-phase extraction procedures for the trace-enrichment and clean-up of phenyureas in ground water and soil samples.

40|$|In this study, {{adsorption}} and biodegradation were exploited sequentially {{to remove}} the herbicide <b>fenuron,</b> the insecticide carbaryl and the estrogens 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and 4 -tert-octylphenol (OP) from a municipal landfill leachate (MuLL). In the first step, we used spent coffee grounds, almond shells, a biochar and potato dextrose agar to adsorb the compounds spiked in MuLL at a concentration of 1  mg L− 1. After only 3  days, any adsorbent removed from MuLL the totality of E 2 and OP, averagely more than 95  % of carbaryl and 62  % of <b>fenuron</b> (81  % after 7  days). In the second step, the adsorbents collected from MuLL after 7  days were inoculated with the fungi Bjerkandera adusta and Irpex lacteus, separately. After 7  days, the maximum degradation occurred for OP in any treatment being averagely 78 and 74  % using B. adusta and I. lacteus, respectively. After 15  days, the average percentages of <b>fenuron,</b> carbaryl, E 2 and OP degraded were, respectively, 75, 76, 88 and 88  % using B. adusta, and 74, 79, 85 and 89  % using I. lacteus. Residual estrogenicity in the adsorbents, tested with the recombinant yeast assay, was strictly related to residual E 2, thus indicating a negligible contribution from the other contaminants and/or degradation products. The 7 -day treatment of MuLL with the adsorbents caused a significant abatement of MuLL phytotoxicity on flax (2. 5 times seedling elongation with coffee grounds, compared to MuLL) and a huge stimulation of rapeseed respect to water (biomass almost doubled), thus suggesting a possible worthwhile recycling of this wastewater in agriculture...|$|E

The high variation of the chemical shifts from the proton located inside the cavity (H- 3, H- 5 and H- 6) coupled with the non variation of the one located outer sphere of the β-CD (H- 1, H- 2 and H- 4) provided clear evidence of the inclusion phenomena.

DOPO- and DDPO-based compounds were synthesized via nucleophilic substitution with 1, 3, 5 -tris-(2 -hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate (THIC, 3) and subsequent oxidation (Scheme 1 and 2). Another trivalent DOPO derivative recently reported by our group was obtained by transamination followed by a Michaelis-Arbuzov rearrangement (Scheme 1)., These products were blended into two epoxy resin systems (DEN 438 and DGEBA, both cured with DICY and <b>Fenuron)</b> to obtain flame retardant thermosets.

The kinetics of {{the conversion}} suggest {{a requirement for}} de novo enzyme synthesis, but the system was not influenced by chloramphenicol or puromycin. Enzyme activity was detected when acetanilide (Km = 0. 195 mm) was used to replace propanil as substrate. Fungal acylamidase (E. C. 3. 5. 1., an aryl acylamine amidohydrolase) was concentrated by salt precipitation and characterized. The Fusarium solani acylamidase exhibited an optimum at pH 7. 5 to 9. 0 and was inactivated in 10 min at 50 C. The enzyme was not sensitive to methyl-carbamate or organophosphate insecticides, but the herbicide, Ramrod (N-isopropyl- 2 -chloroacetanilide), acted as a competitive inhibitor of acetanilide hydrolysis (Ki = 0. 167 mm). Hydrolysis rates were decreased by various para substitutions of acetanilide. Chloro substitution in the acyl moiety of acetanilide also reduced the rate of hydrolysis. 3, 4 -Dichloroacetanilide was less susceptible to enzyme action than acetanilide, but 3, 4 -dichloropropionanilide was hydrolyzed much more rapidly than propionanilide. The fungal acylamidase was highly specific for N-acetylarylamines.

40|$|Two {{different}} molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) {{were prepared}} by precipitation polymerization using linuron or isoproturon (phenylurea herbicides) as templates and trifluormethacrylic acid as functional monomer.

The MISPE procedures were fully optimized and applied to the clean up of selected phenylurea herbicides in carrot, potato, corn, and pea sample extracts and finally determined by HPLC-UV at 244 nm. Although a high degree of clean up was obtained, a decrease of the MIP recognition capabilities was observed in subsequent runs. Thus, a previous clean up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer was used to prevent the loss of MIP performance and to ease the removal of interferences. Following this procedure, namely two-step MISPE, matrix compounds were almost completely removed by the non-imprinted polymer retaining the ability of MIPs to selectively rebind target analytes unaltered.

The objectives were to assess the corresponding risk for aquatic primary producers and to provide exposure information for connected studies on the responses of biological parameters in invertebrate sentinel species. The risk associated with contaminants was assessed using risk quotients based on the comparison of measured concentrations with original species sensitivity distribution-derived hazardous concentration values. For EU Water Framework Directive priority substances, results of monitoring were also compared with regulatory Environmental Quality Standards. The highest residue concentrations and risks for primary producers were recorded for diuron and Irgarol 1051 in Arzal reservoir, close to a marina. Diuron was present during almost the all survey periods, whereas Irgarol 1051 exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with highest concentrations recorded in June and July. These {{results suggest that the}} use of antifouling biocides is responsible for {{a major part of the}} contamination of the lower part of the Vilaine River course for Irgarol 1051. For diuron, agricultural sources may also be involved. The presence of isoproturon and chloroacetanilide herbicides on some dates indicated a significant contribution of the use of plant protection products in agriculture to the contamination of Vilaine River. Concentration levels and associated risk were always lower in estuarine sites than in the reservoir, suggesting that Arzal dam reduces downstream transfer of contaminants and favors their degradation in the freshwater part of the estuary. Results of the additional monitoring of two tidal streams located downstream of Arzal dam suggested that, although some compounds may be transferred to the estuary, their impact was probably very low. Dilution by marine water associated with tidal current was also a major factor of concentration reduction. It is concluded that the highest risks associated to herbicides and booster biocides concerned the freshwater part of the estuary and that its brackish/saltwater part was exposed to a moderate risk, although some substances may sometimes exhibit high concentration but mainly at low tide and on an irregular basis...|$|E
40|$|Epoxy resins have a {{wide range}} of {{application}}s. Their application in fabrication of fiber reinforced composites for lightweight construction has become the subject of ongoing interest in the field of polymer alloys. However due to their existence of cross-linked structure and organic nature, they have two major drawbacks - brittleness and flammability - which very often limit their usage in most applications. The aim of this thesis was to obtain and characterize new additives for epoxy-based materials, which are able to improve the toughness and flammability without any derogation of other material properties. Toughness can be improved by reducing the cross-link density of the polymer matrix or incorporation of another modifier. Recently, hyperbranched polymers have shown their promising results in the field of toughening DGEBA (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) -based materials. In the present work, we first examined the effect of additives and modifiers on epoxy resin used in injection process (especially in Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) process). A number of commercially available additives were tested in DGEBA-based resin formulations. However, toughness is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by many factors and meanwhile many other material properties were affected. Secondly, the results we collected {{in the course of the}} BMBF project "Innovative, modular microwave technology for the production of composite structures" are presented. Based on the previous findings from the same project, the effect of carbon-based and microwave-active fillers, such as activated carbon particles carbon black (Chezacarb® B) carbon nanotubes or graphite explored) on the homo- polymerization of the epoxy resins were investigated. In Addition, the feasibility of the microwave processing for glass fibers reinforced epoxy resin (GRP) curing was tested out. Furthermore, a series of novel oligomers like derivatives of 6 H-dibenzo[c,e][1, 2]- oxaphosphinin- 6 -oxids (DOPO, 1) and 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 2 -dioxa-phosphorinan- 2 -one (DDPO, 2) as flame retardant additives were synthesized. The 1, 3, 5 -tris(2 -hydroxyethyl) - isocyanurate (THIC, 3) -oligomer was used as linkage molecule. These products were blended into two epoxy resin systems (DEN 438 and DGEBA, both cured with DICY and <b>Fenuron)</b> to obtain flame retardant thermosets. The flame retardancy and thermal properties of these epoxy resin systems were examined by UL 94 -V, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Additionally, phosphorus-containing amino compounds were also synthesized and characterized. Their reactivity with the commercial epoxy novolak was studied by means of DSC. The flammability properties of obtained compounds are also presented.

40|$|In {{the course}} of this {{doctoral}} work, a series of organophosphorus derivatives were synthesised in order to deepen our understanding of the influence of the environment around the phosphorus on the flame retardant mechanism. The Friedel-Crafts reaction of PCl 3 with 2 -hydroxybiphenyl, 2, 2 -dimethylpropane- 1, 3 -diol and 2 -aminobiphenyl yielded the phosphorus chloride precursor of 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -oxide (DOPO), 5, 5 -dimethyl-[1, 3, 2]-dioxaphosphorinane- 2 -oxide (DDPO) and 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -aza- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene 10 -oxide(DAPO) respectively. The phosphorus chloride derivatives were then either hydrolised, oxidised, or thionised to yield a series of molecules where the environment around the phosphorus atom varied. The synthesized molecules were chemically incorporated(preformulation) in phenol epoxy novolac (DEN 438) with different phosphorus concentrations. According to standard EE processes, the modified resins were then cured using DICY as hardener and <b>Fenuron</b> as accelerator. The influence of the chemical modification of the epoxy phenol novolac resin, on the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the cured material, was investigated using DSC. As a result of the decreasing number of epoxy functional group available for cross-linking, the Tg decreased with increasing phosphorus loading. This effect was enhanced when sulphur containing molecules were used. However, chemical modification with DAPO only resulted in a negligible impact on Tg as the amine functionality could contribute to the cross-linking. The flame retardant efficiency of the modified resin with different phosphorus loading was evualted using the UL- 94 test, in accordance with the DIN IEC 60695 - 11 - 10. All phosphorus derivatives improved the flame retardancy of phenol epoxy novolac resin with comparable phosphorus loading to DOPO. However, 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -sulfide (DOPS) imparted UL- 94 V 0 rating with only 1. 0 % phosphorus loading. In order to further understand the role of the PO and PS radicals in the mode of flame retardancy of DOPS, Limiting Oxygen Test (LOI) and thermal desorption mass spectrometry (TD-MS) were carried out. TD-MS experiments revealed that PS and PO radicals are released sequentially in the gas which can rationalise the better efficiency of DOPS in comparison to DOPO. LOI experiments showed that the intumescent mechanism of DDPO was reduced when sulphur replaced oxygen in 5, 5 -dimethyl-[1, 3, 2]-dioxaphosphorinane- 2 -sulfide (DDPS). Finally, a part of a cooperation with Prof. G. Camino (Politecnico di Torino, Italy), a DOPO modified resin was cured in the presence of an organically modified montmorrillonite nanoclay (Cloisite 30 B), in an effort to understand the interactions between DOPO and nanoclays and their impact on the flame retardancy of epoxy phenol novolac. The flammability of cured materials was tested using UL- 94 test, LOI and cone calorimetry. The cone calorimeter enables to measure the heat released by the polymeric material under controlled conditions, as well as the gases evolving from the combustion process...|$|E
