40|$|The {{usage of}} the battery power devices in today’s global village has become {{pervasive}} and indispensable in almost every walk of life. The thrust is towards {{reducing the number of}} battery cells, required to decrease cost and size, while minimizing quiescent current flow to increase battery life. An increasing number of low voltage applications require the use of LDOs, which include the growing family of portable battery products. Regulators are required to reduce the large voltage variations of the battery cells to lower and more acceptable levels. Absence of these power supplies can prove to be catastrophic in most high frequency and high performance circuit designs. As a result the demand for lowvoltage, low drop-out regulators are increasing for portable electronics, such as, cellular phones, pagers and laptops. Here the project work deals with complete on-chip voltage regulator with improved transient response. Unlike the conventional LDOs, on-chip capacitance used in this design replaces the need for a large external capacitor allowing greater power system integration for SOC applications. Error amplifier was designed in order to meet high gain and the independent fast path circuit was employed to facilitate the LDO to respond quickly to the sudden load variations. This enabled reduction in the consequent ripple in the output voltage. The fast path was designed to enable easy migration to the other process without much degradation in the performance. The designed LDO provides a constant voltage of 1. 6 V for a input voltage (Line Regulation) range of 1. 8 V to 3. 3 V, beyond which the pass transistor will be in triode region and it would not give a constant voltage of 1. 6 V. Load regulation was achieved at maximum voltage of 1. 598 V where the load resistance (RL) varied from 100 Ω to 1 kΩ. The LDO circuit was implemented in TSMC 0. 18 um CMOS technology. The Quiescent current of 25 uA with a <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>voltage</b> of 200 mV was obtained. Maximum gain of 65 dB and settling time of 6 µsec was obtained due to the two stage op-amp and fast path circuit...|$|E

40|$|On-chip voltage {{regulation}} using distributed Digital Low <b>Drop</b> <b>Out</b> (LDO) <b>voltage</b> regulators {{has been identified}} as a promising technique for efficient power-management for emerging multi-core processors. Digital LDOs (DLDO) can offer low voltage operation, faster transient response, and higher current efficiency. Response time as well as output voltage ripple can be reduced by increasing the speed of the dynamic comparators. However, the comparator offset steeply increases for high clock frequencies, thereby leading to enhanced variations in output voltage. In this work we explore the design of digital LDOs with multiple dynamic comparators that can overcome this bottleneck. In the proposed topology, we apply time-interleaved comparators with the same voltage threshold and uniform current step in order to accomplish the aforementioned features. Simulation based analysis shows that the DLDO with time-interleaved comparators can achieve better overall performance in terms of current efficiency, ripple and settling time. For a load step of 50 mA, a DLDO with 8 time-interleaved comparators could achieve an output ripple of less than 5 mV, while achieving a settling time of less than 0. 5 us. Load current dependant dynamic adjustment of clock frequency is proposed to maintain high current efficiency of ~ 97 %...|$|R
40|$|Low <b>Drop</b> <b>Out</b> (LDO) <b>voltage</b> {{regulators}} {{are commonly used}} to supply low-voltage digital circuits such as microprocessor cores. These digital circuits normally are continuously changing from one mode of operation to another. Therefore, the load demand can change rapidly resulting in large voltage transients at {{the output of the}} regulator which can adversely affect the digital circuitry. In this Master's Thesis, design topologies and challenges of very low-power fully integrated On-Chip Low-Dropout (LDO) regulators have been analyzed. Instead of conventional LDO which makes use of a large external capacitor to have better dynamic response and stability, a CapacitorLess LDO (CL-LDO) is chosen on considerations of smaller area. The most challenging part of designing this kind of regulator is achieving high current efficiency by reducing the quiescent current while ensuring good stability response as well as good regulation performance. Thus, different circuit techniques must be carefully added in order to balance the lack of the large external capacitor having the minimum impact on system efficiency. This work focuses on designing a fully integrated low-dropout regulator with good dynamic performance, high regulation performance and ultra-low power consumption. The stability is achieved by the use of two pole-splitting techniques, namely Cascode and Nested-Miller compensation. The good dynamic response with low quiescent current are achieved by the use of an adaptive biasing circuit, a gm-boost circuit and adaptive power transistor architecture...|$|R
40|$|Low <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (LDO) <b>voltage</b> {{regulators}} {{are widely used}} for post regulating the switching ripples generated by the switched mode power supplies (SMPS). Due to demand for portable applications, industry is pushing for complete system on chip power management solutions. Hence, the switching frequencies of the SMPS are increasing to allow higher level of integration. Therefore, the subsequent post-regulator LDO must have good power supply rejection (PSR) up to switching frequencies of SMPS. Unfortunately, the conventional LDOs have poor PSR at high frequencies. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop novel LDO regulators that can achieve good high frequency PSR performance. In this thesis, two PSR improvement methods are presented. The first method proposes a novel power supply noise-cancelling scheme to improve the PSR of an external-capacitor LDO. The proposed power supply noise-cancelling scheme is designed using adaptive power consumption, thereby not degrading the power efficiency of the LDO. The second method proposes a feed forward ripple cancellation technique to improve the PSR of capacitor-less LDO; also a dynamically powered transient improvement scheme has been proposed. The feed forward ripple cancellation is designed by reusing the load transient improvement block, thus achieving the improvement in PSR with no additional power consumption. Both the projects have been designed in TSMC 0. 18 ?m technology. The first method achieves a PSR of 66 dB up to 1 MHz where as the second method achieves a 55 dB PSR up to 1 MHz...|$|R

Performance issues of IC Low <b>Drop</b> <b>Out</b> (LDO) <b>voltage</b> regulators, with specific reference to stability, are discussed in this thesis. Evaluation of existing frequency compensation schemes and their performances across operating loads is presented. The problem of instability of the LDO voltage regulator at low Electo Static Resistance (ESR) of the load capacitors and the consequences of this problem are highlighted. As a solution to some of the discussed problems, an alternate LDO voltage regulator topology that is stable with low Electro Static Resistance (ESR) capacitive loads is presented. The proposed scheme, instead of relying on the zero generated by the load capacitor and its ESR combination for stability, generates a zero internally. The LDO voltage regulator is implemented and fabricated in AMI 0. 5 mm CMOS technology through MOSIS service. It is demonstrated that this scheme realizes robust frequency compensation, facilitates use of Multi Layer Ceramic Capacitors (MLCC) for load of LDO regulators, and improves transient response and noise performance. Test results from the prototype provide an evaluation of the most important parameters of the regulator: ground current, load regulation, line regulation, output noise and start-up time...|$|R

40|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>out</b> among school {{children}} {{especially at the}} basic school level has over the years gained the attention of many ministries of education, international organizations and scholars in the academia. It is said to inhabit threat to achieving universal primary education (UPE) everywhere, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To some recent studies, the phenomenon of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is said to be}} somewhat responsible for increased crime in some parts of Africa. It is the goal of this study to understand why students <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school in Ghana and also what strategies there are to mitigate it. The study does so by comparing rural <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> to that of the urban as it carried out field work in four schools in five different communities. The study used the qualitative research approach to address what factors there were in causing children to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school and what strategies are laid down by the government, better still the Ghana Education service in reducing <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data from the various stake holders- directors of education, circuit supervisors, head teachers, teachers, parents and most importantly the <b>drop</b> <b>outs</b> themselves. Such data was collected from the four schools in the five communities in both the rural and urban areas chosen for this study. The study investigated six factors as influencing <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> among {{school children}} in the selected areas. It also identified both macro and micro- level strategies for mitigating <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in the rural and urban schools. The study shows how the contextual differences of children, among others can influence their decision to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school. The study indicates that <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> among school children in both rural and urban areas is predominantly caused by poverty, child labour, academic performance, pregnancy, corporal punishment (CP) and school context. The study makes clearer that such factors that cause children to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school are not adequately independent but there are cases where one factor may coincide with the other to bring about <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> decision. It makes explicit that that the individual and institutional related factors of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> sometimes work in connection with one another culminating in <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Like it has been said earlier, macro and micro level strategies are found for mitigating <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in rural and urban schools in Ghana. The macro strategies identified include, school feeding programme, free school uniform distribution and free education. The micro strategies include effective teaching, child safety, child friendly school environment, scholarship, guidance and counseling, introduction of kindergarten, role of NGOs, role of the family, communal by laws, among others.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Student {{intention}} to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is a concern}} for higher education institutions as well for their students. Students with the {{intention to}} <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> may eventually <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> and contribute towards the already high dropout rates, which are causing economic damage. Students leaving their institution have vast financial consequences for their institution, as institutions obtain grants from the government according to their success rates. Although previous {{research has been conducted}} on students’ intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> it is limited, especially when looking at possible predictors that are specific to the South African context. This study contributes towards the gap in research regarding the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The objectives of this study were to 1) conceptualise the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> according to the literature; 2) determine if self-evaluation traits (self-esteem and self-efficacy) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 3) determine if student burnout and student engagement are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 4) determine if social support (social support from parents and general social support) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; and 5) determine if career decision-making difficulties are significant predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> A non-probability quota sample (N = 782) was used to investigate possible predictors of career student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in a sample of university students. Student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> was measured by one item consisting of two categories: I have no intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 501), and I have an intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 280).

Second, we used the <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> data from our database and CD 4 cell count decline rate from another study to estimate the productivity loss due to HIV patients <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Results: lower CD 4 cell count {{was associated with a}} higher probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Support from family/peers, living with family, and diagnosed with TB were associated with lower probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The productivity loss at national level due to treatment <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (consequently, due to CD 4 cell count decline) can reach US$ 365 million (using average wage).
