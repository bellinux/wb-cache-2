40|$|AbstractThe use of {{granular}} pile {{is one of}} {{the effective}} and efficient methods of ground improvement because of its ability in improving the bearing capacity and reducing the settlement of different soft soils. Conventional granular piles cannot be used as tension members to offer resistance under pull out loads. Granular Pile Anchor (GPA) {{is one of the}} recent ground improvement technique in devised for resisting pull out forces. In a granular pile anchor, the footing is anchored to a mild steel plate placed {{at the bottom of the}} granular pile through a reinforcing rod or a cable. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of relative <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> material, granular pile diameter on the pull capacity of the granular pile anchor and the comparison of encased and non-encased granular pile has been done. The laboratory model tests using GPAF system revealed that the pull-out capacity of the granular pile anchor increased with increasing relative density of the granular material. There was a maximum percentage increase of 35 % in the ultimate load when the relative density was increased from 50 to 70 % for 50 mm diameter pile. It was also revealed that the pull-out capacity of the granular pile anchor increased with increasing diameter of the granular pile anchor. The increase of 35 % was also obtained when the diameter was increased from 30 mm to 50 mm at a relative density of 70 %. For the encased pile, maximum increase in the percentage ultimate pullout load was obtained for pile diameter of 30 mm and it was about of 13. 2 %...|$|E

Materials and Methods: A total of 40 mandibular premolars with straight single canals were divided into two groups with 20 each. The root canals were shaped by hand file and Revo-S rotary files to size (25, 0. 06) at the end point, then they filled by Gutta-percha cone and meta-seal sealer. In group A, a single matched cone technique was used to fill the root canals. In group B, a hot lateral condensation using system B instrument at 101 °C was performed.

A nondestructive sorting method was recently proposed in which nanotube bundles are dispersed in water-surfactant solutions and submitted to ultracentrifugation in a density gradient.

The binding energies of SDS and SC on the outer nanotube surface are very similar and depend weakly on diameter. The binding inside the tubes, on the contrary, is strongly diameter dependent: SDS fits best inside tubes with diameters ranging from 8 to 9 angstrom, while SC is best accommodated in larger tubes, with diameters in the range 10. 5 - 12 angstrom.

40|$|Issue: The {{moisture}} content <b>of</b> a <b>fill</b> material will affect its compaction characteristics {{and needs to}} be evaluated during quality control <b>of</b> the <b>fill</b> operation. When the fill is drier than its optimum {{moisture content}}, any moisture in the fill serves as a lubricant and helps the relative movement of the particles when densifying under vibratory compaction.

Hence, moisture content determination constitutes an important part of quality control because the information is used in evaluating the compaction efficiency and material behaviors. Accurate assessment of the moisture content <b>of</b> a <b>fill</b> material is important also because the <b>density</b> requirement <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> is based on the dry <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the material, and the dry density is calculated based on the measurements <b>of</b> wet <b>density</b> corrected for moisture content.
