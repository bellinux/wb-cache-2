"Well now, isn't {{it true that}} wits jump?--that's jist what I was sayin' to meself," [...] remarked O'Riley, {{grinning}} {{from ear}} to ear as he pulled the <b>fur</b> <b>hood</b> farther over his head, crossed his arms more firmly on his breast, and tried to double himself up as he sat there like an overgrown rat. [...] "I wouldn't exchange it with the Lord Mayor o' London and his coach an' six--so I wouldn't. Arrah! have a care, Meetuck, ye baste, or ye'll have us kilt." ...|$|E
60|$|So Diogenes, {{standing}} {{well out}} of sight, watched Gilda as {{she came out of}} the door of the molens and remained for one moment quite still, waiting for the sledge to draw up. She looked fragile this morning, he thought, and her face looked tiny and very pale within the soft frame of the <b>fur</b> <b>hood</b> which covered her head. For a second or two it seemed to him as if she was looking round somewhat anxiously, with a frown upon her smooth forehead--puzzled and almost frightened--as if she expected {{and at the same time}} feared to see some one or something.|$|E
60|$|He crawled {{back over}} the huddled dogs, dusted the dry snow from his furs with the {{whalebone}} beater that Amoraq kept by the door, tapped the skin-lined roof {{of the house to}} shake off any icicles that might have fallen from the dome of snow above, and curled up on the bench. The dogs in the passage snored and whined in their sleep, the boy-baby in Amoraq's deep <b>fur</b> <b>hood</b> kicked and choked and gurgled, and the mother of the newly-named puppy lay at Kotuko's side, her eyes fixed on the bundle of sealskin, warm and safe above the broad yellow flame of the lamp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of importance, M. le Marquis? You almost frighten me." [...] But {{there was}} no fear on the serene little face in its <b>furred</b> <b>hood.</b> It was not for nothing that she had {{graduated}} in the Versailles school of artificialities.|$|R
25|$|Linen caps called coifs {{were worn}} under the <b>fur</b> cap, <b>hood</b> or hat.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, the use of wigs fell into disuse in the West for a {{thousand}} years until they were revived in the 16th century as a means of compensating for hair loss or improving one's personal appearance. They also served a practical purpose: the unhygienic conditions of the time meant that hair attracted head lice, a problem that could be much reduced if natural hair were shaved and replaced with a more easily de-loused artificial hairpiece. <b>Fur</b> <b>hoods</b> were also used in a similar preventative fashion.|$|R
6000|$|An Inuit {{does not}} think of these chances till he is forced to. Kadlu, Kotuko, Amoraq, and the boy-baby who kicked about in Amoraq's <b>fur</b> <b>hood</b> and chewed pieces of blubber all day, were as happy {{together}} as any family in the world. They came of a very gentle race--an Inuit seldom loses his temper, and almost never strikes a child--who did not know exactly what telling a real lie meant, still less how to steal. They were content to spear their living out of {{the heart of the}} bitter, hopeless cold; to smile oily smiles, and tell queer ghost and fairy tales of evenings, and eat till they could eat no more, and sing the endless woman's song: [...] "Amna aya, aya amna, ah! ah!" [...] through the long lamp-lighted days as they mended their clothes and their hunting-gear.|$|E
50|$|The Lord Chief Justice, when robed, dresses like a High Court Judge (see below) {{with the}} {{distinction}} of a train to his scarlet robe. On ceremonial occasions he wears the scarlet and <b>fur</b> <b>hood</b> and mantle, and in addition a gold chain of office {{in the form of}} a collar of esses.|$|E
50|$|On Saturn, human-made {{airships}} {{are shown}} in the distant clouds, overlooked by the planet's colossal rings. On one of the ships, a female explorer gazes out into the distance, wearing an insulated jacket, a <b>fur</b> <b>hood,</b> and a protective mask. As the clouds of Saturn cast reflections on her helmet, which conceals her mouth, she smiles in wonder. Carl Sagan's narration concludes as he states:Maybe it’s a little early. Maybe the time is not quite yet. But those other worlds — promising untold opportunities — beckon. Silently, they orbit the Sun, waiting.|$|E

25|$|The colour and {{lining of}} hoods in {{academic}} dress represents the rank and/or {{faculty of the}} wearer. In many Commonwealth universities bachelors wear hoods edged or lined with white rabbit fur, while masters wear hoods lined with coloured silk (originally ermine or other expensive <b>fur).</b> Doctors' <b>hoods</b> are normally made of scarlet cloth and lined with coloured silk. Faculty colours were introduced by the University of London and many universities followed suit.|$|R

50|$|When, in {{the late}} 1990s, Durham University re-instituted the degree of LL.B. (previously {{associated}} with the Newcastle division and latterly with Newcastle University), it adopted a design of hood which was essentially the old hood reversed (see above) - though for some reason this logic was not followed with the re-instituted LL.M. The old B.C.L. degree was rebranded as M.Jur. {{at about the same}} time - leading to the peculiarity of a <b>fur</b> <b>hood</b> being worn with a master's gown for this degree. As a research degree of 50,000 words, the thesis requirement of the M.Jur is greater than that required for the LL.M.|$|E
25|$|Women’s parkas in the Yukon River {{area were}} longer than men's, with rounded hems and side splits that reached {{almost to the}} waist. Farther south along the Kuskokwim River, parkas of both sexes {{extended}} to the ankles and were usually hoodless, requiring that a separate <b>fur</b> cap or <b>hood</b> be worn. Kuskokwim styles of parka decoration were far more elaborate.|$|R
60|$|With {{a wave of}} his candle {{all three}} miracles were wrought,--for the snow- flakes turned to a white <b>fur</b> cloak and <b>hood</b> on Effie's head and shoulders, a bowl of hot soup came sailing to her lips, and {{vanished}} when she had eagerly drunk the last drop; and suddenly the dismal field changed to a new world so full of wonders that all her troubles were forgotten in a minute.|$|R
50|$|The M-65 {{fishtail}} parka has a detachable {{hood and}} was the last revision. It features a removable quilted liner made of light nylon / polyester batting which are modern synthetic materials. The M-65 fishtail parka first came into production in 1968.These parkas featured synthetic <b>fur</b> on the <b>hoods</b> after an outcry from the fur lobby. As a result, only hoods for these parkas made in 1972 and for one year later have real fur.|$|R
5000|$|Canada Goose Inc. is a Canadian {{manufacturer}} of winter clothing. The company {{was founded in}} 1957 by Sam Tick, under the name Metro Sportswear Ltd. Canada Goose manufactures {{a wide range of}} jackets, parkas, vests, hats, gloves, shells and other apparel. Some Canada Goose jackets use coyote <b>fur</b> on the <b>hoods</b> and are often filled with down which is purchased from Hutterite farmers in rural Canada". Duck down is used for most models. The jackets retail between $600 and $1,275; the [...] "Kensington", its best-selling women's coat, retails for approximately $745.|$|R
2500|$|The hood was {{originally}} a functional garment, worn {{to shield the}} head from the elements. In the English tradition, it has developed to an often bright and decorative garment worn only on special occasions. [...] Hoods comprise two basic patterns: full shape or simple shape. The traditional full-shape hood consists of a cape, cowl, and liripipe, as is used at Cambridge. At Oxford, the bachelors' and masters' hoods use simple hoods that have lost their cape and retain only the cowl and liripipe. [...] The colour and lining of hoods in academic dress represents the rank and/or faculty of the wearer. In many Commonwealth universities bachelors wear hoods edged or lined with white rabbit fur, while masters wear hoods lined with coloured silk (originally ermine or other expensive <b>fur).</b> Doctors' <b>hoods</b> are normally made of scarlet cloth and lined with coloured silk.

50|$|Originally {{introduced}} in olive green shade 107, {{it is now}} produced in a large variety of colors and patterns, including military camouflage. The frontmost portion of the jacket has two large hip pockets and two medium-sized breast pockets. The rearmost neck portion and collar of the jacket features a zipper which houses a protective hood. The M-1965 field jacket can be combined with a button-in insulated lining for cold-weather wear, {{as well as a}} button on <b>fur</b> trimmed winter <b>hood.</b> It was made by Alpha Industries, and John Ownbey Co., inc. as well as other companies like Propper, Golden Manufacturing and many more, for the military.|$|R
5000|$|The outer {{hood of the}} M-51 Fishtail Parka is {{integral}} to the parka shell, an added hood liner {{as well as a}} button in main liner make the M-51 a versatile 3 piece parka.The idea behind this 3 part system was to enable a more customisable parka that allowed for easier cleaning of the shell as the <b>hood</b> <b>fur</b> was on the detachable hood liner, not fixed to the shell as in the M-48. It also allowed for both liners to be buttoned in or our depending on the temperature and hence warmth required. It was also cheaper than the M-48 to mass-produceThe early M-51 was made of heavy sateen cotton, the same material as the M-48. Later revisions of the M-51 were poplin based. The later liners were also revised from the [...] "heavy when wet" [...] wool pile to a lighter woolen loop or frieze wool design that dried easier and were far lighter. The frieze liners were constructed of mohair and were designed using a double loop system which repelled cold weather.|$|R
60|$|Madame de Bellaise was a fine-looking {{woman of}} forty, {{in a high}} state of preservation, owing to the healthy life she had led. Her eyes were of brilliant, {{beautiful}} black her complexion had a glow, her hair--for she wore it visibly--formed crisp rolls of jetty ringlets on her temples, almost hiding her close white cap. The heavy thick veil was tucked back beneath the <b>furred</b> purple silk <b>hood</b> that fastened under her chin. The white robes of her order were not of serge, but of the finest cloth, and were almost hidden by a short purple cloak with sleeves, likewise lined and edged with fur, and fastened on the bosom with a gold brooch. Her fingers, bearing more rings than the signet of her house, were concealed in embroidered gauntlets of Spanish leather. One of them held an ivory-handled riding-rod, the other the reins of the well-fed jennet, on which the lady, on a fine afternoon, late in the Carnival, was cantering home through the lanes of the Bocage, after a successful morning's hawking among the wheat-ears. She was attended {{by a pair of}} sisters, arrayed somewhat in the same style, and by a pair of mounted grooms, the falconer with his charge having gone home by a footway.|$|R
