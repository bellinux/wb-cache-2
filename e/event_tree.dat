Tali's romance <b>event</b> <b>tree</b> was added in Mass Effect 2 due to fan demand and her ability to express human emotion.

They were aware that either decision would likely annoy some people, and that no reveal could universally fit all views of Tali. BioWare wished to unveil her face in a [...] "tasteful way" [...] outside of the game engine, and decided that a gift from Tali would be the best way.

40|$|<b>Event</b> <b>trees</b> are a {{graphical}} {{model of a}} set of possible situations and the possible paths going through them, from the initial situation to the terminal situations. With each situation, there is associated a local uncertainty model that represents beliefs about the next situation. The uncertainty models can be classical, precise probabilities; they can also be of a more general, imprecise probabilistic type, in which case they can be seen as sets of classical probabilities (yielding probability intervals). To work with such <b>event</b> <b>trees,</b> we must combine these local uncertainty models. We show this can be done efficiently by back-propagation through the tree, both for precise and imprecise probabilistic models, and we illustrate this using an imprecise probabilistic counterpart of the classical Markov chain. This allows us to perform a robustness analysis for Markov chains very efficiently...|$|R

50|$|<b>Event</b> <b>tree</b> {{analysis}} {{can be used}} in risk assessment by determining the probability that is used to determine the risk when multiplied by the hazard of the event. <b>Event</b> <b>Tree</b> Analysis is a tool that makes easy to see what pathway is creating the greatest probability of failure for a specific system. It is common to find single point failures that do not have any intervening events between the initiating event and a failure. With <b>Event</b> <b>Tree</b> Analysis single point failure can be targeted to include an intervening step that will reduce the overall probability of failure and thus reducing the risk of the system. The idea of adding an intervening event can happen anywhere in the system for any pathway that generates too great of a risk, the added intermediate event can reduce the probability and thus reduce the risk.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall goal}} of <b>event</b> <b>tree</b> {{analysis}} {{is to determine}} the probability of possible negative outcomes that can cause harm and result from the chosen initiating event. It is necessary to use detailed information about a system to understand intermediate events, accident scenarios, and initiating events to construct the <b>event</b> <b>tree</b> diagram. The <b>event</b> <b>tree</b> begins with the initiating event where consequences of this event follow in a binary (success/failure) manner. Each event creates a path in which a series of successes or failures will occur where the overall probability of occurrence for that path can be calculated. The probabilities of failures for intermediate events can be calculated using fault tree analysis and the probability of success can be calculated from 1 = probability of success(ps) + probability of failure (pf). For example, in the equation 1 = (ps) + (pf) if we know that pf=.1 from fault tree analysis then through simple algebra we can solve for ps where ps = (1) - (pf) then we would have ps = (1) - (.1) and ps=.9.|$|E

40|$|Graphical models {{provide a}} very {{promising}} avenue for {{making sense of}} large, complex datasets. The most popular graphical models in use at the moment are Bayesian networks (BNs). This thesis shows, however, they are not always ideal factorisations of a system. Instead, I advocate {{for the use of}} a relatively new graphical model, the chain event graph (CEG), that is based on <b>event</b> <b>trees.</b> <b>Event</b> <b>trees</b> directly represent graphically the event space of a system. Chain event graphs reduce their potentially huge dimensionality by taking into account identical probability distributions on some of the <b>event</b> <b>tree’s</b> subtrees, with the added benefits of showing the conditional independence relationships of the system — {{one of the advantages of}} the Bayesian network representation that <b>event</b> <b>trees</b> lack — and implementation of causal hypotheses that is just as easy, and arguably more natural, than is the case with Bayesian networks, with a larger domain of implementation using purely graphical means. The trade-off for this greater expressive power, however, is that model specification and selection are much more difficult to undertake with the larger set of possible models for a given set of variables. My thesis is the first exposition of how to learn CEGs. I demonstrate that not only is conjugate (and hence quick) learning of CEGs possible, but I characterise priors that imply conjugate updating based on very reasonable assumptions that also have direct Bayesian network analogues. By re-casting CEGs as partition models, I show how established partition learning algorithms can be adapted for the task of learning CEGs. I then develop a robust yet flexible prediction machine based on CEGs for any discrete multivariate time series — the dynamic CEG model — which combines the power of CEGs, multi-process and steady modelling, lattice theory and Occam’s razor. This is also an exact method that produces reliable predictions without requiring much a priori modelling. I then demonstrate how easily causal analysis can be implemented with this model class that can express a wide variety of causal hypotheses. I end with an application of these techniques to real educational data, drawing inferences that would not have been possible simply using BNs.
