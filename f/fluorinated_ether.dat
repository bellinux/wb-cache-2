40|$|Polymeric perfluoroalkylethers {{are being}} {{considered}} for use as lubricants in high temperature applications, but have been observed to catalytically decompose {{in the presence of}} metals. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) were used to explore the decomposition of three model <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethers</b> on clean polycrystalline iron surfaces and iron surfaces chemically modified with oxygen. Low temperature adsorption of the model <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethers</b> on the clean, oxygen modified and oxidized iron surfaces was molecular. Thermally activated defluorination of the three model compounds was observed on the clean iron surface at remarkably low temperatures, 155 K and below, with formation of iron fluoride. Preferential C-F bond scission occurred at the terminal fluoromethoxy, CF 3 O, of perfluoro- 1 -methoxy- 2 -ethoxy ethane and perfluoro- 1 -methoxy- 2 -ethoxy propane and at CF 3 /CF 2 O of perfluoro- 1, 3 -diethoxy propane. The reactivity of the clean iron toward perfluoroalkylether decomposition when compared to other metals is due to the strength of the iron fluoride bond and the strong electron donating ability of the metallic iron. Chemisorption of an oxygen overlayer lowered the reactivity of the iron surface to the adsorption and decomposition of the three model <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethers</b> by blocking active sites on the metal surface. Incomplete coverage of the iron surface with chemisorbed oxygen results in a reaction which resembles the defluorination reaction observed on the clean iron surface. Perfluoro- 1 -methoxy- 2 -ethoxy ethane reacts on the oxidized iron surface at 138 K, through a Lewis acid assisted cleavage of the carbon oxygen bond, with preferential attack at the terminal fluoromethoxy, CF 3 O.

Temperature programmed desorption shows no contribution of PFDEM toward nickel fluoride on an NiF{sub 2 } surface obtained by CF{sub 3 }I adsorption. Higher coverages of nickel fluoride do not show any evidence of NiF{sub 2 } contribution from PFDEM. The results do not agree with the idea that a fluorinated surface might induce decomposition of PFPEs, leading to addition fluoride formation on the surface. The metal fluoride bond strength is not a legitimate concern for decomposition of PFE lubricants. Impurity in PFPEs might be the cause of initial surface fluoridation leading to breakdown of PFPEs which could cause additional metal fluoride formation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of organic working fluid {{has entered the}} environment protection era. Ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP) are two most important indices of the organic working fluid. Nowadays, more and more {{attention has been paid}} to GWP. The calculation of GWP is an extremely complicated process which involves interactions between surface and atmosphere such as atmospheric radiative transfer and atmospheric chemical reactions. GWP of a substance is related to its atmospheric abundance and is a variable in itself. However, radiative efficiency is an intermediate parameter for GWP calculation and it is a constant value used to describe inherent property of a substance. In this paper, the group contribution method was adopted to estimate the radiative efficiency of the organic substance which contains more than one carbon atom. In most cases, the estimation value and the standard value are in a good agreement and most errors are less than 20 %, and the biggest estimation error occurs in the estimation of the radiative efficiency of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethers</b> which contains several carbon atoms because of the complicated structure of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethers</b> compared with hydrocarbon. This estimation method can be used to predict the radiative efficiency of newly developed organic working fluids and its accuracy can meet the requirement of engineering application...|$|R

In striking contrast to other electrolytes, the FEC-PFE electrolyte allows the rapid charging of high-density LNMO cathodes and graphite anodes at high rates.

The anesthetic or TFE (0. 2 1 dkg) caused decreased white blood cell counts, necrosis of bone marrow and lymphocytes, and decreased small intestine dry weight and was associated with septicemia. To elucidate the mechanism of TFE toxicity in rats we undertook histopathologic, ultrastructural and bacteriologic studies. TFE produced severe edema of intestinal lamina propria and submucosae, dilatation of crypts, loss of surface epithelium, vacuolation and necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the edematous lamina propria. Intestinal epithelial villi lost their cellular tissue integrity. Coccobacillary organisms were numerous in the ulcerated intestine. Hemolytic E. coli were isolated from intestinal tissue at a two-log increase in concentration relative to controls. Hemograms from TFE-treated rats exhibited marked leukopenia and morphologic differences. The platelets lost their discoid shape, extended pseudopods, and centralizing granules. Hemoglobin precipitation as Heinz bodies and crystalloid structures was observed in TFE-treated rats.

Dimethyl ether is a proposed diesel fuel substitute. Concerns about mobile source emissions and their impact on urban tropospheric ozone formation have spurred research into alternative fuels. The <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethers</b> are proposed CFC/HFC replacements in refrigeration applications. Attractive features of these ethers include the absence of chlorine and the incorporation of hydrogen, which will allow for degradation to begin in the troposphere. ^ Dimethyl ether has a short atmospheric lifetime of five days. Dimethyl ether degrades solely in the troposphere and will thus not impact stratospheric ozone. The short atmospheric lifetime and weak infrared absorption properties make dimethyl ether benign toward global climate. The atmospheric oxidation of dimethyl ether is predicted to result in the formation of methyl formate, formaldehyde, formic acid anhydride, and formic acid. E 143 a is dominated by the tropospheric degradation of hydroxyl radical having an atmospheric lifetime of less than 4. 7 years. It is unlikely to interact with the ozone layer and has moderate global warming properties. E 134 and E 125 react slowly with tropospheric hydroxyl radical. E 134 and E 125 have lifetimes of 29. 7 and 165 years with respect to OH loss, respectively. Both species will have substantial concentrations in the stratosphere and may be removed through reaction with O(1 D). E 125 is a severe global warming agent. The oxidation of E 143 a, E 134, and E 125 ultimately results in the formation of carbonyl fluoride, CF 2 O. E 216 contains a double bond and thus undergoes a very fast hydroxyl radical addition reaction in the troposphere. E 216 has a very short lifetime of 4 days and is thus neither a threat to stratospheric ozone nor a global warming agent. The incorporation of a double bond in a molecule represents a new molecular structure framework from which future CFC replacements can be generated. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{attempting}} to develop energy storage systems possessing superior properties to traditional lithium ion batteries (LIBs), numerous alternative chemistries have undergone study and development. Of these, the lithium-sulfur battery seems {{one of the}} more promising contenders for replacing LIBs, particularly for applications like electric vehicles. Nevertheless, a variety of limitations have prevented lithium-sulfur battery introduction to the marketplace, in spite of almost fifty years of research, including polysulfide shuttle, reactivity of the electrolyte, and anodic microstructure evolution. This thesis will explore the use of first-principles computational techniques in understanding the impact of electrolyte composition, polysulfide molecules, and lithium crystal structure on the reactions taking place near the lithium anode in order to better address the problems facing lithium-sulfur batteries. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), in conjunction with static density functional theory (DFT) optimizations, Bader charge analysis, and additional analytical techniques, the interactions and impacts of the different components of the typical lithium-sulfur battery can be examined on a molecular basis. It is the author?s hope that a better theoretical understanding of how these species behave will enable design and implementation of real-world lithium-sulfur systems capable of meeting and overcoming the difficulties facing their commercialization. In order to test the effects of lithium crystal structure on electrolyte stability and surface morphology evolution, both a (100) and (110) lithium metal surface were created and tested using AIMD simulations. There was a minimal difference in the results for each structure, in both the surface morphology and ratio of solvent molecules reduced by the lithium. In testing the effects and stability of various solvents, it was found that ethylene carbonate reduced readily, while dioxolane, dimethoxyethane, and <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ether</b> molecules were quite stable {{in the presence of the}} anode. AIMD simulations of polysulfide molecules in the vicinity of the lithium surface show high reactivity, as seen experimentally, and subsequent DFT calculations indicate the reduction of long-chain polysulfide molecules in the presence of Li atoms is a thermodynamically favorable reaction pathway.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry is currently {{faced with the}} problem of the use and emissions of strong global warming compounds, known as perfluorocompounds (PFCs) for dielectric etch applications. The release of global warming compounds from this and other sources is suspected to result in changes in the earth's climate and weather patterns. Quantitative targets for emissions reduction set by the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) makes it urgent to find a solution to this issue. A long-term means of approaching this problem is to find and develop alternative chemistries that are more environmentally benign without sacrificing performance. Several classes of chemistries have been investigated to date, including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), iodofluorocarbons (IFCs), and NF 3 /hydrocarbons. One class of chemistries that have shown considerable promise is the unsaturated fluorocarbons (UFCs). The research documented herein uses the UFCs to assess etch process and emissions performance. Not only are these novel chemistries tested on conventional silicon dioxide films, but also on new low-k dielectrics that are likely candidates for future generation process flows. Emissions and process performance are reported for each of the different gases. The prospects for integration of some of these chemistries to next generation processes are good from both a process and emissions standpoint. The UFCs are not strong greenhouse gases {{as a result of their}} short atmospheric lifetimes (typically less than a day). Unlike many of the previous alternative chemistries studied, the emissions from UFCs are due to reformation of reactive products into strong global warming gases, specifically PFCs and HFCs, in the plasma environment. In this work, the formation of plasma effluents has been studied. (cont.) In this work, the formation of plasma effluents has been studied. These reformation products are not only a result of the reformation of reactive species from the breakup of the feed gas, but also a result of the interaction of the plasma with surfaces in the etch chamber, including the wafer being etched. Process performance has been assessed by performing cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Emissions data have been collected using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In-situ process monitoring methods such as optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and residual gas analysis (RGA) have been used in some experiments. Ex-situ studies of fluorocarbon deposited films have been performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).

40|$|International audiencePartially <b>fluorinated</b> poly(arylene <b>ether</b> sulfone) {{multiblock}} copolymers bearing perfluorosulfonic functions (ps-PES-FPES), with ionic {{exchange capacity}} (IEC) ranging between 0. 9 and 1. 5 meq H+/g, are synthesized by regioselective bromination of partially <b>fluorinated</b> poly(arylene <b>ether</b> sulfone) multiblock copolymers (PES-FPES), followed by Ullman coupling reaction with lithium 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrafluoro- 2 -(1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrafluoro- 2 -iodoethoxy) ethanesulfonate. The PES-FPES are prepared by aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction by an original approach, that is, one pot two reactions synthesis. The chemical structures of polymers are analyzed by H- 1 and F- 19 NMR spectroscopy. The resulted ionomers present two distinct glass transitions and relaxations revealing phase {{separation between the}} hydrophilic and the hydrophobic domains. The phase separation is observed at much lower block lengths of ps-PES-FPES {{as compared with the}} literature. AFM and SANS observations supported the phase separation, the hydrophilic domains are well dispersed but the connectivity to each other depends on the ps-PES block lengths. The thermomechanical behavior, the water up-take, and the conductivity of the ps-PES-FPES membranes are compared with those of Nafion 117 ((R)) and randomly functionalized polysulfone (ps-PES). Conductivities close or higher to those of Nafion 117 ((R)) are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Solvent plays a {{major role}} in {{determining}} the nature of discharge products and the extent of rechargeability of the nonaqueous lithium-air (oxygen) battery. Here we investigate chemical stability for a number of aprotic solvents against superoxide, including N,N-dialkyl amides, aliphatic and aromatic nitriles, oxygenated phosphorus (V) compounds, substituted 2 -oxazolidinones, and <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethers.</b> The free energy barriers for nucleophilic attack by superoxide and the C-H acidity constants in dimethyl sulfoxide are reported, which provide a theoretical framework for computational screening of stable solvents for Li-air batteries. Theoretical results are complemented by cyclic voltammetry to study the electrochemical reversibility of the O 2 /O 2 − couple containing tetrabutylammonium salt and GCMS measurements to monitor solvent stability in the presence of KO 2 and a Li salt. Excellent agreement among all quantum chemical, electrochemical, and chemical methods has been obtained in evaluating solvent stability against superoxide. The combined theoretical and experimental methodology provides a comprehensive testing ground to identify electrolyte solvents stable in the air cathode. Based upon this knowledge we report on the use of an amide-based electrolyte for rechargeable oxygen electrodes in Li-O 2 secondary cells...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{copolymerization}} of ethylene (E) with 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyl {{vinyl ether}} (FAVE 8) by oxidative addition of salicylaldimine ligand to bis(1, 5 -cyclooctadiene) nickel(0) /methylaluminoxane (MAO) {{at room temperature}} and at different ethylene pressures is reported. The homopolymerization of ethylene {{is known to be}} highly active with this catalyst in contrast to the <b>fluorinated</b> vinyl <b>ether</b> which does not homopolymerize. The copolymerization of E with FAVE 8 led to linear poly(E-co-FAVE 8) statistic copolymers that were characterized by means of various techniques. The obtained copolymers, characterized by FT-IR and solid state NMR spectroscopy, showed a small incorporation of the <b>fluorinated</b> vinyl <b>ether.</b> Three copolymerization reactions were investigated with different ethylene pressures (5, 10 and 50 bar) and the copolymer compositions indicated that the content of FAVE 8 units depends on the ethylene pressure. The lower this pressure, the higher the content of such a fluorinated comonomer and for a 50 bar-pressure, no FAVE 8 was incorporated. Thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analyses of these resulting copolymers exhibited high thermal stability, the thermal degradation starting from ca. 300 8 C whereas high melting point (Tm = 129 8 C) were achieved with these copolymers. Original films processed from these poly(E-co-FAVE 8) copolymers illustrated hydrophobic and oleophilic characters as evidenced by water and diiodomethane contact angles of 1048 and 498, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSynthesis of photocrosslinkable {{fluorinated}} polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) {{was carried}} out through the direct hydrosilylation of allyl 2 -(perfluorohexyl) ethyl ether with copoly(dimethyl methyl hydro siloxane). The hydrosilylation of the <b>fluorinated</b> allyl <b>ether</b> allowed the introduction of fluorinated groups onto the polysiloxane backbone. Then, a second hydrosilylation of allyl methacrylate led to PDMS bearing both fluorinated and photocrosslinkable groups. The ratio between fluorinated groups and allyl methacrylate groups allowed us to tune the refractive index of the resin without changing thermal properties. Formulations containing fluorinated PDMS were ultraviolet-cured, and their ultraviolet transparency and Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG) laser resistance were investigated...|$|R
