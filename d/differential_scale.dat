40|$|Measurement is a {{fundamental}} issue in management research. However, traditional scale development methods have the drawback of mixing researchers' bias with the scale design. Based on Ding et al. 's (2007) exploratory work, {{a new way to}} develop semantic <b>differential</b> measurement <b>scales</b> is proposed and tested with a survey {{in the context of the}} construction industry. The purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a new method to develop semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> for measurement while the bias from their own perspective can be reduced. The reliability and validity of semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> according to the new method are tested with SPSS and Amos 6. 0. The results show that the generated semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> with this method have high reliability and validity. The new way to develop semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> offers researchers and practitioners one more choice of scale development.

The objective of this research is to fill this gap between theoretical findings and methodological practices by importing a tool from psychological researches: the Evaluative Space Grid (Larsen et al., 2009). This grid provides a single item measure of positivity and negativity through a 25 cells grid. In an empirical study, we compare the construct and predictive validity of this tool to the traditional semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales.</b> Results show that satisfaction measured with Evaluative Space Grid offer a better predictive validity of behavioral intentions, capturing separately indifferent and mixed evaluations...|$|R
50|$|Hydrophobicity scales {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by calculating the solvent accessible surface areas for amino acid residues in the expended polypeptide chain or in alpha-helix and multiplying the surface areas by the empirical solvation parameters for the corresponding types of atoms. A differential solvent accessible surface area hydrophobicity scale based on proteins as compacted networks near a critical point, due to self-organization by evolution, was constructed based on asymptotic power-law (self-similar) behavior. This scale {{is based on a}} bioinformatic survey of 5526 high-resolution structures from the Protein Data Bank. This <b>differential</b> <b>scale</b> has two comparative advantages: (1) it is especially useful for treating changes in water-protein interactions that are too small to be accessible to conventional force-field calculations, and (2) for homologous structures, it can yield correlations with changes in properties from mutations in the amino acid sequences alone, without determining corresponding structural changes, either in vitro or in vivo.|$|E
5000|$|Obtaining {{input data}} - For example, :- Respondents are asked {{a series of}} questions. For each product pair, {{they are asked to}} rate {{similarity}} (usually on a 7-point Likert scale from very similar to very dissimilar). The first question could be for Coke/Pepsi for example, the next for Coke/Hires rootbeer, the next for Pepsi/Dr Pepper, the next for Dr Pepper/Hires rootbeer, etc. The number of questions {{is a function of the}} number of brands and can be calculated as [...] where Q is the number of questions and N is the number of brands. This approach is referred to as the “Perception data : direct approach”. There are two other approaches. There is the “Perception data : derived approach” in which products are decomposed into attributes that are rated on a semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale.</b> The other is the “Preference data approach” in which respondents are asked their preference rather than similarity.|$|E
50|$|Good quality {{measures}} need to {{have high}} satisfaction loadings, good reliability, and low error variances. In an empirical study comparing commonly used satisfaction measures {{it was found that}} two multi-item semantic differential scales performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian service consumption contexts. A study by Wirtz & Lee (2003), found that a six-item 7-point semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale</b> (for example, Oliver and Swan 1983), which is a six-item 7-point bipolar scale, consistently performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian services. It loaded most highly on satisfaction, had the highest item reliability, and had by far the lowest error variance across both studies. In the study, the six items asked respondents’ evaluation of their most recent experience with ATM services and ice cream restaurant, along seven points within these six items: “pleased me to displeased me”, “contented with to disgusted with”, “very satisfied with to very dissatisfied with”, “did a good job for me to did a poor job for me”, “wise choice to poor choice” and “happy with to unhappy with”. A semantic differential (4 items) scale (e.g., Eroglu and Machleit 1990), which is a four-item 7-point bipolar scale, was the second best performing measure, which was again consistent across both contexts. In the study, respondents were asked to evaluate their experience with both products, along seven points within these four items: “satisfied to dissatisfied”, “favorable to unfavorable”, “pleasant to unpleasant” and “I like it very much to I didn’t like it at all”. The third best scale was single-item percentage measure, a one-item 7-point bipolar scale (e.g., Westbrook 1980). Again, the respondents were asked to evaluate their experience on both ATM services and ice cream restaurants, along seven points within “delighted to terrible”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) {{is a well-known}} technique for transmission of high rate data over broadband frequency-selective channels that mitigates intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by the delay spread of wireless channels. Space Frequency Block Coded technique (SFBC) is a spatial diversity technique used to achieve full transmission diversity with higher capacity. The major drawbacks of OFDM are high Bit Error Rate (BER) and high Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Spacefrequency block coded OFDM system (SFBC-OFDM) is used to reduce the BER and transmit the data. In this paper, the performance of BER vs. SNR in normal OFDM is {{compared to that of}} SFBC-OFDM systems using simulation. Simulation results show that the BER in SFBC-OFDM is less than that in normal OFDM. Selective Mapping (SLM) is used as the existing system. In this technique, the minimum PAPR signal is selected and transmitted by generating different representations of OFDM symbols using different phase sequences. Here, the thesis gives an idea to reduce the PAPR using Clipping and <b>differential</b> <b>scaling.</b> The simulation results show that clipping and <b>differential</b> <b>scaling</b> effectively reduces the PAPR...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} an {{understanding}} of the information seeking process for image documents by focusing on needs for connotative messages. For this purpose, this study attempted to investigate and compare three stages of the image search process in terms of use of image attributes. The three stages of the image search process are identified as initiation, representation and selection, and image attribute levels are defined as color, denotative, and connotative attributes. Data was collected from a survey questionnaire composed of Likert scales, open questionnaires, and Semantic <b>Differential</b> <b>scales.</b> The study found that while color, denotative, and connotative attributes were all considered important by users, color itself did not have critical impact during the representing and selecting stages. Denotative and connotative attributes were important across the overall search process and users employed diverse denotative and connotative terms for finding a satisfactory image under a given task. This study also demonstrated that affective attributes of an image can be represented with reduced dimensions using Semantic <b>Differential</b> <b>scales,</b> and that reduced dimensions can be used to indicate more meaningful and relevant images...|$|R

The purpose of this political communication study is to explore in detail and describe various "attitude" profiles of voters and resulting candidate "images" of the 1972 presidential election. These "attitudes" and "images" are determined {{through the use of}} three primary research instruments: the semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale,</b> the Method of Ordered Alternatives, and the political philosophy continuum. In addition to these, a record of actual voting behavior serves as validating support of the measured attitudes. This study deals with "attitudes" toward and candidate "images" of George McGovern, R.
