5|$|Although Jinnah {{initially}} opposed separate electorates for Muslims, he {{used this}} means to gain his first elective office in 1909, as Bombay's Muslim representative on the Imperial Legislative Council.

Two years later, the measure passed, the first act sponsored by non-officials to pass the council and be <b>enacted</b> <b>by</b> the Viceroy.

One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had an Organic Act <b>enacted</b> <b>by</b> Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been <b>enacted</b> <b>by</b> Congress.
