40|$|Introduction. Among {{the citrus}} species, C. sinensis {{has been the}} most studied given its {{importance}} in terms of production and its industrial application in <b>juices.</b> Some of <b>orange</b> <b>juice's</b> organoleptic and functional properties, which make it an attractive product for the consumer, are due to its carotenoid composition. Xanthophylls can be found in either their free form (as the carotenes are found) or in a more stable fatty acid esterified form in the case of mono and polyhydroxylated xanthophylls. Detection of adulteration of <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> is of concern to consumers, regulatory agencies and citrus processing industries, and the study of carotenoid ester composition has been proposed to evaluate fruit products' authenticity. In this study, we report on the native (carotenoid esters and free carotenoids) carotenoid profile of <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> of eight different varieties. Materials and methods. Monovarietal <b>fresh</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> were obtained from squeezing mid-season oranges (Citrus sinensis varieties: Bionda, Brasiliana, Moro, Ovale, Sanguinello, Tarocco, Valenc e and Washington) cultivated and supplied by a local producer. After the extraction of the carotenoids from the samples, the analyses were carried out by HPLC-DAD-APCI-MS. Results and discussion. The results showed that, in the juices st udied, the xanthophylls were mostly esterified (93 % of the total carotenoid mean content). The different varieties investigated showed variations in their carotenoid contents. The total carotenoid contents ranged from 2. 42 μg·g – 1 in the Washington variety to 15. 8 μg·g – 1 in the Valencia variety. Among the monoesters, the Valencia variety showed the highest violaxanthin ester amounts (61 %), the Brasiliana variety showed the highest  -cryptoxanthin ester content (86. 9 %) and the Tarocco variety had the highest luteoxanthin ester amount (75. 7 %). Moreover, in general, in the Brasiliana, Ovale, Sanguinello, Valencia and Washington varieties, the monoester contents were higher than the diesters, whereas in the Bionda, Moro and Tarocco varieties the opposite was determined. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that this analytical approach has been applied to characterising, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the whole carotenoid pattern (carotenoid esters and free carotenoids) in <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> from the Bionda, Bras iliana, Moro, Ovale, Sanguinello, Tarocco, Valence and Washington varieties. This contribution could also be used to establish authenticity markers among orange varieties that could potentially be used to prevent adulteration. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of post {{processing}} quality loss was conducted after high pressure processing (600 MPa, 40 degrees C, 4 min) or thermal pasteurisation (80 degrees C, 60 s) of <b>fresh</b> Navel <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> Selection of processing conditions was mainly based on pectin methylesterase inactivation. Ascorbic acid loss, colour, viscosity and sensory characteristics were measured during storage at different isothermal conditions (0 - 30 degrees C). Increased shelf life (based oil ascorbic acid retention) was achieved for high pressurised compared to thermally pasteurised juice, ranging from 49 % (storage at 15 degrees C) to 112 % (storage at 0 degrees C). Activation energy values for ascorbic acid loss were 68. 5 and 53. 1 kJ/mol, respectively, for high pressurised and thermally treated juice. High pressure processing resulted in better retention of flavour of untreated juice and superior sensory characteristics compared to thermal pasteurisation. Colour change was linearly correlated to ascorbic acid loss for {{both types of}} processing. Slightly higher apparent viscosity values were determined for high pressurised juice.

Besides there are a few studies about the inactivation of naturally grown microorganisms by using UV-C treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of UV-C treatment on the inactivation of Escherichia coli K 12 inoculated into white grape juice and naturally grown microorganisms in the <b>fresh</b> squeezed <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> Also, the effect of UV light on the colors of the products was determined. The data were evaluated considering the properties of the juices. Results of microbiological analysis of white grape juice showed that, maximum log reduction was more than 5 -log CFU/mL at a UV dose of 75. 04 mJ/cm 2 when the inoculation rate was 5. 73 (l 20. 114) log CFU/mL. Although a 5 -log reduction requirement of FDA was satisfied with white grape juice, maximum log reduction for the naturally grown microorganisms in <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> was only 1. 76 -log CFU/mL even if the sample was subjected to UV dose of 144. 36 mJ/cm 2. Color analysis demonstrated that <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> color was not affected from the treatment. For white grape juice, increased UV dose caused a decrease in a* value indicating slightly more green region. Also, increased intensity and sample depth had a pronounced effect on b* value of the juice showing yellow region. As a conclusion, UV-C light can be used as an alternative technique in processing of white grape juice.
