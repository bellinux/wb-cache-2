40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{a valuable}} but forgotten resource in automatic terminology processing (ATP) : <b>glossaries.</b> It argues that <b>glossaries</b> are widely available, {{especially on the}} Internet, and that they contain valuable terminological knowledge which can be exploited by automatic procedures. The empirical analysis {{of a set of}} <b>glossaries</b> collected from the Internet substantiates these arguments. The paper also presents a method to extract knowledge patterns from <b>glossaries.</b> An evaluation is then performed showing the usefulness of the extracted patterns in ATP. In two experimented domains, the improvements are 5 % and 16 % over f-measures respectively. The paper concludes that <b>glossaries</b> should be further studied and exploited.

To the 6th edition in 1883, Eddy added with a Key to the Scriptures (later retitled with Key to the Scriptures), a 20-page <b>glossary</b> containing her definitions of biblical terms. The book sold 15,000 copies between 1875 and 1885.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the <b>Glossary</b> of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's birthdate is unknown. Together {{with his}} cousin Nigel he was educated at Laon, under the {{schoolmaster}} Anselm of Laon, {{and returned to}} England at some unknown date. The historian Martin Brett feels that Alexander probably served as a royal chaplain early in his career, although no sources support this conjecture. Alexander was an archdeacon in the diocese of Salisbury by 1121, under his uncle. While occupying that office he was credited with a writing a <b>glossary</b> of Old English legal terms in the Anglo Norman language, entitled the Expositiones Vocabulorum. Unlike his cousin Nigel, Alexander {{does not appear to}} have entered the king's household or administration before his appointment as a bishop, and only attested, or witnessed, one royal charter before his elevation to the episcopate in 1123.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} by School Library Journal, Smith's {{encyclopedia}} was praised for its reference value. The review called the encyclopedia comprehensive, and noted it contained helpful appendices including a <b>glossary,</b> lists of executive staff {{members of the}} CIA, and a large bibliography and index. Booklist commented in its review that the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Language Council (Språkrådet) is the {{official}} regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language, as for instance the Académie française does for French. However, many organizations and agencies {{require the use of}} the council's publication Svenska skrivregler in official contexts, with it otherwise being regarded as a de facto orthographic standard. Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council, the Swedish Academy (established 1786) is arguably the most influential. Its primary instruments are the <b>glossary</b> Svenska Akademiens ordlista (SAOL, currently in its 14th edition) and the dictionary Svenska Akademiens Ordbok, in addition to various books on grammar, spelling and manuals of style. Even though the dictionaries are sometimes used as official decrees of the language, their main purpose is to describe current usage.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{authors of}} earlier works {{published}} by Balai Pustaka, Pane {{does not use}} old Malay proverbs; he instead uses similes. Another {{way in which he}} writes differently from earlier writers is by limiting his use of the Dutch language; earlier writers such as Abdul Muis and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana had used Dutch words– representative of the dominant colonial power– to illustrate the intellectualism of the main characters. Instead, in Belenggu Pane relies on the Indonesianised loanwords, with a <b>glossary</b> of difficult or uncommon words provided with early editions of the novel. Siregar wrote that Pane's language reflected the actual use of Indonesian well.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which <b>glossary,</b> style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered hit-and-run operations over Belgium and France. The operations {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. The escalation of offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned Operations Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: Ramrod (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter Ramrod (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); Roadstead (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter Roadstead (the same operation as Roadstead but without bombers) along with Rhubarb (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus operations (see <b>glossary).</b>|$|E

40|$|Mgr. Kateřina Voleková Česká lexikografie 15. století Czech Lexicography of the 15 th Century Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} Czech medieval lexicography. Based on {{research}} into rich manuscript material totalling over 350 items, it describes {{the development of}} Czech lexicography from Czech glosses in foreign-language texts and first Latin-Czech <b>glossaries</b> to the flourishing Czech lexicography of the 15 th century covering both Latin-Czech, Czech-Latin and multilingual lexicographical works and also infrequently attested Czech monolingual dictionaries. The high number of lexicographical works is divided according to formal and content criteria. With respect to form and macrostructure we discern Czech glosses in Latin and Latin-German <b>glossaries,</b> a bilingual <b>glossaries</b> with Czech {{as one of the}} languages, alphabetaries and nomenclators and <b>glossaries</b> lacking an ordering criterion. With respect to the content we distinguish large dictionaries covering as many lexical items as possible on one hand and short <b>glossaries</b> covering only a narrowly delimited part of vocabulary on the other hand. The lexicographical works are supplied with a short description which is in case of short and yet unedited works complemented by an edition using transcription. The thesis also contains description of selected phenomena of [...] ...|$|R
