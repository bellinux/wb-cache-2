2500|$|At {{the end of}} the May 5, 2005 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, he {{attacked}} his former tag team partner, Mysterio, leaving him bruised and bloody after suplexing him onto a set of steel steps thus completing his brief villainous turn. Once again a villain, Guerrero then adopted a new, brooding gimmick. During this time, he also stopped driving his low-riders down the ring and walked to the ring slowly with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> gained a new theme which was a darker remix of [...] "Lie, Cheat, And Steal" [...] and started using his other finishing move, the Lasso from El Paso, more often. At Judgment Day, Guerrero lost to Mysterio by disqualification after hitting Mysterio with a chair.|$|E
60|$|Arthur put out {{his hand}} angrily, as though to keep him back. The <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> grew darker.|$|E
60|$|They {{set about}} the search, but found nobody, and George stopped outside the last {{building}} with a puzzled <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|His mouth closed, and a <b>frown</b> came <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He jumped {{suddenly}} down.|$|R
60|$|Giatron paused, {{with the}} bottle {{suspended}} in mid-air. He slowly set it down. A <b>frown</b> appeared <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|But Thomas Cole wasn't listening. He {{was bent}} over the schematics, an intense <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{weathered}} <b>face.</b> <b>His</b> long fingers moved restlessly over the schematics, tracing wiring and terminals. His lips moved as he calculated.|$|R
60|$|He {{had heard}} the noise before entering, and now stood with a stern <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> as he gazed at his wife and her visitor.|$|E
6000|$|The smith stood {{square in}} front with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "You'll not touch my tools. Vise and forge is yours; {{screwing}} stocks is mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! so {{you think}} you are going to spy on me, after all!" [...] cried a voice, and Nat Poole came towards them, with a deep <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "As I did so {{a shrill}} cry arose behind me, and looking back, I beheld the trapper's wife {{prostrate}} on the ground, and Misconna standing over her, his spear uplifted, and a fierce <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> dark <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} {{standing}} there when Mr. Carmyle swung round with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> dark <b>face</b> which seemed {{to say that he}} had not found the janitor's conversation entertaining. The sight of Ginger plainly did nothing to lighten his gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... "What has befallen Mabel Dunham?" [...] {{demanded the}} young man, with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{handsome}} <b>face,</b> that was visible even {{to those on}} the block. [...] "If a hair of her head has been touched, it will go hard with the whole Iroquois tribe." ...|$|R
60|$|Harding {{was leaning}} back in his chair in the smoking-room with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> when Blake joined him. He had a nervous alert look and was dressed with fastidious neatness.|$|E
60|$|Vane sat in Nairn's {{office with}} a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Specimens of ore lately {{received}} from the mine were scattered about a table and Nairn had some papers in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{would like}} to have a talk with you, young man," [...] went on Emil Bauermann, with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "We came over here on purpose to see you." ...|$|E
60|$|Archie had {{a dinner}} and theatre {{engagement}} that night, {{and it was}} late {{when he returned to}} the hotel. He found his father-in-law prowling restlessly about the lobby. There seemed to be something on Mr. Brewster's mind. He came up to Archie with a brooding <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> square <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|Conrad {{was seated}} in a friend's house in Somerset when the said shell exploded. It {{came in the form}} of a {{newspaper}} paragraph. He looked surprised on reading the first line or two; then a dark <b>frown</b> settled <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> which, as he read on, became pale, while his compressed lips twitched with suppressed passion.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{freckled}} <b>face</b> grew deeper, {{and for a}} {{long time}} he sat without moving. Suddenly <b>his</b> <b>face</b> cleared, and he jumped to his feet. He began to chuckle. [...] "I have it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I'll do a little shooting myself!" [...] Then he chuckled again and started for home. Presently he began to whistle, a way he has when he is in good spirits.|$|R
6000|$|... "He looked wrathful as a tiger in {{the arena}} when the guards come and snatch his prey from him. There was a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> darker than that which usually sits on Taurus Antinor's brow." ...|$|E
60|$|Hutton made {{a sign of}} concurrence, {{but there}} was a suggestive <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> when he leaned upon the balustrade, as Nasmyth and Acton went down the {{stairway}} together. When they were half-way down the street, Acton looked at Nasmyth with a dry smile.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{followed}} for a time; but the remark had set us {{all on the}} alert, straining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands, the captain {{out in the middle}} of the block-house, with his mouth very tight and a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|On {{the broad}} terrace outside his palace, {{overlooking}} the fair {{expanse of the}} Royal gardens, King Merolchazzar of Oom stood leaning on the low parapet, his chin {{in his hand and}} a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> noble <b>face.</b> The day was fine, and a light breeze bore up to him from the garden below a fragrant scent of flowers. But, for all the pleasure it seemed to give him, it might have been bone-fertilizer.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{came into the}} club-house. There was a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> usually cheerful <b>face,</b> and he ordered a ginger-ale {{in the sort of}} voice which an ancient Greek would have used when asking the executioner to bring on the hemlock.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a sort}} of majesty in {{the figure}} half buried in the snow. His hands were clenched, and there was a <b>frown</b> of {{resolution}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> as if he had fancied Death coming, and had gone defiantly forth to meet him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me see you a moment, Brady," [...] he said, quietly. His eye rested for {{a second}} on the long fur scarf thrown stylishly back over Molly's left shoulder. The Kid, with his old-time police hating <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> stepped a yard or two aside with the detective.|$|E
60|$|He turned away, leaving Courtledge alone, for {{a minute}} or two, on the {{threshold}} of the card room. The secretary's attention was riveted upon the table near the wall, and the <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> deepened. Just as he was moving off, the Baron de Grost rose and joined him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{paid for}} his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There he sent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few minutes later {{he was in the}} {{presence}} of the man who did not here go by the name of [...] "Mr. Carter." [...] There was a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|Though {{he said it}} as if his wonder were past--at {{the same}} time {{resuming}} the walk--it was not lost upon the master that he {{looked over his shoulder}} after speaking, and that the same perplexed and pondering <b>frown</b> was heavy <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{young boy}} sitting on a sandy ground with a pile of what appear to be eggs, [s. d. ]. The boy is sitting on a sandy floor, with his legs spread apart, showing a small pile of what seem to be eggs visible in front of him. He has a <b>frowning</b> {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> while holding up an egg with his right hand. The sand covers the entire ground area and extends towards the background...|$|R
60|$|For a {{few moments}} he was silent, lost in rather gloomy thought, with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> brown <b>face,</b> and Mrs. Allott, his English relative, studied him across the table. On the whole, Jim Thirlwell had {{improved}} in Canada, and she {{thought he would be}} welcomed if he returned to England. She had been his mother's friend, and during the week or two they had now spent together, had decided that if he proved amenable she would help him to make a career. Indeed, it was largely on Thirlwell's account she had accompanied her husband <b>on</b> <b>his</b> American tour.|$|R
60|$|Captain Wybrow was silent. He felt out of humour, wearied, annoyed. There come {{moments when}} one almost determines never again to oppose {{anything}} but dead silence to an angry woman. 'Now then, confound it,' {{he said to}} himself, 'I'm going to be battered on the other flank.' He looked resolutely at the horizon, with something more like a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> than Beatrice had ever seen there.|$|E
60|$|He found Rainiharo, with a {{tremendous}} <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and deep lines of care on his brow, seated {{in front of our}} friend the Secretary, who had an open book on his knee. Three other officers of the palace sat beside them. These constituted a court of inquiry into the contents of the suspected books, and the Secretary, being the only literary character among them, was the appointed reader.|$|E
60|$|He {{disappeared}} below, and Vane sat at {{the helm}} with a <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> An angry coppery glare streamed down upon the white-flecked water which gleamed in the lurid light. It was very cold, {{but there was a}} wonderful quality that set the blood tingling in the nipping air. Even upon the high peaks and in the trackless bush, one fails to find the bracing freshness that comes with the dawn at sea.|$|E
60|$|There {{the same}} thing happened. He was very patient, very, very patient, but his {{patience}} brought no reward, {{not so much as}} the faintest kind of a nibble. Farmer Brown's boy trudged on to the next pool, and there was a puzzled <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> freckled <b>face.</b> Such a thing never had happened before. He didn't {{know what to make of}} it. All the night before he had dreamed about the delicious dinner of fried trout he would have the next day, and now--well, if he didn't catch some trout pretty soon, that splendid dinner would never be anything but a dream.|$|R
6000|$|No {{reply was}} given to this, but the {{question}} seemed to throw the red man into a savage reverie, and a dark <b>frown</b> settled <b>on</b> <b>his</b> painted <b>face,</b> as he muttered, [...] "The Little Wolf meant to take the white man's life, but he was wise: he spared his life and took his heart. His revenge is sweeter. Wah!" ...|$|R
60|$|All {{around the}} Smiling Pool {{and then up}} and down the Laughing Brook Farmer Brown's boy tramped, and each trap he found sprung and buried in the mud. He had stopped {{whistling}} by this time, and there was a puzzled <b>frown</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> freckled <b>face.</b> What did it mean? Could some other boy have found all his traps and played a trick by springing all of them? The more he thought about it, the more puzzled he became. You see, he did not know anything about the busy day the Minks and the Otters and the Muskrats and the Coons had spent the day before.|$|R
