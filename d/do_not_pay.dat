5|$|Zelda now {{claims to}} be {{in direct contact with}} Christ, William the Conqueror, Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock {{paraphernalia}} of insane-asylum jokes...

When they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
