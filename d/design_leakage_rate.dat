An experiment facility has been constructed at UW-Madison to measure the <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> and pressure drop of S-CO 2 flow through labyrinth seals. Various geometries and conditions have been tested to study the flow characteristic and provide validation data for numerical study. The CFD simulation of this scenario is performed under the framework of an open source CFD code OpenFOAM. Fluid properties of S-CO 2 are implemented into the code. The primary goal is to verify the code's capability to predict <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> through seals, with a secondary goal focused on using the code to optimize the seal geometry for S-CO 2 flow, and understand how changing the operating condition will affect {{the performance of the}} seal. Optimization of the seal geometry is performed by studying the effects of geometrical parameters like radial clearance, tooth width, cavity depth, cavity width, and the number of teeth. It has been found that as the cavity width is increased individually the <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> through the seal decreases, whereas increasing the radial clearance causes an increase in the <b>leakage</b> <b>rate.</b> Cavity depth studies indicate that there is an optimum value that results in minimum <b>leakage</b> <b>rate.</b> For a fixed total seal length, as the number of teeth are increased reduction in <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> associate...|$|R

This study represents an efficient mathematical model for estimating <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> by hydraulic head change evaluation {{through different}} conduits or leakage pathways coupled with an injection well. The <b>leakage</b> <b>rate</b> is estimated using Darcy?s law by evaluating hydraulic head change between the upper and the lower aquifers through leakage conduit (abandoned well and fracture). The analysis is conducted by solving the governing equations of fluid flow in the aquifer coupled with the flow through different conduits. The single-phase flow is considered which is capable of explaining both fluid and CO 2 plume flow in an aquifer system by neglecting the variable density effect. The result is obtained in the Laplace domain and subsequently inverted to yield the real-time domain solution.
