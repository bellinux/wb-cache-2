5|$|The Japanese Grand Prix {{was one of}} {{only two}} events in the 2015 season to <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> drag {{reduction}} system (DRS) zone, the other being Monaco. The DRS zone at Suzuka was in its traditional spot, on the start/finish straight between turn 18 and turn 1, with the detection point just before the Casio Triangle complex.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|According to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, the Commission de toponymie du Québec, and the Geographical Names Board of Canada, {{the names}} of Canadian cities and towns <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{official}} form. Thus, Montréal is officially spelled with an accented é in both Canadian English and French. However, Canadian English spelling conventionally omits the accent in both Montreal and Quebec.|$|E

5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> mate each year, {{and stay}} faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years {{is only about}} 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating {{appears to be an}} influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner.|$|E

5|$|Generally sharks <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{layer of}} tesserae, but {{the jaws of}} large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and {{the timing of the}} births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 2012, the {{executive}} producer Martin Österdahl told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter that SVT plans for the 2013 Contest to <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> presenter for the entire contest, unlike previous years where there were up to three presenters per show. The last time {{there was just one}} presenter was in the 1995 Contest, in Dublin, Ireland, when the solo host was Mary Kennedy. Petra Mede was announced as the host for the 2013 contest on 28 January 2013.|$|E

5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they may pose a risk to the blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> or two seconds, depending on the context, to audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds.

5|$|Similarities between House and {{the famous}} fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore {{explained}} that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} mapped to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> abnormal copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E

5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> robot, Clank.|$|E
5|$|After {{the female}} lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the egg to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds <b>have</b> <b>only</b> <b>one.</b> Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.|$|E
