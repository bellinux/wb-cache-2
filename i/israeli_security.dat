5|$|The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held {{control of}} the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 Six-Day War. After Israel's victory in that war, Israel {{transferred}} the {{control of the}} mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic waqf trust, who are independent of the Israeli government. However, <b>Israeli</b> <b>Security</b> Forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of <b>Israeli</b> <b>security</b> forces around the site since the Second Intifada.
