A sustainable and standardized management of the reforestation / afforestation programs will contribute to watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, wood productivity, wood {{that could be used for}} fire needs, timber industry development and unemployment alleviation. Another fundamental aim is that will give employment to labor in certain zones where marked unemployment is. Reforestation/afforestation efforts indicates a need for approximately 500 people per year in the establishment of forests plantations, which includes functions such as nursery work, seed processing, seed production, land preparation and planting. They have a significant impact on employment, especially in rural areas, due to its labor-intensive nature. This will create additional jobs and will foster the local economy...|$|R

5000|$|The {{study is}} mainly {{concentrated}} on Pindikhola VDC of Syangja district. Pindikhola VDC {{is one of}} the 60 VDCs of Syangja district, which is located 59 km ( [...] 44 km from Putalibazar to Galyang and 15 km from Galyang to Chhabisebazar) far from district headquarters in western part of this district. It is surrounded by Sirsekot VDC and some part of Pelakot VDC in the east, Niwuakharka VDC and some part of Pelakot VDC in the south, Kaligandaki river and some part Taklak and Shaligram VDC of the Parbat district in the west and Taklak, Triveni and Shaligram of the Parbat district in the North. Its altitude is about 700m to 2000m from the sea level. About 10% land is only plain which has been cultivated far from land and the rest land is sloppy with coverage of major human settlement, <b>forest,</b> <b>shrub</b> land, farming land, grazing land, small streams and so on.Total 18.45% area from the total area of Syangja district has covered by this VDC ( [...] i.e. 19135 hector). Out of the total area of this VDC, 42.5% land has been covered by 2600 landowner for the purpose of housing, farming and grazing and followed by 19.5% of forest land.On the forest area, Sal, Katush Simal, Faledo, Jamuno, Fadiyar, Chiuri, Khalluk,Kadam, Dhairo, Sour, Chap, Siltemor etc. can be found. So far the water resources is concerned, Pindikhola is major and permanent streams flows through the mid of the VDC. This stream starts from Chande choutari where two small streams i.e. Betiheni khola and Arfoudi khola of ward no. 1 and 2 meet and flows to end at Kaligandaki river at Setibeni. Several small streams of Pindikhola and Setikhola came from Parbat district also mix with this stream. This stream has been mainly tapped for irrigation and fishing. Almost all rice field situated on the plain area of this VDC has been irrigated from this stream. There are other 55 water resources including 83.63% permanent and 16.36% temporary sources, which have been utilized for source of drinking water. ( [...] Pindikhola VDC profile 2058). Because some settlements such as Ranipokhari Majhgaun of ward no. 9, Bhalthum, Chitung, Padhera and Nigali of ward no. 4 and Bhanjyan of ward no. 6, are situated on higher altitude than location of source of water, drinking water has not been properly supplied there. Climate of Pindikhola can not be assigned to any particular type because of the prevailing variation in altitude, topography and resulting temperature and precipitation. Mainly the features of subtropical, warm temperate and cool temperate zone meet in the VDC. On the basis of VDCs of Syangja with common climatic features, it can be mentioned in the case of Pindikhola also that temperature in this VDC varies between 9- 23 degree Celsius and rainfall average at 2665 ml.|$|E
