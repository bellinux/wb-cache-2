5|$|The {{end of the}} Johnson County War also {{marked the}} end of the open range in Wyoming. By 1893, the WSGA was opened to the other small ranchers and farmers, finally ending their {{monopoly}} and control over Wyoming business interests. Previous practices of the WSGA, such as vigilantism and confiscation of cattle were <b>finally</b> <b>stopped.</b> Many prominent leaders of the Association such as Frank Wolcott, Frank M. Canton and Tom Smith later left the area.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not close off Bruges completely. Further plans to attack Ostend came to nothing during the summer of 1918, and the threat from Bruges would not be <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> until the last days of the war, when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz was a {{heavy cruiser}} of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, fourth in the , but was never completed. The ship was laid down in December 1936 and {{launched}} in January 1939, but the outbreak of World War II slowed her construction and fitting-out work was <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> {{in the summer of}} 1940 when she was approximately 95percent complete. The unfinished ship remained pier-side in the shipyard until March 1942, when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants. Seydlitz was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} several alumni owned {{vehicles}} that are painted {{to resemble the}} Wreck. These vehicles mimic {{the look and feel}} of the Reck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One of the most famous instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking his ship. Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting his ship and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits). Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 28 November, the PVA 80th Division {{attacked}} again with four regiments. At the inlet, the Chinese assault became a disaster as communications broke down while devastating fire from the anti-aircraft (AA) guns attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion swept the Chinese ranks. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, the PVA 238th and the 239th Regiment together had less than 600 soldiers. The attacks by PVA 240th Regiment, on the other hand, forced Maclean to order a retreat from the northern hills towards the inlet. On 29 November, the 1st Battalion managed to break through the Chinese blockade and reached the inlet, but Maclean disappeared as he mistook some Chinese soldiers as American. The Chinese <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> their attacks on {{the night of}} 29 November while waiting for fresh reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{independence}} in 1830, Belgium had been obliged to remain neutral in perpetuity by an 1839 treaty {{as part of}} a guarantee for {{its independence}}. Before the war, Belgium was a constitutional monarchy and was noted for being one of the most industrialised countries in the world. On 4 August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and pushing the 200,000-strong Belgian army, supported by their French and British allies, to the far west. Large numbers of refugees also fled to neighbouring countries. In October 1914, the German advance was <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> near the French border by a Belgian force at the Yser and by a combined Franco-British force at the Marne. As a result, the front line stabilised with most of Belgium already under German control. In the absence of any decisive offensive, most of Belgium remained under German control {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|Various {{attempts}} were made to mate the 40mm Bofors L/50 gun to the M3 chassis. In most cases the weapon's recoil was too severe or the mounting too heavy, and the {{attempts were}} <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> with the adoption of the M19 MGMC on the M24 light tank chassis.|$|E

25|$|After an {{especially}} difficult winter in 1906, {{and years of}} hardship since the 1880s, the British government offered to evacuate the island. Those remaining on Tristan held a meeting and decided to refuse, thus deepening the island's isolation.

25|$|The last barge {{to travel}} on the section between Pallingham and Newbridge was {{recorded}} in 1888, and Hardham tunnel was closed in 1889. The artificial cuts were officially abandoned in 1896, but limited traffic continued on the old river sections into the 20th century, notably bricks from Harwoods Green below Pallingham and chalk from Houghton Bridge; they were <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> in 1938 by a new, fixed bridge on the Havant to Brighton railway line at Ford.|$|E
25|$|Griffin's {{division}} and the V Corps artillery under Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Charles S.

The Confederates fell back about 400 yards from the run when they met the fire from Griffin and Wainwright, although historian Ed Bearss states that the Confederates only meant to make a forced reconnaissance at the run, not to cross it.|$|E
25|$|The rain <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> on 2 March, and {{two days}} later Duchesne {{launched}} a second, highly successful offensive. In a series of actions fought between 4 and 7 March, the French broke the Chinese encirclement of Keelung with a flank attack delivered against {{the east of the}} Chinese line, defeating Chinese forces under the command of Cao Zhizhong, Wang Shizheng, and Lin Chaodong, capturing the key positions of La Table and Fort Bamboo, and forcing the Chinese to withdraw behind the Keelung River.|$|E

25|$|Most significantly, {{later in}} the decade the {{aqueduct}} began to carry less water. New York City had both eliminated {{one of the two}} reservoirs in Central Park that it fed, and developed or planned to develop new reservoirs in the Catskills and further up the Croton River watershed, so it needed the water that had gone through Ossining less.

He was <b>finally</b> <b>stopped</b> by Dredd and killed (again {{with the help of a}} civilian, Darien Kenzie), but only after considerable loss of life.|$|E
25|$|In 1656, 6,000 soldiers, who {{had participated}} in the English Civil War, landed in France and took their {{quarters}} in Abbeville from where they left to go and reinforce the army of Turenne en route to Valenciennes.
