40|$|The {{main goal}} of a {{drinking}} water treatment plant is to provide safe drinking water for its consumers. Historically, this was accomplished through monitoring the influent and effluent water quality {{to ensure that the}} water quality met a set of guidelines and regulations. However, as the limitations of relying on compliance monitoring become more evident, water utilities and drinking water treatment plants are beginning to utilize risk management frameworks to help provide safe drinking water and to mitigate potential risks. Applying a risk management framework requires an evaluation of potential risks. This systematic evaluation can be performed through using risk analysis methods. The overall goal of this research is to analyze and evaluate risk analysis methodologies that are used in a variety of engineering fields, select two risk analysis methods, and use them to evaluate the probability of producing non-compliant drinking water from a rapid <b>gravity</b> <b>filtration</b> unit with respect to turbidity. The risk analysis methodologies that were used in this research were the consequence frequency assessment and computer modelling combined with probabilistic risk analysis. Both of the risk analysis methodologies were able to determine the probability of producing non-compliant water from a rapid <b>gravity</b> <b>filtration</b> unit with respect to turbidity. However, these methodologies were found to provide different numerical results with respect to each other. The consequence frequency assessment methodology was found to be easier to implement; however, the consequence frequency assessment was only able to be performed on one parameter at a time. Computer modelling and probabilistic risk analysis enabled the inclusion of multiple parameters which provided a more comprehensive understanding of the filtration unit. The primary conclusion from this research is that the risk analysis methods, as they are described in this thesis, are not sufficient to use directly on a rapid <b>gravity</b> <b>filtration</b> unit without further modification. Furthermore, although the risk analysis methods provided some guidance, these methods should only be used {{as a part of a}} complete risk management process...|$|E

The filterability of RBCs was increased by verapamil 1 microgram/ml (P less than 0. 01) in healthy volunteers (P less than 0. 05) and in patients with PSS (P less than 0. 05). A high concentration of verapamil (200 micrograms/ml) caused an 80 % reduction (P less than 0. 05) in the filterability of RBCs from healthy volunteers. The filterability of RBCs stored at 4 degrees C for 24 h was increased by 1 microgram/ml verapamil (P less than 0. 05).

A limited study of high rate <b>gravity</b> sand <b>filtration</b> {{was conducted in}} a laboratory model to in-vestigate the required parameters for removing fish eggs and larvae from a flow of water. Live fish eggs and larvae of the common carp and rainbow smelt were applied to two separate filters, one containing an effective size sand of 0. 425 to 0. 500 mm (0. 017 to 0. 020 in) and the other having an effective size sand of 1. 20 to 1. 70 mm (0. 047 to 0. 067 in). The filtration rate was held constant at 6. 79 x 10 - 3 m/s (10 (gal/min) /ft ~) through both filters. Fish eggs preserved in formaldehyde were used after the spawning season of the fish.

The interaction of the local ISM with the solar wind shapes our heliospheric environment with hydrogen being the dominant component of the very local ISM. In this paper, we report on direct sampling of the neutral hydrogen of the local ISM over four years of IBEX observations. The hydrogen wind observed at 1 AU has decreased and nearly disappeared as the solar activity has increased over the last four years; the signal at 1 AU has dropped off in 2012 by a factor of ~ 8 to near background levels. The longitudinal offset has also increased with time presumably due to greater radiation pressure deflecting the interstellar wind.

The availability of safe water, and in particular safe drinking water, {{is one of the most}} important determinants of our general health. The removal of suspended matter from water is one of the major goals of drinking water treatment. Effective clarification is really necessary for completely reliable disinfection because microorganisms are shielded by particles in the water. Coagulation, flocculation and clarification, followed by rapid <b>gravity</b> sand <b>filtration,</b> are the main steps in conventional water treatment systems. Colloidal particles and other finely divided matter are brought together and agglomerated to form larger size particles that can subsequently be removed in a more efficient fashion. The increase in the contact mass increases the probability that collisions will take place inside the flocculator resulting in a more efficient flocculation. Therefore, the intentional introduction of preformed floc or sludge into the mixing and flocculation stage is a feature of most proprietary water treatment equipment. The aim of study is to explore the wealth of literature to present the new trends of the conventional drinking water treatment that is continuously evolving, especially clarification enhancement and acceleration by solids contact increase. The study will experimentally demonstrate the possibility of turbidity removal enhancement, by increasing the contact mass with adding a sludge dosage during flocculation process. The raw water turbidity removal was investigated under conditions that the destabilized colloids and sludge dosage are mixed during flocculation process.

Selection of an appropriate harvesting method {{depends on the}} end product, namely its value and properties [14]: {{it is important to}} consider the acceptable level of moisture, salt concentrations, cell damage and strain features, such as their density and size. Additionally, selection of an effective harvesting procedure must take into account that microalgal biomass must be further processed. Therefore, these procedures must not be toxic or contaminate microalgal biomass. It is also desirable that the selected harvesting method allows the recycling of the culture medium [25]. In this sense, bioflocculation appears as a viable alternative for the commonly used procedures. This method consists in the addition of other microorganisms or microbial metabolites to microalgal cultures, trying to stimulate microbial aggregation and flocs formation. The use of bioflocculation as harvesting method is more energetically efficient and reduces the impact of the addition of chemical flocculants to microalgal biomass, which tend to be an expensive and toxic alternative [26]. The ability of microorganisms to form flocs strongly depends on their surface physicochemical properties.|$|R

Following blocking, the membranes were washed three times in PBST (for 5  min each). The membranes were incubated at room temperature for 3  h with primary antibody (anti-ubiquitin antibody, Cell Signaling Technology) diluted in 1 % BSA and 0.05 % sodium azide in PBST, washed in PBST, and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 2  h with secondary antibody. The immunoreaction was developed with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) and imaged with a Fusion FX 7 system (Vilbert Lourmat, Eberhardzell, Germany). The developed membranes were imported as TIFF files. The immunoreactive signals were analyzed using a software package (MCID software). The results were converted to numerical values to compare the levels of ubiquitinated proteins of the immunoreactive signals.|$|E
40|$|Pure {{water is}} an {{essential}} requirement {{for the survival of}} human beings. To meet the requirements of potable, industrial and agricultural water, the immediate need is to treat waste water, particularly the sewage sludges and slimes from the municipal and industrial effluents respectively. These effluents are highly undesirable and unsafe. The removal of contaminants from waste water is a must before they can be reused. The removal of contaminants from these effluents involves the process of flocculation and coagulation. The purpose of the present article is to clarify and explain the processes in details along with the materials involved in the processes. This will be essential for the present day life. 1. Coagulation and Flocculation Colloidal particles in nature normally carry charges on their surface, which lead to the stabilisation of the suspension. By addition of some chemicals, the surface property of such colloidal particles can be changed or dissolved material can be precipitated so as to facilitate the separation of solids by <b>gravity</b> or <b>filtration.</b> Conversion of stable state dispersion to the unstable state is termed destabilisation and the processes of destabilisation are coagulation and flocculation 1, 2. Often the terms coagulation and flocculation are used synonymously inspite of existing a subtle difference between the two 1, 3. If destabilisation is induced through charge neutralisation by addition of inorganic chemicals, the process is called coagulation. On the other hand, the process of forming larger agglomerates of particles in suspension or of small agglomerates already formed as a result of coagulation through high molecular weight polymeric materials is called flocculation. No substantial change of surface charge is accomplished in flocculation. The agglomerates formed by coagulation are compact and loosely bound, whereas the flocs are of larger size, strongly bound and porous in case of flocculation. In mineral processing industries, the scope of application of flocculants is much greater than the coagulants. Coagulants find use in the processing of coal, taconite, soda ash...|$|R
40|$|Many {{methods for}} the {{quantitative}} concentration of {{small amounts of}} viruses from natural water supplies have been considered. One {{of the most promising}} of these is the adsorption of viruses onto a 0. 45 pm cellulose nitrate membrane filter apparatus. A quantity of water is passed through the filter by <b>gravity</b> or pressure <b>filtration.</b> The viruses present in the water are adsorbed onto the membrane and are subsequently eluted by the use of a beef extract eluant. The virus-containing elution is then layered upon tissue culture, preferably the BGM cell line, for isolation by the plaque method. The isolated virus is then identified by serological techniques. The research presented here utilized the cellulose nitrate membrane filter system for the detection of viruses from local waterways and sewage treatment influents and effluents. Examination of the water was done for the Enterovirus group of viruses consisting primarily of the Echovirus, Coxsackievirus, and Poliovirus groups. Although viral cytopathic effect was detectable in a few cell cultures innoculated with collected water samples, no virus was isolated and identified by serological techniques or electron microscopy. The use of continuous cell lines produced numerous problems during this study. Subsequently, any viruses in positive CPE flasks could not be repassaged in BGM cultures. No viruses could be identified by neutralization in tissue culture. Identification of the positive flasks could not be made by electron microscopy. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Heck {{coupling}} of iodobenzene with {{ethyl acrylate}} or styrene {{was used to}} assess the catalytic properties of biogenic nanoparticles of palladium supported upon the surface of bacterial biomass (bioPd), this approach combining advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The biomaterial was comparably active or superior to colloidal Pd in the Heck reaction, giving a final conversion of 85 % halide and initial rate of 0. 17 mmol/min for the coupling of styrene and iodobenzene compared to a final conversion of 70 % and initial rate of 0. 15 mmol/min for a colloidal Pd catalyst under the same reaction conditions at 0. 5 mol. % catalyst loading. It was easily separated from the products under <b>gravity</b> or by <b>filtration</b> for reuse with low loss or agglomeration. When compared to two alternative palladium catalysts, commercial 5 % Pd/C and tetraalkylammonium-stabilised palladium clusters, the bioPd was successfully reused in six sequential alkylations with only slight decreases in the rate of reaction as compared to virgin catalyst (initial rate normalised for g Pd decreased by 5 % by the 6 th run with bioPd catalyst cf. a decrease of 95 % for Pd/C). A re-usable Pd-catalyst made cheaply from bacteria left over from other processes would impact on both conservation of primary sources via reduced metal losses in industrial application and the large environmental demand of primary processing from ores...|$|R
