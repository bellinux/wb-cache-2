25|$|<b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> {{there are}} two Wagners in our culture, almost unrecognizably {{different}} from one another: the Wagner possessed by those who know his work, and the Wagner imagined by {{those who know him}} only by name and reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Wieringo {{explained}} the philosophy behind his drawing style thus: [...] "I {{just try to}} keep things fun. I like to do fun comics. It doesn't have to be realistic to be believable. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> that funny [...] might actually add something to certain books." [...] When he began illustrating the Rogue miniseries, he was intimidated by the dark tone of that book's story, but once he finished the first issue, the editors decided to light up the [...] "grim and gritty" [...] tone of the story.|$|E
2500|$|Of the work, Andrew Sullivan wrote [...] "you cannot read [...] on Romeo and Juliet or Antony and Cleopatra {{without seeing}} those {{works in a}} new light. You cannot read his account of Rousseau's La {{nouvelle}} Heloise without wanting {{to go back and}} read it—more closely—again...Bloom had a gift for reading reality—the impulse to put your loving face to it and press your hands against it". Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said [...] "Allan inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air...People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When critics proclaim the death of the novel, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. [...] Allan was certainly one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not certain, Mr. Frank. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it {{was natural}} perversity; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was false pride at getting over sea-sickness; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was reading 'Robinson Crusoe,' and books warning of me {{not to go to}} sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|Caroline did {{not seem}} vexed by the inquiry, but went on {{speaking}} rather {{as if she was}} examining herself as to the answer,--"Love him? <b>I</b> don't know; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not. It is not as people in books love, and--and it can't be as your Agnes must love Mr. Arundel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's a funny one she is," [...] {{said the}} old man {{scratching}} his head as he looked after her, [...] "of all the woman folk as ever I knowed she is the rummest. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>thinks</b> she wants to get drowned. Dash me if I haven't half a mind to stave a hole in the bottom of that there damned canoe, and finish it." ...|$|R
2500|$|He was {{considered}} an attacking batsman who could score all around the wicket with [...] "a style that is entirely his own". He scored quickly when on form and was an [...] "ideal cricketer". His cover drive {{was considered}} particularly effective and hard hitting as well as attractive - A. A. Thomson wrote of him: [...] "Though a crabbed unemotional Northerner, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> that if one last fragment of cricket had to be preserved, as though in amber, {{it should be a}} glimpse of K. L. Hutchings cover-driving under a summer heaven." [...] According to David Denton and George Hirst, he hit the ball harder than any other player of their time (and they were contemporaries of Gilbert Jessop, one of the harder hitting batsmen of the Golden Age of cricket).|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{extremely}} well received and lauded by the UK music magazines {{at the time}} of its original release. Sounds awarded Signing Off five stars out of five, claiming that [...] "it is an (almost) perfect album... It's rare to find a debut album so detailed, so excellently played and so packed with bite – <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> it hasn't really happened since The Clash." [...] NME described the album as [...] "a courageous debut... Their radical sentiments and trenchant lyrics are given all the more force by the soft-fist of UB40's measured musical delivery... The music might be mellow, but the hard-backed sentiments are hardly those of the nice reggae band you may have pigeonholed the UBs as." [...] Melody Maker said [...] "The UBs, chirpy and still fully independent, have wrapped up their initial promise and persuasion and delivered a well-girthed winner of a debut album... Certainly the music of UB40 benefits far more in both quality and quantity from the exacting freedom of an LP than any of their close contemporaries... the band have broadened out the unique, shy commerciality of the two singles, [...] "King" [...] and [...] "Food for Thought"... to an approach that sharpens the shape of their music and magnifies the message." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as [...] "one {{of the most}} popular characters EastEnders has ever had", while James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is [...] "adored". Palmer has suggested that viewers [...] "rooted" [...] for Bianca because [...] "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, [...] " [...] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think." [...] Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, [...] "It makes me feel bad. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> I should go back [...] for everyone else's sake." [...] When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said [...] "Good riddance!" [...] She described Bianca as a [...] "king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain" [...] and a [...] "prize slapper [...] tormented all those whose paths [...] crossed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very; exquisite, really; the {{blending}} of the tones is so perfect. I wish I {{knew what to}} think about these things. I can't {{make up my mind}} about them. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's all right to make them and buy them; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's all wrong.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Upon my word, then, I {{should like}} {{it better than}} his hanging about here doing nothing but attend to those nasty dogs. <b>I</b> really <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> {{that he has no}} spirit left." ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. Poor Crichton! <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> he {{is losing}} {{his sense of}} humour. Come along, Agatha.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> {{we must be}} all mad {{and that}} we shall wake to sanity in strait waistcoats.|$|E
60|$|For {{there are}} two sorts of faith; and one must always, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think,</b> come before the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in that, madam," [...] answered the gardener; [...] "it may have been that during the story <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> did <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> myself might have been Jaqui." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] {{returned}} his companion; [...] "I'm only talking {{of the way}} in which one's thoughts will wander. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> seriously enough. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it strange that men can look at such a scene as that, and scarcely bestow a thought upon Him who made it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, Ellen. That's {{what makes}} it so kind of awful. I can't tell whether it's a real fancy, or I only <b>think</b> it is. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that I think so because I am afraid to believe it. Do you under Ellen?" ...|$|R
60|$|HILLCRIST. Yes. But {{you don't}} love {{the place as}} I do, Jill. You youngsters don't love anything, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E
60|$|GERALD. It is very curious, {{my mother}} never talks to me about my father. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> she must have married beneath her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> {{she wishes}} {{he had gone}} a little farther in crime. Then his reformation would be more obvious." ...|$|E
60|$|PS.--I {{shall be}} on thorns till I receive your answer. I read, and re-read your letter, and cannot for my soul {{discover}} what your real sentiments are. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you write {{of her as}} one in jest--and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that cannot be. Put me at ease as soon as possible.|$|R
60|$|Why comest thou then so slowly? Because I am hindered. What hinders? Has God {{forbidden}} thee? No. Art thou {{not willing}} to come faster? Yes, yet I cannot. Well, prithee be plain with me, and tell me the reason and ground of thy discouragement. Why, says the sinner, though God forbids me not, and though I am willing to come faster, yet there naturally ariseth this, and that, and the other thought in my heart, that hinders my speed to Jesus Christ. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I am not chosen; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I am not called; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I am come too late; and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I know not {{what it is to}} come. Also one while I think I have no grace; and then again, that I cannot pray; and then again, I think that I am a very hypocrite. And these things keep me from coming to Jesus Christ.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{what people}} say--but <b>I</b> don't know. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I {{have no right}} to any part of it. You have to earn what you own, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So she does. She's fond of it,--I am not. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> that Fred takes after her. Where was it {{you first}} knew him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wisht I {{knew what}} ter do. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> I orter tell {{somebody}} that knows more'n I do, Josie, if I ever blab at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe grief is, {{and always}} has been, my worst ailment. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> if an {{abundant}} gush of happiness came on me I could revive yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless {{she is very}} lovely,--and very clever. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> her {{the most}} {{beautiful}} woman I ever saw in the world." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “I was {{sometimes}} discriminated in South Korea. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be}} better to live in foreign country.” (Participant K/skeptical identity).|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wilcox laughed. [...] "That's {{just what}} {{none of us}} knows. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they are husband and wife--he lectures her so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is never}} dull anywhere,--even at Liverpool, which, {{for a young}} lady, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> the dullest place on earth. I know {{it is for a}} man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{dare not}} urge a suit which may offend you; yet, {{if you could}} read my heart, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> {{that we might be}} happy. Let me hope!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just like them. Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> I {{have got}} into a fairy tale. Everything is so {{beautiful}} and so bewildering, and unlike what I fancied.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Eric relaxed. [...] "Well, that's that. God, those damn things {{give me the}} creeps. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we {{were better}} off before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{like your}} own company? Do you?--Sometimes I think I'm nothing when I'm alone. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I surely must be nothing--nothingness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Come in, Bunk,' {{says the}} farmer, 'and {{look at my}} place. It's kind of lonesome here <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's New York calling.' ...|$|R
