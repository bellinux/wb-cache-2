500|$|A <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area,</b> or [...] "low", is {{a region}} where the {{atmospheric}} pressure at sea level is below that of surrounding locations. [...] Low-pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in upper levels of the troposphere. [...] The formation process of a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> is known as cyclogenesis. [...] Within the field of atmospheric dynamics, areas of wind divergence aloft occur in two areas: ...|$|R
50|$|On November 8, the {{tropical}} depression crossed the Malay Peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Bengal. Being a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> later, it {{was struggling to}} develop until intensifying into a depression on November 13. The system made landfall over India on November 16 and caused 16 fatalities, before it weakened into a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area,</b> and then entered the Arabian Sea on the next day.|$|R
50|$|The JMA {{upgraded}} a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> to {{a tropical}} depression {{east of the}} Philippines early on July 25.|$|R
25|$|Another {{implication}} of the cross-stream momentum equation is that a cyclostrophic flow can only develop next to a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
25|$|If a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> {{forms in}} the atmosphere, air tends to flow in towards it, but is {{deflected}} perpendicular to its velocity by the Coriolis force. A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating circular movement, or a cyclonic flow. Because the Rossby number is low, the force balance is largely between the pressure gradient force acting towards the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> and the Coriolis force acting away {{from the center of}} the low pressure.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{strengths}} of Earth3D is the capacity of showing metereological phenomena, like <b>Low-pressure</b> <b>areas,</b> anticylones, etc. in near-real time.|$|R
5000|$|Subtropical Storm Nicole (2004) - {{formed from}} a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> near Bermuda and headed towards Nova Scotia. Persisted less than 2 days.|$|R
50|$|The {{rainfall}} {{was associated}} with an active cold front and an Atlantic <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> that was over the Azores and moved northeastwards on 19 February 2010.|$|R
50|$|On 7 March, {{over the}} Coral Sea, Cyclone Justin began to form. The {{way in which}} it formed was as follows. The sea waters were at least 27 °C, and as a result some of this water was {{evaporated}} into the air. This water vapour then rose upwards and created large cumulonimbus clouds. These clouds grouped together and caused a current of warm, moist, rapidly rising air to occur. As a result of this current a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> {{on the surface of the}} sea began to develop. This <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> made the trade winds (In the southern hemisphere, where Cyclone Justin formed, they are the east to south-easterly winds) to become much stronger, and indeed, allowed them to impart enough force to rotate the cumulonimbus clouds. As these winds spiralled around the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> (the ‘eye’) they released heat and moisture which supplied the now cyclone with energy.|$|R
5000|$|A {{parade of}} <b>low-pressure</b> <b>areas</b> and {{tropical}} disturbances formed from the Intertropical Convergence Zone late on July 15. Late on July 23, {{one of the}} last low-pressure systems developed further to a weak tropical disturbance, which formed southeast of Chuuk in Micronesia. The system drifted to the west, and on July 25 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> to a tropical depression. At that time, it was located approximately [...] west of Guam. At midnight that day, the JMA began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.|$|R
5000|$|A {{decaying}} {{cold front}} entered into Gulf of Mexico, {{and developed a}} <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> of July 17. Later that day, the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> developed into Tropical Depression One almost halfway between Louisiana and the Yucatan Peninsula. The depression moved northwestward, and minimal intensification occurred, as it approached the Gulf Coast of the United States. The depression made landfall in Texas near the Galveston area, and dissipated by July 21. Minimal impact was recorded from the depression, and light rainfall was reported in Texas and western Louisiana, peaking at 3.77 in in Refugio, Texas.|$|R
50|$|The {{remnants}} of Axel interacted with a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> {{which is also}} the {{remnants of}} Bobbie as it created a large extratropical system, affecting Canada and finally dissipating on January 2, 1995.|$|R

500|$|Another {{indication}} {{of the presence of}} severe weather along a squall line is its morphing into a line echo wave pattern, or LEWP. [...] A LEWP is a special configuration in a line of convective storms that indicates the presence of a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> and the possibility of damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. At each kink along the LEWP is a mesoscale <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area,</b> which could contain a tornado. [...] In response to very strong outflow southwest of the mesoscale low, a portion of the line bulges outward forming a bow echo. [...] Behind this bulge lies the mesoscale high-pressure area.|$|R

50|$|Late on October 30, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) {{reported}} that a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> had formed near Chuuk. On November 1, a tropical disturbance southeast of Yap persisted within the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area,</b> as well as JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression east of Palau late on the same day. However, the agency soon downgraded it back to a low-pressure only six hours later, when the system remained poorly organised with convection confined to the western flank. Shortly after JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression near Palau again early on November 3, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system.|$|R
50|$|A well-marked <b>low-pressure</b> <b>area</b> {{developed}} into a depression on August 9, close to Canning, West Bengal, India. The next day, it moved northeastwards and intensified into a deep depression overland in Bangladesh, about 100 km east-northeast of Kolkata.|$|R
