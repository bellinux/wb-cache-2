A Tool Monitoring System (TMS) as proposed in this paper {{is a piece of}} large-scale computing software and it consists of an offline part and tool assignment model and a real-time tool information monitoring mechanism. In the parts and tools scheduling process, the part geometrical features, work flow information and tool availability factors are considered to determine a part priority weight.

40|$|Cutting {{tools are}} {{essential}} and costly components in a <b>flexible</b> <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> (FMC). Tool assignment and tool exchange control are vital managerial decision functions {{for a group}} of CNC machines in an FMC. A well-designed tool control system should include the abilities of tool scheduling and tool information monitoring in an automatic fashion. A Tool Monitoring System (TMS) as presented in this paper is a large-scale computer software tool, which consists of an off-line part and tool assignment model and a real-time tool information monitoring mechanism. The underlying principle of the system is based upon the approach of simultaneous scheduling of parts and tools. In the part and tool scheduling processes, part geometry, work progress specifications and tool availability are the key factors to be considered in calculating a part priority weight for the design of tool assignment orders. Fuzzy logic approaches are employed to determine the weight for a batch of jobs with multiple parts. The case study shows that the aggregated criteria can all be considered using the fuzzy model. An immediate action can be taken to overcome shop-floor problems by the tool information monitoring mechanism. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>Machining</b> <b>Cells</b> (FMC) {{have become}} very popular in many {{manufacturing}} environments due to the reduction in set-up down-time using off-line set-up. A similar procedure is not yet available for assembly cells. This arises from the need for accurate positioning of parts from bulk storage containers prior to assembly.

This paper investigates {{the development of a}} tactile array sensor that would define the type of component and its position relative to a datum point. The type of component would be given by its shape and weight. This would, in conjunction with software and a suitable control system, enable the assembly cell to identify, locate and assemble a component without the need for expensive and complex orientating devices.

40|$|Modern {{flexible}} manufacturing facilities {{can be highly}} complex, consisting of {{the latest developments in}} machine tool technology, automated material handling systems and sophisticated cell controllers. The design and management of such systems requires a large number of decisions and choices with regard to production mix, assignment of fixtures and cutting tools. A large number of commercial computer modelling packages are now available in the market place. Although these allow valuable assistance in the analysis of a manufacturing facility, they usually take significant amounts of time to build models and require a large amount of training, and can be constraining in their application. This paper establishes a research prototype for a multi-level approach for the realization of a three-phase design and modelling system for flexible machining facilities. It portrays the view of an integrated fully data-driven solution underpinned by a machining cell database, and outlines three major areas of work within the structure, i. e. the 'Cell Configurator', 'Evaluator' and 'Emulator'.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing need for Flex-ible Machining Cells, to cope up with the demand for small and medium-batch products. Controlling {{processes}} in a <b>Flexible</b> <b>Machining</b> <b>Cell</b> is more difficult compared to conventional manufacturing systems. This is primarily due to the concurrent and asynchronous interaction of events which cause system deadlocks. An approach to model the controls of a cell for a given process specifica-tion is presented. Petri Nets was used as the modeling formalism. An algorithm is used to test the model for deadlock occurrences. The results obtained from this research indicates the scope for designing adaptive control procedures capable of on-line applications. 1 INTRODUCI'ION Flexible Machining Cells (FMCs) are a relatively new class of automated manufacturing systems, consisting of a group of computer controlled machining centers serviced by automated handling devices. The cell is designed to manufacture a wide variety of parts simulta-neously. Parts enter the cell at a loading station, and are routed through a sequence of operations at the machining centers. The completled part is finally unloaded at an unloading station. The rnachining operations and part movements are controlled by a host computer through a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). A key advantage of a FMC over conventional manufacturing systems; is the flexibility feature, which allows a variety of parts to be manufactured simul-taneously. This feature: results in a number of planning, scheduling, and control problems during the manufactur-ing cycle. Sophsticated planning, scheduling, and control models and procedures have been suggested to optimize the throughput from the system.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a framework for}} the concurrent modelling of workpieces and cutting tools (dual flow) and introduces a computer aided tool, the dual-flow emulator, {{for use in the}} initial investment phase of high-cost <b>flexible</b> <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> (FMC) and their subsequent short-term scheduling. This facility enables designers to make decisions based on the economic performance and enhancement of proposed designs. The focus of the work is on <b>machining</b> <b>cells,</b> where an individual machining centre's cost can be in excess of one million pounds, with the tooling being three/four times more expensive than conventional tooling. With these high-cost investments, where there is a small number of expensive machines, it is essential that designers are assured a greater chance of economic success. This makes it necessary to model both the flow and management of the workpieces and cutting tools. A framework for the concurrent modelling of workpieces and cutting tools (dual flow) is introduced and the dual-flow emulator described. This dual-flow emulator can be used to explore the relative merits of alternative operating strategies and, finally, as a short-term scheduling tool as an operational performance aid. An industrial-based study has been undertaken and the economic performance of two strategies is discussed in terms of the overall specification and operational performanc...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} enhance the NC {{programming}} efficiency and quality of aircraft structural parts (ASPs), an intelligent NC programming pattern driven by process schemes is presented. In this pattern, the NC <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> is the minimal organizational structure in the technological process, consisting of an operation <b>machining</b> volume <b>cell,</b> and the type and parameters of the machining operation.

In {{order to}} solve the problem {{regarding}} the rapid NC machining programming for top planar surface of ribs in aircraft structural parts, an approach based on skeleton extraction technique is presented here to generate tool path for top planar surface.

Then based on these skeleton branches and process scheme, the set of <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> of the rib top planar surface is constructed. Secondly, the problem on determining the sequence of <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> is resolved by optimizing the machining path. Finally, the sequence of <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> can be converted into the <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> chain from which tool path can be calculated by CAM systems.

40|$|Purpose: Improving the {{productivity}} of a large manufacturing firm through {{development and implementation of}} a group technology model in a real manufacturing environment. This incorporates classification of parts, coding of parts and par families, formation of <b>machine</b> <b>cells,</b> and minimization of machine idle times through <b>machine</b> <b>cell</b> capacity adjustment. Design/methodology/approach: An algorithm has been developed for classification of all the parts into part families on the basis of manufacturing similarities. This formed 144 par families for more than 7500 different parts in production. The algorithm assigned group technology code to each part and a part family code to each part family. The former represents manufacturing characteristics of the part and the latter simplifies determination of part families. A number of <b>machine</b> <b>cells</b> were developed to produce all of the part families. After classification the system automatically directs each part to the appropriate <b>machine</b> <b>cell</b> for manufacturing. A computer software has been developed that automated the functions of classification of parts and assigning a group technology code to each part, determination of part families and assigning part family codes, and directing part families to appropriate <b>machine</b> <b>cells</b> for production. Findings: Introducing part family codes in addition to group technology codes considerably simplified the task of part family determination. Application of the system immediately resulted in an increased productivity of about 50 %. This was due to the reduced setup times, less flow of parts in the workshop, production of similar parts due to parts classification, etc. Yet a productivity improvement of 100 % or more is anticipated in near future. Research limitations/implications: As the manufacturing firm was producing a wide range of products at the time of implementation of this work, it was difficult to implement the project without affecting the production flow significantly. There has also been some resistance from technical people opposing a change in traditional production methods. Originality/value: Integration of <b>machine</b> <b>cell</b> formation with capacity adjustment is of great value that resulted in significant productivity improvements.
