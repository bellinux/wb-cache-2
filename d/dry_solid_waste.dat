40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to evaluate the potential utilization in road construction of wastes produced from the Coolside, LIMB (limestone injection multi-stage burner) and FBC (fluidized-bed combustion) processes, and to specify criteria for landfill disposal of waste from the Coolside process. These three processes {{are considered to be}} clean coal technologies. The Coolside process involves injecting an aqueous slurry of hydrated lime into the ductwork downstream of the air preheater in a coal-fired boiler. The hydrated lime captures sulfur dioxide from the flue gas producing anhydrous calcium sulfite and calcium sulfate, which are collected along with the unused hydrated lime and fly ash. The LIMB process involves injection of lime or hydrated lime directly into the furnace to capture sulfur dioxide. The waste consists principally of anhydrous calcium sulfate, lime, and fly ash. Both processes were demonstrated successfully at the Edgewater Station of Ohio Edison in Lorrain, OH, from 1989 to 1992. Circulating fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) is a commercial technology which combines steam generation with SO{sub 2 } control by burning coal in a circulating bed of limestone. The waste, chemically similar to LIMB waste, is produced by bleed-off of the bed material and by collection of the flue dust. All three processes produce a <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste,</b> which must either be used or disposed of and managed to ensure environmental compliance and economic feasibility.

40|$|PETC {{developed}} {{a comprehensive program}} of coal-related, acid-rain research and development with a major activity area centering on flue gas cleanup and control of SO{sub 2 } emissions. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the retrofit measures for older coal-fired power plants which predate the 1971 New Source Performance Standards. Candidate emission control technologies fall into three categories, depending upon their point of application along the fuel path (i. e., pre, during, or post combustion). The post-combustion, in-duct injection of a calcium-based chemical reagent seemed promising. Preliminary studies showed that reagent injection between the existing air heater and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) could remove between 50 - 60 % of the SO{sub 2 } and produce an environmentally safe, <b>dry,</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> that is easily disposed. Although SO{sub 2 } removal efficiencies were less, the estimated capital costs for duct injection technology were low making the economics of duct injection systems seem favorable when compared to conventional wet slurry scrubbers under certain circumstances. With the promulgation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 came more incentive for the development of low capital cost flue gas desulfurization (FGD) processes. A number of technical problems had to be resolved, however, before duct injection technology could be brought to a state of commercial readiness. The Duct Injection Technology Development Program was launched as a comprehensive, four-year research effort undertaken by PETC to develop this new technology. Completed in 1992, this Duct Injection Design Handbook and the three-dimensional predictive mathematical model constitute two primary end products from this development program. The aim of this design handbook and the accompanying math model is to provide utility personnel with sufficient information to evaluate duct injection technology against competing SO{sub 2 } emissions reduction strategies for an existing plant...|$|E

This paper discusses several case studies where public and private owners/operators of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> facilities bave been forced to close their facilities pre-maturely, resulting {{in a loss of}} valuable <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> capacity and increased cost for <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> disposal. Research is needed to develop methodology to gather scientific and quantifiable support for set backs and buffer zones as a function of landfill and transfer station operations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mine {{activities}} may cause serious environmental problems. Whether the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> from the mine pollute {{the environment is}} {{the one of the}} problems. The <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> from the Nanjing YinMao Lead-Zinc Mine were investigated by multiple miner-alogical techniques in this paper. Calcite and quartz were the major components of the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> by X-ray diffraction spectrum. Several elements such as O, Mg, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ca, K, S, Si, Al, As and Na were detected in the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> by electron microprobe analysis. Although the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> contained heavy metals, their concentrations in the leaching solution of the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> by ICP were less than the identification standard for hazardous <b>waste.</b> Therefore, the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> from the Nanjing YinMao Lead-Zinc Mine are not hazardous...|$|R

Starting with the jurisdiction given to the Local Authority, the jurisdiction to manage <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> and public cleansing is now given to the Federal Government and implemented by the National <b>Solid</b> <b>Waste</b> Managenent Department, the <b>Solid</b> <b>Waste</b> and Public Cleansing Corporation and the contractors or licencees appointed. The takeover was meant to ensure the effectiveness of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> and public cleansing management thus reducing the environmental pollution caused by the weaknesses in the management and legislation. This article discusses two important aspects, that is, management and legislation of the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> and public cleansing by examining the provisions stated in the <b>Solid</b> <b>Waste</b> and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007...|$|R

These inputs {{form the basis of}} policy frameworks that influence <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management decisions. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates household, industrial, manufacturing and commercial <b>solid</b> and hazardous <b>wastes</b> under the 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Effective <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management is a cooperative effort involving federal, state, regional, and local entities. Thus the RCRA’s <b>Solid</b> <b>Waste</b> program section D encourages the environmental departments of each state to develop comprehensive plans to manage nonhazardous industrial and municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|R
