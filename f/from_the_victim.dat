5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> or thrown back.|$|E

25|$|Confession of sins is made {{directly}} to God and not through man (except in asking for forgiveness <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> of the sin). It is taught that sins {{are to be}} kept to oneself to seek individual forgiveness from God. God forgives those who seek his forgiveness and commit to themselves not to repeat the sin, although some sins in which another person is victimized are not forgiven unless that person forgives you, so they should also be asked for forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 1956, Woodcock {{was riding}} his bike around Cabbagetown {{when he picked}} up 9-year-old Gary Morris. He then drove the boy to Cherry Beach, where he strangled and beat him to death - with a coroner later {{determining}} that Morris had died from a ruptured liver. Morris' body was found with a bite mark on his throat and this time paper clips {{seemed to have been}} ritualistically sprinkled near the corpse. Again, the clothing had been removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> and then he had been re-dressed.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been {{hypothesized}} that vampire legends were influenced by individuals being buried alive because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time. In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> trying to escape. In other cases the person would hit their heads, noses or faces and {{it would appear that}} they had been [...] "feeding". A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food, water or fresh air. An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies. Another likely cause of disordered tombs is grave robbery.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the Supreme Court {{revisited}} {{questions about}} the constitutionality of involuntary bodily intrusions in several key cases. In 1973, the Court ruled in Cupp v. Murphy {{that the police were}} permitted to extract a tissue sample from underneath a suspect’s fingernails to recover [...] "evanescent" [...] physical evidence. The suspect in Cupp was suspected of strangling his wife and voluntarily went to a police station to answer questions. Officers noticed bloodstains under the suspect’s fingernails and detained him, but did not place him under arrest. Against the suspect’s wishes, the police scraped out a tissue sample from under his fingernails to retrieve the evidence. The biological material found under the suspect’s fingernails was later found to have come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> Citing Schmerber, the Court held that this warrantless search was justified under the exigent circumstances exemption of the Fourth Amendment because the search was necessary to preserve the “highly evanescent evidence” under the defendant’s fingernails.|$|E
500|$|Lorenzo Prado Navarette and Jose Prado Navarette {{filed an}} appeal in the California Court of Appeal, {{but the court}} affirmed the {{judgment}} of the Superior Court. Relying on the [...] "public safety" [...] exception established in People v. Wells, the court held that [...] "ongoing danger to other motorists [...] the stop without direct corroboration of the vehicle's illegal activity". The court noted that the vehicle was traveling on an [...] "undivided two-lane road, thus raising the risk of a collision with oncoming traffic, which poses a particular risk to human life and limb." [...] However, the court also held that the [...] "anonymous tip itself had several indicia of reliability — the content of the tip strongly suggested it came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> and the tipster accurately described the appearance, location and direction of the vehicle." [...] Lorenzo and Jose appealed again to the Supreme Court of California, but the Court declined to review their case. They then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted their petition for certiorari on October 1, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Loss {{of control}} {{is defined in}} {{sections}} 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 56 abolishes the common law defence of provocation, which also dealt only with murder. There is no mandatory life sentence for voluntary manslaughter. The defence operates whether the defendant is a principal or an accomplice. Broadly speaking, the defendant must have actually lost self-control; the trigger for {{this must be a}} qualifying trigger; and it must be that a [...] "normal" [...] person might also have lost control in the circumstances. The loss of control need not be sudden, but cannot be in a [...] "considered desired for revenge". The loss of control is a subjective test which asks whether this defendant actually lost control, and if so, whether that loss of control led to their killing. The qualifying trigger may take one of two forms, or be a combination of both: that the killing was attributable to the defendant's fear of serious violence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> against the defendant or another identified person; or where the defendant's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. The meaning of the terms [...] "extremely grave character" [...] and [...] "justifiable sense of being seriously wronged" [...] used in the second form is currently unclear. Section 51(1)(c) requires that [...] "a person of 's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of , might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to [...]" [...] These issues are complicated and directing a jury on issues of loss of control is likely to be difficult.|$|E

2500|$|In Judaism, {{confession}} is {{an important}} part of attaining forgiveness for both sins against God and another man. [...] Confessions to God are done communally in the plural. Jews confess that [...] "We have sinned." [...] In matters involving offenses against a fellow man, private confession to the victim is a requirement to obtaining forgiveness <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> which is generally a requirement to obtaining forgiveness from God. If the victim refuses to forgive, the offender confesses publicly, before larger and larger audience. Confession (viduy) is also performed on one's deathbed, if at all possible.|$|E
2500|$|A very {{remarkable}} psychography which circulated worldwide, {{was about}} a case from [...] "Goiania" [...] (a Brazilian city), in which José Divino Nunes, accused of murdering his best friend Maurício Henriques, was cleared from the accusation by a judge who accepted the psychography as a valid proof (among other proofs presented by the defense); a testimony <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> himself already dead, through a psychographed letter dictated to Chico Xavier. The case took place in October 1979, {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Goiás. Thus; the supposed spirit of Maurício, freed his best friend from the accusation of murder claiming that it had been an accident.|$|E

For there to be robbery there must be [...] "force or fear" [...] in perpetrating the theft. Questions concerning the degree of force necessary for robbery {{have been the subject of}} much litigation. Merely snatching <b>the</b> property <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim's</b> person is not sufficient force unless <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> resists or one of the items is attached or carried in such a way that a significant amount of force must be used to free <b>the</b> item <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim's</b> person.|$|R
2500|$|Moreover, {{as members}} of their {{respective}} country’s militaries, peacekeepers also carry {{with them in the}} peace operations the [...] "hyper-masculine culture" [...] that encourages sexual exploitation and abuse. This claim is supported by {{the fact that most of}} the peacekeepers are male. As of November 2003, while there are 81,181 male peacekeeping soldiers, there are only 2,322 female peacekeeping troops; on the other hand, while there are 11,644 male police, only female police are only 1,273. The motivations for rape differ from the traditional perpetrators (government and rebel forces) in that rape is not part of a war strategy that contributes to fulfilling the organization’s mission, but rather more as means to relieve the perpetrators’ sexual urges most often related to the military culture. Apart from putting the victim under the threat of physical violence, perpetrators induce sexual acts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> through payment, and granting or denying humanitarian aid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crime scene}} was photographed and law {{enforcement}} flew over the area to take further photographs and to find any additional clues. Body decomposition was not advanced enough to completely alter her fingerprints, which were eventually taken. Dental information was obtained along with, years later, her DNA.

2500|$|To {{understand}} the mosquito mouthparts, {{it is helpful}} to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a dragonfly. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the hypopharynx is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still [...] "grip" [...] the [...] "food" [...] while the mandibles [...] "bite" [...] it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted [...] "U". Finally, the hypopharynx has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva {{at the end of the}} proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when pressed against it, the labrum forms a closed tube for conveying blood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E
