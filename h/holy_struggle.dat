5|$|Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam {{left for}} Cairo {{to study at}} the al-Azhar Mosque. Who he studied with is disputed by sources; some {{accounts}} say he studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and {{came into contact with}} the prominent proto-Salafist, Rashid Rida, who himself studied under Abduh, while others are skeptical of al-Qassam's relationships with either. However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well-acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused. At al-Azhar, al-Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad (<b>holy</b> <b>struggle).</b> He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ′alim and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur'an. In addition he preached as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.|$|E
5|$|Soon, however, Saladin's sons squabbled {{over the}} {{division}} of the empire. Saladin had appointed al-Afdal to the governorship of Damascus with the intention that his son should continue to see the city as his principal place of residence in order to emphasize the primacy of the jihad (<b>holy</b> <b>struggle)</b> against the Crusader states. Al-Afdal, however, found that his attachment to Damascus contributed to his undoing. Several of his father's subordinate emirs left the city for Cairo to lobby Uthman to oust him on claims he was inexperienced and intended to oust the Ayyubid old guard. Al-Adil further encouraged Uthman to act in order prevent al-Afdal's incompetence putting the Ayyubid empire in jeopardy. Thus, in 1194, Uthman openly demanded the sultanate. Uthman's claim to the throne was settled in a series of assaults on Damascus in 1196, forcing al-Afdal to leave for a lesser post at Salkhad. Al-Adil established himself in Damascus as a lieutenant of Uthman, but wielded great influence within the empire.|$|E

The committee provided him with arms and funds, and helped promote his armed campaign among the city's Muslim scholars as well as put Hananu in touch with Ibrahim al-Shaghuri, head of the Arab Army's Second Division. On orders from the Arab government in Damascus, Hananu formed an ′iṣābā in Aleppo consisting of seven men from his native Kafr Takharim, who he armed with hand-held bombs and rifles. With al-Shaghuri's assistance, Hananu later expanded his ′iṣābā to forty fighters, known as mujahidin (fighters of a <b>holy</b> <b>struggle),</b> from Kafr Takharim and organized them into four equal-sized units. According to historian Dalal Arsuzi-Elamir, {{the small size of}} each unit made them highly mobile and [...] "able to inflict chaos on French troops".

5000|$|The seventh commandment forbids {{unjustly}} taking or {{keeping the}} goods of one's neighbor and wronging {{him in any}} way with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity {{in the care of}} earthly goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good, it requires respect for the universal destination of goodsand respect for the right to private property. Catechism of the Catholic Church Catholic teaching states that in economic matters, respect for human dignity requires practicing temperance, a virtue that moderates attachment to worldly goods; justice, a virtue that preserves our neighbors rights and renders what is due; and solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule. [...] Even if it does not contradict explicit provisions of civil law, any form of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of goods lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another. The following are also considered morally illicit: speculation in which one contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation.In addition, Catholic teaching demands that contracts and promises be strictly observed. Injustices require restitution to the owner. Promises must be kept and contracts strictly observed {{to the extent that the}} commitments made in them are morally just. A significant part of economic and social life depends on the honoring of contracts between physical or moral persons - commercial contracts of purchase or sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts must be agreed to and executed in good faith. Contracts are subject to commutative justice which regulates exchanges between persons and between institutions in accordance with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice obliges strictly; it requires safeguarding property rights, paying debts, and fulfilling obligations freely contracted. Without commutative justice, no other form of justice is possible. Catechism of the Catholic Church Catholic teaching reminds that Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them [...] "renounce all that have" [...] for his sake and that of the Gospel.

50|$|Because {{of their}} history of being oppressed, Shias also {{associated}} jihad with certain passionate features, notably in the remembrance of Ashura. Mahmoud M.

Shi'î tradition carried this requirement a step further, making jihad one of the pillars or foundations (arkan) of religion. If, therefore, Husayn's struggle against the Umayyad regime must be regarded as an act of jihad, then, In the mind of devotees, the participation of the community in his suffering and its ascent to the truth of his message must also be regarded as an extension of the <b>holy</b> <b>struggle</b> of the Imam himself. The hadith from which we took the title of this chapter states this point very clearly. Ja'far al-Sadiq is said to have declared to al-Mufaddal, one of his closest disciples, 'The sigh of the sorrowful for the wrong done us is an act of praise (tasbih) God, his sorrow for us is an act of worship, and his keeping of our secret is a struggle (jihad) in the way of God'; the Imâm then added, 'This hadith should be inscribed in letters of gold'.|$|E

40|$|Islam {{has been}} under {{intensive}} ongoing crusade for centuries. It has been made into {{what might be called}} the cause of all the problems and ills that afflict the world. Every Westerner with a political axe to grind is being given centre stage to pontificate on Islam. Western political leaders have also adopted an apocalyptic discourse to ratchet up their rhetoric so as to talk in God’s name of the <b>holy</b> <b>struggle</b> against evil: Islam. Attacks have, therefore, been carried out against Arabs and Muslims in the West for the one and only simple fact that they are Arabs and Muslims. Islam, in Western eyes, is thus an invalid religion that must be rooted out from the soul of the world. This paper will be seeking to rebut these allegations and claims, prove that the West’s blindness to the truth has led it to perceive Islam as incompatible with the principles, prerequisites, and civil ethics of the Western world, and with the world at large. and provide evidence that it was under the sky of Islam that the human mind had most fully flourished and developed some of its choicest gifts, had most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and had found solutions for some of them which deserved the attention even of those who studied Plato and Kant. Ultimately, it will be illustrating that it is time to come out of the narrow shell of misrepresentation, hostile and oriental stereotype, parochialism and communalism, religious rancour, and politics, and illuminate the track of humanity by holding high the lamp of wisdom, by giving form and shape to the great and noble dreams that were cherished by the immortal prophets and philosophers of the past so that the whole world might declare that the light has come from the East and saved the West from doom and destruction...|$|E
