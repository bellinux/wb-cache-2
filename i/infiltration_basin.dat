25|$|In the CMWU damage {{assessment}} report, waste water networks in Gaza City, Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia have sustained severe damage. The Ash Sheikh 'Ijleen sewage plant which treats the raw sewage {{of an area}} inhabited by 400,000 people {{has been out of}} order since it was struck by a shell in the second week of the conflict. The final report of the {{damage assessment}} carried out by the CMWU reveals that repairing the water and wastewater network and facilities will cost approximately 6 million US dollars, including 830,000 dollars to repair the wastewater network. According to the Palestinian Hydrology Group, solid waste is accumulating in most areas affected by the hostilities, with the exception of Gaza city where only two areas face problems with solid waste. The group also reported that on 13 February, 3,000 litres of fuel had leaked into wastewater <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> of the Beit Lahia emergency wastewater treatment plant, posing a risk for chemical contamination of the aquifer by hydrocarbons. Major repairs can not take place without the entry of needed spare parts into Gaza, which remains problematic.|$|E

5000|$|A sump in a {{basement}} can be built in drywell form, allowing the sump pump to cycle less frequently (handling only occasional peak demand).

50|$|An <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> (also {{known as}} a {{recharge}} basin or in some areas, a sump or percolation pond), {{is a type of}} best management practice (BMP) that is used to manage stormwater runoff, prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay. It is essentially a shallow artificial pond that is designed to infiltrate stormwater though permeable soils into the groundwater aquifer.

50|$|A {{percolation}} test (colloquially {{called a}} perc test) {{is a test}} to determine the water absorption rate of soil (that is, its capacity for percolation) {{in preparation for the}} building of a septic drain field (leach field) or <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin.</b> The results of a percolation test are required to properly design a septic system. In its broadest terms, percolation testing is simply observing how quickly a known volume of water dissipates into the subsoil of a drilled hole of known surface area. While every jurisdiction will have its own laws regarding the exact calculations for the length of line, depth of pit, etc., the testing procedures are the same.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the very}} high {{groundwater}} fluctuations and {{despite the lack of}} space, a sealed ground water lake with a high water table was built. The lakes water-impermeable layers (tertiary) are sealed around and create a dense run off trough. To avoid groundwater damming, three basic water transfers (culverts) were built allow water to transfer from south to north, and in addition to the run off area, the groundwater is pumped out of the ground in the other surrounding areas and flows into the lake. Through an overflow area at the western end of the lake, the access water is purified in the <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> and fed into the ground water. Through the exchange of water, a consistent water quality can be ensured.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a drywell with {{a series}} of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help {{facilitate}} percolation. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> defeating its purpose. Depression-focused recharge of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high water table. In some cases lined bioretention cells with subsurface drainage are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.|$|E

40|$|International audienceManaged aquifer {{recharge}} (MAR) {{has been}} developed in many countries to limit the risk of urban flooding and compensate for reduced groundwater recharge in urban areas. The environmental performances of MAR systems like <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> depend on the efficiency of soil and vadose zone to retain stormwater-derived contaminants. However, these performances need to be finely evaluated for stormwater-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) that can affect groundwater quality. Therefore, {{this study examined the}} performance of MAR systems to process DOM during its transfer from <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> to an urban aquifer. DOM characteristics (fluorescent spectroscopic properties, biodegradable and refractory fractions of dissolved organic carbon -DOC-, consumption by micro-organisms during incubation in slow filtration sediment columns) were measured in stormwater during its transfer through three <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> during a stormwater event. DOC concentrations sharply decreased from surface to the aquifer for the three MAR sites. This pattern was largely due to the retention of biodegradable DOC which was more than 75 % for the three MAR sites, whereas the retention of refractory DOC was more variable and globally less important (from 18 % to 61 % depending on MAR site). Slow filtration column experiments also showed that DOC retention during stormwater infiltration through soil and vadose zone was mainly due to aerobic microbial consumption of the biodegradable fraction of DOC. In parallel, measurements of DOM characteristics from groundwaters influenced or not by MAR demonstrated that stormwater infiltration increased DOC quantity without affecting its quality (% of biodegradable DOC and relative aromatic carbon content eestimated by SUVA 254 -). The present study demonstrated that pro- cesses occurring in soil and vadose zone of MAR sites were enough efficient to limit DOC fluxes to the aquifer. Nevertheless, the enrichments of DOC concentrations measured in groundwater below <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> need to be considered in future studies to especially assess their impact on groundwater quality...|$|R
40|$|Nonpoint source {{pollution}} {{captured by}} urban stormwater runoff {{is the greatest}} challenge for surface water quality improvements. Computer-based design tools {{have been developed to}} help mediate this issue by guiding end users through the implementation of decentralized stormwater management. The majority of these tools focus on treatment via biofiltration, yet concern regarding this treatment regime is rising. Case studies from research past clearly indicate the susceptibility of groundwater to contamination from extensive anthropogenic activity at the surface. Contaminants, such as nitrates and pathogens, are not completely removed before runoff enters the underground watercourse. Additionally, national and state legislation, which explicitly lists where neglect for groundwater quality is permissibleâ€”exacerbate concerns. This research analyzes the efficiency the BMP Siting Tool developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Grey-to-Green Decision Support Tool developed by the University of South Florida. The tools were used to obtain cartographic data illustrating suitable sites for bioswales and <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> throughout northern portion of Hillsborough County, Florida. This data was then integrated with the Karst Aquifer Vulnerability Index (KAVI) groundwater vulnerability model. The area of bioswales and <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> that intersected areas of the KAVI model listed as â€˜highly vulnerableâ€™ or â€˜moderate-to-highly vulnerableâ€™ was calculated. This permitted an assessment of which BMP facility had the greatest sitings atop vulnerable areas, respective of the tool. The BMP Siting Tool sited 2. 80 % of all bioswales and 27. 89 % of all <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> above vulnerable areas. Likewise, the Grey-to-Green Decision Support Tool sited 21. 66 % of all bioswales and 9. 62 % of all <b>infiltration</b> <b>basins</b> above vulnerable areas.

An <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> next to the intake serves to contain water when the flow rate is too high for the intake, to avoid flooding. Since 1933, the stream has been carried by an underground concrete pipeline from this point up to the railway triangle south of the A94 at the southernmost point of the Munich district called Bogenhausen, where it feeds the HÃ¼llgraben, which starts from there. The pipe runs under KampenwandstraÃŸe, turns along the Hachinger-Bach-StraÃŸe east until St.-Veit-StraÃŸe. It runs north under St.-Veit-StraÃŸe until it leads to the point when it flows into the HÃ¼llgraben.

40|$|Infiltration basins {{are widely}} {{employed}} stormwater control measures (SCMs) {{to manage and}} treat urban stormwater runoff. However, these SCMs experience progressive failure and the environmental functionality of such `failed' infiltration basins in managing stormwater runoff is unknown. The purpose of this research study was to systematically quantify through field-scale research, the hydrologic and water quality performances of a failed <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> facility managing highway runoff in Maryland, U. S. A. Stormwater runoff flows were continuously monitored and representative runoff samples were collected during storm events and for time periods between events over a three-year research period. Runoff samples were analyzed for a suite of pollutants including total suspended solids, nitrogen species, phosphorus, heavy metals, and chloride, that are of greatest concern in roadway runoff. The hydrologic and water quality performances were quantified using appropriate performance metrics and compared to established goals. The research study showed that the failed <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> was naturally transforming into a wetland and/or wetpond-like practice and possessed both hydrologic management and water quality functions. The transforming <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> effectively reduced the highway runoff flows by providing dynamic flow attenuation, and total volume and peak flow reductions. Water quality improvements were achieved through reductions in the mean pollutant concentrations and pollutant mass for all water quality parameters during both storm events and dry-weather periods. The discharge concentrations met the established water quality goals for all pollutants except total phosphorus. Comprehensive analysis of various pollutant species, coupled with hydrologic analysis and characterization of environmental conditions in the <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> during different seasons and storm characteristics, showed that sedimentation, adsorption, and denitrification were the main mechanisms controlling water quality at the facility. The <b>infiltration</b> <b>basin</b> also provided ancillary benefits such as wildlife habitat, which added an overall ecological value to the facility. The transforming infiltration basins providing both hydrologic and water quality functions must be considered as functioning, innovative SCMs. Results and research information obtained from this study are applicable for assessing similar SCM facilities and improve understanding of SCM performances and designs. Ultimately, the knowledge obtained will lead to widespread and reliable implementation of SCMs for improved environmental quality...|$|E
