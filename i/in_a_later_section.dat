25|$|The {{condition}} that γ'A(λ) ≤ μ'A(λ) can be proven by considering a particular eigenvalue ξ of A and diagonalizing the first γ'A(ξ) columns of A {{with respect to}} the eigenvectors of ξ, described <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>section.</b> The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix ξI'γ'A(ξ). As a result, the characteristic polynomial of B will have a factor of (ξ−λ)γ'A(ξ). The other factors of the characteristic polynomial of B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of B is no less than the geometric multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.|$|E

50|$|A {{portion of}} the Federal Route 8 {{was a part of}} the 80-mile Kuala Kubu-Kuala Lipis Road, the {{earliest}} trunk road in Pahang, which was constructed by the Public Works Department in 1887.

30|$|Given {{that social}} media and their {{popularity}} are but one outcome {{of what is}} {{commonly referred to as}} the “knowledge society”, they can be seen as essential policy response. According to Keenan et al. “(…) it is reflexive to apply foresight to issues of the knowledge society, using knowledge society tools to examine the knowledge society itself” [24]. Thereby, for the authors, foresight is based on several features: They describe knowledge as “widely dispersed” and constantly changing, but above all necessary to “(…) inform decisions (…) for policies and strategies to be based on sound evidence and expert opinion”. This qualifies social media an ideal solution for foresight policy making, even though—depending on the digitalisation progress <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given society—one must be aware to be stirring <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spectrum “from technocratic to democratic decision making” [24]. This is especially due to the “digital divide” that is prevalent in almost any society and excluding citizens that are computer/social media illiterate and/or for other reasons unable to get internet access. In most Western societies, digital participation is dependent from gender, age, education, and income [cf. e.g. 25]. This {{is one of the most}} obvious limitations that governments using social media for decision making are confronted with, which will be discussed more <b>in</b> depth at <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>section.</b>|$|R
40|$|Shape {{factors have}} been used to {{calculate}} the shape effi ciency of palm leaf petiole sections in order to understand how palms compensate for the torsional and bending forces they are subjected to by their environment. The part of the palm leaf that is similar in form to the leaf stalk (petiole) in dicot leaves will be referred to as <b>a</b> petiole <b>in</b> this paper, whilst recognising that it is probably not an exact homologue. Wind and rain on the blade generate combined fl exural and torsion loads on the petiole and a question arises as to how the section properties of the petiole deal with this loading. By isolating the shape from the size of the sections through the use of shape factors, the effects of the petiole section shape can be analysed on its own. Thus microstructural and material factors become a separate issue and will be discussed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> paper. Cross <b>section</b> profi les from seven palm petioles are modelled, independent of their sizes, in order to calculate and plot the fl exural and torsional coupling effi ciencies for comparison with other plants and typical engineering cross sections...|$|R

5000|$|From the {{perspective}} of the theory, sonata form engages two principal levels of compositional design: tonal and rhetorical. The tonal layout of sonata form has frequently been described by theorists, and involves a motion from the tonic to <b>a</b> secondary key <b>in</b> the exposition, answered by a return and solidification of the tonic later in the piece (usually in the recapitulation). The rhetorical form, on the other hand, concerns the manner in which themes, textures, and musical ideas are presented; it [...] "includes personalized factors of design and ad hoc expression: modular and textural layout, selection and arrangement of musical topics, varieties of structural punctuation, and so on." [...] A key consideration of the theory in this regard is the rotational layout of the usual sonata design. An exposition usually presents a number of differing musical ideas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specific order. <b>Later</b> <b>sections</b> of the piece (such as the development, recapitulation, and coda) usually revisit these ideas in the same order—though not necessarily touching on every one—as if rotating through a pre-set sequence, like hours on a clock or channels on a television dial.|$|R
40|$|In 1914, Wittgenstein {{recorded}} <b>an</b> incident <b>in</b> his Notebooks that {{he later}} mentioned to several friends as occasioning a major insight for his {{views in the}} Tractatus that propositions represent by being pictures. The entry reads: "In the proposition a world is as it were put together experimentally. (<b>As</b> when <b>in</b> the law-court <b>in</b> Paris <b>a</b> motor-car accident is represented by means of dolls, etc.) " This incident, he said, was pivotal in coming to the view in the Tractatus that propositions represent by being pictures. In his later writings as well, investigations {{of what it is}} to understand a proposition remain tied to investigations of what it is to understand a picture. Numerous scholars have looked to Hertz' Priniciples of Mechanics as the element of Wittgenstein's milieu from which he drew the notions of model and picture used in the Tractatus; that they have done so may be due to a brief parenthetical remark <b>in</b> <b>a</b> much <b>later</b> <b>section</b> of the Tractatus. However, I think that a far more relevant source of a notion of model in Wittgenstein's milieu was the engineering scale model. The methodology of scale modelling is strikingly different from analytical methods, in just those ways that are important to the notion of picturing found in the Tractatus: the primary notion is that of translatability between two physical situations, rather than between a physical situation and a mathematical or linguistic representation, or, even, between two physically similar situations whose similarity is established by showing that they are both instantiations of the same more general equation or general description. The notion fits well with the remark: "The essential nature of the propositional sign becomes very clear when we think of it as made up of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, books) instead of written signs (3. 1. 4. 3. 1). " It's also significant that the methodology of scale modelling can be used when one has no theory by which the behavior of the model can be predicted, or, even, a theory of the phenomenon being investigated. Since wind tunnels were already in use when Wittgenstein did his engineering studies, the concept of scale model would actually have been in his milieu much earlier than the pivotal 1914 notebook entry. However, the methodology of scale modelling was then more a matter of engineering practice than it was a formal methodology. At the time Wittgenstein recorded the insight about a world being "put together experimentally", the field was at a threshold. Formal foundations for the practice were just then being developed; it was in 1914 that Buckingham's proof about the minimum number of dimensionless groups needed to identify physically similar situations was presented in London.
