Many teachers have dropped the engaging lessons and activities that have shown to be effective to inspire students to learn. Because of this, many students are failing to make gains in long-term learning {{simply because they are}} bored by the <b>dry,</b> ???<b>drill</b> and kill??? style of teaching many schools are using to meet annual testing goals. The curriculum unit created for this project attempted to address both the need for engaging lessons that capture students??? interest that also pushes students to learn the basics set forth in the California state standards for seventh grade English-Language Arts (ELA). Through the use of four assignments that were centered on the discussion of multicultural food traditions and cooking, students in a seventh grade ELA intervention class utilized the skills and strategies from the state standards to create final products. Students in the pilot class showed improved gains in their learning of both reading and writing standards, but most importantly showed a high level of engagement which led to higher student participation rates and work completion. The pilot showed that students who are engaged in the classroom activities because of high interest lessons will be more motivated to complete assignments, thus ensuring higher levels of learning and theoretically lead to higher annual assessment scores.

Im Rahmen dieser Dissertation wurde eine Methodik entwickelt, mit deren Hilfe Problembereiche ausgehalten und somit Maßnahmen im aktiven mitteldeutschen Tagebaubetrieb ergriffen werden können, um die zukünftige Beeinflussung der umgebenden Grund- und Oberflächenwasserkörper zu minimieren. An Vorfeldsedimenten konnten in Feld-eluaten, Stoßbeprobungen und Verwitterungsversuchen geochemische Eigenschaften ermittelt werden. In resultierenden Pufferungsversuchen aus karbonathaltigen Geschiebe-mergeln und Hauptaciditätsträgern konnte eine langfristige Minderung der Aciditätswirkung nachgewiesen werden und ein adaptierter Regelkippenaufbau mit laminaren, alterierenden Sichtaufbau begründet werden. In umliegenden Altkippengrundwässern sind Pufferung und Sulfatreduktion als Wiederfestlegungsprozesse der AMD-Problemstoffe belegt worden. For {{lignite mining}} {{extensive}} overburden masses {{have to be}} moved. Due to the ventilation of the overburden by atmospheric oxygen, there is a weathering of mostly tertiary sulfides. The rebound of groundwater in future tippings dissolves sulfate, iron, heavy metal and H+ ions, resulting from the pyrite weathering. The partial mobilization of overburden sulfides are opposed to hydrogeochemical buffer reactions e. g. the buffering by carbonates {{as the first step}} of buffering. Therefore, there are the questions to the mining operators of the measures that can be taken to minimize the geochemical influence of the surrounding ground and surface water bodies. Object of this PhD-thesis is to lead a methodology that helps to characterize the future tilting substrates to find technological and strategic measures for minimizing the acid water formation in the active open pit operation. In Field eluates and weathering tests in the laboratory and in the field, sediments from <b>dry</b> <b>drill</b> holes in the forefront of open pits “Schleenhain” and “Peres” it could be shown that the geological facies formation of sediments has a decisive influence on geochemical characteristics. As the main acidifying sediment the tertiary aquifer number 2 (lying part) and number 3 can be identified with their high sulfur contents. With increasing time of oxygen exposure sulfate, iron, heavy metal and H + ions released massively. Furthermore, it appears that carbonate buffer essentially are available as glacial till only in cohesive Quaternary. With the resulting buffering experiments from glacial till and the most acidic aquifer sediments a long-term retention of iron, heavy metal and H + - ion and a reduction of sulfate release can be shown, if there is a share of at least 40 % glacial till to the lying aquifer number 2 sediments or 20 % glacial till to the aquifer number 3. The groundwater quality monitoring of unstructured resaturated old dumps near to the active open pits is comparable to a field test. In addition to weathering zones with high levels of pollutants in the presence of carbonates, buffering processes and sulfate reduction with precipitation of problematic substances in secondary mineral phases can be detected. Blending the research results of geological and geochemical data, an important, in principle selectively recoverable, buffer potential already exists. The determined mixing ratio from 80 - 60 mass-% acidic sediments to 20 - 40 mass-% buffering sediment from the buffering experiments can be realized in tilting. In the open pit “Schleenhain” the missing buffering material can be compensated by mass offset from the open pit “Peres”. With the use of the already existing equipment, it is possible to establish a laminar, alternately tipping body with good geochemical and geotechnical conditions...|$|E

However, water adverseky affects tri- cone drill bits commonly used in surface drilling operations, causing excessive wear and premature replacement. Consequently, <b>dry</b> <b>drilling</b> with a dust collector system has the most widespread use in the industry.

The ease of machinability of this material makes it a more desirable operand in manufacturing usage. Hence, in this research, a study was undertaken to perform a comparative analysis of dry and cold air drilling on 6061 aluminium alloy. The drill tool used in the drilling process was HSS Cobalt coated tool which has not featured in many research papers. Subsequently, the quality of each hole was identified based on the diameter accuracy of the hole and the surface roughness of the hole. A variation in the parameters was employed to identify the best feed rate and spindle speed that can accommodate a quality hole. In addition, during the drilling operations, force was measured to analyse the ensemble of parameters that present the highest and lowest force.

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} how to {{determine}} the chloride content in concrete structures exposed to marine environment in an accurate way. When analyzing dust from <b>dry</b> <b>drilling</b> in concrete, it is very often {{a fact that the}} chloride profiles show extensive variations even if the sampling has been performed within a very concentrated area with the sampling points close to each other. Several authors have observed this phenomenon in earlier research and some of these are referred to in this thesis. The aim of this project has been to find reasons to these extensive variations and to find inspection methods that decrease the variations. Both laboratory studies and field studies have been performed within the line of this work. The laboratory study has consisted of concrete sampling by <b>dry</b> <b>drilling</b> and by profile grinding 100 mm cores on a concrete slab that had been submerged in saline water in the laboratory. The chloride profiles from the cores have been used as a reference to all other samples collected on the slab. The study shows that profile grinding of cores is the most accurate method to perform sampling on concrete with the purpose of analyzing the chloride content, and that when using small bore diameters the sampling should be performed as mixed samples from several bore holes. In all cases, samples should not only be analyzed for chloride but also for binder content. The results from the <b>dry</b> <b>drilling</b> in laboratory shows that the binder content becomes over estimated in the dust samples compared to the analyzed cores on the same concrete slab. This means that the analyzed dust samples seams to contain a higher chloride content than the cores analyzed by profile grinding. This phenomenon became obvious when simulating chloride profiles using data from EPMA. Most probably the drilling follows an easy path between the large aggregate particles. One field study has been performed in the port of Trelleborg in southern Sweden and another one in the port of Malmö, also in southern Sweden within some 50 km distance but facing the open sea in different directions. The field study in Trelleborg has consisted of an inventory of existing concrete structures in the harbour and climate studies of the wind and temperature in the area followed by a more detailed inspection including sampling on selected parts of a quay. This study shows that the exposure to open sea clearly influences the chloride content in concrete structures exposed to marine environment more than the main wind direction. The field study in the port of Malmö also confirms this finding. The conclusions of this work is that when sampling concrete on structures in marine environment it is important not only to study the surrounding environmental loads such as the dominating wind direction, but also the exposure of the structure to the open sea which has shown to be of great importance in the field studies. If it is possible, the sampling should be performed by profile grinding cores. The studies in the laboratory have shown that sampling cores gives small variations in the analyzed chloride content. If <b>dry</b> <b>drilling</b> is used, the diameter of the drill bit should not be smaller than 20 mm.
