40|$|Bio-composites are {{increasing}} in demand due to governmental incentives {{across the globe}} for both environmental and human health reasons. The ideal bio-composite is renewable, recyclable, available, and non-toxic. To properly engineer bio-composite products, the physical properties of the fiber as well as fiber/matrix interactions must be known. The problem {{lies in the fact}} that many suitable natural fibers are not currently available in a material form that may be easily worked with. This research investigates methods to process raw kenaf (hibiscus cannabinus) on a scale that allows researchers to make more consistent samples for testing. Though kenaf is highlighted, these processing methods may be applied to any natural fiber. The raw fibers are processed into kenaf chopped strand mats (KCSM) by adapting basic paper-making techniques. KCSM exhibit paper-like qualities and mechanical properties and provide a material of uniform thickness for use in composite parts. Also presented are a basic understanding of natural fiber constituents and effects of mechanical and co-mechanical treatments on those constituents. To test KCSM, samples are made for the ASTM D 3039 tensile testing and for testing in a dynamic material analyzer (DMA). Both mechanically and chemo-mechanically processed samples are made for the purpose of comparison. Also, <b>I-beam</b> <b>bridges</b> are built with KCSM to demonstrate how KCSM may be used to create a structure. This is spurred on by the annual SAMPE bridge competition that includes special categories for natural fiber beams. The lay-up procedure is shown in detail to provide a framework that future competitors may use to build quality I-beams for this competition. The properties obtained by using the KCSM are competitive with other reported properties for kenaf-based composites. A kenaf I-beam demonstrates a strength-to-weight ratio that is 65 % of a berglass I-beam built to the same dimensions. Trade-os of using KCSM are the random 2 d-fiber orientation and brittle failure, which are not usually desirable in composite components. The chemically treated samples indicate a higher degree of crystallinity but demonstrate inferior mechanical properties when compared to the untreated samples...|$|R

5000|$|This is {{yet another}} {{original}} section of the old Lincoln Highway from 1913. The east-west section of roadway {{is now part of}} County Road E39, and the north-south section of the roadway is part of Iowa Highway 25. The highways are located on relatively level farmland. There are 13 contributing resources to this historic district, 11 structures and two objects. [...] The structures include the 4.35 mi of roadway, the road drainage system, eight culverts, and a skew <b>I-beam</b> <b>bridge.</b> Empire Construction paved this section of the Lincoln Highway in 1924. Part of the paving project included {{the construction of a new}} bridge. The I-beam structure was completed by C.J. Kramme of Fort Dodge, Iowa for $5,413. It replaced an earlier wooden span. The objects are two property markers located on private property where the road turns south from County Road E39 onto Iowa 25. They were placed here by James E. Moss, who farmed the land and was an ardent supporter of the Lincoln Highway. Moss was a Civil War veteran who lost a foot at Missionary Ridge. He had these identical markers erected in 1926 as memorials to Abraham Lincoln, whom he considered [...] "one of our greatest citizens." [...] They are concrete structures created by Harold Carlisle of Jefferson, and are capped by a concrete bust of Abraham Lincoln. The original busts were broken off and have been replaced. An [...] "L" [...] is stamped on the shoulder of the base, and [...] "J.E. Moss" [...] stamped on front. Similar markers were to be erected at several other points in Greene County, but there is no evidence that they ever were.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation is}} performed aiming at identifying the applicability and the seismic efficiency of an unconventional abutment, which restrains the seismic {{movements of the}} bridge deck. The abutment consists of {{the extension of the}} deck slab of the bridge onto transversely directed R/C walls with which the, so-called continuity slab, is monolithically connected. The restraining walls play the role of an additional horizontal and relatively flexible support of the deck of the bridge. The design of these restraining walls is based on two criteria referring to on one hand the accommodation of the in-service induced longitudinal movements of the deck {{and on the other hand}} on the earthquake loading of the walls. The walls are constructed in a concrete box-shaped substructure, which replaces the conventional wing-walls and retains the backfill material. The foundation of the abutment is checked and found to have adequate resistance against sliding and overturning. The proposed abutment was attempted to be implemented in a precast <b>I-beam</b> <b>bridge.</b> The study showed that the abutment can achieve a desirable control of the seismic movements of the deck and therefore reduces the seismic actions of the bearings, the piers and their foundation. The restraining effect of the abutment is also significant even in stiffer bridge resisting systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
50|$|The South Dakota Dept. of Transportation Bridge No. 20-153-210 is a {{historic}} bridge in Deuel County, South Dakota. It carries 187th Street across Cobb Creek, about 2 mi east of Brandt.

5000|$|The 1931 Jeffersonville Bridge was a Parker {{through truss}} structure, with steel girder {{approaches}} at both ends.

The total length of the bridge was about 200 ft. It had a deck of concrete laid on steel <b>I-beam</b> stringers. The <b>bridge</b> was built in 1931 by the American Bridge Company, and was built using standards and practices adopted by the state after its devastating 1927 floods. Although the bridge rebuilding program after that flood formally ended in 1930, this bridge was built applying the same principles for selection of bridge type (based on the length of the span) and construction practices.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the static and dynamic testing of a three-span continuous <b>I-beam</b> highway <b>bridge.</b> Live load stress frequency curves for selected points are shown, and the static and dynamic load distribution to the longitudinal composite beam members are given. The bridge has four traffic lanes with a roadway width of 48 ft. Six longitudinal continuous WF beams act compositely with the reinforced concrete slab to carry the live load. The beams have partial length cover plates at the piers. Previous research has indicated that beams with partial length cover plates have a very low fatigue strength. It was found in this research that the magnitude of the stresses due to actual highway loads were very much smaller than those computed from specification loading. Also, the larger stresses which were measured occurred {{a relatively small number of}} times. These data indicate that some requirements for reduced allowable stresses at the ends of cover plates are too conservative. The load distribution to the longitudinal beams was determined for static and moving loads and includes the effect of impact on the distribution. The effective composite section was found at various locations to evaluate the load distribution data. The composite action was in negative as well as positive moment regions. The load distribution data indicate that the lateral distribution of live load is consistent with the specifications, but that there is longitudinal distribution, and therefore the specifications are too conservative...|$|R
30|$|Transverse {{cracking}} {{on these}} decks {{may also be}} related to structural-related stresses, such as restrained shrinkage effects due to connections on steel girders, negative bending moments over steel supports or other structural-related stresses. These cracks could have also occurred due to loads applied too soon after the deck was constructed, or other reasons. These two bridges are also two of the oldest bridges included in the study, and traffic loads could {{also play a role}} in the development of transverse cracks. Bridge decks with stay-in-place metal forms (bridge decks 8 N/ 8 L and 9 N/ 9 L) also tended to exhibit more longitudinal and transverse cracking than bridge decks on precast concrete girders and non-continuous steel girders. Stay-in-place metal forms are not typically considered to be bonded to the concrete deck, although some restraint due to partial bonding and friction can be expected. It is interesting to note that although all four of these bridges have stay-in-place forms, they are supported by different types of girders, with bridges 8 L and 9 L on widened steel <b>I-beams,</b> while <b>bridges</b> 8 N and 9 N have stay-in-place forms on prestressed concrete girders. Some of the cracking observed on the bridge decks 8 N, 8 L, 9 N, and 9 L may also be attributable to the superstructure design, rather than from concrete materials-related causes. Other bridge decks exhibiting transverse cracks (albeit to a lesser extent than in bridge decks 6 N, 6 L, 7 N, 7 L, 8 N, 8 L, 9 N, and 9 L), include bridge decks 1 L, 3 N, and 5 N.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{extensive}} literature review, parametric study and four full-scale 23. 8 m (78 ft) long NU- 1100 I-beams with a composite deck slab shear testing results, the following {{conclusions can be}} made on shear. (1) An integrated and simplified shear design model has been developed. It {{has been found that}} the proposed model results in a much simpler design without sacrificing the shear capacity of the prestressed concrete members and without significantly impacting the cost. (2) For properly detailed prestressed concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>I-beams,</b> one can approach 0. 25 fc'bdv for maximum shear reinforcement. A key factor is the anchorage of the longitudinal reinforcement. (3) The horizontal wires of the orthogonal welded wire fabric {{have been found to be}} extremely effective to control shear cracking and increase the shear capacity. ^ Based on the strut-and-tie model analysis and eight 3. 1 m (10 ft) long NU- 1100 post-tensioned I-beams testing, the following conclusions are made on post-tensioned anchorage zone. (1) Two optimized anchorage zone details have been developed. The reduced tapered anchorage zone details are recommended to be used for all sizes of the NU I-beams. (2) Modification of the current available I-beam forms is not needed except an additional small form of about 1. 0 m (3. 3 ft) long. (3) Reinforcement in the anchorage zone is designed to resist post-tensioning bursting force in combination with vertical shear. ^ Based on the analysis and three 12. 2 m (40 ft) long NU- 1100 I-beams with 203 mm (8. 0 in.) deck slab testing, the following conclusions are made on beam continuity for negative moment. (1) Making the beams continuous before casting the deck can increase the span capacity and help increasing the composite action between the deck slab and the beam. (2) The continuity method using Grade 634 MPa (92 ksi) threaded rods has been developed. The developed connection details have performed well and are recommended as a standard non-prestressing beam continuity method. (3) The bulky bottom flange of the NU I-beam has been found to have at least 1. 51 times the designed ultimate negative moment capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based damage identification techniques for damage localization and severity prediction in I-beam and steel girder bridge structures using modal properties. In this research, experimental modal analysis and numerical simulations of these structures were carried out to generate dynamic parameters of structures and also to investigate the applicability of ANNs and ANFIS for improved structural damage identification. Vibration data from a scaled down steel girder bridge deck and nine I-beams structures with regard to different damage scenarios for each structure were measured to obtain the first five natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structures. Single and multiple damage cases which include double, triple and quad damages were induced in I-beam structures, while only single damage was inflicted in the girder bridge at different locations. Also, numerical modeling of these structures and computation of the responses were carried out using commercial software. In this research, a combination of natural frequencies and mode shapes for the first five modes of these structures were selected as the input parameters for damage identification purpose. In damage identification using ANNs, five individual networks corresponding to mode 1 to mode 5 were trained, and then a method based on neural network ensemble was proposed to combine the outcomes of the individual neural networks to a single network. Based on this study, ANNs were able to detect the severity and location in single and multiple damages accurately. Some insignificant errors for numerical datasets due to modeling errors of the structure and some less accurate results due to the existence of node points in the structure were demonstrated. The ensemble network produces better damage identification outcomes than the individual networks and shows high accuracy of damage identification predictions. Besides that, results show the ANFIS model could identify the severity and location of damage in <b>I-beam</b> and girder <b>bridge</b> structures with high level of accuracy and demonstrated that the outcomes of ANFIS were very close to targets and the developed ANFIS model can be applied as a very strong tool for identification of damage. By incorporating ANNs and ANFIS techniques, the potential and accuracy of damage identification can be improved and some significant major problems of conventional methods can be overcome. According to the results of the comparative study, although both ANNs and ANFIS presented good predictions, ANNs were very sensitive to insufficient and noisy datasets as compared to ANFIS. However, ANFIS provided a structure for the combination of fuzzy logic and ANNs and was less sensitive to insufficient and noisy data and showed more flexible technique than ANN. The comparative study showed that, although in some cases both techniques demonstrated high level of predictions, the ANFIS showed a superior capability to damage predictions using vibration datasets of structures. In conclusion, the ANFIS technique outperformed the ANN and demonstrated the best performance with lowest AE and highest correlation coefficient...|$|R
