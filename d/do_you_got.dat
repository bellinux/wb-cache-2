500|$|Lawrence Tierney {{was cast}} as Alton Benes. He {{was known for}} his bad-guy roles in films during the 1940s and 1950s, such as Dillinger, The Hoodlum and Born to Kill. Tierney's {{appearance}} in the episode is one of his only comedic roles. Cast and crew members were very impressed with Tierney's performance, and intended to make Alton Benes a recurring character. However, they were frightened of him; during filming it was discovered that Tierney had stolen a butcher knife from the knife block in Jerry's apartment set. Various cast members remember Seinfeld encountering Tierney and stating [...] "Hey Lawrence, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> there in your jacket?". Tierney, realizing he had been caught, tried to make a joke about how he thought taking the knife would be funny, by reenacting a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), holding the knife above his head and making threatening motions towards Seinfeld. Tom Cherones, Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus saw this happen, and, as Alexander recalled, it [...] "scared the living crap out of all of us." [...] Cherones stated that, afterwards, Larry David would jokingly threaten to have Tierney back on the show if Cherones did his work badly.|$|E

5000|$|... "What Do You Got?" [...] is a {{song that}} was written by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora and Brett James, {{produced}} by Howard Benson and co-produced by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora. It was recorded in Bay 7 Studios in Valley Village and Sparky Dark Studios in Calabasas, California. The song was written during sessions for The Circle (2009), but it didn't fit that album, so band decided to hold it and finished it for the Greatest Hits (2010). Lyrically, the song is about the esthetic of love. Richie Sambora explained: [...] "It's a worldly thing and it doesn't have to be exactly about romance. It could be about with your family, daughter or son. What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> If you ain't got love. It's a profound statement in it's simplicity." ...|$|E
5000|$|By 2009, CIDC {{dropped the}} [...] "dot" [...] from its branding, {{referring}} the station as [...] "Zee 103-5" [...] and unveiling a new slogan, [...] "All The Hits". Rival CKFM-FM switched from adult top 40 to contemporary hit radio {{due to high}} airplay on top-played singles, while CIDC-FM tweaked its format by adding some adult top 40 singles, such as Bon Jovi's What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got?.</b> Rival CKIS-FM dropped their rhythmic lean and went more mainstream in February 2011. At that same time, CIDC did the reverse: from mainstream to a rhythmic-lean, although it still plays {{a small percentage of}} dance music, which was slightly increased by 2015. Most non-top 40 dance hits remain at the station, although they are classics. It continues to report on Mediabase & Nielsen BDS as a contemporary hit radio. As of the summer of 2012, the station's slogan is [...] "#1 For Hit Music", following the other Top 40 stations in Toronto, KiSS 92.5 and 99.9 Virgin Radio, which both claim to be [...] "Toronto's #1 Hit Music Station!"
