5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{initially}} conceded discovery {{credit to}} Ortiz, but came to suspect the Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> observatory {{the day before}} the discovery announcement. These logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images, and they were accessed again just before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating he was merely verifying whether they had discovered a new object.|$|E
5|$|By 1700, the European {{states had}} enough troops and ships at their disposal, {{following}} {{the end of}} a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of privateers.

5|$|California has {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation than other states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the Land Claims Act of 1851 (following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that required all claims deriving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> and Mexican governments to be filed within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the Land Claims Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed claims under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E

5|$|In 1508, the Caribbean {{coast of}} Honduras was superficially {{explored}} by Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Vicente Yáñez, but {{the focus of}} their expeditions lay further to the north.

At this time there were said to be 400 relocated Maya from the same area living in Belén.|$|E
