As a subject of my study I chose the company AISIN <b>EUROPE</b> MANUFACTURING CZECH <b>s.</b> <b>r.</b> o. that currently employs 270 people. Its motivation and stimulation system has got very sofisticated structure for motivation and stimulation of the employees. As a method of my work I have chosen investigation by questionnaire, interview and observation. The questionnaire that became a starting point of my study was based on theoretical knowledge and features important for evaluation. The goal of the investigation was to analyze attitude of the employees to the individual motives and motivators and herewith {{to find out how}} they perceive fulfilment of those factors by the company. Answers to each question are displayed in a graph and a chart which are accompanied by the results and discussion. Inquired group of employees covered all the departments in the company. Getting to know the wide range of motivation and stimulation means in the company, I found out that the company AISIN <b>EUROPE</b> MANUFACTURING CZECH <b>s.</b> <b>r.</b> o. prefers material remuneration and offering benefits to the employees. Regarding remuneration, I would propose to apply flexible component of the salary that a manager could use to valuate a subordinate more often, respectively in one month period. Regarding communication and information flow, I would recommend to install digital mean of sharing information and also to place it close to the employee entrance in order to announce the changes to the employees as soon as they enter the plant. Another proposal for improvement is to start operation of company buses for the employees. Thereby the company might recruit qualified manpower also from locations close to premises of the company but currently without good trasportation service...|$|R

This company provides licences and implements original software products as well as third-party software products. First, an analysis is conducted in the given company, which then serves as basis {{for the implementation of}} the BI solution that should be interconnected with the company strategies. The main goal is the implementation of a pilot BI solution to aid the monitoring and optimisation of corporate performance. Among secondary goals are the analysis of related concepts, business strategy analysis, strategic goals and systems identification and the proposition and implementation of a pilot BI solution. In its theoretical part, this thesis focuses on the analysis of concepts related to corporate performance and BI implementations and shortly describes the company together with its business strategy. The following practical part is based on the theoretical findings. An analysis of the company is carried out using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) methodology, the result of which is depicted in a strategic map. This methodology is then supplemented by the Activity Based Costing (ABC) analytical method, which divides expenses according to assets. The results are informational data about which expenses are linked to handling individual developmental, implementational and operational demands for particular contracts. This is followed by an original proposition and the implementation of a BI solution which includes the creation of a Data Warehouse (DWH), designing Extract Transform and Load (ETL) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems and generating sample reports. The main contribution of this thesis is in providing the company management with an analysis of company data using a multidimensional perspective which can be used as basis for prompt and correct decision-making, realistic planning and performance and product optimisation...|$|R

Only two of the 90 species of Trichoptera recorded from Uruguay, belong to the genus Smicridea: Smicridea (Rhyacophylax) atrobasis Flint and Smicridea (Rhyacophylax) dentifera Flint. In this paper, seven species of the subgenus Smicridea (Rhyacophylax) Müller were identified from Uruguay: Smicridea (R.) coronata Flint, Smicridea (R.) discalis Flint, Smicridea (R.) mesembrina (Navás), Smicridea (R.) pampeana Flint, and Smicridea (R.) spinulosa Flint, recorded {{for the first time}} from this country; <b>S.</b> (<b>R.)</b> atrobasis; and <b>S.</b> (<b>R.)</b> dentifera, whose distribution is extended to the Paysandú and Salto Departments.
