5000|$|Modern rolling {{practice}} {{can be attributed}} to the pioneering efforts of Henry Cort of Funtley Iron Mills, near Fareham, England. In 1783 a patent was issued to Henry Cort for his use of <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls</b> for rolling iron bars. [...] With this new design mills were able to produce 15 times more output per day than with a hammer. Although Cort was not the first to use <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls,</b> he was first to combine the use of many of the best features of various ironmaking and shaping processes known at the time. Thus modern writers have called him [...] "father of modern rolling." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of the rolling mill in Europe {{may be attributed to}} Leonardo da Vinci in his drawings. The earliest rolling mills in crude form but the same basic principles were found in Middle East and South Asia as early as 600 BCE. Earliest rolling mills were slitting mills, which were introduced from what is now Belgium to England in 1590. These passed flat bars between rolls to form a plate of iron, which was then passed between <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls</b> (slitters) to produce rods of iron. The first experiments at rolling iron for tinplate took place about 1670. In 1697, Major John Hanbury erected a mill at Pontypool to roll 'Pontypool plates'—blackplate. Later this began to be rerolled and tinned to make tinplate. The earlier production of plate iron in Europe had been in forges, not rolling mills.|$|E
5000|$|Cort's {{innovation}} was a {{new process}} for [...] "fining" [...] iron. This became essential once blast furnaces were used to extract iron from its ore. The [...] "pig" [...] iron produced was too impure for forging (though it could be cast): fining removed the impurities. The previous method of fining used a finery hearth fuelled with charcoal. By Cort's time wood for making charcoal had long become too scarce to enable the iron industry to expand: already many blast furnaces were using coke instead of charcoal. What Cort did was to burn coal in the furnace and [...] "puddle" [...] his impure iron, i.e. stir it with a long rod in the hot gas of the flames. The purified iron came out as spongy mass, {{and had to be}} consolidated (shingling). Another of Cort's innovations was to use <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls</b> in a rolling mill rather than a hammer to draw the iron out into a bar. This enabled the iron to be rolled into bars with a variety of cross-sections (square, circular, etc.). These two brilliant innovations were the most important ones for the iron industry in the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} machine, {{it is not}} a desired feature for the {{boundary}} layer flows in the fabric and the roll surfaces to travel into the closing nips, creating overpressure. In this thesis, the aerodynamic behavior of the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> and smooth rolls is compared {{in order to understand the}} nip flow phenomena, which is the main reason why vacuum and <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> constructions are designed. A common method to remove the boundary layer flow from the closing nip is to use the vacuum roll construction. The downside of the use of vacuum rolls is high operational costs due to pressure losses in the vacuum roll shell. The deep <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> has the same goal, to create a pressure difference over the paper web and keep the paper attached to the roll or fabric surface in the drying pocket of the paper machine. A literature review revealed that the aerodynamic functionality of the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> is not very well known. In this thesis, the aerodynamic functionality of the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> in interaction with a permeable or impermeable wall is studied by varying the groove properties. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are utilized as the research tool. The simulations have been performed with commercial fluid dynamics software, ANSYS Fluent. Simulation results made with 3 - and 2 -dimensional fluid dynamics models are compared to laboratory scale measurements. The measurements have been made with a <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> simulator designed for the research. The variables in the comparison are the paper or fabric wrap angle, surface velocities, groove geometry and wall permeability. Present-day computational and modeling resources limit <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> fluid dynamics simulations in the paper machine scale. Based on the analysis of the aerodynamic functionality of the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll,</b> a <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> simulation tool is proposed. The smooth roll simulations show that the closing nip pressure does not depend on the length of boundary layer development. The surface velocity increase affects the pressure distribution in the closing and opening nips. The 3 D <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> model reveals the aerodynamic functionality of the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll.</b> With the optimal groove size it is possible to avoid closing nip overpressure and keep the web attached to the fabric surface in the area of the wrap angle. The groove flow friction and minor losses play a different role when the wrap angle is changed. The proposed 2 D <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> simulation tool is able to replicate the grooved aerodynamic behavior with reasonable accuracy. A small wrap angle predicts the pressure distribution correctly with the chosen approach for calculating the groove friction losses. With a large wrap angle, the groove friction loss shows too large pressure gradients, and the way of calculating the air flow friction losses in the groove has to be reconsidered. The aerodynamic functionality of the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> is based on minor and viscous losses in the closing and opening nips as well as in the grooves. The proposed 2 D <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> model is a simplification in order to reduce computational and modeling efforts. The simulation tool makes it possible to simulate complex paper machine constructions in the paper machine scale. In order to use the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> as a replacement for the vacuum <b>roll,</b> the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> properties have to be considered on the basis of the web handling application...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of the effect of roll-surface on the strip-surface. Improvement ofsmall cracks on the strip-surface was tried and effect of <b>groove</b> at the <b>roll</b> surface on the strip surface was shown. Design/methodology/approach: Method {{used in the present study}} was high speed twin roll caster withgrooved roll. Two kinds of grooves were used: one was parallel groove and the other was cross groove machinedby knurling and bite attached to a lathe. Findings: Findings of this research are that <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> was effective to eliminate the small cracks on the stripsurface. The contact condition between the roll and the melt became uniform by the small groove on the rollsurface. Contact area became small, and heat transfer between the melt and roll became small, too. As the result,chill structure did not become columnar, and crack did not occur. Groove pattern on the strip surface could beerased by the cold rolling. Research limitations/implications: Research limitation is that groove life could not be investigated. Practical implications: Practical implications are as below. The roll load was small and strip was not hot-rolledin a high speed twin <b>roll</b> caster. The <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> made strip-surface sound. Grooved 600 mm width roll was tested,and usefulness of the <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> was shown.

The closure and growth of transversal crack on slab corner duringmulti-pass vertical–horizontal (V–H) rolling was simulated with the explicit dynamic finite element method (FEM) and the updating geometric method. The influences of the friction coefficient, the crack size, the edger roll shape, and the fillet radius of <b>grooved</b> edger <b>roll</b> on the closure and growth of cracks were analyzed with the crack width and the contact pressure on crack surfaces. For vertical rolling, the contact pressure on crack surfaces when the <b>grooved</b> edger <b>roll</b> is used is larger than that when the flat edger roll is used. However, after horizontal rolling, the cracks open again when using the <b>grooved</b> edger <b>roll,</b> which may close well when using the flat edger roll. With increase of the fillet radii of the <b>grooved</b> edger <b>roll,</b> the contact pressure on crack surfaces increases during V 1 pass and decreases during V 2, V 3 pass. Reduction of the friction coefficient between the slab and the rolls is helpful for the crack closure for both the flat edger <b>roll</b> and the <b>grooved</b> edger <b>roll</b> during vertical rolling.

Investigations were carried out for four different starting mean rolling temperatures between 900 - 1200 oC, and four different rolling strain rates of 0. 8, 0. 4, 1. 2, and 1. 6 s- 1. Results obtained showed that for all cases, rolling in <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls</b> required more power (higher load) compared to rolling in flat rolls.

Those are extrusion, {{a combination of}} extrusion and chipping, mechanical rolling, hydraulic expansion, and sintering of metal powder, all of which involve complex operations and high production costs. Grooved rolling is introduced as a simple process to form enhanced boiling surfaces. First, the deformation caused by grooved rolling was analysed by applying a visioplasticity method with plasticine model rolling.

The saturated fibro-porous material is rolled between circumferentially <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls,</b> which enhance frictional grip and provide a low-resistance path for liquid flow during the extraction process. Previously reported two-dimensional (2 D) computational models, account for the large deformation of the porous material by solving the fully coupled governing fibre stress and fluid-flow equations using finite element techniques. While the 2 D simulations provide much insight into the overarching cause-effect relationships, predictions of mechanical quantities such as roll separating force and particularly torque {{as a function of}} roll speed and degree of compression are not satisfactory for industrial use. It is considered that the unsatisfactory response in roll torque prediction {{may be due to the}} stress levels that exist between the groove tips and roots which have been largely neglected in the geometrically simplified 2 D model.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the power required in a rolling process is the fundamental importance for the optimum planning of a rolling mill. Several models have been studied for the calculation of this parameter. These analytical models are characterized by very complex expressions, being many the parameters to consider in hot rolling: friction coefficient, temperature, roll radius, speed rolling etc. In particular, in a hot rod rolling process, the workpiece deformation is a three dimensional problem. In this paper, a hot rolling for low carbon steel rods, using <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls,</b> has been considered.

In order to predict the rolling power, Avitzur’s and Ekelund’s analytical models have been considered. These formulae {{are based on the}} monodimensional models used in flat rolling. Therefore, in order to reduce a tridimensional problem to a monodimensional one, two theories (Wusatowski and Shinokura Takay) have been used to determine the values of the equivalent heights of the incoming and outgoing workpiece.

Throughput and extraction performance {{is strongly dependent on}} material behaviour, the geometry and surface condition at the roll bagasse interface. Factories use welding procedures to arc roughen the tips of grooves in an effort to increase friction. Although industry procedures appear ad hoc it is clear that some level of roughness is crucial to performance. A similar statement can be made in respect to roll grooving given the wide variation in adopted practice. This project involved an experimental investigation into the effects of interface friction on bagasse compaction between grooved steel platens. An apparatus was developed for use in the SOE MTS testing facility. A factorial design experiment involving 105 tests randomised in blocks was conducted to discover the interaction between friction (the dependent variable) and groove angle, compaction, and roughness (independent variables). The results indicate that roughness, groove angle and compaction significantly affect friction coefficient. While roughness and groove angle contribute to increase friction coefficient, compaction causes a marked decrease. Observations on samples of bagasse exhibiting pure shear suggest that the frictional forces generated at the interface cannot be sustained by the shear strength of bagasse. Comparisons between friction coefficient and shear coefficient showed that the friction coefficient values approach the shear coefficient values under particular geometric and loading conditions.

40|$|Abstract — {{the process}} of plastic {{deformation}} of metal by passing it through the rolls called as the metal rolling. Rolling is widely used forming process, which can have high production figures and precise control of final product. Rolling is classified in two major parts the cold rolling and hot rolling. Every part has its own theory, development of rolling process and subsequently the designing of the cold rolling mill components, like rolls and rolling mill housing. The aim of the present paper is to understand the various methodologies which are used to design the cold rolling mill. We {{have focused on the}} history of the rolling process; it is understand that the rolling process was adopted since year 1590. Although it was raw method but it initiated the slitting rolling mill and the actual experimentation were started from year 1670. In those days rolling was concerned with rolling of bars only after few years the rolling of bars were started. We also tried to discuss the earlier patents which were granted in 18 th century and was related to the tandem mill which were using copper and brass as the rolling materials. In year 1783, after the entry of <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls</b> the rolling production increased up to 15 times and that was the start of modern rolling mill. While reviewing the design of rolling mill components our area of interest is to visit design of rollers and rolling mill housing. We have discussed the different parameters and factors that affect the roll design. The calculations for the power required for rolling operation and the roll dimensions are also discussed. In reviewing the design of rolling mill housing, we try to explain the load that comes on the rolls during the rolling operations and how it affects the bearing life. The rolling mill housing designed optimisation has achieved by using different Finite Element Analysis techniques and various experimentation for rolling mill housing structural analysis is also reviewed...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} process of the longitudinal rolling of tubes through a set of three driven <b>grooved</b> <b>rolls.</b> Tubes were rolled with or without internal support i. e. under mandrel rolling or sinking conditions. Knowledge was required {{of the way in which}} the roll separating force and rolling torque vary for different conditions of rolling. The objective of this work being to obtain a better understanding and optimization of the mechanics of the process. The design and instrumentation of a complete experimental three-roll mill for the rolling of lead tube as an analogue material for hot steel, with the measurement of the individual roll force and torque is described. A novel type of roll load cell was incorporated and its design and testing discussed. Employing three roll sizes of 170 mm, 255 mm and 340 mm shroud diameter, precise tube specimens of various tube diameter to thickness ratios were rolled under sinking and mandrel rolling conditions. To obtain an indication of the tube-roll contact areas some of the specimens were partially rolled. For comparative purposes the remaining tubes were completely rolled as a single pass. The roll forces, torques and tube parameters e. g. reduction of area, D/t ratio, were collated and compared for each of the three roll diameters considered. The influence of friction, particularly in the mandrel rolling process, was commented upon. Theoretical studies utilising the equilibrium and energy methods were applied to both the sinking and mandrel rolling processes. In general, the energy approach gave better comparison with experiment, especially for mandrel rolling. The influence of the tube deformation zones on the two processes was observed and on the subsequent modification of the tube-roll arc contact length. A rudimentary attempt was made in the theoretical sinking analysis to allow for the deformation zone prior to roll contact; some success was noted. A general survey of the available tube rolling literature, for both the sinking and mandrel processes has been carried out...|$|E

The mechanical properties of ribbons produced during roll compaction can influence breakage behaviour in a mill and hence the performance of a drug formulation. Therefore it is important to explore critical factors that determine the quality of ribbons. In this study, MCC Avicel PH- 102 was used as the model powder for roll compaction and the critical operating factors affecting ribbon quality were studied. MCC 102 ribbons were manufactured at a range of process conditions (roll speed, feed screw speed and compaction pressure) using the TF mini roll compactor with a serrated die & punch (DPS), <b>grooved</b> <b>roll</b> surface. The key ribbon properties measured are the powder feed ratio (defined as the ratio of feed screw speed to that of roll speed) and mass throughput ratio (defined as the mass of ribbons produced in a given time to that of fines). The porosity of ribbons was observed to depend significantly on powder feed ratio into the compaction zone. Porosity remained constant at a fixed feed ratio irrespective of the absolute roll speed and the feed screw speed conditions used. Mass throughput ratio is another factor that was introduced to describe process efficiency i. e. to draw comparison between the amount of ribbons and fines. The amount of ribbons and fines generated at a given process condition depends significantly on the feed screw speed and the compaction pressure. In addition, ribbon porosity decreased with increasing pressure but there was negligible effect on ribbon porosity when excessively high pressure (> 60 bar) was used. Ribbon porosity was also observed to decrease with increasing feed screw speed but the converse is true with increasing roll speed. In conclusion, the impact of various roll compaction process parameters were critically investigated and a detailed insight into the main factors (powder feed and mass throughput ratios) that govern the behaviour of roll compacted ribbons was provided. In future, the focus is to relate these process properties (and ribbon porosity) to granule size distribution from a milling process...|$|R

Despite its importance, a detailed mechanistic understanding of this process {{at the molecular level}} is lacking. We have constructed, using extensive atomistic computer simulations and umbrella sampling techniques, a free energy landscape for the intercalation of the anticancer drug daunomycin into a twelve base pair B-DNA. A similar free energy landscape has been constructed for a probable intermediate DNA minor groove-bound state. These allow a molecular level understanding of aspects of the thermodynamics, DNA structural changes, and kinetic pathways of the intercalation process. Key DNA structural changes involve opening the future intercalation site base pairs toward the minor <b>groove</b> (positive <b>roll),</b> followed by an increase in the rise, accompanied by hydrogen bonding changes of the minor groove waters. The calculated intercalation free energy change is - 12. 3 kcal/mol, in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimate - 9. 4 kcal/mol. The results point to a mechanism in which the drug first binds to the minor groove and then intercalates into the DNA in an activated process, which is found to be in general agreement with experimental kinetic results.

40|$|Abstract: In the tandem groove rolling process, when {{a certain}} amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the roll gap, i. e. the section height, should be {{adjusted}} to keep a mass balance between stands, i. e. multiply the exit cross-sectional area by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit cross-sectional area variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original <b>roll</b> <b>groove,</b> i. e. on the <b>roll</b> <b>groove</b> with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worn-down groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece while the roll gap changed. To predict the amount of roll gap adjustment that compensates wear, a model for roll gap adjustment is proposed. In the proposed model, the authors introduced the concept of equiva-lent roll gap adjustment, which reduces the increased exit cross-sectional area owing to wear up to a base exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece. Results reveal that the exit cross-sectional area calculated by the roll gap adjustment model is in good agreement with the exit cross-sectional area measured. It has been found from the pilot hot rolling test that variation in exit cross-sectional area is almost linearly proportional to roll gap change while the roll gap decreases from a datum roll gap to about half of the datum one...|$|R
40|$|As {{the first}} stage of a {{research}} program aimed at identifying improved <b>roll</b> <b>groove</b> geometries for milling units, prepared cane and bagasse samples were compressed between grooved platens of different groove profile in confined uniaxial compression. Three series of tests were conducted that explored the effects of groove pitch, groove angle, maximum compression pressure, sample mass and compression speed on the final moisture content of the sample. The tests showed that larger groove angles resulted in lower moisture content. No consistent effect was found for groove pitch. The results also showed that larger compression pressure, larger sample mass and lower compression speed contributed to lower bagasse moisture for both prepared cane and bagasse samples...|$|R
