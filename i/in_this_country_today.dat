All of the presidents were appointed by the government which established a direct connection between the government and the university leadership. The purpose of this study is to understand how each president balanced politically assigned roles and expectations with personal visionary academic responsiveness to the principles which define the university. ^ Each president and his tenure were analyzed using historical research, a developed leadership model, an integration of role theory, Locke 2 ̆ 7 s leadership model, Wiles and Bondi curriculum leader tasks, and Burn 2 ̆ 7 s leadership style. Results of analyses of documents showed that all presidents of the National Taiwan University were highly respected due to their academic background, personal characteristics, and contribution to the university as a leader. Meanwhile, implementation and achievement of the presidents led to the conclusion that appointed university presidents had significant relationships with government policy. Their leadership style was affected strongly by their personal traits and knowledge and the social and political climate of the time. ...|$|R

5000|$|During {{his last}} years, Carr {{continued}} {{to maintain his}} optimism in a better future, {{in spite of what}} he regarded as grave setbacks. In a 1978 interview in The New Left Review, Carr called capitalism a crazy economic system that was doomed to die. In the same interview, Carr complained about what he called [...] "obsessive hatred and fear of Russia", stating [...] "an outburst of national hysteria on this scale is surely the symptom of a sick society". In a 1980 letter to his friend Tamara Deutscher, Carr wrote that he felt that the government of Margaret Thatcher had forced [...] "the forces of Socialism" [...] in Britain into a [...] "full retreat". In the same letter to Deutscher, Carr wrote that [...] "Socialism cannot be obtained through reformism, i.e. through the machinery of bourgeois democracy". Carr went on to decry disunity on the Left, and wrote:"What worries me is not only what is happening <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>today,</b> but my preoccupation with what happened in the 30s. The hard-liners denied that Brüning was a lesser evil than Hitler, and refused to co-operate with the Social Democrats. I don't know that in the draft chapters Twilight of the Comintern I have specifically attacked this view, but that is certainly the slant of the whole narrative. Trotsky denounced this line from the start, and in the last forty years I cannot think of any writer who has defended it. Have we all been wrong? And should we really deny that Callaghan is a lesser evil than Thatcher?Another thought. Lenin in the 1920s wanted the Communists 'to help the MacDonalds and the Snowdens to defeat the Lloyd Georges and the Churchills'. Are Callaghan and Healey so much worse than MacDonald and Snowden?" [...] Though Carr regarded the abandonment of Maoism in China in the late 1970s as a regressive development, he saw opportunities, and wrote to his stock broker in 1978: [...] "a lot of people, as well as the Japanese, are going to benefit from the opening up of trade with China. Have you any ideas?". In one of his last letters to Tamara Deutscher, shortly before his death in 1982, Carr expressed a great deal of dismay at the state of the world, writing that [...] "The left is foolish and the right vicious." [...] Carr wrote to Deutscher that the sort of socialism envisioned by Marx could never be achieved via the means of democracy, but complained that the working class in Britain were not capable of staging the revolution needed to destroy British capitalism. Carr criticized what he regarded as an excessive preoccupation in the West with the human rights situation in the Soviet Union, blasted the European Left for naïveté, and Eurocommunism as a useless watered-down version of Communism. Carr wrote to Deutscher:"What can one think of [...] "Eurocommunists" [...] who have produced no programme of their own, but are prepared {{at the drop of a}} hat to rub shoulders with declared counter-revolutionaries (anti-Lenin, anti-Marx) and Cold Warriors? This must be meat and drink to the hardliners in the Kremlin. Back to the [...] "united front from Trotsky to Chamberlain?" [...] At least Trotsky never did that. Where are we going? There are too many war-mongers around the world at present for comfort. Cannot the New Left go back to Nuclear Disarmament? Also perhaps a bit naïve, but healthier." [...] Carr ended his letter by saying that he did not believe that the British proletariat, or any of the other Western proletariats, had the willingness and/or the capacity to stage the sort of revolutions that Marx had predicated, and that because of his lack of faith in the revolutionary potential of the Western working classes, he could not be a Marxist. Beside the issue about the non-imminence of a workers' uprising in the West, Carr stated that he was in otherwise complete agreement with all of the main tenets of Marxism. In a letter to Deutscher, Carr wrote he had been convinced of the [...] "bankruptcy of capitalism" [...] since the 1930s, but that:"It would be fair to say that I have always been more interested in Marxism as a method of revealing hidden springs of thought and action, and debunking the logical and moralistic facade, erected around them, than in the Marxist analysis of the decline of capitalism. Capitalism was clearly on the way out, and the precise mechanism of its downfall did not seem to me all that interesting.". Carr added that he [...] "could not see the Western proletariat, the progeny of Western bourgeois capitalism, as the bearer of the world revolution in its next stage". Shortly before his death, Carr wrote that he believed: [...] "I cannot indeed foresee for western society in anything like its present form any prospect but decline and decay, perhaps but not necessarily ending in dramatic collapse. But I believe that new forces and movements, whose shape we cannot yet guess, are germinating beneath the surface, here or elsewhere. That is my unverifiable Utopia, and I suppose I should call it [...] "socialist" [...] and I am to this extent Marxist. But Marx did not define the content of socialism except in a few Utopian phrases; and nor can I".|$|E

Of the two terms, Socialism is perhaps the older, for it was not till the new form of government began to be contrasted with the old that either of the terms was at all needed. Socialism is especially new and more especially to Americans.
