5|$|At {{the time}} of the 2013 Miss America competition, she was a Fashion Institute of Technology (<b>FIT)</b> student, where she studied advertising, {{marketing}} and communications with aspirations of a profession related to cosmetic and fragrance marketing. At <b>FIT,</b> she {{was a part of the}} Presidential Honors Program. Her three placements in the Miss New York competition provided her with sufficient scholarship monies to pay for her entire <b>FIT</b> tuition. She trained several different methods to prepare for the pageant. Her trainers included Richard Talens of social fitness network Fitocracy, Sohee Lee, and Mark Fisher of Mark Fisher Fitness. One of her training elements was also CrossFit exercise programs.|$|E

50|$|If G is {{a finite}} {{solvable}} group, then the <b>Fitting</b> subgroup contains its own centralizer. The centralizer of the <b>Fitting</b> subgroup {{is the center}} of the <b>Fitting</b> subgroup. In this case, the generalized <b>Fitting</b> subgroup is equal to the <b>Fitting</b> subgroup. More generally, if G is any finite group, the generalized <b>Fitting</b> subgroup contains its own centralizer. This means that in some sense the generalized <b>Fitting</b> subgroup controls G, because G modulo the centralizer of F*(G) is contained in the automorphism group of F*(G), and the centralizer of F*(G) is contained in F*(G). In particular there are only a finite number of groups with given generalized <b>Fitting</b> subgroup.|$|R
5|$|Eldora Speedway, {{which opened}} in 1954, is {{considered}} to be one of 14 intermediate tracks on the Truck Series schedule, the others being Charlotte, Chicagoland, Dover, Homestead-Miami, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Michigan, Phoenix, Pocono, Rockingham and Texas. The track is a 0.5 mile (0.80km) oval with turns at a 24 degree banking, while the straightaways are 8 degrees. The track's grandstands can <b>fit</b> 17,782 spectators, and the hillside seating can <b>fit</b> an unlimited number of fans.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type were {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> with pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 was <b>fitted</b> with a Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 was <b>fitted</b> with a Fischer bow collector, 378 was <b>fitted</b> with an ASEA pantograph, 379 was <b>fitted</b> with a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 was <b>fitted</b> with an English Electric pantograph. The pantographs on 376, 379 and 380 {{were all}} <b>fitted</b> {{on a small}} pantograph tower while 377 and 378 had their pantographs mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} was <b>fitted</b> with a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs <b>fitted</b> all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams were <b>fitted</b> with pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R
5000|$|... 60009 had {{a double}} chimney <b>fitted</b> on 18 November 1958. This feature was first <b>fitted</b> to 4468 Mallard back in 1938. As the safety {{requirements}} were tightened after the Harrow rail crash, Automatic Warning Systems or AWS was <b>fitted</b> to all locomotives. 60009 was so <b>fitted</b> on 17 February 1960. At {{the same time}} this was done, a Stone-Smith type speed recorder was also <b>fitted.</b>|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Marge {{has begun}} to panic over being unable to {{communicate}} with Homer, as she knows nothing of his undercover work and cannot get any information on his whereabouts. She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin <b>Fit</b> Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, <b>Fit</b> Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories. <b>Fit</b> Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as <b>Fit</b> Fat Tony and then simply Fat Tony - now physically indistinguishable from the original.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} Lockett {{sections}} {{is transferred from}} <b>Fitting</b> classes to <b>Fitting</b> sets. This in general works only partially; in some special groups (which I call “mobility” groups), however, among these the stable linear groups, a literal translation of the <b>Fitting</b> class theory is possible. As the groups relevant in outer <b>Fitting</b> pairs actually are mobility groups, {{a new way of}} deriving information on the Lockett section of a <b>Fitting</b> class arises. This is used to present a simplified, if nonsoluble, counter-example to Lockett's conjecture and to decide a related question. Also, an approach to generating <b>Fitting</b> classes is given...|$|R

5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music <b>fit</b> so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to <b>fit</b> an Epistle's needs.|$|E
