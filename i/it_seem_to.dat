5|$|The overall {{acoustic}} {{system is a}} distributed sound reinforcement system, which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly {{in a way that}} facilitates ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E

In 1977, Anne Paolucci argued that the play lasts five days.|$|E

6000|$|Whenever then in future, I {{speak of}} ideas of imitation, I {{wish to be}} {{understood}} to mean the immediate and present perception that something produced by art is not what <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be. I prefer saying [...] "that {{it is not what}} <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be," [...] to saying [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be what <b>it</b> is not," [...] because we perceive at once what <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be, and the idea of imitation, and the consequent pleasure, result from the subsequent perception of its being something else--flat, for instance, when we thought it was round.|$|R

500|$|Typically, when {{creating}} a manga chapter, an artist draws a rough draft or [...] "name", then {{a more detailed}} storyboard, and lastly the finalized version. However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work. He did not plan {{the details of his}} stories in advance. When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters. The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half. Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him. Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks' time travel. The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been foreshadowing. The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, which is exactly what he did.|$|E
500|$|When {{the first}} Test began, Jardine persisted with Bodyline tactics, even though Bradman, the main target, {{did not play}} in the match. David Frith {{has pointed out that}} Bradman would have been {{watching}} and seeing the tactics that England were using. However, when Stan McCabe was scoring 187 not out, Jardine was briefly seen to be unsettled as runs came quickly, and he may not have been fully convinced that the tactics would be successful. England eventually won the match comfortably. In the second Test, Jardine completely misjudged the pitch and left out a specialist spinner when conditions later in the match favoured one. The match seemed to be going well when Bill Bowes unexpectedly bowled the returning Bradman first ball in the first innings; Jardine was seen to be so delighted that he had clasped his hands above his head and performed a [...] "war dance". This was an extremely unusual reaction in the 1930s, particularly from Jardine who rarely showed any emotion while playing cricket. In the second innings, Bradman scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. This made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> critics that Bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. On the other hand, the pitch was slightly slower than was customary throughout the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chaperon}} {{never became}} quite this dominant in Italy or France; nor does <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been worn as often by grand personages, {{although this is}} sometimes the case. [...] There is a famous bust of Lorenzo de Medici wearing one, although in this he may be deliberately avoiding ostentatious dress (see gallery section). [...] They are more characteristic of merchants and lawyers in these countries, for example in the images of Jean Fouquet from the mid-century. In England, on the other hand, almost all the non-royal members of the Order of the Garter are shown wearing them in their portraits in the [...] "Bruges Garter Book" [...] of 1430â€“1440 (British Library, MS Stowe 594). In the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and Portugal they were generally less common, & appeared lower down the social scale. They were apparently never worn by the clergy anywhere.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011 Douglas E. Streusand {{criticized the}} Hodgson-McNeill Gunpowder-Empire hypothesis, calling it into disfavor as a neither [...] "adequate or accurate" [...] explanation, {{although}} the term remains in use. [...] The main {{problem with the}} Hodgson-McNeill {{theory is that the}} acquisition of firearms {{does not seem to have}} preceded the initial acquisition of territory constituting the imperial critical mass of any of the three early modern Islamic empires, except in the case of the Mughals. Moreover, it seems that the commitment to military autocratic rule pre-dated the acquisition of gunpowder weapons in all three cases. Reasons other than (or in addition to) military technology have been offered for the nearly simultaneous rise of three centralized military empires in contiguous areas dominated by decentralized Turkic tribes. One explanation, called [...] "Confessionalization" [...] by historians of fifteenth century Europe, invokes examination of how the relation of church and state [...] "mediated through confessional statements and church ordinances" [...] lead to the origins of absolutist polities. Douglas Streusand uses the Safavids as an example: The Safavids from the beginning imposed a new religious identity on their general population; they did not seek to develop a national or linguistic identity, but their policy had that effect. Nor does <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be the case that the acquisition of gunpowder weapons and their integration into the military was influenced by considerations of whichever variety of Islam the particular empire promoted. Whether or not gunpowder was inherently linked to the existence of any of these three empires, it cannot be questioned that each of the three acquired artillery and firearms early in their history and made such weapons an integral part of their military tactics.|$|E
