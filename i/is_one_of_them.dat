5|$|Sia <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

25|$|Conceding {{the market}} as the locus of regulation. Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms have slowly {{introduced}} a raft of market-based instruments (MBIs) to regulate the agro-food sector (the PGS framework <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them).</b> The market {{is seen as the}} ideal ‘arms-length’ mechanism with which to foster growth, re-balance imperfections in the connected industries and add previously uncalculated value to European produce. But their social and ecological protections are perpetually unequal, falling short of providing any instance of a Polanyian 'double-movement'. That is, generating a societal reaction to the 'dehumanizing' effects of the self-regulating market.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists such as John B. Watson, Robert Plutchik, and Paul Ekman have {{suggested}} {{that there is only}} a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction, anger, angst, anxiety, fright, horror, joy, panic, and sadness. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable. The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{cellular}} receptors {{have been}} {{thought to be}} activated when bound to their ligand, and are relatively inactive when no ligand is present. A number of receptors have been found that do not fit into this conceptual mould, and DCC <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> These receptors are active both with ligand bound and unbound, but the signals transmitted are different when the receptors are ligand bound. Collectively, this type of receptor {{is known as a}} dependence receptor because the unbound pathway is usually apoptotic, meaning that cell survival depends on ligand presence. Other receptors also show this functional profile, including p75NTR, the androgen receptor, RET, several integrins and Patched.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{gameplay}} in The Bouncer {{consists of}} the player fighting groups of enemies using hand-to-hand combat techniques. Occasionally, one of the AI controlled bouncers will do a taunt, prompting a button-press to activate a team attack ("Trinity Rush") which damages all enemies on screen. However, the Trinity Rush is ineffective against some bosses. In some instances, the player will also be tasked with activities other than fighting, such as running {{through a series of}} hallways to avoid being caught in a flood, finding a keycard, or fooling enemies into thinking the player <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In general, a gameplay segment ends when the player has either defeated all of the enemies in the area, has defeated a boss enemy, or has achieved a set goal.|$|E
25|$|John Winchester {{gives it}} to the demon Azazel in return for Dean's life being spared after a near-fatal car crash. At {{the end of the}} second season, Azazel uses the Colt as the key to open one of the Gates to Hell that Samuel Colt had sealed. The last bullet is then used to kill Azazel, though the gun is later altered to allow the use of more bullets. Towards the end of the third season, Lilith's {{right-hand}} demon, Crowley, acquires the gun and hides it. It is then featured in two time-travel episodes – Dean using a past version of it when he is sent back to 1973, and his future self discovering it when Dean is sent five years into the future – before Crowley returns it to the Winchesters so they can kill Lucifer. However, after Dean shoots Lucifer in the head at point-blank range, an unharmed Lucifer boasts there are five things in creation which the gun cannot kill, and he <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The Colt is subsequently lost and absent for several years until Mary Winchester retrieves it back from a Prince of Hell, Ramiel.|$|E

500|$|Barfi!s soundtrack {{received}} positive reviews by critics. Hindustan Times {{rated the}} album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "verall, the soundtrack is a joyride sans flaws. Pritam has given many hits, but like his tunes in Life in a... Metro, {{this one will}} be remembered for breaking the monotony in his sound. There are no foot-tapping numbers or remixes here, but the simplicity that makes this album a winner." [...] Koimoi gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "In simple words, Barfi! is excellent music on all counts. Very rarely does one get to hear an album where you can hear a complete soundtrack without skipping tracks; this <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> So, just play, enjoy the music and the world of Barfi!". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated [...] "Barfi!s soundtrack is quite good and is easily one of the best quality creations by Pritam. He has totally reinvented himself with this album which defies Bollywood norms and boasts of a sound of its own." ...|$|E
500|$|Hawaiian eruptions often {{begin as}} {{a line of}} vent eruptions along a fissure vent, a {{so-called}} [...] "curtain of fire." [...] These die down as the lava begins to concentrate at {{a few of the}} vents. Central-vent eruptions, meanwhile, often take the form of large lava fountains (both continuous and sporadic), which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more. The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground, resulting in the accumulation of cindery scoria fragments; however, when the air is especially thick with clasts, they cannot cool off fast enough due to the surrounding heat, and hit the ground still hot, the accumulation of which forms spatter cones. If eruptive rates are high enough, they may even form splatter-fed lava flows. Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived; Puʻu ʻŌʻō, a cinder cone of Kilauea, has been erupting continuously since 1983. Another Hawaiian volcanic feature is the formation of active lava lakes, self-maintaining pools of raw lava with a thin crust of semi-cooled rock; there are currently only 5 such lakes in the world, and the one at Kīlauea's Kupaianaha vent <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb from About.com commented: [...] " [...] {{album is}} {{state of the}} art dance-pop loaded with hits from 'Holiday' and 'Lucky Star' to 'Borderline'. Irresistible pop hooks glide across shimmering synth beats to make this a {{landmark}} album of the early 80's." [...] Jonathan Ross from Q said that [...] "'Borderline' is sweet and 'Holiday' still fizzes with invention and joie de vivre....this quintessentially '80s dance hit also features a barrelhouse piano solo." [...] Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice, [...] "In case you bought the con, disco never died — just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy — essence of electro, the D in DOR." [...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone was of the opinion that [...] "without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine rated the album four and a half out of five stars and commented: [...] "Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [...] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago." [...] In March 2012, the publication placed the album at number 33 on their [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] list. Michaelangelo Matos from Spin selected the album among [...] "The Definitive Guide to Classic Disco" [...] and noted that it [...] "mashed-up street sounds and reinvigorated disco for a generation that {{wanted nothing to do with}} polyester suits, ending an era and birthing a new one." ...|$|E
