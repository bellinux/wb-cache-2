40|$|Sulfonated {{hydrothermal}} carbon is able {{to catalyze}} the esterification of palmitic acid with methanol at a higher initial rate per site than other well-known sulfonic solids, including stronger acids such as Nafion-silica. Although {{the origin of this}} higher rate per site is not clear, it seems to be related to high surface <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> groups (both carboxylic and sulfonic). At the same time, their close proximity makes possible the mutual activation of the surface groups for esterification with methanol. The formation of sulfonate esters on the surface produces irreversible partial deactivation of the solid for a second reaction. Other solids able to bring sulfonic groups close, such as Dowex, show the same deactivation pattern, but their sites are less active than those in sulfonated hydrothermal carbon. As an additional advantage, this solid displays enhanced stability against the presence of water, which enables improvement of the behavior after recovery by minimization of the esterification of the surface acid sites.

The work function of the TiO 2, measured using a Kelvin probe, increases with increasing <b>density</b> <b>of</b> carboxylic <b>acid</b> groups due {{to the formation of}} interfacial dipoles pointing toward the TiO 2 surface. The formation of interfacial dipoles results in a shift in the band offset at the TiO 2 /polymer interface, which explains the decrease in the open-circuit voltage.

40|$|The new desilicated {{forms of}} the zeolites X, Y and ZSM- 5 were {{prepared}} by the selective removal of silicon atoms from the parent zeolites in an aqueous solution of base. This treatment, which decreases the Si/Al ratio while keeping the zeolite framework almost unmodified, enhanced the ion exchange capacities of all the zeolites, a property which can be exploited industrially for the X and Y zeolites since the desilicated forms had higher total ion removal rates of calcium and magnesium ions from hard water. Similarly, desilication results in a higher <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> sites {{as shown in the}} following. 1 H MAS NMR studies were done on anhydrous samples of desilicated ZSM- 5 and have detected a signal which was not observed for the parent sample and is believed to arise from the interaction of Bronsted acid sites hydrogen bonded to framework Aluminum atoms. This corresponds {{to the creation of a}} second generation of Bronsted Acid Sites (BAS II) distinguishable from the normal bridging hydroxyl BAS (BAS I) associated with tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum in the zeolite framework. In catalytic testing studies, the desilicated ZSM- 5 zeolite was found to display a higher total conversion in the dehydration of absolute ethanol into ethylene, however the selectivity for ethylene was higher for the parent zeolite at lower reaction temperatures. This was a direct consequence of the higher <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> sites on the desilicated zeolite, which is comprised of BAS II in the presence of "unusual" Lewis acid sites of type II (LAS II). These Lewis acid sites were also detected by 1 H MAS NMR during the rehydration phase and are believed to be produced by dehydroxylation of BAS II which were generated by the "desilication-healing" phenomena. LAS II are distinguishable from LAS I since the latter are easily rehydrated back to the corresponding BAS I. The nature and strength of these different acidic sites on the parent and those created on the desilicated ZSM- 5 were also studied in more detail by the techniques of XPS, FTIR, NH 3 TPD, nitrogen and argon adsorption and desorption (BET), DTA/TGA and poison testing using pyridine and 2, 6 -dimethylpyridine. Upon steam treatment of the desilicated zeolite, both the total conversion and selectivity for ethylene improved significantly in the dehydration of absolute ethanol. Steaming was capable of rehydrating the LAS II into BAS II, a reconversion which was previously too demanding to be achieved under the conditions of catalytic testing, hence the low selectivity for ethylene at lower reaction temperatures. Further evidence of this reconversion is provided by catalytic testing with aqueous ethanol for which the desilicated zeolite achieved higher total conversions and selectivities for ethylene than the parent at all reaction temperatures, and the selectivity for ethylene was always significantly higher than was achieved with absolute ethanol. This has important implications for the Bioethanol to Ethylene Process. A cut off temperature was also confirmed for the dehydration of ethanol, at which the reaction mechanism changed from the two step conversion into diethyl ether and ethylene, into the one step, direct conversion to ethylene. These temperature ranges were determined to be 200 - 225 ∘C and 225 - 250 ∘C for absolute and aqueous ethanol respectively...|$|E

This work provides a comparative study of the catalytic performances of a large scope of acid solids in the esterification of acetic acid with an excess of glycerol. Aluminium containing formulations (niobium oxide supported on commercial silica-alumina, aluminium phosphate) presented an inhibitory effect probably due to the amphoteric character of aluminium-bonded hydroxyl groups and the presence of basic sites where the limiting reagent (acetic acid) could be strongly adsorbed being unavailable for the reaction. Tungstated zirconia samples presented an inert behaviour, due to the deactivation of active sites by strong adsorption of water or glycerol. Tungstophosphoric acid immobilised by sol-gel technique in zirconia and silica, presented a high resistance to leaching. The strong interaction between the heteropolyacid and the matrixes led, however, to the lowering of the heteropolyacid acid strength, resulting in an absence of catalytic activity. Sulphated zirconia synthesised by sol-gel showed good catalytic activity. The lower the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> sites, the higher the catalytic activity.

40|$|The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017. As {{the impact}} of acids on catalytically driven {{chemical}} transformations is tremendous, fundamental understanding of catalytically relevant factors {{is essential for the}} design of more efficient solid acid catalysts. In this work, we employed a post-synthetic doping method to synthesize a highly selective hydroisomerization catalyst and to demonstrate the effect of acid strength and density, catalyst microstructure, and platinum nanoparticle size on the reaction rate and selectivity. Aluminum doped mesoporous silica catalyzed gas-phase n-hexadecane isomerization with remarkably high selectivity to monobranched isomers (∼ 95 %), producing a substantially higher amount of isomers than traditional zeolite catalysts. Mildly acidic sites generated by post-synthetic aluminum grafting were found to be the main reason for its high selectivity. The flexibility of the post-synthetic doping method enabled us to systematically explore the effect of the acid site density on the reaction rate and selectivity, which has been extremely difficult to achieve with zeolite catalysts. We found that a higher density of Brønsted acid sites leads to higher cracking of n-hexadecane presumably due to an increased surface residence time. Furthermore, regardless of pore size and microstructure, hydroisomerization turnover frequency linearly increased as a function of Brønsted acid site density. In addition to strength and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> sites, platinum nanoparticle size affected catalytic activity and selectivity. The smallest platinum nanoparticles produced the most effective bifunctional catalyst presumably because of higher percolation into aluminum doped mesoporous silica, generating more 'intimate' metallic and acidic sites. Finally, the aluminum doped silica catalyst was shown to retain its remarkable selectivity towards isomers even at increased reaction conversions...|$|E
40|$|The {{strengths}} of acid sites and the pore sizes of zeolites {{have been successfully}} controlled for shape-selective isomerization of n-butene to isobutylene. Medium pore (B) -ZSM- 5 and (B) -ZSM- 11 and small pore ferrierite/ZSM- 35 and ZSM- 23 zeolites have been synthesized using hydrothermal methods. Crystallinity, morphology, acidity, porosity, thermal stability, bonding properties, and surface properties of these zeolites have been extensively characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning Auger microscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, microbalance, BET surface area measurements, pore size distributions, and inductively coupled plasma analysis. Different kinds of acid sites responsible for skeletal isomerization and dimerization reactions have been revealed. Weakening of strength of acid sites of medium pore zeolites ZSM- 5 and ZSM- 11 by boron substitution leads to a limited success in improvements of yields and selectivities to isobutylene. Use of small pore zeolites ferrierite/ZSM- 35 and ZSM- 23 yields a shape selective isomerization of n-butene to isobutylene. Coke deposition enhances shape selectivity by partially blocking the zeolitic channels so that the space around acid sites is not large enough for dimerization reactions. It also poisons some strong acid sites responsible for dimerization and subsequent cracking reactions. Mechanisms of n-butene skeletal isomerization and accompanying side reactions have also been carefully elucidated. Methods for modification of non-template synthesized ferrierite/ZSM- 35 materials are proposed and successfully established. Effective removal of non-shape selective acid sites and decreasing of the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> sites significantly improve catalytic performances of non-template synthesized materials to the level similar to template-synthesized materials of higher crystallinity. At the present time, this process {{is on the way}} to commercialization by Texaco, Inc. for an alternative source of isobutylene to produce methyl t-butyl ether for boosting the octane number of gasoline and reducing the automobile emission of volatile organic compounds. ...|$|E
40|$|A facile {{method for}} the aqueous {{synthesis}} of monodisperse and micronmeter-sized colloids with highly carboxylated surfaces is presented. The method {{is applied to}} three different monomers, styrene, methyl methacrylate, and 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate, and illustrate tuning of the size and monodispersity in the reactions. High surface <b>density</b> <b>of</b> carboxylic <b>acids</b> <b>of</b> up to 10 COOH nm- 2 from potentiometric titrations, is achieved through copolymerization with itaconic <b>acid.</b> The versatility <b>of</b> this system is highlighted by creating highly fluorescent and monodisperse particles that can be index matched in aqueous solution and through surface modification via the carboxylic acid groups using standard amidation chemistry...|$|R

40|$|Cellulosic fibrous {{networks}} are modified using 3 different amino acids; small (Glycine, Gly), aliphatic (Leucine, Leu) and aromatic (Phenylalanine, Phe). The effect <b>of</b> amino <b>acid</b> functionality on chemical coupling to cellulose fibres {{in terms of}} their coverage and packing density are investigated. Different amino acid modified cellulose {{networks are}} characterised by using Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The presence <b>of</b> amino <b>acids</b> is confirmed using ToF-SIMS. The quantitative distribution <b>of</b> different amino <b>acids</b> across the cellulose surface is assessed by using XPS. It is shown that the packing <b>density</b> <b>of</b> amino <b>acids</b> depends {{on the size of the}} side chain; smaller amino acids (Gly, Leu) tend to couple to the surface at higher density compared to larger ones (Phe).
