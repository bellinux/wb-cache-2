As the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> is passed from generation to generation, family members tend to develop divergent goals regarding the farm 2 ̆ 7 s operation.

This article {{highlights}} the main {{characteristics of the}} <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> and reviews both the socio-economic and political-institutional arguments used for the persistence of this structure in West European farming. At micro level, the socio-economic rationale behind the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> states that economies of scale tend to increase the optimal farm size, but that this tendency is partly offset by the importance of transaction costs for monitoring labour results. Moreover, the flexibility of family labour, the accumulated human capital within the <b>farming</b> <b>family</b> {{and the ability to}} withstand hard (financial) times are factors in favour of the <b>family</b> <b>farm.</b> At macro level, the availability of food for the population {{has been one of the}} major concerns of policy makers.

Although the kind of farming system is not specified in these measures, the farm lobby has influenced the legislations in order to safeguard the current <b>family</b> <b>farms.</b> In the last decades the governmental concern has broadened due to environmental concerns.

40|$|The central {{argument}} of the thesis {{is that as}} the dominant economic and social structure in advanced industrialized agriculture, the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business is central to enabling change in rural Australia. A deep understanding of the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business — its components and their interactions — is critical to designing mechanisms for enabling change in Australian agriculture. The process of enabling change needs {{to address the needs}} of the right people, at the right time. A service brokering model — which incorporates this approach — is proposed as an alternative to the current 'product-push' model of extension in Australia. The thesis is presented as a series of selected research papers, published over several years, and which have a common proposition: that understanding the social dynamics of the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business is core to enabling change in Australian agriculture. In addition to a general introduction to enabling change in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses, the papers address the following topics: • Identification of the characteristics of <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses as the dominant structural unit in Australian agriculture (Paper I) • A review of the role and needs of women in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses in Australia (Paper 2) • Research on the role of agribusiness in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> decision making (Paper 3) • An assessment of the barriers to farm diversification in regional Tasmania (Paper 4) • A review of research on agricultural extension, learning and change (Paper 5) • Identification of effective processes for ensuring the content of learning activities for <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses is relevant to their changing needs (Paper 6) • The case for meeting the needs of <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses through training brokerage (Paper 7) Across the papers, a conceptual framework to assist in the design of programmes aimed at enabling change in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses in Australia is presented. This model conceives <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business behaviour as the outcome of the interactions between the family, the natural resources which are farmed, and the farm business, all within a broader social, economic and political context. The thesis presents an alternate extension model to the current 'product-push' model. The service broker concept addresses the provision of extension services in agriculture by focusing on the needs of <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses. A case is made for agencies to act as 'brokers' between <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses and the wide range of services available to address their needs. Such an approach, coordinated at a regional level, has the potential to deliver a major breakthrough in the rate of improvement in the sustainability of our <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses, our rural industries and rural and regional Australia...|$|R
