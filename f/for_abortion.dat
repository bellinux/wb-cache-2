5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in Detroit, Mansour entered {{religious}} orders then earned {{a doctorate in}} biochemistry. She served {{as the president of}} Mercy College of Detroit from 1971 to 1983. She ran unsuccessfully for public office in 1982, in the process provoking comment from the Archbishop of Detroit. The Governor of Michigan appointed her to lead the state's social services department, and she was confirmed in early 1983. During this time, the Archbishop of Detroit and Vatican officials asked Mansour declare herself against abortion—her department was responsible <b>for</b> <b>abortion</b> services funded through Medicaid. Mansour refused to make such a statement, and two months after her confirmation as director she was required by the Vatican to decide whether she was to continue as director or as a nun. She chose to give up her vows as a nun. After serving out her appointment she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} obstacle was {{a pivotal}} group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant {{to support the}} bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding <b>for</b> <b>abortion</b> significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their concerns, {{but they could not}} address abortion in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment. This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage. The House passed the Senate bill with a 219–212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it. The next day, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill. Obama signed ACA into law on March 23, 2010. Since passage, Republicans have voted to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act over sixty times; no such attempt by Republicans has been successful. The amendment bill, The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, cleared the House on March 21; the Senate passed it by reconciliation on March 25, and Obama signed it on March 30.|$|E

The amendment was dropped in the Senate when President George H. W. Bush threatened to veto the entire defense appropriation measure if it remained in.|$|E
40|$|Many states {{restrict}} the access of minors to abortion services. By October 1995, 27 states had enacted {{and begun to}} enforce parental consent or notification laws for minors and 34 states restricted Medicaid funding <b>for</b> <b>abortions.</b> This paper includes estimates {{of the impact of}} these enforced abortion restrictions on minors' demand <b>for</b> <b>abortions</b> between 1978 and 1990. Using four estimation methods that account for difficult-to-measure variables, such as anti-abortion sentiment, the results suggest that parental involvement laws decrease minors' demand <b>for</b> <b>abortions</b> by 13 to 25 percent and state restrictions on Medicaid funding of abortions decrease minors' demand <b>for</b> <b>abortions</b> by 9 to 17 percent. ...|$|R

50|$|Morgentaler's recent {{legal battles}} {{have focused on}} obtaining {{universal}} public funding <b>for</b> <b>abortions,</b> by gaining recognition that a well-regulated specialist clinic provides a service equivalent to that offered in a hospital.

Morgentaler has challenged this policy in New Brunswick.|$|R
