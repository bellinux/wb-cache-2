40|$|In this contribution, {{we propose}} an {{innovative}} horn antenna design capable to filter undesired noise out. The radiator {{is based on}} a regular WR- 62 horn, having a metallic screen inserted between the <b>feeding</b> <b>waveguide</b> and the flared aperture. We have drilled a vertical rectangular slit on the screen (the long side of the slit is in the E-plane) and placed a dielectric slab across the slit itself. On {{the two sides of the}} slab, we have printed metallic omega particles with appropriate dimensions in order to resonate in a sub-band of the operating frequency range of the WR- 62 horn. At the particle resonance, signals are allowed to pass through the screen, reducing, thus, the operating frequency band of the WR- 62 horn. This setup may find application in receiving systems of satellite communications, where signal bandwidths are rather narrow and noise captured by the antenna needs to be filtered out. This result is obtained keeping the same space occupancy of the regular WR- 62 horn at the only expense of inserting a light and cheap dielectric board between the horn and its <b>feeding</b> <b>waveguide.</b> The idea is verified through proper full-wave numerical simulations and experimental results. ...|$|R

40|$|Planar {{arrays of}} waveguide-fed slots have been {{employed}} in many radar and remote sensing applications. Such arrays are {{designed in the}} standing wave configuration because of high efficiency. Traveling wave arrays can produce greater bandwidth {{at the expense of}} efficiency due to power loss in the load or loads. Traveling wave planar slot arrays may be designed with a long <b>feed</b> <b>waveguide</b> consisting of centered-inclined coupling slots. The <b>feed</b> <b>waveguide</b> is terminated in a matched load, and the element spacing in the <b>feed</b> <b>waveguide</b> is chosen to produce a beam squinted from the broadside. The traveling wave planar slot array consists of a long <b>feed</b> <b>waveguide</b> containing resonant-centered inclined coupling slots in the broad wall, coupling power into an array of stacked radiating waveguides orthogonal to it. The radiating waveguides consist of longitudinal offset radiating slots in a standing wave configuration. For the traveling wave feed of a planar slot array, one has to design the tilt angle and length of each coupling slot such that the amplitude and phase of excitation of each radiating waveguide are close to the desired values. The coupling slot spacing is chosen for an appropriate beam squint. Scattering matrix parameters of resonant coupling slots are used in the design process to produce appropriate excitations of radiating waveguides with constraints placed only on amplitudes. Since the radiating slots in each radiating waveguide are designed to produce a certain total admittance, the scattering (S) matrix of each coupling slot is reduced to a 2 x 2 matrix. Elements of each 2 x 2 S-matrix and the amount of coupling into the corresponding radiating waveguide are expressed in terms of the element S 11. S matrices are converted into transmission (T) matrices, and the T matrices are multiplied to cascade the coupling slots and waveguide sections, starting from the load end and proceeding towards the source. While the use of non-resonant coupling slots may provide an additional degree of freedom in the design, resonant coupling slots simplify the design process. The amplitude of the wave going to the load is set at unity. The S 11 parameter, r of the coupling slot closest to the load, is assigned an arbitrary value. A larger value of r will reduce the power dissipated in the load while increasing the reflection coefficient at the input port. It is now possible to obtain the excitation of the radiating waveguide closest to the load and the coefficients of the wave incident and reflected at the input port of this coupling slot. The next coupling slot parameter, r, is chosen to realize the excitation of that radiating waveguide. One continues this process moving towards the source, until all the coupling slot parameters r and hence the S 11 parameter of the 4 -port coupler, r, are known for each coupling slot. The goal is to produce the desired array aperture distribution in the feed direction. From an interpolation of the computed moment method data for the slot parameters, all the coupling slot tilt angles and lengths are obtained. From the excitations of the radiating waveguides computed from the coupling values, radiating slot parameters may be obtained so as to attain the desired total normalized slot admittances. This process yields the radiating slot parameters, offsets, and lengths. The design is repeated by choosing different values of r for the last coupling slot until the percentage of power dissipated in the load and the input reflection coefficient values are satisfactory. Numerical results computed for the radiation pattern, the tilt angles and lengths of coupling slots, and excitation phases of the radiating waveguides, are presented for an array with uniform amplitude excitation. The design process has been validated using computer simulations. This design procedure is valid for non-uniform amplitude excitations as well...|$|E

The necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen depends only on the spacing between accelerator structures. In this system, the structures are not fed in a binary hierarchal system, rather in series with a set of directional couplers designed to bleed off an equal amount of power to each accelerator structure in the set. We study the sensitivity of such a system to errors resulting from the differences in accelerator structures spacing. We also study the sensitivity of the system to component imperfections, such as the finite directivity of the directional couplers, and the residual reflections from the loads that are attached to these couplers.

The approximate model reflecting the reflection-canceling feature of slot pairs dispenses with the full analysis of practical structure with thousands of slots. 1. Aperture illumination of slotted oversized waveguide arrays Rectangular parallel plate slotted arrays using dielectric substrate, named a post-wall waveguide array shown in Fig. 1 are attractive candidates for high efficiency and mass producible planar array antennas in millimeter wave applications[1 - 5].

40|$|Recent {{experience}} with X-band accelerator structure development {{has shown the}} rf input coupler to be the region most prone to rf breakdown and degradation, effectively limiting the operating gradient. A major factor in {{this appears to be}} high magnetic fields at the sharp edges of the coupling irises. As a first response to this problem, couplers with rounded and thickened iris horns have been employed and successfully tested at high power. To further reduce fields for higher power flow, conceptually new coupler designs have been developed, in which power is coupled through the broad wall of the <b>feed</b> <b>waveguide,</b> rather than through terminating irises. A “mode-launcher” coupler, which launches the TM_{ 01 } mode in circular waveguide before coupling through a matching cell into the main structure, has been tested with great success.

40|$|In {{radiometer}} applications, it {{is required}} to design antennas that meet low average sidelobe levels and low average return loss over a specified frequency bandwidth. It {{is a challenge to}} meet such specifications over a frequency range when one uses resonant elements such as waveguide feed slots. In addition to their inherent narrow frequency band performance, the problem is exacerbated due to modeling errors and manufacturing tolerances. There was a need to develop a design methodology to solve the problem. An iterative design procedure was developed by starting with an array architecture, lattice spacing, aperture distribution, waveguide dimensions, etc. The array was designed using Elliott s technique with appropriate values of the total slot conductance in each radiating waveguide, and the total resistance in each <b>feed</b> <b>waveguide.</b> Subsequently, the array performance was analyzed by the full wave method of moments solution to the pertinent integral equations. Monte Carlo simulations were also carried out to account for amplitude and phase errors introduced for the aperture distribution due to modeling errors as well as manufacturing tolerances. If the design margins for the average sidelobe level and the average return loss were not adequate, array architecture, lattice spacing, aperture distribution, and waveguide dimensions were varied in subsequent iterations. Once the design margins were found to be adequate, the iteration was stopped and a good design was achieved. A symmetric array architecture was found to meet the design specification with adequate margin. The specifications were near 40 dB for angular regions beyond 30 degrees from broadside. Separable Taylor distribution with nbar= 4 and 35 dB sidelobe specification was chosen for each principal plane. A non-separable distribution obtained by the genetic algorithm was found to have similar characteristics. The element spacing was obtained to provide the required beamwidth and close to a null in the E-plane end-fire direction. Because of the alternating slot offsets, grating lobes called butterfly lobes are produced in non-principal planes close to the H-plane. An attempt to reduce the influence of such grating lobes resulted in a symmetric design...|$|E

Various types of applicators used for producing hyperthermia in a biomass, are also discussed. Propagation of a uniform plane electromagnetic wave through a human body is investigated for the general case of oblique incidence. Various models used for the human body have been discussed and the planar multilayer model has been chosen for this study. Reflection and transmission coefficients for both the parallel and perpendicular linear polarisations of the wave, have been determined. For normal incidence, power transfer ratio at the muscle has been defined and calculated at 433, 915 and 2450 MHz (ISM frequencies). Efects of skin thickness and also of fat thickness, on the power transfer ratio at muscle, have been studied. Effects of the thickness and dielectric constant of a bolus, and also of the dielectric constant of an initial layer, on the power transfer ratio, have been studied and their optimum values obtained at the ISM frequencies. For microwave hyperthermia, 915 MHz is recommended as the frequency of operation. Steady-state solution of the bioheat transfer equation has been obtained, assuming the biomass to be a semi-infinite homogeneous medium. Effects of various physical parameters on the temperature profile in the biomass, have been studied.

Other parts of the thesis include a conversion of the proposed antenna to the SIW technology and a design of a transition between the antenna and a <b>feeding</b> <b>waveguide</b> WR 15. The last part of the thesis deals with measuring of the reflection coefficient and the radiation pattern of the fabricated antenna prototype...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{single-crystal}} diamond {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} promising platform for Raman lasers at exotic wavelengths due to its giant Raman shift, large transparency window and excellent thermal properties yielding a greatly enhanced figure-of-merit compared to conventional materials. To date, diamond Raman lasers have been realized using bulk plates placed inside macroscopic cavities, requiring careful alignment and resulting in high threshold powers (W-kW). Here we demonstrate an on-chip Raman laser based on fully-integrated, high quality-factor, diamond racetrack micro-resonators embedded in silica. Pumping at telecom wavelengths, we show Stokes output discretely tunable over a 100 nm bandwidth around 2 -μm with output powers > 250 μW, extending the functionality of diamond Raman lasers to an interesting wavelength range {{at the edge of}} the mid-infrared spectrum. Continuous-wave operation with only 85 mW pump threshold power in the <b>feeding</b> <b>waveguide</b> is demonstrated along with continuous, mode-hop-free tuning over 7. 5 GHz in a compact, integrated-optics platform.
