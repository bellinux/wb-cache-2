50|$|An {{advantage}} of the <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> is that at any moment in time one call uses only one channel. The <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> event is indeed very short and usually is not perceptible by the user. In the old analog systems it could be heard as a click or a very short beep; in digital systems it is unnoticeable. Another {{advantage of}} the <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> is that the phone's hardware {{does not need to}} be capable of receiving two or more channels in parallel, which makes it cheaper and simpler. A disadvantage is that if a handover fails the call may be temporarily disrupted or even terminated abnormally. Technologies which use hard handovers, usually have procedures which can re-establish the connection to the source cell if the connection to the target cell cannot be made. However re-establishing this connection may not always be possible (in which case the call will be terminated) and even when possible the procedure may cause a temporary interruption to the call.|$|E

30|$|Multiple access {{channels}} (MAC) correspond to a communication scenario where several transmitters communicate {{with a single}} receiver through a common channel [1]. In parallel MAC, each transmitter can exploit {{a common set of}} orthogonal channels to communicate with the receiver. Often, channel orthogonality is assumed in the frequency domain, and thus, channels can be understood as different non-overlapping frequency bands. This model allows one to study communication scenarios such as 802.11 -based wireless local area networks [2, 3], distributed soft or <b>hard</b> <b>handovers</b> in cellular systems [4], or throughput-maximizing power control in multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems [5].|$|R
50|$|The logical {{connections}} between the network elements are known as interfaces. The interface between the RNC and the Circuit Switched Core Network (CS-CN) is called Iu-CS and between the RNC and the Packet Switched Core Network is called Iu-PS. Other interfaces include Iub (between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same network). Iu interfaces carry user traffic (such as voice or data) as well as control information (see Protocols), and Iur interface is mainly needed for soft handovers involving 2 RNCs though not required as the absence of Iur will cause these <b>handovers</b> to become <b>hard</b> <b>handovers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In analog systems the {{parameters}} used as criteria for requesting a <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> {{are usually the}} received signal power and the received signal-to-noise ratio (the latter may be estimated in an analog system by inserting additional tones, with frequencies just outside the captured voice-frequency band at the transmitter and assessing the form of these tones at the receiver). In non-CDMA 2G digital systems the criteria for requesting <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> may be based on estimates of the received signal power, bit error rate (BER) and block error/erasure rate (BLER), received quality of speech (RxQual), distance between the phone and the BTS (estimated from the radio signal propagation delay) and others. In CDMA systems, 2G and 3G, the most common criterion for requesting a handover is Ec/Io ratio measured in the pilot channel (CPICH) and/or RSCP.|$|E
50|$|Hard handover: Is one {{in which}} the channel in the source cell is {{released}} and only then the channel in the target cell is engaged. Thus the connection to the source is broken before or 'as' the connection to the target is made—for this reason such handovers are also known as break-before-make. Hard handovers are intended to be instantaneous in order to minimize the disruption to the call. A <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> is perceived by network engineers as an event during the call. It requires the least processing by the network providing service. When the mobile is between base stations, then the mobile can switch with any of the base stations, so the base stations bounce the link with the mobile back and forth. This is called 'ping-ponging'.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—If {{large amount}} of small cells, i. e., femtocells, picocells or microcells, is deployed, users perform {{handover}} among small cells and macrocells very often. In OFDMA networks, only <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> is usually supported as this type can be implemented easily. On the other hand, frequent <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> negatively influence a quality of service experienced by users. The degradation of the quality {{is a consequence of}} a short interruption in communication during <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> and due to redundant overhead generated for controlling and managing the handover procedure. This paper investigates performance of a fast cell selection applied in two-tier networks with small cells and compares it with the <b>hard</b> <b>handover.</b> We focus on the impact of a backhaul capacity limitation on the performance of both <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> and fast cell selection. As our results indicate, there is a gain in throughput introduced by the fast cell selection if the backhaul of the small cells is not a bottleneck in term of capacity. Nevertheless, if the backhaul capacity is limited, the fast cell selection is profitable only for low bitrates. This observation indicates a need for mandatory consideration of the backhaul capacity for the fast cell selection in the networks with small cells.

40|$|Abstract — An {{analytical}} {{framework for}} studying the performance of Wireless Profiled TCP (WP-TCP) flows over the integrated wireless LAN and cellular networks is proposed. The framework {{can be used to}} analyze the short-term performance during vertical handover and long-term performance of WP-TCP for a given set of network and protocol parameters. It captures the WP-TCP behavior under the influence of wireless channel errors, step change in network parameters and excessive packet losses due to vertical handovers. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of the analytical framework. The main findings in this study are: 1) when the network is subjected to <b>hard</b> <b>handovers,</b> increasing the maximum window size improves the efficiency in a high transmission error environment, but degrades the efficiency in a low transmission error environment; 2) increasing the congestion window reduces the chances of premature timeouts during soft upward vertical handover; and 3) depending on duplicate ACK threshold, increasing the congestion window can increase or reduce the chances of false fast retransmit during soft upward vertical handover.

With the development of these cellular networks, a major problem came up; it was the call handover from one cell to the other cell during an ongoing session without dropping the connection with the base station. A lot of techniques were developed and used to cope with this major issue. The user’s movement is a dynamic process considering its location.

30|$|Link switching, {{commonly}} known as handover in other wireless communication technologies, is an essential issue that deals with the mobility of end users (the term ‘link switching’ {{is used in the}} IEEE 802.15. 7 standard instead of ‘handover’). It guarantees seamless connectivity or improves the quality of service (QoS). In first-generation cellular systems, such as the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) [6], or second-generation systems such as the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) [7] and Personal Access Communications System (PACS) [8], a <b>hard</b> <b>handover</b> is deployed.

In a soft handover, a user device can communicate with the system using multiple radio links through different base stations simultaneously. Compared to the conventional <b>hard</b> <b>handover,</b> a soft handover produces a smoother transmission and reduces the so-called ‘ping-pong’ effect [10 – 12], but it has the disadvantages of implementation complexity and extra resource consumption.|$|E
