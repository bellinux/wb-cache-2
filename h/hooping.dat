25|$|Many modern hoopers {{make their}} own hoops out of {{polyvinyl}} chloride, polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, or polypropylene tubing.

These hoops may be covered in a fabric or plastic tape to ease the amount of work in keeping a hoop twirling around the dancer, and can be very colourful.

The pigs are kept in the <b>hoop</b> usually as one large group (3 ̆e 150 head). The <b>hoop</b> is naturally ventilated. Bedding is added as the pigs grow. The <b>hoop</b> is cleaned after the pigs are marketed. Typical size for <b>hoops</b> is 30 ft × 84 ft for 200 market pigs. Wider <b>hoops</b> with steel truss arches are now on the market. Wider and longer <b>hoops</b> often have ridge vents to improve ventilation. Several companies are now marketing small-scale <b>hoops</b> of widths less than 20 ft These are often called utility shelters. The objective of this project was to demonstrate a small-scale <b>hoop</b> structure for swine. Low cost, small scale, versatility and quasitemporary status were emphasized...|$|R
