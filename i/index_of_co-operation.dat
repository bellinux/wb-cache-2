40|$|The Borana {{people are}} the {{predominant}} ethnic group on the Borana plateau in southern Ethiopia. Though traditionally transhumant pastoralists, they have recently increased their reliance on crops. Rainfall in the region averages between 353 and 873 mm; variability is high, with coefficients of variation ranging from 0. 21 to 0. 68. Anecdotal evidence implies that the vulnerability of pastoralist households to drought is increasing; stock levels increase dramatically during good rainfall years but plummet when rainfall is poor, indicating that the drought cycle is becoming more pronounced. In recent years, {{there has also been}} a dramatic increase in land allocated to crops, and land allocated to pastures that are either privatised or accessible to only a small subgroup of people. Nonetheless, the Borana are still highly dependent on access to common grazing lands, which provide the predominant source of forage and which also provide a mechanism to reduce risk of poor rainfall in one area by allowing for mobility. Because many of the land resources are used and managed in common, the authors hypothesise that one of the key determinants of the productivity and sustainability of the systems is the ability of community members to co-operate over the use and maintenance of these resources. In this report, we develop indicators of co-operation and examine factors affecting these indicators. We then use these indicators to determine the impact of co-operation on stock densities and land allocation patterns. Results indicate that co-operation is positively related to factors that increase the profitability of livestock, but negatively related to the total number of households, the use of community pastures by non-community members, and heterogeneity of wealth within the community. Furthermore, stock densities are negatively related to the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>co-operation,</b> as we would expect. Stock densities are also lower in areas with more highly variable rainfall indicating that high variability reduces the number of livestock held, contrary to the oft-mentioned hypothesis that households build greater stockholdings in areas where rainfall is highly variable to survive a drought with more animals. Finally, results from the land allocation estimations give evidence to support the notion that more land is privatised either for crops or pasture where levels of co-operation are lower. Given the importance of mobility and the poor suitability of most land for cropping, measures to offset the increasing densities and land privatisation should focus on improving the capacity of communities to co-operate and mitigate the impact of heterogeneity on that capacity, and on improving market access to improve co-operation and increase incentives to sell stock in good as well as poor rainfall years. Results also highlight the need to search for alternative policy mechanisms that mitigate the impact of drought, but that do not simultaneously increase incentives to increase herd levels in non-drought years...|$|E

40|$|Formulation of the problem. Technogenic {{failures}} and elemental phenomena result in destruction or damage of building objects – constructions and buildings. Under wreckages and damaged constructions of building {{there can be}} victims. The most widespread technogenic failure are explosions of domestic gas. The structure of obstructions changes depending on parameters and direction of explosion, first of all size and location of wreckages. Sorting out of wreckages of constructions and damaged parts of building is executed on not rational charts, which do {{not take into account}} character of destructions, and without corresponding facilities of mechanization, which answer the requirements of these works not always. It increases terms, labour intensiveness and cost of their conduct. Development of rational technological decisions is therefore needed, corresponding machines and logistic of their moving for the effective sorting out of destructions of building objects. Purpose. Logistic development of the rational moving of machines and equipment on a site area for providing of effective processes of sorting out of destructions of constructions and buildings. Conclusion. Experience of works shows on sorting out of the destroyed building objects, that they are executed without the account of destruction character of building and does not examine the rational moving of machines, which results in considerable resource losses. Worked out structural model of entrance information for making decision on sorting out of obstructions of the destroyed building, which contains component parts of technological process, in particular presence of transport networks, facilities types of mechanization and direction of their moving. On the basis of the queuing system the basic <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> machines <b>co-operation</b> are certain...|$|R

40|$|About the {{teaching}} <b>of</b> <b>co-operation</b> The teaching <b>of</b> <b>co-operation</b> {{has a long}} history and education has always been seen as an important part of co-operative thinking. A lot has been written internationally on co-operation and the research of it is getting more versatile all the time. However, the research of {{the teaching}} and training <b>of</b> <b>co-operation</b> has remained narrower. This has without doubt made the work of the teachers and instructors <b>of</b> <b>co-operation</b> more difficult. The teaching task <b>of</b> <b>co-operation</b> has become more and more challenging. How to teach co-operation now that ”the new forms <b>of</b> <b>co-operation,</b> as well as the changes of the traditional business area <b>of</b> <b>co-operation,</b> are connected in sociological dialogue to the themes of civil society, the third sector, social economy, local economy, partnership, social capital and entrepreneurship and anthropocentric activity ” (Laurinkari 2004, 148) ? In today’s information society the contents of teaching have to be linked to the reality surrounding us. The advantage of the teaching <b>of</b> <b>co-operation</b> is that this demand is, according to Laurinkari’s (2004) point of view, like built-in in the new co-operation. Information society demands the applying, completing and questioning of the information learned. Like other training, also the teaching <b>of</b> <b>co-operation</b> has to both offer possibilities for this and have the courage to 2 scrutinize the contents of its teaching critically, being in dialogue also with experts and students about the working and applicability of them. E-learning or learning in the web? Computer-aided instruction (CAI) has been studied already since the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s. These studies clarified how different teaching- and questionnaire programs affect the learning of students. Later the studies of CAI have been collected into different meta-studies, and according to these the effect of computers/programs on learning has bee...|$|R

Having analysed scientific works of many scientists and considered a significant number of regulatory and legal acts, the authors systemised the component elements of the legal provision <b>of</b> trans-border <b>co-operation</b> <b>of</b> enterprises and showed a hierarchical connection between them. In the result of the study the article presents a rather complete system of regulatory and legal provision <b>of</b> trans-border <b>co-operation</b> <b>of</b> enterprises and provides a complete list of regulatory and legal acts directed at regulation <b>of</b> such a <b>co-operation.</b> The prospects <b>of</b> further studies in this direction are development of proposals on improvement of the existing regulatory and legal base of Ukraine in the sphere <b>of</b> trans-border <b>co-operation</b> and development <b>of</b> efficient ways of development <b>of</b> trans-border <b>co-operation</b> <b>of</b> enterprises.
