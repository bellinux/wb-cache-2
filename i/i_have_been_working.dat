I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began work}} on her third studio album Speak Now two years prior to its release in 2010. [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was written by Swift when she was sixteen years old, prior the release of her eponymous album in 2006. She {{performed}} the song live during several bar shows [...] "of forty and fifty people". A recorded live performance of the song during one of her concerts made its way onto the internet in 2007. The song became a favorite among Swift's fans, leading Swift to rework the song and include it on Speak Now after having so many requested {{for it to be}} included on the album. Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote {{a few years ago and}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on it ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans have heard it before in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't wait for them to hear." ...|$|E

[...] "Whereas The Golden Compass had to be introduced to the public carefully", he said, [...] "the religious themes {{in the second and third}} books can't be minimised without destroying the spirit of these books. ...I will not be involved with any 'watering down' of books two and three, since what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> towards the whole time in the first film is to be able to deliver on the second and third". In May 2006, Pullman said of a version of the script that [...] "all the important scenes are there and will have their full value"; in March 2008, he said of the finished film that [...] "a lot of things about it were good.... Nothing can bring out all that's in the book. There are always compromises".|$|E

2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, a Forest Service {{contracting}} officer {{determined that}} the exchanges had been illegal, and on December 1, 1998, the Forest Service asserted ownership of the aircraft and ruled that the aircraft must be returned. [...] "The original exchange agreements for the transfer of aircraft are void because we didn't {{have the authority to}} conduct an exchange. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> to resolve concerns about the air tanker program raised in the OIG audit and issued the letter asserting aircraft ownership on behalf of the Agency," [...] stated Ron Hooper, staff assistant to the Forest Service Deputy Chief for Business Operations, the contracting officer who made the determination of ownership, and who would later testify to that effect in court. In letters sent to the operators, the Forest Service also said that they were prepared to return the titles of the historical aircraft then in museums, many of which were no longer flyable. The airtanker operators sued and eventually prevailed against this ruling. The assertion of ownership ruling allowed for continued operation of eleven of the aircraft which were scheduled to be used under the 1999 National Air Tanker Contract (five other operable aircraft were in the possession of companies who either were unsuccessful in their bid for the contract, or simply chose not to bid; the aircraft, the USFS stated, must still be maintained and used only for firefighting purposes).|$|E
2500|$|Debussy {{had long}} been fascinated by the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, {{familiar}} to French readers through the translations by Charles Baudelaire. As early as 1890, André Suarès {{wrote in a letter}} to Romain Rolland that [...] "Monsieur Claude Debussy... is working on a symphony that will unfold psychological ideas based on the stories of Poe, in particular, The Fall of the House of Usher." [...] Nothing came of this plan but in the wake of the success of his only completed opera, Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902, Debussy turned to Poe for material for a potential successor. He worked on his first attempt at a Poe-inspired opera, the comedy Le diable dans le beffroi, for several years before finally abandoning it in 1911 or 1912. By mid-June 1908 Debussy had begun another opera based on a Poe tale, the darker Fall of the House of Usher. On 5 July he signed a contract with the New York Metropolitan Opera guaranteeing the house the right to stage the premiere of his projected Poe double-bill as well as another unwritten opera La légende de Tristan. That summer he wrote to his friend Jacques Durand: [...] "These days <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> hard on The Fall of the House of Usher...There are moments when I lose the feeling of things around me and if the sister of Roderick Usher were to come into my house, I shouldn't be very surprised." ...|$|E
