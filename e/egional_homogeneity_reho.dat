40|$|Recently, {{increasing}} {{attention has}} focused on exploring brain activity during rest. A current challenge is to ascertain activity patterns without using an external reference. In this paper, we propose a model-free approach based on regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> to identify specific network of brain regions during rest.

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} whether male violent {{juvenile offenders}} demonstrate any differences in local functional connectivity indicative of delayed maturation {{of the brain}} that may serve as a biomarker of violence. Twenty-nine violent juvenile offenders and 28 age-matched controls were recruited. Regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> method was used to analyze resting-state magnetic resonance images. Violent offenders showed significantly lower ReHo values in the right caudate, right medial prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus, and higher values in the right supramarginal gyrus than the controls.

40|$|Most {{patients}} with {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) {{are thought to be}} in an early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reflects spontaneous brain activity and/or the endogenous/background neurophysiological process of the human brain.

Impairments in the medial temporal gyrus and hippocampus may serve as important markers distinguishing MCI from healthy aging. Moreover, the increased ReHo index observed in the postcentral and paracentral lobes might indicate compensation for the cognitive function losses in individuals with MCI...|$|R

40|$|Resting-state fMRI studies {{investigating}} the pathophysiology of depression have identified prominent abnormalities in large-scale brain networks. However, {{it is unclear}} if localized dysfunction of specialized brain regions contribute to network-level abnormalities.

Exploiting the statistical power gained from pooled analysis, we also investigated the effects of age, gender, illness duration and treatment on ReHo. The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) showed the most robust and reliable increase in ReHo in depression, with greater abnormality in medication-free patients with multiple episodes. Brain networks that relate to this region have been identified previously to show aberrant connectivity in depression, and we propose that the localized neuronal inefficiency of MPFC exists alongside wider network level disruptions involving this region...|$|R

The neurobiological underpinnings of IGA should be studied {{to unravel the}} potential heterogeneity of IGA. This study investigated the brain functions in IGA patients with resting-state fMRI. Methods Fifteen IGA subjects and fourteen healthy controls participated in this study. Regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> measures were used to detect the abnormal functional integrations. Results Comparing to the healthy controls, IGA subjects show enhanced ReHo in brainstem, inferior parietal lobule, left posterior cerebellum, and left middle frontal gyrus. All of these regions are thought related with sensory-motor coordination. In addition, IGA subjects show decreased ReHo in temporal, occipital and parietal brain regions. These regions are thought responsible for visual and auditory functions.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the regional synchronization of brain in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from twenty-one patients with JME and twenty-two healthy subjects. Regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> was used to analyze the spontaneous activity in whole brain. Two-sample t-test was performed to detect the ReHo difference between two groups.

40|$|Background. Previous volume-based {{regional}} <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> studies neglected the intersubject {{variability in}} cortical folding patterns. Recently, surface-based ReHo {{was developed to}} reduce the intersubject variability and to increase statistical power. The present study used this novel surface-based ReHo approach to explore the brain functional activity differences between first-episode, drug-naive MDD patients and healthy controls. Methods. Thirty-three first-episode, drug-naive MDD patients and 32 healthy controls participated in structural and resting-state fMRI scans. MDD patients were rated with a 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression prior to the scan. Results. In comparison with the healthy controls, MDD patients showed reduced surface-based ReHo in the left insula. There was no increase in surface-based ReHo in MDD patients. The surface-based ReHo value in the left insula was not significantly correlated with the clinical information or the depressive scores in the MDD group. Conclusions.

40|$|Abstract. So far, resting state {{functional}} connectivity (RSFC) {{has been}} per-formed mainly by seed correlation analysis (SCA) on functional MRI (fMRI) studies. In previous studies, the seeds are usually selected {{on the basis}} of prior anatomical information or previously performed activation maps. In this paper, we proposed a novel way to select the desired seeds by taking the natures of resting state data into account. The proposed approach is based on the meas-urement of regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> of brain regions. Using this technique, 2 locations showing higher ReHo in the cerebellum (i. e. the bilateral anterior inferior cerebellum, AICb) were identified and used as the seeds for RSFC pat-terns studies. We found that the bilateral AICb show significant functional con-nectivity with the bilateral thalamus, the bilateral hippocampus, the precuneus, the temporal lobe and the prefrontal lobe. Further, the differences of RSFC pat-terns between the bilateral AICb were ascertained by a random effect paired t-test. These findings may improve our understanding of cerebellar involvement in motor and a variety of non-motor functions. ...|$|R

40|$|Consistent resting brain {{activity}} patterns have been repeatedly demonstrated using measures derived from resting BOLD fMRI data. While those metrics are presumed to reflect underlying spontaneous {{brain activity}} (SBA), it is challenging {{to prove that}} association because resting BOLD fMRI metrics are purely model-free and scale-free variables. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is typically closely coupled to brain metabolism and is used as a surrogate marker for quantifying regional brain function, including resting function. Assessing the correlations between resting BOLD fMRI measures and CBF correlation should provide a means of linking of those measures to the underlying SBA, and a means to quantify those scale-free measures.

Here, we use task-related and resting-state fMRI to investigate neuroplasticity in the primary sensory (S 1) and motor cortex (M 1) in patients with acute Bell’s palsy (BP). We found that the period directly following the onset of BP (less than 14 days) is associated with significant decreases in regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo),</b> fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC) values in the contralateral S 1 /M 1 and in ReHo and ICC values in the ipsilateral S 1 /M 1, compared to healthy controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to their self-rating depression scale (SDS) score, MWoA were divided into twenty in the SDS (+) (SDS > 49) group and 20 in the SDS (-) (SDS ≤ 49) group. Regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> method were employed to assess local features of spontaneous brain activity between 1) all MWoA and healthy controls, 2) each subgroup and healthy controls, and 3) SDS (-) group and SDS (+) group. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, decreased ReHo in similar regions were shown in the MWoA group and subgroups. It is noteworthy that the caudate showed increased ReHo in the SDS (-) group compared with healthy controls and the SDS (+) group. Moreover, the average ReHo values of the caudate in SDS (-) group were significantly positively correlated with duration of migraine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that ReHo patterns in migraine patients may be affected by depressive symptoms and serve as a biomarker to reflect depression severity in MWoA...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the changes in the vision-related resting-state network (V-RSN) in pituitary adenoma (PA) patients after vision improvement, which was induced by operative treatment. Methods: Ten PA patients with an improved visual acuity or/and visual field after transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection were recruited and underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, as well as an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol, including structural and resting-state functional MRI sequences before and after the operation. The regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> of the V-RSN was evaluated. Two sample t-test was performed to identify the significant differences in the V-RSN in the PA patients before and after transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection. Results: Compared with the preoperation counterparts, the PA patients with improved vision after the operation exhibited reduced ReHo in the bilateral thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, putamen nucleus, supplementary motor area, and left hippocampal formation, and increased ReHo in the bilateral cuneus gyrus, calcarine gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Conclusions: PA patients with improved vision exhibit increased neural activity within the visual cortex, but decreased neural activity in subareas of the multisensory and multimodal systems beyond the vision cortex...|$|R
40|$|As {{patients}} with Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{are at high}} risk for comorbid depression, it is hypothesized that these two diseases are sharing common pathogenic pathways. Using regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo)</b> and functional connectivity approaches, we characterized human regional brain activity at resting state to examine specific brain networks in {{patients with}} PD and those with PD and depression (PDD). This study comprised 41 PD human patients and 25 normal human subjects. The patients completed the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and were further divided into two groups: patients with depressive symptoms and non-depressed PD patients (nD-PD). Compared with the non-depressed patients, those with depressive symptoms exhibited significantly increased regional activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus, and decreased ReHo in the left amygdala and bilateral lingual gyrus. Brain network connectivity analysis revealed decreased functional connectivity within the prefrontal-limbic system and increased functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex and lingual gyrus in PDD compared with the nD-PD group. In summary, the findings showed regional brain activity alterations and disruption of the mood regulation network in PDD patients. The pathogenesis of PDD may be attributed to abnormal neural activity in multiple brain regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this work, a discriminative {{model of}} {{attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is presented on the basis of multivariate pattern classification and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This model consists of two parts, a classifier and an intuitive representation of discriminative pattern of brain function between patients and normal controls. Regional <b>homogeneity</b> (<b>ReHo),</b> a measure of brain function at resting-state, is used here as a feature of classification. Fisher discriminative analysis (FDA) is performed on the features of training samples and a linear classifier is generated. Our initial experimental results show a successful classification rate of 85 %, using leave-one-out cross validation. The classifier is also compared with linear support vector machine (SVM) and Batch Perceptron. Our classifier outperforms the alternatives sig-nificantly. Fisher brain, the optimal projective-direction vector in FDA, is used to represent the discriminative pattern. Some abnormal brain regions identified by Fisher brain, like prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, are well consistent with that reported in neuroimaging studies on ADHD. Moreover, some less reported but highly discriminative regions are also identified. We conclude that the discriminative model has potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of ADHD. ...|$|R
