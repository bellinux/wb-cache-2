5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for {{the entire state of}} Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} his first novel was {{published}} Maugham began contributing to magazines and periodicals; initially these were short stories, but he also wrote opinion pieces, non-fictional and autobiographical work, and letters. Much of his non-fictional writing was published in book form, and covered a range of topics, including travel, current affairs, autobiography and belles lettres. Maugham was also editor {{on a number of}} works, which often included adding a preface or introductory chapter to the work of other writers. In 1903 his first play was performed, A Man of Honour at the Imperial Theatre, London. It was the first of many of his works that were produced for the stage, and with the later development of cinema, his novels and stories were also adapted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen.|$|E

He was active in Republican Party politics in Grand Rapids, Michigan, {{and was one of}} the organizers of a reform movement to oust the city's political boss, Frank McKay. As an anti-McKay reform candidate, Goebel was three times elected mayor of Grand Rapids in the 1950s. He was later elected to the University of Michigan Board of Regents, where he served from 1962 to 1970.|$|E

The watches and warnings prompted residents to board up windows and stock up on emergency supplies. The storm's approach also closed down beaches and prompted officials to cancel outdoor activates as a precaution and the American Red Cross opened shelters and provided emergency services. The preparations for Hurricane Jimena cost the American Red Cross $5,000 (2003 USD).|$|E
5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the cyclone, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island. A tropical storm warning was subsequently issued for the same location, The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20 transportation, public works, and health experts to the region. Many schools were closed, including the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College; as a result, an estimated 26,000 college students were sent home. As a weakening cyclone, Flossie produced light precipitation {{on the island of}} Hawaii. Large waves impacted south-facing beaches while the maximum sustained wind observed reached 39mph (63km/h) at South Point. No fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Filmation began {{producing}} several new series <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Three television networks.

According to Scheimer, filming with the animals was tough, as the bulldog who portrayed Tyrone would often chase the cats on set around and not stay still during filming.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} {{week of the}} season, however, Indiana {{suffered}} its first loss: a 2715 conference defeat {{at the hands of}} No.22 Wisconsin. The Hoosiers recovered from the setback, however, and won their next four games—all of which were against Big Ten opponents. The fourth of those victories came against the Michigan State Spartans, who had replaced Wisconsin at the No.22 spot in the country. Indiana held the Spartans scoreless in a tough defensive battle, earning a 100 victory. With a 71 record, Indiana appeared to be in position to compete <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Ten championship, but consecutive losses to highly ranked Penn State and Ohio State put an end to any thoughts of a championship. The Hoosiers ended the season with a 2417 win over traditional rival Purdue and accepted a bid to the Independence Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1999college {{football}} season with raised expectations.

The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which {{was supposed to be a}} rebuilding year—in the 1998 Music City Bowl, where the Hokies defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 387. With the addition of redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick to a team that had allowed an average of just 12.9points per game on defense, there was the possibility that Tech could improve upon its previous season's performance. Sports Illustrated, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to the first game of the season.|$|E
