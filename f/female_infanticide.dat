In addition to <b>female</b> <b>infanticide,</b> girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E

5|$|Under Confucianism {{the typical}} family was patriarchal because men had the {{capability}} {{to pass on the}} family name and carry on the lineage of the ancestors; women were expected to be subservient. Adoption of Western family values in the twentieth century challenged traditional Chinese values. Nationalism contributed to the changes of customs and status of women. Nationalist revolutionary Qiu Jin promoted feminism through various essays and speeches, as well as through her Chinese Women's Journal. Jin chastised wife beating, <b>female</b> <b>infanticide,</b> arranged marriages, and foot binding. She eventually began teaching at a girls' school. Around this time, many other schools for girls opened in China. This led to increased job opportunities for women in the 1920s.|$|E

Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani.

30|$|The above being stated, {{this study}} {{examines}} the sociological aspects of the gender imbalance in contemporary India, showing how old traditions that justify discrimination against women and widows persist {{in a society where}} the Indian Silicon Valley, digital technology, modern university Campuses, the election of a woman President, Miss World Competitions and Bollywood coexist along with the signs of unprecedented discrimination against women and widows (Giri 2002 a, p. 107), dowry practices and dowry deaths, <b>female</b> <b>infanticides</b> and feticides, the holy city of Vrindavan and its ashrams. Our interest is geared toward unexpected, emergent, combinations between modern forms and older traditional gender forms existing in contemporary Indian society. From our perspective, these unexpected combinations should be framed within a new theoretical and methodological approach toward social system study, namely within the conception of social systems as complex adaptive systems and an emergentist, nonlinear conception of social change. This aspect will be addressed in the concluding section of the article. Data supporting our point of view, which represent the major social indicators of gender inequality, beginning with sex ratio trends according to regional distribution up to <b>female</b> <b>infanticides</b> and sex-selective abortions and dowry deaths, come from official census data from 1901 to 2011 and from national and international reports on women’s condition in India.|$|R
5000|$|In India, the male-female {{sex ratio}} is skewed {{dramatically}} {{in favour of}} males, the chief reason being {{the high number of}} females who die before reaching adulthood.

40|$|Background: An {{important}} modern diagnostic tool, {{used for}} monitoring pregnancy and genetic defects; the ultrasound machine, {{has also become}} a selective killer of the female child. The male child preference in India was responsible for <b>female</b> <b>infanticides</b> in the past. With easy availability and accessibility of USG, a shift has occurred from infanticide to feticide, although <b>female</b> <b>infanticides</b> still continue. In the process doctors are blamed as "merchants of death". Peeved and pressed by national and internal agencies for the declining female child ratio (0 - 6 years), the Government of India reacted by enacting a stringent PC-PNDT Act almost solely aimed at doctors {{to prevent them from}} advertising and disclosing the sex of the fetus to the pregnant woman or her relatives. Since the enactment, hundreds of cases have been launched against the doctors. Aims: 1.

The Indian legal system rests the "burden of proof" on the prosecution. In two sections of The Act, these have been done away with. Instead, the accused doctor has to prove himself innocent. Therefore a demand has been made to make suitable amendments to The Act in this regard. 3.

50|$|The chacma baboon usually {{lives in}} social groups, called troops, which are {{composed}} of multiple adult males, adult females, and their offspring. Occasionally, however, very small groups form that consist of only a single adult male and several adult females. Chacma troops are characterized by a dominance hierarchy. Female ranking within the troop is inherited through the mother and remains relatively fixed, while male ranking is often in flux, especially when the dominant male is replaced. Chacmas are unusual among baboons in that neither males nor females form strong relationships {{with members of the}} same sex. Instead, the strongest social bonds are often between unrelated adult males and <b>females.</b> <b>Infanticide</b> is also common compared to other baboon species, as newly dominant males will often attempt to kill young baboons sired by the previously dominant male. Baboon troops possess a complex group behavior and communicate by means of body attitudes, facial expressions, vocalizations and touch.|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: The {{theme of}} women and death is {{pervasive}} in the German culture {{of the past five}} centuries. With the conviction that only an interdisciplinary approach can explore a typology as far-reaching and significant as this, and in accordance with the feminist tenet that images are accountable for norms, this volume investigates how iconic representations {{of women and}} death came about and why they endure. Traditionally, representations of women as agents of death [...] when they have been considered at all [...] have been considered separately from women as victims, as though there was no shared thematic ground. Here, familiar depictions of female victims are examined alongside the more unsettling spectacle of women as killers, exposing cultural assumptions. Essays explore, among others, the themes of virgin sacrifice and <b>female</b> <b>infanticides,</b> "Death and the Maiden" in art, female vampires in literature, and women killers in the media. Others compare cultural practices such as female mourning across historical contexts, examining change and the reasons for it. The authors' judgments eschew the simplistic and programmatic, contributing not just to current research in German literature, but also to understanding of cultural history in general...|$|R
30|$|These {{unexpected}} combinations are not comprehensible {{in light}} of a linear concept of social change which is founded, in turn, on a concept of social systems as interaction systems that relate to exterior or environmental perturbations according to proportional cause and effect relationships. According to this approach, based on the classic scientific epistemological Newtonian.-Laplacian paradigm, viewing social systems as systems characterized by a linear structure of interaction relationships among system’s components/agents means assuming that evolution or change processes are linear as well, and therefore, their predictability and control are ensured (see Condorelli 2013). From this perspective, therefore, facing modernization inputs, behavioral attitudes and interaction relationships should be less and less regulated by traditional values and practices as exposure to modernizing influences increases. And progressive decreases should be found in rates of social indicators of gender inequality like dowry deaths (the inverse should be found in sex ratio trends). However, this linear, proportional weakening process of tradition as a regulating principle of social interaction was not confirmed from data. As we have seen, modernity and tradition reinforce each other reciprocally. Tradition absorbs, combines with modernization and, rather than weakens until it disappears, strengthens, continuing to last in regulating social interaction relationships and harnessing the potential for social change of the modernization process. This {{is the case of}} <b>female</b> <b>infanticides</b> and feticides and dowry practice, which has extremely serious adverse consequences for women.|$|R
25|$|Infanticide in India, and {{elsewhere}} in the world, is a difficult issue to objectively access because reliable data is unavailable. Scrimshaw states that not only accurate frequency of <b>female</b> <b>infanticide</b> is unknown, differential care between male and female infants is even more elusive data. Reliable data for <b>female</b> <b>infanticide</b> is unavailable. Its frequency, and that of sex-selective abortion, is indirectly estimated from the observed high birth sex ratio; that is, the ratio of boys to girls at birth or 0–1 age group infants, or 0–6 age group child sex ratio. The natural ratio is assumed to be 106, or somewhere between 103 and 107, and any number above or below this range is considered as suggestive of female or male foeticide respectively.|$|E

30|$|Using Census of India {{data from}} 1901 to 2011 and {{national}} and international reports on women’s condition in India, beginning with sex ratio trends according to regional distribution up to <b>female</b> <b>infanticides</b> and sex-selective abortions and dowry deaths, this study examines the sociological aspects of the gender imbalance in modern contemporary India. Gender inequality persistence in India proves that new values and structures do not necessarily lead to the disappearance of older forms, but they can co-exist with mutual adaptations and reinforcements. Data analysis suggests that these unexpected combinations are not comprehensible in light of a linear concept of social change which is founded, in turn, on a concept of social systems as linear interaction systems that relate to environmental perturbations according to proportional cause and effect relationships. From this perspective, in fact, behavioral attitudes and interaction relationships should be less and less proportionally regulated by traditional values and practices as exposure to modernizing influences increases. And progressive decreases should be found in rates of social indicators of gender inequality like dowry deaths (the inverse should be found in sex ratio trends). However, data does not confirm these trends. This finding leads to emphasize a new theoretical and methodological approach toward social systems study, namely the conception of social systems as complex adaptive systems and the consequential emergentist, nonlinear conception of social change processes. Within the framework of emergentist theory of social change {{is it possible to}} understand the lasting strength of the patriarchal tradition and its problematic consequences in the modern contemporary India.|$|R

30|$|In the North, {{control of}} {{economic}} resources by women is non-existent {{and the influence}} of Patriarchy is persistent and pervasive. The Patriarchate institution shows a close link to the structure of production processes, to the way this structure determines the degree of female participation in production and the consequential social respect of women. In Northern rural villages like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the intensive wheat cultivation and general farming system is entrusted entirely to men (male farming system) as it requires the use of heavy machinery such as oxen-led plows. Women, unable to handle such heavy equipment needed for that type of farming, are excluded from the agricultural production process or are allowed to participate only occasionally for short periods of time, such as during harvest time. Such an exclusion from the economic system implies social exclusion as well. By not working, women are unable to contribute in any way to the wealth and support of their family and of the community. They do not have their own income, property and are mainly involved in domestic work. Without any education and self sustenance, they are subject to the decisions, choices and often to the mood swings of their respective husbands. Therefore, they are socially invisible, and a social burden, more than a value for society. This explains the greater use of such strategies as for example, <b>female</b> <b>infanticides,</b> arranged child marriages, traditional dowry practices and dowry deaths (frequent uxorcides by husbands eager to remarry, once their wife’s dowry is consumed) and afterwards, at the husband’s death, the traditional abandonment of widows in Vrindavan or Varanasi.|$|R
