2500|$|The song's musical key is a {{combination}} of G major and G minor. Pollack comments that whereas Lennon and Paul McCartney had regularly employed a major key and its parallel minor to provide an element of contrast in their songs, Harrison's composition ensures that the two modes are [...] "blended", so creating a form that is [...] "neither quite really Major nor minor". In the description of musicologist Dominic Pedler, while G major appears to be the central key, the song's musical premise involves permanent tonic key ambiguity and [...] "restless root movement" [...] through extensive borrowing from the parallel minor key. The G7 chord over the introduction suggests a tonic key of G major and a musical mode of G Mixolydian, yet the verse opens with A minor, the ii chord in Roman numeral analysis, which suggests A Dorian mode, and the subsequent change to D minor then suggests A Aeolian mode, in which the chord represents iv. The immediate shift to a B chord (III in G major) followed by a C chord (IV in G major) creates further ambiguity, since these chords hint at a VI–VII rock run in D Aeolian.

5000|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{a dominant}} seventh is a four-note chord combining a major chord and a minor seventh. For example, the C7 dominant seventh chord adds B to the C-major chord (C,E,G). The naive chord (C,E,G,B) spans six frets from fret 3 to fret 8; such seventh chords [...] "contain some pretty serious stretches {{in the left}} hand". An illustration shows a naive C7 chord, which would be extremely difficult to play, besides the open-position C7 chord that is conventional in standard tuning. The standard-tuning implementation of a C7 chord is a second-inversion C7 drop 2 chord, in which the second-highest note <b>in</b> a <b>second</b> <b>inversion</b> of the C7 chord is lowered by an octave. Drop-two chords are used for sevenths chords besides the major-minor seventh with dominant function, which {{are discussed in the}} section on intermediate chords, below. Drop-two chords are used particularly in jazz guitar. Drop-two second-inversions are examples of openly voiced chords, which are typical of standard tuning and other popular guitar-tunings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A model-based {{inversion}} {{method was}} used to obtain quantitative estimates of histological parameters from multispectral images of the colon and to examine their potential for discriminating between normal and pathological tissues. Pixel-wise estimates of the mucosal blood volume fraction, density of the scattering particles and thickness were derived using a two-stage method. In the first (forward) stage reflectance spectra corresponding to given instances of the parameter values were computed using Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation through a multi-layered tissue. <b>In</b> the <b>second</b> (<b>inversion)</b> stage the parameter values were obtained via optimisation using an Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm based on Discrete Markov Random Fields (DMRF). The method was validated on computer generated data contaminated with noise giving a mean normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD) of 2. 04. Validation on ex vivo images demonstrated that parametric maps show gross correspondence with histological features of mucosa characteristic of cancerous, pre-cancerous and non-cancerous colon lesions.

Based on the verification of the local dynamic behaviour of the structure, the FAT constitutes an interesting inverse problem since boundary conditions and sources outside the studied domain may not be known. In its first developments, the FAT was written for analytically known structures like beams, plates and shells but more recently, its adaptation to more complex structures was possible thanks {{to the use of}} Finite Element Method and model reductions. In this mathematical adaptation, the regularization of the problem is done by a double inversion of the numerical operator where the well known Tikhonov regularization is applied <b>in</b> the <b>second</b> <b>inversion.</b> <b>In</b> order to correct the smoothing effect on regularized results, it is then proposed to apply a deconvolution post-process made by the Richardson-Lucy algorithm.

40|$|About three-hundred microearthquakes, preceeding and {{accompanying}} the 2002 - 2003 Mt. Etna flank eruption, were considered in this study. On the high-quality velocity seismograms, {{measurements of the}} first half cycle of the wave, the so-called rise time ?, were carried out. By using the rise time method, these data were inverted to infer an estimate of the intrinsic quality factor Qp of P waves and of the source rise time ? 0 of the events, which represents an estimate of the duration of the rupture process. Two kind of inversions were carried out. In the first inversion ? 0 was derived from the magnitude duration of the events, assuming a constant stress drop and Qp was inferred from the inversion of reduced rise times ??? 0. <b>In</b> the <b>second</b> <b>inversion</b> both ? 0 and Qp were inferred from the inversion of rise times. To determine the model parameters that realize the compromise between model simplicity and quality of the fit, the corrected Akaike information criterion was used. After this analysis we obtained Qp= 57 ± 42. The correlation among the inferred ? 0 and Qp, which is caused by some events which concomitantly have high ? 0 (> 30 ms) and high Qp (> 100) indicates that the technique used is able to model rise time versus travel time trend only for source dimensions less than about 80 m...|$|R

5000|$|The Bebop Major scale, for example, {{is a major}} {{scale with}} an extra note between the 5th and 6th scale degrees.

5000|$|In music, {{especially}} modern {{popular music}} a slash chord or slashed chord, also compound chord, is a chord whose bass note or inversion {{is indicated by}} the addition of a slash and the letter of the bass note after the root note letter. It does not indicate [...] "or".For example, a C major chord (C) <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>inversion</b> is written C/G or C/G bass, which reads [...] "C slash G", [...] "C over G" [...] or [...] "C over a G bass". If E were the bass it would be written C/E or C/E bass (making a major chord in first inversion), which is read [...] "C slash E", [...] "C over E" [...] or C/E bass. Some chords may not otherwise be notated, such as A/A. Thus, a slash chord may also indicate the chord form or shape and an additional bass note.In popular music, where the exact arrangement of notes is less important than some other forms, slash chords are generally used only when the specific bass note is important. A common example in guitar based music is in the I-V-vi progression, in which the V chord is a passing chord. By placing the third of the V chord in the bass, a descending scale, also known as a walkdown, is created in the bass. For example, in the key of G major this would be the chords G, D/F, Em. That progression has the descending bassline G, F, E. This type of slash chord contains diatonically occurring notes. In traditional Classical notation it would be written using figured bass symbols. Another commonly-used type of slash chord in chord progressions is the minor key progression i-i/VII bass-IV/VI bass-V. In the key of A minor, this chord progression would be notated A minor, A minor/G bass, D Minor/F bass, E major (or E7). This descending bassline moving diatonically from i to V is a stock feature in popular music that is used in numerous songs.|$|E

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 8 : 27 in length. The piece selected for this conducting recital was Richard Strauss' Allerseelen, with symphonic band setting by Albert Oliver Davis, edited by Frederick Fennell. The title, German for "All Soul's Day", {{was one of}} the four final pieces of the Op. 10 song set. These songs, dedicated to the famed Munich Opera tenor Heinrich Vogl, were the first of Strauss' Lieder to be published. The last four of these works were penned in November in Meinengen just after Strauss' appointment to assistant conductor under Hans von Bulow. Allerseelen, along with three other works from the set, was debuted in a chamber music recital in Meiningen on March 5, 1886. The original song is a straight forward incipient binary which lasts about three minutes. In contrast, the Davis/Fennel! version for Symphonic Wind Band is much larger. This expansion is achieved through the addition of an introduction, development section, recapitulation, and coda. Thematically much of the piece is based on a four note statement, a descending triad <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>inversion</b> with the terminal note repeated, which is heard in the lead horn at the third measure. Beginning at measure fourteen, we are introduced to a process in which the motif is repeated four times, rising from trombones to trumpets, then woodwinds, and finally the horn section. At each color change, the triad is inverted to begin with the chordal member one leap below that which began the previous statement, effectively leading us from first inversion to root position, second inversion, and back to first inversion as a climax. In addition to the preparation of the introduction's closing, this is significant because it foreshadows the added development section based upon the same process, leading to a continuity among the sections added to the original work. At measure twenty-four the original four note fragment is expanded into a full statement of the A theme, thus revealing the previous material to have been introductory in nature. This A section is delivered in two parts and then returned to after a brief 8 section, yielding the incipient binary structure of the original piece. Following this a developmental section is heard based upon the aforementioned inverting process. The development section is followed by an exuberant return of the A theme in varied repetition. It {{should be pointed out that}} while this section is heard as a kind of recapitulation, the structure is not sonata form due to the return of the A section prior to the development. The piece ends with the return of Strauss' original ending, first heard before the development section and now serving as a quasi coda. Faced with such an homogenous piece, the challenge to the conductor lies in balance, pacing, and tone, with the purpose of illustrating for the audience the evolutionary process through which the work is realized. Maintaining the proper balance of color and emphasis is significant in this work due to its thick scoring. Without proper attentiveness in this area the piece can quickly become bogged down beneath its own weight. Related to this is the crucial task of pacing, for the true communication of the piece lies in its struggle to rise above its conflicts. Without careful pacing, the piece has a tendency to feel repetitive, something which is avoided by the meticulous guiding of the piece's energies toward the consummation of the primary theme at measure ninety-one. Lastly, the piece undergoes a series of tone changes, progressing respectively through solemnity, yearning, insecurity, satisfaction denied, anger, strife, celebration, and finally satisfied peace. As mentioned earlier, it is this evolution which communicates with the audience. With so little contrast in the piece these changes in tone become the subject matter of the work, and thus the ability to convincingly portray this process defines the communicative success of the experience...|$|E
