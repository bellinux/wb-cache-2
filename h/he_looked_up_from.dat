2500|$|At first {{all went}} well. Panjandrum {{rolled into the}} sea and began {{to head for the}} shore, the Brass Hats {{watching}} through binoculars from the top of a pebble ridge [...] Then a clamp gave: first one, then two more rockets broke free: Panjandrum began to lurch ominously. It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. As he ran for his life, he glimpsed the assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements. Panjandrum was now heading back to the sea but crashed on to the sand where it disintegrated in violent explosions, rockets tearing across the beach at great speed.|$|E

60|$|They {{found him}} in the room he called his study. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his desk as they entered.|$|E
50|$|Now, in the present, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the jade amulet to see Bai Wu Xia, who has sneaked {{into the}} side wing of the sanctum and is staring at him from behind a great pillar. He hesitates, then vows to remain celibate, and she leaves.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> swiftly <b>from</b> {{under his}} shaggy brows. The book {{fell to the}} floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Loudon," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the journal, [...] "you {{sometimes}} think I {{have too many}} irons in the fire. My notion, on the other hand, is, {{when you see a}} dollar lying, pick it up! Well, here I've tumbled over a whole pile of 'em on a reef {{in the middle of the}} Pacific." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> {{a diagram}} of some Thames-mouth shoals {{which he was}} {{explaining}} to me, and answered with his gentle smile: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> {{the letter}} spread out before him. Lucille was seated at his command, {{a few yards}} away. Mr. Sabin stood respectfully before him.|$|E
6000|$|After {{writing a}} few lines, {{she rose and}} handed the paper to him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> it in surprise. [...] "Addressed to Mrs. MacEdwin!" [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may thank your stars I've {{come back}} to-night," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> under his dropped head, sulkily, {{trying to be}} impressive.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the tea-pot, {{into which}} he had been pouring water; [...] "you can be certain of the food at Cook's." ...|$|R
60|$|Two days later, as Mr. Crewe {{was seated}} in his study, his man entered and stood respectfully waiting for the time when <b>he</b> should <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his book.|$|R
6000|$|His {{order was}} obeyed promptly; but George's {{appetite}} {{was taken away}} the next moment by Dolly's exclaiming, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his damaged coat, with a scandalized face: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} my friend again," [...] said the Jew to himself, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the paper. [...] "Let him make an attempt {{on me and}} weâ€™ll see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{getting up}} an {{enthusiasm for the}} Service just from hearing Alec Belden rave against it," [...] he said a few minutes later, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his letter.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a famous}} {{portrait}} by Goya, the duke is clad in elegant riding clothes. With {{an air of}} melancholy <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the music book he is holding in his hands, including the [...] "Four songs/with piano accompaniment/by Mr. Haydn". The duke commissioned several works from Joseph Haydn and was a gifted musician himself. In his painting, Goya subtly combines the symbols of his model's passion for music and equestrian skills (viola or violin, riding boots and riding hat) with the neoclassical interior of the ducal residence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Archer," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> {{the papers}} on the desk before him, [...] "these verses are disgraceful. Of all in the holiday tasks sent in, yours appears {{to me to be}} the worst." ...|$|R
60|$|Coulthurst, {{who could}} not see the door <b>from</b> where <b>he</b> sat, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his book for just a moment, and did not appear to notice that Tomlinson was no longer in front of him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor Sissy! He {{had better}} have apprenticed her,' said Childers, giving his hair another shake, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the empty box. 'Now, he leaves her without {{anything}} to take to.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stanley was {{apparently}} very comfortable. He was smoking {{one of my}} best cigars, and a whisky and soda stood at his elbow. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> behind the Times as I entered.|$|E
60|$|Next morning Captain Hampton {{went through}} the diggings; {{presently}} he came upon the man he had spoken to the evening before. He was working with two others. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his work and nodded.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{you going}} into Rose's, in the High Street, this afternoon, Wren," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his Greek prose. [...] "I didn't give you leave. Come up here after prayers tonight. Shut the door." ...|$|R
6000|$|Huish sat {{cleaning}} a favourite briar-root; <b>he</b> scarce <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> that engrossing task. [...] "Don't ast me what I {{think of}} him!" [...] he said. [...] "There's a day comin', I pray Gawd, when I {{can tell it}} him myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Dr. Latimer was {{a friend}} of Mr. Bentley's, and betrayed no {{surprise}} at a situation which otherwise might have astonished him. It was only when he learned the dead man's name, and his parentage, that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> quickly <b>from</b> his note book.|$|R
60|$|Little did Mr. Brumley reckon {{when first}} <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his laces at Black Strand, how {{completely}} that pretty {{young woman in}} the dark furs was destined to shatter all the assumptions that had served his life.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his work, {{and scanned}} me hard, {{as was his}} wont. [...] "That is well," [...] he said at last, his eyes glowing deep; [...] "she was getting too great a hold on you, that young woman!" ...|$|E
60|$|When he had {{a moment}} of absence, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the table and said good-morning to Ursula. There was a {{pleasant}} light in his brown eyes. He seemed very manly and incontrovertible, like something she wanted to push over.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, of course!' <b>he</b> answered, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> {{the paper}} with a smile; 'I meant they were so many. But you do right to be particular. It {{stands to reason that}} you must be particular. Will you allow me to use your pen and ink?' ...|$|R
50|$|Two years later, Dr. Daniels {{is giving}} {{a lecture on}} Rachael's mind and how {{he wrote a book}} about her. When <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> {{speaking}} with a student, he sees Rachael, who has not died after all; she indirectly reveals that she killed Starkman's last assistant, Elizabeth McGuire, and stole her identity to get into Quantico. She allows Dr. Daniels to know because she believes {{there is no point in}} committing the perfect crime if no one knows about it and that she is proud of his success. The body that was in the car was the real Rachael. As she walks out of his class, Dr. Daniels is obviously disturbed and rattled.|$|R
60|$|He {{went into}} {{details of the}} new operations, and when <b>he</b> {{finished}} Nairn <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the figures <b>he</b> had been jotting down.|$|R
6000|$|Keith, {{the oldest}} boy, was coiled {{up on the}} sofa calmly working out some algebra problems, quite {{oblivious}} to the noise around him.

6000|$|... 'No, I don't think 'tis mine!' cried Ned hoarsely, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his hands. 'But she is mine, all the same! Ha'n't I nussed her? Ha'n't I fed her and teached her? Ha'n't I played wi' her? O, little Carry--gone {{with that}} rogue--gone!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, and ye'll no get oot to-morrow," [...] remarked Saunders with a {{shake of}} his head, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the log-book, in which he was making an entry. [...] "We're hard and fast, so we'll just have to make the best o't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will {{probably}} be six months before I sit here again, tangling your threads and maltreating your needles, Nan. How glad you must feel to hear it!" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> a thoughtful examination of the hard-working little citizens of the Industrial Community settled in Nan's work-basket.|$|R
60|$|Left to himself, {{he began}} to feel a certain languid curiosity in {{relation}} to the manuscript. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> over the pages, reading a line here and a line there. Suddenly he changed colour as <b>he</b> read--and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the manuscript like a man bewildered. 'Good God! what does this mean?' he said to himself.|$|R
500|$|In an {{obituary}} of Windon, he {{was described}} as [...] "not only a rugged, hard-tackling breakaway, he was a speedy, elusive runner with a gift for scoring tries". According to Max Howella fellow WallabyWindon claimed his best coach was his brother Keith. In order to analyse opponents, <b>he</b> would <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the scrum before the ball was fed.|$|R
