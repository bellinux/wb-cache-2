40|$|ABSTRACT: Trichobezoars (formations of <b>hair</b> <b>balls</b> {{that can}} not pass through the pyloric valve) are {{responsible}} of some of deaths observed in Angora rabbirs. A total of 160 trichobezoar deaths corresponding to 28. 6 % of total deaths were recorded during a reported period of five years. The highest mortality due to <b>hair</b> <b>balls</b> was recorded in 2001 (36. 4 %) and was least in 1999 (9. 4 %). Of the four breeds, the highest trichobezoar death records were obtained in Russian Angoras and the lowest in German Angoras. Trichobezoars occur more frequently in winter months than other months. Besides trichobezoars, other causes of death recorded were pneumonia, suppurative pneumonia, peritonitis, rupture of stomach, gastroenteritis, cardiac failure and {{a small number of}} miscellaneous causes. In most of the cases, large, single trichobezoars were located in the stomach. The stomach contents of the trichobezoar deaths were mainly watery and scanty faeces and hard semisolid faeces. The ball obstructed the stomach occupying the opening of the pyloric valve. Pathomorphological lesions were noted in stomach, liver, lungs, heart and kidney...|$|R

40|$|TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Mechanism of formation: • Plant hairs are {{apparently}} poorly digested by ruminal micro-organisms and accumulate in especially the abomasum. • Here {{under the influence}} of abomasal movement, innumerable hairs conglomerate (possibly around a small milk clot as nucleus) and felt together firmly in packed, dense layers to form balls of various shapes and 10 to 150 mm in diameter. • Up to 30 balls might be present in the abomasum. SYNDROMES: Intestinal <b>hair</b> <b>balls</b> originating from plants. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Gastro-intestinal system. CLINICAL SIGNS: Goats are more often affected than sheep and clinical signs and death occur in the age group 3 - 15 months. • Inappetance • Slow progressive loss in condition • Ruminal stasis • Distended abdomen (gas, <b>hair</b> <b>balls)</b> • Faeces - foul smelling and scanty. NECROPSY: • Emaciation, cachexia • Fore-stomachs thin-walled, papillae atrophied, contents watery, foul-smelling. • Bezoars in abomasum • Signs of rupture of abomasum or intestine may be seen. TREATMENT: • Purgatives are ineffective • Balls too firm to break manually • Surgery - consider cost effectiveness • Diagnose through palpation of abdomen and slaughter before too much condition is lost. PREVENTION: Avoid exposure of lambs to only seradella pastures or camps with causative plants especially during periods when pappus hairs are prevalent. Colour photos. Final web-ready size: JPEG.

Her condition seemed to improve a little, however on November 29, she suffered from fever and anuresis, and was hospitalized in a surgical department. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen and tenderness in the abdomen, but no tumor. An ultrasound examination {{was performed on the}} abdomen and a CT scan was performed on the pelvis. From the results of these tests, the patient was diagnosed with torsion of tumor in the left ovary. Peritoneotomy was performed and the result of the surgery showed that the tumor originated from the right overy, and was incarcerated in the pelvic cavity, exerting pressure on the base of the bladder. The tumor was 7 × 6 × 6 cm in size, and contained <b>hair</b> <b>balls</b> and 15 g of serum. Pathohistologically, fatty tissues, as well as developed crinis and bone tissues were found.

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of the digestion system of cats begins with their sharp teeth. Their sharp teeth help them tear meat which is {{most if not all}} of their diet. Cats naturally do not have a diet high in carbohydrates, and therefore, their saliva doesn’t contain the enzyme amylase.Food moves from the mouth through the esophagus and into the stomach. The gastrointestinal tract of domestic cats contains a small cecum and unsacculated colon. The cecum while similar to dogs, doesn’t have a coiled cecum. The stomach of the cat can be divided into distinct regions of motor activity. The proximal end of the stomach relaxes when food is digested.While food is being digested this portion of the stomach either has rapid stationary contractions or a sustained tonic contraction of muscle. These different actions result in either the food being moved around or the food moving towards the distal portion of the stomach.The distal portion of the stomach undergoes rhythmic cycles of partial depolarization.This depolarization sensitizes muscle cells so {{they are more likely to}} contract. The stomach is not only a muscular structure, it also serves a chemical function by releasing hydrochloric acid and other digestive enzymes to break down food. Food moves from the stomach into the small intestine. The first part of the small intestine is the duodenum. As food moves through the duodenum it mixes with bile, a fluid that neutralizes stomach acid and emulsifies fat. Bile is created in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. The pancreas releases enzymes that aid in digestion so that nutrients can be broken down and pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood and travel to the rest of the body.The pancreas doesn’t produce starch processing enzymes because cats don’t eat a diet high in carbohydrates. [...] Since the cat digests low amounts of glucose, the pancreas uses amino acids to trigger insulin release instead of glucose. Food then moves on to the jejunum. This is the most nutrient absorptive section of the small intestine. The liver regulates the level of nutrients absorbed into the blood system from the small intestine. From the jejunum, whatever food that has not been absorbed is sent to the ileum which connects to the large intestine.The first part of the large intestine is the cecum and the second portion is the colon. The large intestine reabsorbs water and forms fecal matter. There are some things that the cats are not able to digest. For example, cats clean themselves by licking their fur with their tongue, which causes them to swallow a lot of fur. This causes a build-up of fur in a cat’s stomach and creates a mass of fur. This is often thrown up and is better known as a <b>hair</b> <b>ball.</b> The short length of the digestive tract of the cat causes cats’ digestive system to weigh less than other species of animals, which allows cats to be active predators. While cats are well adapted to be predators they have a limited ability to regulate catabolic enzymes of amino acids meaning amino acids are constantly being destroyed and not absorbed.Therefore, cats have a higher protein requirement in their diet than many other species. Cats are not adapted to synthesize niacin from tryptophan and because they are carnivores can’t convert carotene to vitamin A so eating plants while not harmful does not provide them nutrients. Understanding the digestive system of a domestic cat is very important for pet owners. If a pet owner understands how the different parts work together then if a problem occurs they could potentially help the cat’s situation even before taking it to a vet.|$|E

40|$|A normal {{nuisance}} or a {{sign that}} something is wrong? Practical relevance: Vomiting of hair balls is a common problem in domestic cats, {{to the extent that}} it is considered by many owners and veterinarians to be a normal feline behaviour. Whether this is ever the case remains unclear but in most shorthaired cats the frequent elimination of hair balls is an indicator of an underlying chronic disease that is causing increased ingestion of fur or altered gastrointestinal motility. Pruritic skin disease, flea infestation and/or an underlying dietary intolerance are common contributing factors that should not be overlooked. Evidence base: Studies concerning this common problem are lacking and there are no previously published data regarding the incidence of hair balls in pet cats or potential predisposing causes. Although a range of commercial <b>hair</b> <b>ball</b> control diets are available there is no objective information in the public domain regarding their efficacy. Similarly, no studies have evaluated the success of other commonly recommended preventive strategies. Clinical challenges: Despite the lack of evidence-based information, veterinarians are faced with the day-to-day challenge of helping owners to limit the extent to which their cats produce hair balls. The problem is at best an unpleasant nuisance for both cat and owner, and at worst may be a cause of significant morbidity and even, in rare cases, mortality...|$|E

40|$|Self-assembled supramolecular organic {{liquid crystal}} {{structures}} at nanoscale have potential applications in molecular electronics, photonics, and porous nanomaterials. Most of these structures are formed by aggregation of soft spherical supramolecules, which have soft coronas and overlap {{each other in}} the packing process. Our main focus here is to study the possible packing mechanisms via molecular dynamics simulations at the atomistic level. We consider the relative stability of various lattices packed by the soft dendrimer balls, first synthesized and characterized by Percec et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 1539) with different packing methods. The dendrons, which form the soft dendrimer balls, have the character of a hard aromatic region from the point of the cone to the edge with C 12 alkane “hair”. After the dendrons pack into a sphere, the core of the sphere has the hard aromatic groups, while the surface is covered with the C 12 alkane “hair”. In our studies, we propose three ways to organize the <b>hair</b> on the <b>balls,</b> Smooth/Valentino balls, Sticky/Einstein balls, and Asymmetric/Punk balls, which lead to three different packing mechanisms, Slippery, Sticky, and Anisotropic, respectively. We carry out a series of molecular dynamics (MD) studies on three plausible crystal structures (A 15, FCC, and BCC) as a function of density and analyze the MD based on the vibrational density of state (DoS) method to extract the enthalpy, entropy, and free energies of these systems. We find that anisotropic packed A 15 is favored over FCC, BCC lattices. Our predicted X-ray intensities of the best structures are in excellent agreement with experiment. “Anisotropic ball packing” proposed here plays an intermediate role between the enthalpy-favored “disk packing” and entropy-favored “isotropic ball packing”, which explains the phase transitions at different temperatures. Free energies of various lattices at different densities are essentially the same, indicating that the preferred lattice is not determined during the packing process. Both enthalpy and entropy decrease as the density increases. Free energy change with volume shows two stable phases:[*] the condensed phase and the isolated micelle phase. The interactions between the soft dendrimer balls are found to be lattice dependent when described by a two-body potential because the soft ball self-adjusts its shape and interaction in different lattices. The shape of the free energy potential {{is similar to that of}} the “square shoulder potential”. A model explaining the packing efficiency of ideal soft balls in various lattices is proposed in terms of geometrical consideration...|$|R
