5000|$|The BGP <b>Extended</b> Community Attribute {{was added}} in 2006, {{in order to}} <b>extend</b> the range of such {{attributes}} {{and to provide a}} community attribute structuring by means of a type field. The <b>extended</b> format consists of one or two octets for the type field followed by seven or six octets for the respective community attribute content. The definition of this <b>Extended</b> Community Attribute is documented in RFC 4360. The IANA administers the registry for BGP <b>Extended</b> Communities Types.The <b>Extended</b> Communities Attribute itself is a transitive optional BGP attribute. However, a bit in the type field within the attribute decides whether the encoded <b>extended</b> community is of a transitive or non-transitive nature. The IANA registry therefore provides different number ranges for the attribute types.Due to the <b>extended</b> attribute range, its usage can be manifold. RFC 4360 exemplarly defines the [...] "Two-Octet AS Specific <b>Extended</b> Community", the [...] "IPv4 Address Specific <b>Extended</b> Community", the [...] "Opaque <b>Extended</b> Community", the [...] "Route Target Community", and the [...] "Route Origin Community". A number of BGP QoS drafts also use this <b>Extended</b> Community Attribute structure for inter-domain QoS signalling.|$|R

Using Green’s functions, the <b>extended</b> general displacement solutions are {{obtained by the}} boundary element method. This crack problem is reduced to solving a set of hypersingular integral equations coupled with boundary integral equations, in which the unknown functions are the <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities. Then, {{the behavior of the}} <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities around the crack front terminating at the interface is analyzed by the main-part analysis method of hypersingular integral equations. Analytical solutions for the <b>extended</b> singular stresses, the <b>extended</b> stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the <b>extended</b> energy release rate near the crack front in EMTE-MCs are provided. Also, a numerical method of the hypersingular integral equations for a rectangular crack subjected to <b>extended</b> loads is put forward with the <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities approximated by the product of basic density functions and polynomials. In addition, distributions of <b>extended</b> SIFs varying with the shape of the crack are presented. The results show that the present method accurately yields smooth variations of <b>extended</b> SIFs along the crack front...|$|R

First, {{based on the}} <b>extended</b> boundary element method, the 3 D interface crack problem is reduced to solving a set of E-HIDEs coupled with <b>extended</b> boundary integral equations, in which the unknown functions are the <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities. Then, {{the behavior of the}} <b>extended</b> singular stress indices around the interface crack front terminating at the interface is analyzed by the <b>extended</b> main-part analysis. The <b>extended</b> stress intensity factors near the crack front are defined. In addition, a numerical method for a 3 D interface crack problem subjected to <b>extended</b> loads is proposed, in which the <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities are approximated by the product of basic density functions and polynomials. Finally, the radiation distribution of <b>extended</b> stress intensity factors at the interface crack surface are calculated, and the results are presented toward demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method...|$|R
