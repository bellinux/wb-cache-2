[...] "Lost Boys and Golden Girls" [...] is [...] "Steinman's {{interpretation}} {{of the story of}} Peter Pan." [...] The composer says that Peter Pan has [...] "always been about my favorite story and I've always looked at it from the perspective that it's a great rock and roll myth because it's about—when you <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> to it—it's about a gang of lost boys who never grow up, {{who are going to be}} young forever and that's about as perfect an image for rock'n'roll as I can think of." ...|$|E

This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again at the cash register as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services. For tax junkies, the first is a flat tax. The second is a retail sales tax and the third a business transfer tax. [...] But they are all consumption taxes.|$|E
2500|$|Birt {{was made}} unpaid Strategy Adviser to Blair in 2001, {{appointed}} {{for what was}} termed [...] "Blue skies thinking" [...] and claimed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to be [...] "worth every penny"; Blair wanted advice from outside the traditional Whitehall mindset – he had known Birt since the 1980s and approved of his analytical approach. Jeremy Heywood, Blair’s principal private secretary, said: “He liked the way that John was willing to <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> into the data and understand the evidence, {{and come up with}} [...] a real sense that you could do things in a totally different way.” [...] Birt supervised the development of long-term strategy on drugs, health, crime reduction, education, transport and London.

5000|$|Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{gave the}} album a mixed review, writing [...] "At its best, WK’s {{music is a}} {{refreshing}} blast of skanky air on the current stale music scene, but at its worst, it’s disappointingly monotonous, unoriginal, and very, very dumb." [...] Evan Chakroff of Stylus Magazine called it a [...] "worthless piece of rock-product, 35 minutes of glossy, overproduced tripe", but concluded that [...] "once these songs have pounded their way into your head, you can’t help but pay attention" [...] and [...] "if this is a joke, it's a brilliant one." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork panned the album as being [...] "about as empty as rock music <b>gets,</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> to the tinny, digitally processed tonebank noise that passes for 'guitars.'" ...|$|R

5000|$|In JamBase, Dennis Cook wrote, [...] "7 Walkers... is {{the most}} organic, {{original}} music {{to come out of}} the core Grateful Dead alumni since the passing of Jerry Garcia. It's worth <b>getting</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> to brass tacks since 7 Walkers goes for the creative jugular in such a lusty, exuberant manner. With richly imaginative lyrics penned by Dead scribe Robert Hunter... Even on paper this quartet is lethal, but that's nothing compared to the roiling energy when they come together in the flesh. With their collective pedigree, there's an enormous pool of possibilities and their self-titled debut reflects all their swirling undercurrents and coalesces into fascinating new shapes, fresh colors forming on the surface of things as dark, interesting eddies move below. Put another way, there's something powerful and primal and beautiful going on in the music of 7 Walkers." ...|$|R

5000|$|I think {{science fiction}} does help, and it points in very {{interesting}} directions. It points in relativistic directions. It {{says that we}} have the imagination for these other opportunities, these other choices. We tend to tie ourselves down to limited choices. We say, [...] "Well, the only answer is ..." [...] or, [...] "If you would just ...". Whatever follows these two statements narrows the choices <b>right</b> there. It <b>gets</b> the vision <b>right</b> <b>down</b> close to the ground so that you don't see anything happening outside. Humans tend not to see over a long range. Now we are required, in these generations, to have a longer range view of what we inflict on the world around us. This is where, I think, science fiction is helping. I don't think that the mere writing of such a book as Brave New World or 1984 prevents those things which are portrayed in those books from happening. But I do think they alert us to that possibility and make that possibility less likely. They make us aware that we may be going in that direction. Frank Herbert ...|$|R
