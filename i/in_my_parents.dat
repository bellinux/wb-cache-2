6000|$|He {{had made}} but a short stay at school--not {{because he was}} tormented, for he thought it so fine to be at school at all that he held his tongue at home about the sufferings {{incurred}} through the medicine-bottle, but because his father thought he was learning bad manners. This he imparted to me in confidence at the time, and I remember how it increased my oppressive awe of Mr. Pickering, who had appeared to me in glimpses {{as a sort of}} high priest of the proprieties. Mr. Pickering was a widower--a fact which seemed to produce in him a sort of preternatural concentration of parental dignity. He was a majestic man, with a hooked nose, a keen dark eye, very large whiskers, and notions of his own as to how a boy--or his boy, at any rate--should be brought up. First and foremost, he was to be a [...] "gentleman"; which seemed to mean, chiefly, that he was always to wear a muffler and gloves, and be sent to bed, after a supper of bread and milk, at eight o'clock. School-life, on experiment, seemed hostile to these observances, and Eugene was taken home again, to be moulded into urbanity beneath the parental eye. A tutor was provided for him, and a single select companion was prescribed. The choice, mysteriously, fell on me, born as I was under quite another star; my parents were appealed to, and I was allowed for a few months to have my lessons with Eugene. The tutor, I think, must have been rather a snob, for Eugene was treated like a prince, while I got all the questions and the raps with the ruler. And yet I remember never being jealous of my happier comrade, and striking up, for the time, one of those friendships of childhood. He had a watch and a pony and a great store of picture-books, but my envy of these luxuries was tempered by a vague compassion which left me free to be generous. I could go out to play alone, I could button my jacket myself, and sit up till I was sleepy. Poor Pickering could never take a step without asking leave, or spend half an hour in the garden without a formal report of it when he came <b>in.</b> <b>My</b> <b>parents,</b> who had no desire to see me inoculated with importunate virtues, sent me back to school at the end of six months. After that I never saw Eugene. His father went to live in the country, to protect the lad's morals, and Eugene faded, in reminiscence, into a pale image of the depressing effects of education. I think I vaguely supposed that he would melt into thin air, and indeed began gradually to doubt of his existence, and to regard him as one of the foolish things one ceased to believe in as one grew older. It seemed natural that I should have no more news of him. Our present meeting was my first assurance that he had really survived all that muffling and coddling.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} half my life (I will be 44 this year) I had no {{reliable}} way to tell others what was in my mind. I live with complex autism and cannot speak with my voice. People assumed that my intelligence was very limited, so I was never taught reading or math at school. I was lucky <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> and twin sister, but away from home I felt excluded and isolated. In 1991 I was introduced to a way of communicating in which I am supported physically and emotionally to talk by typing. I {{have been able to}} use this other voice more regularly since 2000 and it has transformed my life. Feeling so good about myself, I was able {{to take the lead in}} forming a special support group with others who type to talk and want more control over their lives. We call ourselves Bridges-Over-Barriers. Why are Supported Typing (S-T) and Bridges-Over-Barriers important? What was it like, not being able to rely on our voices? How has S-T changed my life? What kinds of barriers need to be bridged? How could Bridges help more people? I can comment from my own experience of trying to communicate and being misunderstood until I found S-T when I was 23. Being able to express my thoughts and feelings helped me to survive some very hard years. Forming the Bridges communication group has given me great joy. I hope that people will want to use S-T when they hear I have done good things as a result of communicating my ideas. More than anything else, I want people to understand the importance of having a voice and being heard...|$|E
40|$|Displacement is the act {{by which}} fluid {{is forced to}} move by an object {{floating}} or submerged in it. During {{the course of a}} bath, the bather continuously affects the water he/she displaces, creating water distortions that visually contort and fragment the bather. Our human senses cannot fully digest all these nuances made from one simple splash. We are essentially blind to these beautiful milliseconds save {{through the use of a}} camera. In studying my photographic references, I have been able to discern different types of water formations. The complexity of rendering water is its own struggle. More than a few paintings have failed; the water distortion, no matter how exact it is photographically, is still a huge challenge to translate believably into paint. I predominately use two mediums: oil paint and pastel. The ephemeral nature of a splash translates well in pastel, with its thin layers of dusty pigment sitting precariously on the paper 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The properties of oil paint are also incredibly well suited for the subject matter. Its viscous properties are ideal for rendering flesh, and the use of wet media to portray wetness has its own metaphoric appeal. Displacement 2 ̆ 7 s general meaning is the movement of something from its usual or correct place. My work involves placing private intimate scenes in a public setting. I give the viewer permission to publicly take a voyeuristic look into my private life. While the private act of bathing is displaced to a public setting, the visual language that describes this act can be displaced to describe alternative concepts beyond water and flesh. The markings I make that signal water often take on other I associations. Water distortions can become more than water over a surface; they can merge with the bather 2 ̆ 7 s flesh to create deformities. Distorted thumbs can become phallic. Water streaks along the body can become scars and markings. In works that rely on grids and multiples, images from separate scenes are placed together, leading to different readings as a whole than each individual piece would warrant alone. In psychoanalysis, displacement is the transfer of emotion from the original focus to another less threatening object or person. My work is influenced by my unique experience concerning gender and marriage roles. Recently, some emotionally charged family events called into question stereotypes and cliches commonly associated with these roles. In a marriage, can a spouse take ownership of the other 2 ̆ 7 s sexuality? Do the stereotypical ideas of masculinity/active force and femininity/passive entity apply to marriage today as they did <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> 2 ̆ 7 generation? I acknowledge there are no definite answers to these questions, neither generically nor personally. As this definition of displacement implies, my artwork can serve as the less threatening object onto which I can transfer my emotions. Within my work, I can control my image and that of my husband. I can put my husband in submissive poses, using his image to question the dominating-male stereotype. I can put myself in submissive and objectifying poses, observing my own propensity for submission. I can publicly display my body 2 ̆ 7 s image and be vulnerable to public criticism or praise, while in a small way taking ownership of my sexuality. I can also obscure sexuality through the use of cropping images, letting flesh and body parts become more androgynous. Each definition of displacement manifests itself through the process, working method, subject and psychology of my work. I focus on one experience: the intimate, every-day experience of bathing. While my paintings and drawings are about the act itself, I also use the bather/water relationship to reference conditions of my personal life transcending the bathing process. After three years, I am still very much engaged, challenged and intrigued by water and flesh. I would have never guessed coming into this program, that I would find such rich and diverse subject matter within the small confines of my humble bathroom...|$|E
