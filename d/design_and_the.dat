5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Anniversary {{was generally}} positive. The updated graphics, sounds, {{and ability to}} toggle between the remastered and original visuals were praised. Complaints included technical glitches, faults with the original game's level <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> multiplayer mode's implementation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train. This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E

Blunt received further nominations at the British Independent Film Awards, Broadcast Film Critics' Association Awards, {{and at the}} Empire Awards, among others. The film also received three Academy Awards nominations in 2010 for Best Art Direction (which it lost to Avatar), Makeup (which it lost to Star Trek) and won for Costume Design. At the 63rd British Academy Film Awards, The Young Victoria won the BAFTA Award for Best Costume <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair.|$|E
5|$|If a Severn Barrage {{were ever}} to be {{constructed}} it could have consequences for Flat Holm, depending on the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> route.

5|$|In {{addition}} to those previously mentioned, the film also featured Dan Haggerty, who starred in the television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams.

5|$|Initial {{testing of}} the {{prototype}} QF 25-pounder Short was completed in early December 1942. The 2/1st Field Regiment also trialled the gun in New Guinea during early 1943. Large-scale production began in early 1943, after minor modifications {{were made to the}} <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Army placed an initial order for 112 guns. A second order was later placed for 100 more. This lot incorporated the Mark II carriage, which had larger wheels and tyres to prevent the problem with wheel bounce encountered by the first lot. Altogether, 213 guns were manufactured by the time production ceased in 1944. As completed, the gun's full designation was Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short (Aust) Mark I, but it was nicknamed the 'snort' by Australian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. Most praise {{was directed at}} its combat, open-world <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nemesis System. Some criticism was aimed at the game's story and boss battles. Shadow of Mordor marked the biggest launch for a game based upon Tolkien's universe, and {{would go on to}} win several awards from video gaming publications, including Game of the Year in 2015. The game was supported by downloadable content upon release. A sequel, , was released in October 2017.|$|E

5|$|Streisand {{employed}} Jackson's mixing talents on her 1995 TV special called Barbra: The Concert. Along with Ed Greene and Bob La Masney {{who worked}} on post-production mixing, he received an Emmy Award for sound <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mixing of the live show. Jackson designed the sound for Streisand's 1999â€“2000 , and he mixed the New Year's Eve concert 31 December 1999 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada. He mixed Streisand's appearances in Sydney and Melbourne in March 2000, connecting the large backing choir's sound mix by optical fibre from a nearby polo field where the choir was stationed. The fibre connection was Jackson's real-world test of a similar setup planned {{to be used for}} the Summer Olympics six months later.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us {{garnered}} {{awards and}} nominations {{in a variety}} of categories with particular praise for its story, sound and music, graphical and artistic <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> acting of its cast.

At the 10th British Academy Video Games Awards, the game received ten nominations and went on to win five awards: Best Game, Action & Adventure, Audio Achievement, Performer and Story. The game earned thirteen nominations at the 17th Annual DICE Awards, winning ten, including Game of the Year. At IGN's Best of 2013, the game garnered thirteen nominations and went on to win ten awards, including Game of the Year, Best Overall Action-Adventure Game and Best Overall Sound.|$|E
5|$|The account went viral in 2011 {{and led to}} the reinvigoration of Molyneux's legacy. To many, the two became entwined. Molyneux's {{reputation}} as a dreamer was reclaimed as a positive trait in light of growing opposition to conservative game <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> parody account became a mouthpiece for that population. The tweets contributed to Molyneux's decision to leave Microsoft Game Studios and pursue riskier game ideas. They also inspired a game jam, in which about 1,000 game developers worldwide created about 300 games based on the tweets {{over the course of a}} weekend. The game jam also brought Molyneux fame within a burgeoning indie game movement. Notable games based on the parody account's ideas include Donut County.|$|E

5|$|The {{design was}} rather {{different}} to von Haschenperg's first castle. The keep and the stirrup towers {{were raised in}} height, {{the level of the}} floors elevated, the curtain wall was strengthened, the old bastions entirely removed and four new, larger bastions added in their place, while the older foreworks around the castle were demolished. The keep's flat roof was altered to a pitched <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guns that it had supported moved into the outlying bastions. Although the size of the castle had slightly decreased, the new design had much more domestic space available for the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The film {{attracted}} {{attention for}} {{the appearance of}} Orson Welles as Will Varner, the patriarch of the family. 20th Century Fox wanted to avoid the casting of Welles due to his temperament, but the studio was persuaded by Ritt, who considered him the right actor for the role. The director and the actor had several marked differences during the shooting of the movie, which included problems with {{the interpretation of the}} lines, costume <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> position of Welles while shooting the scenes. At one point during the production, Welles informed Ritt {{that he did not want}} to memorize his lines, requesting instead that they be dubbed afterwards. Part of the cast was intimidated by Welles' temperamental attitude.|$|E
5|$|The game world's <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> game's {{attention}} to detail were well received by critics. Game Informers Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and {{was a place of}} wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it the right mix of creepy and cool, and appreciated the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that pixelated CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the world itself was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of poison gas and electric floors as obstacles.|$|E

5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} {{generally}} poorly received {{at the time}} for being overblown and pretentious.

Starting in the late 2000s, the tour began to collect accolades for its successes, and in 2010 the tour was named one of the top concert tour designs of all time.|$|E
