The law 19 Frimaire An VIII (10 December 1799) defined the metre in terms of this value and the kilogramme as being 18827.15 grains. These definitions enabled reference copies of the kilograms and metres to be constructed and these were used as the standards for the next 90 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of oscillation about the <b>final</b> <b>value</b> is called ringing. The overshoot is the maximum swing above <b>final</b> <b>value,</b> and clearly increases with μ. Likewise, the undershoot is the minimum swing below <b>final</b> <b>value,</b> again increasing with μ. The settling {{time is the}} time for departures from <b>final</b> <b>value</b> to sink below some specified level, say 10% of <b>final</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{a multiple}} of τ is called the settling time, i.e. the time necessary to ensure the signal is within a fixed departure from <b>final</b> <b>value,</b> typically within 10%. The term overshoot refers to the extent the maximum response exceeds <b>final</b> <b>value,</b> and undershoot refers to the extent the response falls below <b>final</b> <b>value</b> for times following the maximum response.|$|E

Preliminary values cannot be viewed as <b>final</b> <b>values</b> plus an error (revision) uncorrelated with these, but they are approximately unbiased forecasts of <b>final</b> <b>values.</b> The second difference in short-term interest rates is a leading indicator of revisions in M 1 growth rates and revisions exhibit significant seasonality; hence preliminary values are not completely rational forecasts. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} quality factor (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit step input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the <b>final</b> <b>value)</b> possible without overshoot. Real system specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against overshoot.|$|E

Fixed-price listings have an insertion fee of $0.30, and the <b>final</b> <b>value</b> fee varies based on category and total amount of the sale (e.g., 13% for DVDs & Movies up to $50). The UK-based ebay.co.uk takes from £0.15 to a maximum rate of £3 per £100 for an ordinary listing and up to 10% of the final price.

The thesis focuses on general annuities with payments varying in arithmetic and geometric progressions which are important varying annuities.

In the beginning (chapter 2) the formulae of the <b>final</b> <b>values</b> of the annuities under xed rates of interest are shown. Chapter 3 {{is the main}} part of the thesis. The mean and variance formulae of the <b>final</b> <b>values</b> of the annuities under random rates of interest are proofed here. The thesis is based on the article [4] and [1].
