5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Sciences</b> at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, RTI's {{staff of}} 430 was reorganized into four {{research}} groups: {{social and economic}} systems, statistical sciences, <b>environmental</b> <b>sciences</b> and engineering, and chemistry and life sciences. It also created a division for education called the Center for Education Research and Evaluation. Four years later, RTI created the Office for International Programs to manage international projects. RTI provided funding assistance to help found the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in 1980, {{and two years later}} was part of a joint venture to create Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC), a non-profit whose computer network connected local K-12 schools. A Health Solutions division formed in 2000 serves the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. In 2015, it formed a subsidiary in New Delhi, India. Among other projects, it was funded to develop a waterless toilet for use in third-world countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{smoke and}} {{airborne}} particulates from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local communities on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Sciences</b> and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.|$|E
5|$|After the Man and His World summer {{exhibitions}} were discontinued, {{with most}} pavilions and remnants demolished between 1985 and 1987, the former site for Expo 67 on Saint Helen's Island and Notre Dame Island {{was incorporated into}} a municipal park run {{by the city of}} Montreal. In 2000, the park was renamed from Parc des Îles to Parc Jean-Drapeau, after Mayor Jean Drapeau, who had brought the exhibition to Montreal. In 2006, the corporation that runs the park also changed its name from the Société du parc des Îles to the Société du parc Jean-Drapeau. Today very little remains of Expo but two prominent buildings remain in use on the former Expo grounds: the American pavilion's metal-lattice skeleton from its Buckminster Fuller dome, now enclosing an <b>environmental</b> <b>sciences</b> museum called the Montreal Biosphere; and Habitat 67, now a condominium residence. Also, the France and Quebec pavilions now form the Montreal Casino. La Toundra Hall is part of the surviving structural remains of the Canadian pavilion. It is now a special events and banquet hall, while another part of the pavilion serves as the administration building of Parc Jean-Drapeau (Katimavik's distinctive inverted pyramid and {{much of the rest of}} the Canadian pavilion were dismantled during the 1970s).|$|E
