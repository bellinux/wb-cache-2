Remarkably, for the pair (g, (g^sigma) ^v) =(so_{ 2 n+ 2 },sp_{ 2 n}), the algebra U_q(n) admits an action of the Artin braid group Br_n and contains a new algebra of quantum n x n matrices with an adjoint action of U_q(sl_n), which generalizes the algebras constructed by K.

The results show {{the presence of a}} sharp front (interface separating the wetting and non-wetting fluids) across the cell during the test, which <b>expectably</b> moves up and down as the controlling non-wetting fluid pressure at the upper boundary varies to simulate different P-c levels over the drainage and imbibition cycle. This phenomenon, representing inhomogeneity at the simulated scale, is in conflict with the homogenization applied to the pressure cell for deriving the constitutive P-c - S relationship. Different boundary conditions, adopted to achieve more homogeneous states in the virtual soil, resulted in different P-c - S curves. No unique relationship between P-c and S, even with the interfacial area (A(nw)) included, could be found. This study shows dependence of the LBM-predicted P-c - S relation on the chosen boundary conditions.

40|$|Three {{types of}} trade policy {{adjustments}} {{to deal with}} an unsustainable current account deficit are examined in this paper for their economywide income and equity effects, {{based on the results of}} simulation experiments using a CGE model of the Philippine economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) <b>expectably</b> decreases with import rationing and less markedly, with the imposition of a general import surtax; by contrast, adjustment through the reduction of tariffs leads to a larger GDP. The latter result, however, is counterbalanced by a substantial loss in government income. With respect to the distribution of income gains (and losses), the additional market distortions and rent-seeking that accompany the implementation of import rationing heavily discriminate in favor of Metro Manila households, whose average income is the highest among the five household groups distinguished in the model. Moving to a general import surtax represents an improvement in that non-Metro Manila households are penalized less. However, these first two policy options are deemed inferior to tariff liberalization which yields larger income benefits to small-farm and "other rural" households relative to the more affluent Metro Manila, other urban, and large-farm households.

These results basically indicate that a preliminary isoseismal map for rapid reporting could be produced by the procedures implemented in this study. However, a large misfit, having an obvious systematic deviation of ground motion, can be shown in the predictions for some of the events. The possible reason causing such a type of residual pattern might be attributed to the stress drop of a seismic source which could be very different from the value of 30 bar used in this model. It appears to be difficult to determine the stress drop in a short time for simulating a better prediction of ground motion for the purpose of the rapid publication of the assessment of ground shaking hazards.|$|E

The objective of this work is to describe quantitative correlation between the crystalline structure and the elastic modulus in order to predict structures with <b>expectably</b> advantageous properties. The molecular mass was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and the regularity of molecular structure was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and stepwise isothermal segregation technique (SIST). The chain regularity of the studied samples is varying in a wide range according to the results of SIST and FTIR measurements. The crystalline structure was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The tensile properties were determined by standardized tensile tests. The results indicate clearly that the increased chain regularity is accompanied by a proportional advancement in crystallinity and consequently proportionally larger stiffness. Moreover, the results of this work were compared to those obtained on other previously produced iPP samples and it can be established that the correlations found during this work are valid generally. An empirical model was developed also, which connects the stiffness to the structural parameters of iPP and makes possible the design and prediction of materials with targeted molecular structure and properties...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen a mantle plume {{rises and}} impinges {{on the base}} of the lithosphere, it <b>expectably</b> {{produces}} variations in surface topography. Recent numerical experiments based on tectonically realistic formulations for the lithosphere and a representative mantle rheology, have shown that plume-induced undulations exhibit temporal successions of uplift and subsidence at various wavelengths. From spectral (Fourier) analyses of the undulations would appear that two groups of wavelengths (200 - 400 km and 60 - 100 km) predominate. Interestingly, a spectral analysis of Europe's topography also reveals two dominant groups. In the present study, we have used a spectral analysis with a wavelet formulation in order to discriminate between tectonically-induced undulations (uni-directional deformation) and plume-induced undulations (omni-directional deformation). The European lithosphere is well-suited for this approach since {{it has been suggested that}} two mantle plumes (the Massif Central and the Eifel area) underlie Western Europe, where Alpine compression has folded the lithosphere over several hundreds of kilometres. The wavelet analysis of Europe's surface topography confirms that the energy distribution of the topographic undulations outside the two main volcanic provinces is homogeneous, thus contrasting with the coexistence of both largescale and medium-scale high-energy features that are obtained for the Massif Central and Eifel areas...|$|E

In a first step, MSW composition data was collected to evaluate the waste combustion enthalpy by a weighted average of each fraction, using the corresponding Low Heat Value (LHV). Results indicate that each kilogram of Maltese MSW releases circa 8, 726 kJ of energy when combusted. Data from 1997 to 2009 allowed the conclusion that an incinerator with a capacity of 32. 5 tonnes per hour can treat the waste <b>expectably</b> generated in Malta during the plant life span.

40|$|During general {{anesthesia}} {{it is important}} to get information about patient’s depth of anaesthesia at any time. The depth of anesthesia should not be too low or too deep to avoid intraoperative awareness and hemodynamic complications. Anaesthetic depth monitoring is able to measure the electrical brain activity and can give references about the current depth of anaesthesia. The target organ of {{general anesthesia}} is the brain, therefore monitoring is important in addition to the clinical standard parameters. A fundamental requirement of the monitors is their reliable function independent of engaged drugs. The work underlying this study examined the effect of xenon and sevoflurane on two different anaesthetic depth monitors and its usability as an additional monitoring parameter during general anaesthesia. One of the used monitors controlled the brain function by discharging raw-EEG-signals, which are processed by a computer and presented as figure (BIS-Value) and graphic. The other monitor worked with auditory evoked potentials, which were also displayed as an index number (A-line autoregressive index - AAI). Collectively 93 patients were randomized in one of the study groups (xenon n = 45, sevoflurane n = 48). In the comparative groups two patients abandoned the commitment of the study preoperative. Due to technical defaults one dataset of the xenon group could not be used. The patients underwent elective operations in the departments of urology, gynecology or general surgery. During anaesthesia data of the clinical parameters and the values of the anesthesia depth monitoring, BIS and AAI, were collected every five minutes. At certain times (induction, intubation, surgical incision, suture) the data were collected every minute. After anaesthesia, the patients were monitored in the post anaesthetic care unit (PACU) and the status of sedation was documented based on the Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAA/S). Using the Brice Interview, the patients were asked about intraoperative awareness in form of recalls. This survey was conducted twice during certain time periods after discharge from the recovery room. The patients of the reference group do not differ significantly in terms of age, sex and height. Regarding to weight and BMI (body mass index) there are significant differences, which are unusual for a randomized trial. In all patients, no intraoperative awareness could be observed. For a study with the present patient base and the operative interventions in the mentioned medical deparments this Oberservation was <b>expectably.</b> In the sevoflurane group the BIS- and AAI-indices correlates <b>expectably</b> well with clinical parameters and the status of sedation. The results reached the producers recommended range for adequate anesthesia. In the xenon-group the bispectral index is also a suitable parameter to assess the depth of anesthesia beside the clinical parameters. After one hour the AAI exceeded the recommended upper limit without a change in clinical parameters by use of xenon. So far there is no explainable reason for this observation. Further studies are needed to determine whether the auditory signal processing may be altered during prolonged xenon anesthesia. Therefore the AAI is not recommended to monitor the depth of anesthesia during xenon anesthesia...|$|E

30|$|Two trans-polyacetylene [t-PA] bands were {{observed}} in the spectra at approximately 1, 140 and 1, 480 cm- 1 while the films were grown at above 60 Torr, which represented the NCD structures that existed at the GBs in the films [15, 19, 20]. Interestingly, the spectra were found to show a peak centered at approximately 1, 190 cm- 1 as the synthesis was at a pressure from 15 to 80 Torr. The decrease in this peak with increasing pressure is opposite to the t-PA bands in the spectra. This phenomenon likely originated from {{the difference in the}} crystal size between UNCD and NCD films. Moreover, the concurrent absence or weakening of the peaks located at 1, 190 and 1, 140 cm- 1 (t-PA) for the sample grown at 100 Torr suggested that the content of C-H bonds (t-PA) in the films would be decreased with increasing pressure (5 to 100 Torr) and temperature (400 °C to 700 °C). A decrease in the relative GB fraction for t-PA bands existed, and the increase in the substrate temperature was to promote hydrogen desorption from the films [10, 18]. The decrease of hydrogen trapping during synthesis is <b>expectably</b> caused by high-temperature growth (high-pressure) due to the hydrogen desorption temperature which is between 600 °C and 1, 000 °C [21]. The above features of visible Raman spectra {{are similar to those of}} the UNCD films deposited by microwave Ar- 1 %CH 4 plasma at various substrate heating [10], but the bonding structure and quality of the films are controlled by pressure via the MEG process, suggesting that the MEG process could improve the synthesis of the UNCD films at LPLT without substrate heating.|$|E

Means and standard deviations regarding the anthropometric measurements were obtained. A comparison of means of body heights and arm spans within this gender group were carried out using a t-test. The relationships between body height and arm span were determined using simple correlation coefficients and their 95 % confidence interval. Then a linear regression analysis was performed to examine the extent to which the arm span can reliably predict body height.

In only 8 out of 81 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock {{during the entire}} study period, or in 67 patients who entered the final statistical analysis, the algorithm was fully applied. However, in patients with a low PCT (<[*] 0.5  ng/mL) or a marked decrease of PCT levels (≤[*] 10 % of peak level), a shorter antibiotic treatment {{was not associated with}} worse clinical outcomes. Thus, our study confirms the results of a recent large study [1] and several reviews and meta-analyses [2 – 6]. Procalcitonin is able to support clinical decision-making to discontinue antibiotics when PCT decrease goes along with clinical improvement. However, in our study, antibiotics were continued in nearly 70 % of patients although antibiotic discontinuation was recommended by the PCT protocol. Algorithm overruling was also of concern in prospective trials where overruling rates reached from 16 to 53 % [17 – 19]. <b>Expectably,</b> overruling rates were higher in real life since the PCT protocol was not applied under controlled study conditions and populations are not comparable due to strict in- and exclusion criteria in randomised trials. Exclusion rates in randomised PCT studies range from 0.3 % [20] to 84 % [21], thus not necessarily reflecting clinical real life. For example, patients with common ICU infections, e.g. caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, which were excluded in several studies [17 – 19] were not excluded in our study. Furthermore, probably we cannot exclude that inappropriate septic source control contributed to low adherence to antibiotic stopping advices in our study, and we did not analyse the impact of multi drug resistant pathogens on antibiotic treatment duration.|$|E
40|$|Anthropologists {{recognized}} the tallness of {{nations in the}} Dinaric Alps long time ago (Popovic et al, 2013). As the modern Montenegrins fall partly into the Dinaric racial classification (Bjelica et al., 2012), {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine the body height in Montenegrin female adolescents from central region as well as the relationship between arm span as an alternative to estimating the body height, which would vary from region to region in Montenegro. Method: Our investigation analyses 593 female adolescents from the central region in Montenegro. The anthropometric measurements were taken according to the protocol of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK). Means and standard deviations regarding the anthropometric measurements were obtained. A comparison of means of body heights and arm spans within this gender group were carried out using a t-test. The relationships between body height and arm span were determined using simple correlation coefficients and their 95 % confidence interval. Then a linear regression analysis was performed to examine the extent to which the arm span can reliably predict body height. Results: The results displayed that female Central-Montenegrins are 169. 24 ± 11. 61 cm tall and have an arm span of 168. 03 ± 10. 34 cm. Discussion: Compared to other studies, the results of this study have shown that this gender made Central-Macedonians the tall population, taller than general female population in Montenegro (Bjelica et al., 2012). On the other hand, <b>expectably,</b> the arm span reliably predicts body height in this gender. However, the estimation equations which have been obtained in Central-Montenegrins are, different alike in general population, since arm span was shorter than the body heights (1. 21 ± 1. 27 centimetres), much more than in general population (Bjelica et al., 2012). This confirms the necessity for developing separate height models for each region in Montenegro...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure and}} propagation characteristics of African easterly waves for the 1986 – 94 period are studied with June–August European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) oper-ational analyses, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses, and Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis GCM output. Specific consideration {{is given to}} the differences in the time-mean circulation, synoptic-scale variance, covariance, and principal oscillation patterns. The African easterly waves derived from the ECMWF and NCEP analyses are very similar, with both providing a reasonably realistic depiction of African easterly waves—given the agreement with one another, earlier station data studies, and theory. Where significant differences exist between the results from the two data assimilation systems they <b>expectably</b> do so over the tropical Atlantic, and in fields that are not directly observed (such as vertical velocity). The situation with the GCM is not as favorable but there are some encouraging areas of agreement—despite the GCM’s relatively coarse resolution and absence of observed data to constrain it. Selected points of agreement and disagreement between the GCM and the analyses include the following. (i) The GCM African easterly wave energetics are comparable with the analyses in terms of the sign and magnitude of the energy transfers from the time-mean state to the waves. (ii) The northern track of easterly waves seen in the analyses terminates prematurely in the GCM at the African coast. (iii) The southerly track of moist easterly waves seen in the analyses near the seasonal rainband is absent in the GCM. Possible reasons for the deficiencies are discussed. The sensitivity of the GCM-simulated African easterly waves to CO 2 doubling is investigated. Together with significant mean warming and moistening over the northern Sahara, the level of simulated African easterly wave activity increases with CO 2 doubling. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{management}} {{of patients with}} severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) is a clinical challenge because the indication for valve replacement is dependent on symptoms, and therefore the decision for a valve operation is reliant on subjective factors. An approach to improve the efficacy of a surgical procedure is to evaluate {{the status of the}} ventricle in addition to analyzing the severity of the valvular disease. We propose to further investigate the independent predictive value of variables measured during stress echocardiography, as well as the cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. Methods and results: For this purpose we put 48 patients with asymptomatic AS under a double stress protocol, including dobutamine stress echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing and followed the patients over a mean of 756 days (range: 100 - 2146 days) to identify a combined endpoint of death or aortic valve replacement. Initially, univariate analysis identified following parameters predicting the combined endpoint: chronic obstructive lung disease, female sex, stroke work loss (SWL), ejection fraction during dobutamine infusion (EFdb), maximum exercise workload (peak watts). Subsequent multivariable analysis showed that SWL, EFdb and peak watts were independent predictors of the combined endpoint. In another study, we attempted to show which variables predicted an improvement in functional status from valve replacement, since symptomatic improvement was theoretically not an expected outcome in patients who were reportedly asymptomatic per-operatively. For this purpose, we compared parameters before and after valve replacement in 20 patients with asymptomatic AS and compared them with 18 symptomatic patients with similar severity of AS. Initially, we determined that asymptomatic patients <b>expectably</b> showed no significant improvement of their subjective exercise tolerance, though there was a trend toward improved VO 2 peak (p= 0. 07). The postoperative values showed a significant improvement over the symptomatic patients. In summary, our studies enabled us to characterize myocardial pump reserve and the cardiocirculatory exercise tolerance, which provided a more complete clinical characterization of this patient group that just severity of valve disease...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the protocol of tests {{for evaluating the}} performance of skeletal, reduced and highly-reduced chemical kinetics mechanisms for one-dimensional (1 D) laminar flame simulations and the validity of these tests for turbulent flame applications. Taking n-heptane as an example fuel, it is first shown that there are apparent disagreements regarding the elementary-reaction chemical kinetics models which should be emulated by reduced kinetic mechanisms. Further it is also shown, <b>expectably,</b> that the functional relationship between mass fractions and temperature is different between 0 D and 1 D models, and it is different among 1 D models having different molecular species-transport formulations. Having identified the retention of this functional relationship as pivotal {{in the success of}} highly-reduced reaction mechanisms to accurately simulate spatial configurations, it is demonstrated that the unity Lewis-number assumption biases this functional relationship such that the highly-reduced chemical kinetic mechanism LS 2 T 20 -species mechanism (LS 2 T 20) used for 1 D flame simulations fails to agree with the template but provides accurate predictions in conjunction with, for example, the mixture-average diffusion model at otherwise the same initial conditions as the unity-Lewis-number simulation. The LS 2 T 20 success extends to the cold-ignition regime. For rich conditions the mixture-average diffusion approximation is less acceptable, and if the transport model does not include the direct effect of the heavy species (which are all modeled in LS 2 T) on the light species (which are all computed in LS 2 T), moderate departures of the 1 D predictions from the template are obtained around the peak OH mass fraction, whereas CO_ 2 is still excellently reproduced by LS 2 T 20. It is then conjectured that, independent of the reduction method, the more reduced is a kinetic mechanism, the more accurate the transport formulation should be to ensure the preservation of the species/temperature functional relationship; due to the extensive investigation necessary to evaluate this conjecture, this activity is relegated to future studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Inter-specific {{hybridization}} occurs {{frequently in}} plants, which may induce genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids, allopolyploids and introgressants. It remains unclear however whether pollination by alien pollens of an incompatible species may impose a "biological stress" {{even in the}} absence of genome-merger or genetic introgression, whereby genetic and/or epigenetic instability of the maternal recipient genome might be provoked. Results We report here the identification of a rice mutator-phenotype from a set of rice plants derived from a crossing experiment involving two remote and apparently incompatible species, Oryza sativa L. and Oenothera biennis L. The mutator-phenotype (named Tong 211 -LP) showed distinct alteration in several traits, with the most striking being substantially enlarged panicles. <b>Expectably,</b> gel-blotting by total genomic DNA of the pollen-donor showed no evidence for introgression. Characterization of Tong 211 -LP (S 0) and its selfed progenies (S 1) ruled out contamination (via seed or pollen) or polyploidy as a cause for its dramatic phenotypic changes, but revealed transgenerational mobilization of several previously characterized transposable elements (TEs), including a MITE (mPing), and three LTR retrotransposons (Osr 7, Osr 23 and Tos 17). AFLP and MSAP fingerprinting revealed extensive, transgenerational alterations in cytosine methylation and to a less extent also genetic variation in Tong 211 -LP and its immediate progenies. mPing mobility was found to correlate with cytosine methylation alteration detected by MSAP but not with genetic variation detected by AFLP. Assay by q-RT-PCR of the steady-state transcript abundance of a set of genes encoding for the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5 -methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, and small interference RNA (siRNA) pathway-related proteins showed that, relative to the rice parental line, heritable perturbation in expression of 12 out of the 13 genes occurred in the mutator-phenotype and its sefled progenies. Conclusion Transgenerational epigenetic instability in the form of altered cytosine methylation and its associated TE activity occurred in a rice mutator-phenotype produced by pollinating the rice stigma with pollens of O. biennis. Heritably perturbed homeostatic expression-state of genes involved in maintenance of chromatin structure is likely an underlying cause for the alien pollination-induced transgenerational epigenetic/genetic instability, and which occurred apparently without entailing genome merger or genetic introgression. </p...|$|E
40|$|An ‘exponential {{growth of}} science’ {{throughout}} modern {{history has been}} frequently boasted by numerous narcissistic accounts of ‘modern humanity. ’ Nonetheless, ‘modern science’ seems to have overwhelmingly compromised on its original promises by fitting into an ‘industrial scheme. ’ With this concern, ‘molecular phylogeographics with conservational ambitions’ would look an intact ground for research efforts in a ‘school of biotechnology. ’ The dog (Canis familiaris) as an earliest domestic animal {{has a history of}} conflicts over its origins and dispersal. Having those disputes addressed, valuable knowledge could be acquired on the nature and dynamics of domestication, and of human societies particularly of pre-agricultural ages. We employed two most widely-used genealogical markers, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the non-recombining portion of the Y-chromosome (NRY), to address dog demography. Through 582 bps of mtDNA Control Region, complemented with whole mitochondrial genomes, it was established that almost all maternal lineages of the domestic dog worldwide coalesce to a population of at least 51 and perhaps many more female wolves in Asia South of Yangtze River (ASY) approximately 16, 000 years before present (BP). This was based on the presence of a maximal diversity in this area, a descending gradient of diversity outward it, and a ubiquitous population structure everywhere in the world. A closer examination of this portrait in Southwest Asia (SwAsia) and the Fertile Crescent (FC), a region which has supplied persuasive evidence on early presence of the domestic dog, retrieved the same information, with implications for backbreeding with the local wolf population. Meanwhile, analyses of mtDNA dispersal showed that dogs took the long way via land to Madagascar Island, and not together with humans via sea. By the other approach, the NRY data in 14, 437 bps length supplemented the mtDNA in reporting the height of diversity from ASY with a founding population of at least 13 male wolves, but <b>expectably</b> produced lower inter-regional differentiation by diversity. Screening of NRY by a SNP assay in the dingoes of Australia Island as a population of feral dogs revealed restricted and similar dispersal patterns for sires and dams. Prospects of ancient, multilocus and whole genome assays with the emerging high-throughput technologies has still more to promise on finer elaborations of these issues. " QC 20120529 </p...|$|E
