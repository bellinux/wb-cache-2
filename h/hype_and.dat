5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E
5|$|With all the <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> media {{attention}} directed at this stunt, the following episode of The Chaser's War on Everything on 12 September 2007, initially {{intended to be}} called The Chaser's War on APEC, was the program's highest-rating ever. In Australia there was a total of 2.981million viewers: 2.245million viewers in the capital cities, and 736,000 regional viewers. This stunning success made it the most watched ABC1 television program since 2000, and broke the show's own record of 1.491million viewers in capital cities, set by the preceding episode.|$|E

25|$|Jeff Reinebold {{was hired}} to replace Murphy as the team coach, and despite {{a huge amount of}} <b>hype,</b> <b>and</b> {{championship}} promises going into the 1997 season, he proved {{to be one of the}} least successful head coaches in team history. The Bombers won four games in 1997, and just three in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Falcons quarterback Michael Vick {{entered the}} game with {{considerable}} pregame <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> an 8-game unbeaten streak. Vick, however, was sacked twice by Tampa Bay, and held to only 125 yards passing and a measly 15 yards rushing. Meanwhile, Brad Johnson connected on four touchdowns (two apiece to Jurevicius and McCardell) as the Buccaneers won 34–10.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent media {{coverage}} of exchanges between Cramer (who had been featured heavily in the original segment) and Stewart led to a highly anticipated face-to-face confrontation on Stewart's show. The episode received {{a large amount of}} media <b>hype,</b> <b>and</b> it became the second most-viewed episode of The Daily Show, trailing only the 2009 Inauguration Day episode. It had 2.3 million total viewers, and the next day The Daily Show website saw its highest day of traffic year-to-date.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, Moin wrote Kahin Pyar Na Ho Jaye. The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Javed Sheikh and the cast included Resham, Shaan and Saleem Sheikh.

25|$|In {{the second}} series of DSDS 2003–2004, co-hosts Hunziker and Spengemann and all four jury members reprised their engagements in the show. Following {{the success of}} the first installment, the second season was aired to a higher profile during 2003 fall schedule, {{including}} an increased number of episodes, budgets and charges for commercial spots. In contrast to the first season, however, the second soon found its main audience but never reached the overwhelming <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> demand which the first season had captured. This fact was underscored by decreasing phone votes and ratings, which were released after the show's final.|$|E
25|$|Flutie {{entered the}} USFL with much <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> fanfare. However, many {{began to wonder}} if the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, as his first two {{professional}} passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, for a total of 174 yards, while running for 51 yards.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Longhorns {{introduced}} blue-chip {{recruit and}} future NBA superstar Kevin Durant to Austin. A recruiting class which included in-state talents such as Damion James and D. J. Augustin helped garner unforeseen levels of <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> scrutiny for the Texas basketball program. Durant's spectacular lone season at Texas resulted in his receiving unanimous National Player of the Year honors. The Longhorns, however, saw their season {{end at the}} hands of the USC Trojans in the second round of the 2007 NCAA Tournament. Durant became the No. 2 overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the former Seattle SuperSonics, and was the 2014 NBA Most Valuable Player with the Oklahoma City Thunder.|$|E

Ancestor was released on April 1, 2007 to much internet <b>hype</b> <b>and,</b> despite having been released two weeks earlier as a free ebook, reached #7 on Amazon.com's best-seller list and #1 on Sci-Fi, Horror and Genre-Fiction {{on the day of}} release. Sigler is leveraging new media to keep in-touch with his fans, regularly talking with them using social networking sites, via email, and IM.

25|$|The code's recent {{growth in}} {{popularity}} in Sydney (where {{the majority of}} the state's population lives) has been partly tied {{to the success of the}} Sydney Swans which relocated from Melbourne in 1982. Since 1996, when it first made the Grand Final, the club has generated media <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> public interest as well as greater participation for the sport. Due to successive finals appearances the interest has been sustained over many seasons, most notably in 2005 and 2006 with two successive Grand Final appearances and the club's first premiership since its relocation. Another Swans premiership win in 2012 and the introduction of a second AFL team in Sydney, the Greater Western Sydney Giants, has increased the momentum behind Australian football in Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Lyon {{suffered}} {{their third}} {{defeat of the}} season the following week against relegation strugglers Nantes. Lyon came into the match apparently looking ahead to their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich and proceeded to underestimate the West Coast side, who defeated Lyon 1–2 with two goals from the Croat Ivan Klasnić. The loss was promptly followed by a showdown for first place with rivals Marseille the following week. Other than battling for first place, the return of Hatem Ben Arfa to the Stade Gerland was {{on the minds of}} supporters, as well as the players. However, despite the <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> build-up leading up to the match, including achieving a record television audience, both clubs failed to score a goal as the match ended in another 0–0 draw. Lyon finally ended their winless run with a 1–0 victory over Caen with Benzema scoring Lyon's lone goal, his tenth of the league campaign. With the victory, Lyon were assured first place heading into the three-week winter break.|$|E

25|$|Glacier was {{originally}} intended to debut in July, but due to the coinciding appearance and immediate impact of the New World Order at the Bash at the Beach pay-per-view that month, his debut was delayed indefinitely; WCW worked this into a feud with Big Bubba Rogers, who criticized Glacier's <b>hype</b> <b>and</b> the overlong wait for his arrival during interviews on Nitro with the Dungeon of Doom. His debut finally occurred on September 9, 1996 episode of Pro, when he pinned The Gambler in a match, which {{was also one of}} only two matches in which he executed his Cryonic Kick finisher off the top rope before it was changed to a spinning reverse roundhouse kick, and subsequently to standard side kick. Glacier then defeated Bubba on his Nitro debut on September 16, ending the brief feud. The original costume and blue lighting were scrapped, however, after only his fourth match, a pinfall victory on Nitro over Mike Wenner on September 30. Following a subsequent ten-week hiatus off WCW television, he reappeared on Nitro on December 2, in which he debuted a new ring outfit and entrance music, then pinned Hardbody Harrison in a 60-second squash.|$|E

5000|$|The genre has {{prompted}} some less than respectful responses, including a comment by John Updike, {{who participated in}} an early effort at online fiction, that [...] "books haven't really been totally ousted yet".

[...] The success of One and Kanon on Key's formula to create a [...] "crying game" [...] was later adopted by other visual novel developing companies which were influenced by this formula. Examples of this include: Kana: Little Sister by Digital Object, the Memories Off series by KID, D.C.: Da Capo by Circus, Snow by Studio Mebius (also under VisualArt's), and Wind: A Breath of Heart by Minori.|$|R

500|$|As Glee initial success {{pulled in}} a large audience, John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that the early shows [...] "felt fresh, mainly because the motley crew of kids {{had a kind of}} square naïveté."
