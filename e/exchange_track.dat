ORB COMM is the first commercial venture to offer worldwide personal communications service (PCS) using non-voice-non-geostationary (NVNG) low earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology. Link budget analyses of the system's satellite up and down links are presented. The author analyzes ORB COMM's proprietary multiple access scheme for random access channel interference and describes how the system's modified ALOHA protocol achieves a higher throughput than pure or slotted ALOHA based systems. Several commercial and DoD applications of the system are discussed, including beaconing, data <b>exchange,</b> <b>tracking,</b> and two way messaging. Specific DoD applications of ORBCOMM include combat sea-alr rescue (CSAR) and deployable communications networks for use in operations other than war (OOTW). With DoD taking. an active role as a cooperative partner, ORB COMM can satisfy the need for a low-cost, commercial space-based system to enhance US military global communicationsNANAU. S. Navy (U. S.

30|$|Distributed {{tracking}} with consensus, {{addressed in}} this paper and previous work [27, 28], refers to the problem {{that a group of}} nodes need to achieve an agreement over the state of a dynamical system by <b>exchanging</b> <b>tracking</b> estimates over a network. For instance, space-object tracking with a satellite surveillance network that consists of fixed nodes that are connected together, and mobile nodes that could only have active links with other nodes within their communication radius could benefit from such distributed tracking with consensus, {{due to the fact that}} individual sensor nodes may not have enough observations of sufficient quality [29]. Thus, different sensor nodes may arrive at different local estimates regarding the same space object of interest [29]. Information exchange among nodes may improve the quality of local estimates, and consensus estimates may help avoid conflicting and inefficient distributed decisions. Other applications of this problem include flocking and formation control, real-time monitoring, target tracking, and global positioning system (GPS) [29, 30]. In [28], the performance analysis of distributed tracking with consensus on noisy time-varying graphs was addressed, and later, the algorithm of distributed tracking with consensus with incomplete data was proposed without theoretical proof in [27].|$|R

40|$|Critical to {{advancement}} of marine shrimp {{culture in the}} United States is the reduction of costs associated with feeding, aeration, and water <b>exchange.</b> <b>Tracking</b> the flow of chemical components is a quantitative means of comparing different levels {{of each of these}} items which will allow refinement of costs. Elucidation of the path of nitrogen through the pond system was a first step in understanding how components were affected by different combinations of feed, aeration, and water exchange (Hopkins, et al., in review). In the present research, total carbon is tracked to obtain another view of the movement of chemicals through the system which are affected by various combinations of water exchange, as it relates to water quality. The primary result of this work was the production of a carbon budget for marine shrimp ponds. The budget indicated that sludge was the largest carbon component in each pond, and that phytoplankton production, using CO 2 from the atmosphere, was the main carbon production method. The water quality results also indicated that if water quality is maintained, then the rate of exchange does not necessarily have to be as high as previously thought to gain high yields. In addition, filtration of pond water for water quality control does not appear as effective at water quality maintenance as small amounts of water exchange...|$|R
40|$|T. D. R., S. J. J., and D. D. contributed {{equally to}} this work. ABSTRACT Chlamydia psittaci is an obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium. Interest in Chlamydia stems from its {{high degree of}} viru-lence as an intestinal and pulmonary pathogen across {{a broad range of}} animals, including humans. C. psittaci human pulmo-nary infections, referred to as psittacosis, can be life-threatening, which is why the organism was developed as a bioweapon in the 20 th century and is listed as a CDC biothreat agent. One remarkable recent result from comparative genomics is the finding of frequent homologous recombination across the genome of the sexually transmitted and trachoma pathogen Chlamydia tra-chomatis. We sought to determine if similar evolutionary dynamics occurred in C. psittaci. We analyzed 20 C. psittaci genomes from diverse strains representing the nine known serotypes of the organism as well as infections in a range of birds andmam-mals, including humans. Genome annotation revealed a core genome in all strains of 911 genes. Our analyses showed that C. psittaci has a history of frequently switching hosts and undergoing recombination more often than C. trachomatis. Evolu-tionary history reconstructions showed genome-wide homologous recombination and evidence of whole-plasmid <b>exchange.</b> <b>Tracking</b> the origins of recombinant segments revealed that some strains have imported DNA from as-yet-unsampled or-unsequenced C. psittaci lineages or other Chlamydiaceae species.

We turn next to economic explanations for this so-called border effect and to its dynamics.
