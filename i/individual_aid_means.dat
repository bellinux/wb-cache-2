40|$|In my diploma thesis, I {{focused on}} pupils with {{mathematics}} learning difficulties {{as well as}} on the individual approaches concerning various types of learning aid. The research was carried out in order to investigate the effects of <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid</b> on pupils with regard to the opinions held by the pupils in question, their parents, and the involved teachers. I was interested in finding out how, from the standpoint of the pupils in question as well as that of their parents and teachers, the <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid</b> affects the pupils’ study habits. I considered several research questions concerning various aspects of <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid.</b> My first research questions was about the effects of learning aid on the learning of mathematics. Another research questions was about the pupils’ study habits. Finally, I questioned whether that the pupils’ motivation for learning mathematics will increase and whether pupils will be motivated to attend learning aid lessons. The stated research questions were studied by means of two different questionnaires; one was filled in by the pupils participating in the learning aid lessons, by their parents and teachers, while a different questionnaire was filled in by the special education teacher. The study sample included seventeen pupils which participated in afternoon <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid</b> lessons in mathematics regularly (i. e. once a week). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which {{incontinence}} aids, used in local authority/municipal nursing homes, were adapted to the resident’s urine-leakage volume and to find out how nurses perceived the current situation concerning individual testing of incontinence aids in municipal nursing homes. The study method was a quantitative empirical study and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was a weighing test, carried out in three nursing homes, whereby the incontinence aids used by 25 residents during a 48 hour period were weighed. The second phase was the completion of a questionnaire by the municipal nurses working in the same local authority. The questionnaire covered: the division of responsibilities; routines for testing incontinence aids, and the level of knowledge concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing. Only 22 % of the pads used during the observation were properly adapted to the patients’ urinary leakage volume, while 76 % of incontinence aids were larger than necessary in relation to the real volume of urinary leakage. The municipal nurses, who have a key role and formal responsibility for <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, considered that there was insufficient knowledge within the organisation concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and that the division of responsibilities in this area was unclear. There were great variations relating to the extent of the nurses’ involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and the nurses stated that increased involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing was dependent on more time being made available for this task. Only a minority of the nurses thought that the requisitioning of incontinence aids was preceded by individual testing of the incontinence pads within the organisation. The majority of nurses considered that this was not the case or were unsure of the situation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that the political impact of aid, including its impact on accountability institutions, is contingent on its objective. This article explains how this occurs. It relies on evidence from two aid programs in Uganda, one targeted at poverty reduction and one at democratic governance. I argue that the stated objective of aid programs masks a deeper cause; <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> managers’ views of what development entails and {{how it should be}} pursued. The evidence suggests that the ‘almost revolution’ in which development has purportedly confronted politics is far more partial, contested, and uneven than many admit...|$|R

The most volatile aid sectors per se include debt, industry, and humanitarian, and the least include education and health. In several sectors volatility appears to have peaked around 2006. Within individual countries, sector volatility is often corrected for in the following period, there are also sometimes knock-on effects on other sectors.

Funding was given to the parents to disburse as they chose, but in Lemon v. Kurtzman, the funding at question was given directly to the schools, which failed the test.|$|R

30|$|Importantly, {{the current}} study gathers views from {{a broad range of}} aid workers, {{including}} development and national workers who are commonly under-researched. An enhanced understanding {{of a wide range of}} aid workers’ stressors and effective coping strategies is important for informing responses to stress at the levels of individuals, organisations and the broader <b>aid</b> sector. For <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> workers, findings from the present research can be used to normalise stress and disseminate information on the range of commonly used coping styles. Organisations can use aid worker views to improve structures and staff support. At the sector level, results can inform staff-care resources and interventions to reduce staff stress. Given the importance of aid workers to the sector, efforts to reduce staff stress can have flow-on benefits for the delivery of aid.|$|R
30|$|For <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> workers, {{stress can}} lead to poor mental health, burnout and {{posttraumatic}} reactions (Cardozo and Salama 2002; Eriksson et al. 2009). As a starting point, sharing the common stressors identified {{in the present study}} may help normalise the challenges of the sector, particularly with regards to some unexpectedly common stressors such as team dynamics and feeling unable to help others. Sharing common stressors has been beneficial in other sectors including the disclosure of traumatic incidences among health practitioners (Farrington 1995). Many respondents to our survey reported that they wanted to hear more about other aid workers’ common stressors to help normalise their experiences. Such normalisation through sharing may be particularly pertinent in the aid sector where stigma often prevents discussion of mental health issues (Fechter 2012).|$|R

40|$|Natural {{resource}} rents {{and foreign}} aid have {{the character of}} windfall gains that affect economic outcomes both directly and indirectly. Several {{studies have shown that}} the indirect effect typically works via institutions like corruption. In this article, we offer a theoretical framework for a joint analysis of how natural resources and aid potentially affect total output in society through rent seeking activities. We survey the existing evidence on both direct and indirect effects of windfalls and provide some new empirical evidence of the association between aid/natural resources and institutions in a large cross-section of countries. Our results suggest that whereas more <b>aid</b> <b>means</b> less corruption, natural resource rents is positively correlated with corruption, although both relationships are nonlinear. institutions; aid; natural resources; windfall gains; economic growth; corruption; rule of law...|$|R

50|$|Social affairs were {{conducted}} {{through the lens}} of the importance of sanitation. Therefore, the Kamermayer administration treated the issue of homelessness {{as a matter of law}} enforcement. The ordinance of poverty regulation, issued by the General Assembly in 1875, also reflected this attitude resulting in many homeless people being deported from the city centre. The annual budgets marginally addressed the problem of <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> systems, however numerous social institutions were created over the years. The communal poorhouse was expanded, and several free public baths were established. New correctional facilities were also built. The small number of hospitals was a serious problem, and they often struggled with overcrowding. There was no solution forthcoming for this. In 1876, the Saint Roch Hospital was extended with new buildings, while the first psychiatric institution (Első Magyar Hülyenevelő és Ápoló Intézet) opened in 1877.|$|R
