5|$|The use of YMCA {{instructors}} from Springfield College gave {{a direct}} link to {{the origins of the}} game. Within a short time after the Birmingham Development many YMCA clubs in England had adopted the game and had formed District Associations similar to the Association in Birmingham. Most of these Associations <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> difficulty of complication in the American Rules and in 1912 the Birmingham Association Rules of Basketball were accepted throughout most of England with some slight differences in rules according to particular conditions.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E

25|$|Nils Johan Berlin and Marc Delafontaine tried also to {{separate}} the crude yttria and <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> substances that Mosander obtained, but Berlin named (1860) the substance giving pink salts erbium, and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide terbium. This confusion led to several false claims of new elements, such as the mosandrium of J. Lawrence Smith, or the philippium and decipium of Delafontaine.|$|E
25|$|The Court <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> true for the PVPA. Under that law, however, “A {{farmer who}} legally {{purchases}} and plants a protected variety {{can save the}} seed from these plants for replanting on his own farm.” The PVPA and also the PPA operate in parallel with § 101 of the utility patent law. They provide different degrees of protection and have different requirements for securing protection. The later laws do not supersede the earlier one.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{a second}} team in Calgary was added as the Calgary Chinooks {{relocated}} from Pincher Creek.

25|$|There {{is mixed}} {{evidence}} for the utility of emotional approach coping in samples of women with breast cancer. In a longitudinal study of women with breast cancer, for women who perceived their social environments to be receptive, emotional expression predicted improved quality of life. Coping through emotional expression among women with breast cancer has also been found to predict an increase in post-traumatic growth. However, other studies have not <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> link between emotional expression and post-traumatic growth.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah and Ward {{used the}} Penrose {{correspondence}} {{to reduce the}} classification of all instantons on the 4-sphere to a problem in algebraic geometry. With Hitchin he used ideas of Horrocks to solve this problem, giving the ADHM construction of all instantons on a sphere; Manin and Drinfeld <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> construction at the same time, leading to a joint paper by all four authors. Atiyah reformulated this construction using quaternions and wrote up a leisurely account of this classification of instantons on Euclidean space as a book.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 1965, the {{neighborhood}} became infamous when five-year-old Eddie Crimmins Jr. and four-year-old Missy Crimmins vanished from their garden apartment at 150–22 72nd Drive. Missy's body was <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{day in a}} vacant lot on 71st Avenue at 162nd Street (the area where the 107th Precinct is located today.) Eddie's body was found five days later near 68th Drive and {{the entrance to the}} northbound Van Wyck Expressway. The children's mother, Alice Crimmins, was convicted in 1971, and imprisoned, in the death of her children. She was paroled in 1977.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Burchenal, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, with Farber's help, {{started his}} own {{methotrexate}} study and <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> effects. He then {{decided to try to}} develop anti-metabolites {{in the same way as}} Farber, by making small changes in a metabolite needed by a cell to divide. With the help of George Hitchings and Gertrude Elion, two pharmaceutical chemists who were working at the Burroughs Wellcome Co. in Tuckahoe, many purine analogues were tested, culminating in the discovery of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which was subsequently shown to be a highly active antileukemic drug.|$|E
25|$|Eventually all the Mesozoic {{rock from}} the Teton Range was {{stripped}} away and the same formations in Jackson Hole were deeply buried. A prominent outcrop of the pink-colored Flathead Sandstone exits 6,000 feet (1,830 m) above the valley floor on the summit of Mount Moran. Drilling in Jackson Hole <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> formation 24,000 feet (7,300 m) below the valley's surface, indicating that the two blocks have been displaced 30,000 feet (9,100 m) from each other. Thus an average of one foot of movement occurred every 300 years (1cm per year on average).|$|E
25|$|After {{the combat}} in El Realejo, the Argentines <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{schooner}} with the Spanish flag {{that they had}} lost in San Blas. The ship went forward towards the Santa Rosa, whose crew was composed of inexpert Hawaiian sailors and had few artillery. A first attack killed three Argentines and wounded many more. When the Argentine ship was going to repel the enemy's boarding, the schooner took out the Spanish flag and showed it was a Chilean ship, called Chileno (Chilean). It was commanded by a corsair whose surname was Croll. Bouchard demanded that his surgeon heal the wounded, but the Chilean corsair decided to go away.|$|E

25|$|Hoffmann assimilated {{well with}} Polish society; the years spent in Prussian Poland he {{recognized}} as the happiest of his life. In Warsaw he <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> atmosphere he had enjoyed in Berlin, renewing his friendship with Zacharias Werner, and meeting his future biographer, a neighbour and fellow jurist called Julius Eduard Itzig (who {{changed his name to}} Hitzig after his baptism). Itzig {{had been a member of}} the Berlin literary group called the Nordstern, and he gave Hoffmann the works of Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, Achim von Arnim, Clemens Brentano, Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert, Carlo Gozzi, and Calderon. These relatively late introductions marked his work profoundly.|$|E
25|$|Chamoun was a {{supporter}} of the nationalist Christian cause at heart, however, and he soon returned to the cause to which he, like his father, had dedicated his life. He served as General Secretary of the National Liberal Party from 1983 to 1985, when he replaced his father as the party leader. In 1988, he became President of the revived Lebanese Front—a coalition of nationalist and mainly Christian parties and politicians that his father had helped to <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> <b>same</b> year, he announced his candidacy for the Presidency of Lebanon to succeed Amine Gemayel (Bashir's brother), but Syria (which by this time occupied some 70 percent of Lebanese territory) vetoed his candidacy.|$|E
25|$|The first {{murder for}} which Bonin was charged {{was that of}} a 13-year-old {{hitchhiker}} named Thomas Glen Lundgren. Lundgren was last seen leaving his parents' house in Reseda at 10:50a.m. on the morning of May 28, 1979: his body, clad only in a T-shirt, shoes and socks, was <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> afternoon in Agoura. An autopsy revealed that Lundgren had suffered emasculation and bludgeoning to his face and head, with his skull sustaining multiple fractures. In addition, the youth had been slashed across the throat, extensively stabbed, and strangled to death. His underwear, jeans, and severed genitals were discovered strewn in a field close to his body. In the abduction and murder of Lundgren, Bonin was assisted by Vernon Butts, who is suspected of accompanying or assisting Bonin on at least eight further murders attributed to the Freeway Killer.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} by Geraerts, Merckelbach, Jelicic, & Smeets (2006) {{found that for}} individuals with low anxiety and high desirability traits (repressors), suppressed anxious autobiographical events initially intruded fewer times than in other groups (low, high, and high defensive anxious groups), but intruded more often after one week. This difference in coping style {{may account for the}} disparities within the literature. That said, the problem remains that the cause of the paradoxical effect may be in the thought tapping measures used (e.g. bell ringing). Evidence from Brown (1990) that showed participants were very sensitive to frequency information prompted Clarke, Ball and Pape (1991) to obtain participants' aposterio {{estimates of the number of}} intrusive target thoughts and <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pattern of paradoxical results. However, even though such a method appears to overcome the problem, it and all the other methodologies use self-report as the primary form of data-collection. This may be problematic because of response distortion or inaccuracy in self-reporting.|$|E
25|$|Sefer Ha-Aggadah (The Book of Legends) is {{a classic}} {{compilation}} of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and the Midrash literature. It was edited by Hayim Nahman Bialik and Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked for three years to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah. When they <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However, they also presented some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the Jerusalem Talmud, and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the Aramaic aggadot into modern Hebrew. Sefer Ha-Aggadah {{was first published in}} 1908-11 in Odessa, Russia, then reprinted numerous times in Israel. In 1992 it was translated into English as The Book of Legends, by William G. Braude.|$|E
25|$|In West Dallas, Texas, {{a mostly}} African American and Latino community, a lead smelter {{poisoned}} the surrounding neighborhood, elementary school, and day cares {{for more than}} five decades. Dallas city officials were informed in 1972 that children in the proximity of the smelter were being exposed to lead contamination. The city sued the lead smelters in 1974, then reduced its lead regulations in 1976. It wasn't until 1981 that the EPA commissioned a study on the lead contamination in this neighborhood, and <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> results that had been found a decade earlier. In 1983, the surrounding day cares had to close due to the lead exposure while the lead smelter remained operating. It was later revealed that EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez had deliberately stalled the clean up of the lead-contaminated hot spots. It wasn't until 1993 that the site was declared a Superfund site, and {{at the time it was}} one of the largest ones. However, it was not until 2004 when the EPA completed the clean-up efforts and eliminated the lead pollutant sources from the site.|$|E
