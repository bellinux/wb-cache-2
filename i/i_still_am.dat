Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>am.</b> I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

[...] She began seeing Robert Oppenheimer in 1936, {{when she was a}} graduate student there and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at Berkeley. They met through his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn, who was {{also a member of the}} Communist party, when Washburn held a fund raiser for communist-backed Spanish Republicans. The couple started dating and had a passionate relationship; he proposed to her twice, but she refused. She is credited with introducing Oppenheimer to radical politics during the late 1930s, and to people involved with, or sympathetic to the Communist Party or related groups, such as Rudy Lambert and Thomas Addis. They continued seeing each other after he became involved with Kitty Harrison, whom he married on November 1, 1940. Oppenheimer and Tatlock [...] spent the New Year together in 1941, and once met at Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com wrote, [...] "It wasn't the whiz-bang finale I {{was expecting}} {{after all the}} hype, {{but it was one}} that was true to what the show stands for, and that's good enough for me." [...] Like Sepinwall and Gibson, Frederick praised the {{performance}} by Levi and Dalton, writing, [...] "Chuck's heartbreak and desperation were incredibly poignant throughout the bulk of the episode." [...] Like Gibson, Frederick also praised the scene depicting Chuck's surrender to Vivian, calling it [...] "sniffle-inducing". Frederick continued that Dalton [...] "plays Hartley Winterbottom with a great sincerity and vulnerability." [...] Frederick also called it [...] "a great reward to the fans that the episode didn't cheat us out of the Chuck/Sarah wedding at all." [...] Frederick wrote, [...] "While I'm not blown away by this finale, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>am</b> satisfied with it, because it represents the values we've come to expect from Chuck: the ideas of hope, family, and sticking together {{in the face of the}} most adverse of circumstances." [...] Ryan McGee of The Onion A.V. Club rated the episode a B+ on an A+ to F scale, although criticizing its [...] "mechanics". Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside season two's [...] "Chuck Versus Santa Claus" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", season three's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", and season five's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman wrote, [...] "Chuck had more ups and downs than usual this season, but it ended on a very strong note. With Sarah's life in danger, Chuck and all his friends and family proved they would risk everything to save her, and it made for a very compelling, involving hour." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, Standing Bear {{decided to}} leave. He {{was no longer}} willing to endure {{existence}} {{under the control of}} an overseer. Luther sold his land allotment and bought a house in Sioux City, Iowa, where he worked as a clerk in a wholesale firm. After a brief job doing rodeo performances with Miller Brothers 101 Ranch in Oklahoma, he moved to California to seek full-time employment in the motion picture industry. In later years, Luther reflected upon his decision to leave the reservation: “Sixteen years ago I left reservation life and my native people, the Oglala Sioux, because I was no longer willing to endure existence under the control of an overseer. For about the same number of years I had tried to live a peaceful and happy life; tried to adapt myself and make re-adjustments to fit the white man’s mode of existence. [...] But I was unsuccessful. I developed into a chronic disturber. [...] I was a bad Indian, and the agent and I never got along. I remained a hostile, even a savage, if you please. And <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>am.</b> I am incurable.” [...] While Standing Bear left the confinement of the reservation, he continued his serious responsibilities and as an Oglala Lakota chief, fighting to preserve Lakota heritage and sovereignty through public education.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, in a {{town hall}} meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his {{political}} philosophy by stating, [...] "I am no longer a socialist, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>am</b> a Marxist". In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that [...] "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. I consider myself a very conservative Marxist". In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled [...] "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was. Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a [...] "cult". In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that [...] " [...] death {{meant a lot to me}} and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{spiritual leader}} of the tail section. Director Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one {{with the ability to}} [...] "exude the {{ambience}} of spirituality." [...] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, [...] "He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>am</b> not entirely certain what the reason is," [...] adding, [...] " [...] as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also sees himself as a true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people." [...] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because, [...] " [...] the fact that I had one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches. [...] and having {{to make it look like}} as though I'd been doing it for years." [...] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to [...] "interpret things as we want, as we see fit" [...] as well as adding pointers to the act. Hurt said of Bong, [...] "I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did when I got home. I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since."
