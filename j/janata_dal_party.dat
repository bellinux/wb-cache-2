The House Speaker Meira Kumar then turned down requests for speeches on the topic and had to adjourn the session amid protests against the ban of the Gita sparked by Mahtab's statement, as angry members of the Parliament across the party lines strongly condemned the ban, shouting: [...] "We will not tolerate an insult to Lord Krishna!" [...] The issue was simultaneously raised in Rajya Sabha (the Upper House). This display of political unity surprised the media and prompted a Rajya Sabha member to call the December 19 parliamentary session [...] "a golden day in our history when all differences were deleted to express solidarity for Gita, the book of India".|$|E
