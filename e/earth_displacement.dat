50|$|For years, the {{epicenter}} of the quake was assumed to be near the town of Olema, in the Point Reyes area of Marin County, because of evidence of the degree of local <b>earth</b> <b>displacement.</b> In the 1960s, a seismologist at UC Berkeley proposed that {{the epicenter}} was more likely offshore of San Francisco, to the northwest of the Golden Gate. The most recent analysis by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) shows that the most likely epicenter was very near Mussel Rock on the coast of Daly City, an adjacent suburb just south of San Francisco. An offshore epicenter is supported by the occurrence of a local tsunami recorded by a tide gauge at the San Francisco Presidio; the wave had an amplitude of approximately 3 in (8 cm) and an approximate period of 4045 minutes.|$|E
40|$|The Witte Effect, {{that was}} first {{observed}} by R. D. Witte [1] in 1991, and {{consist of a}} phase error between two synchronized atomic clocks, due to rotation of the earth, that can {{be connected to the}} earth “absolute” movement in the space. The Witte Effect was explained in context of General Relativity, by R. T. Chaill[2], based on the Michelson-Morley Interferometer. Dr. Chaill demonstrates that, if the light speed in the medium (that forms the interferometer arms) is smaller than in vacuum (for example, using optical fibers) “absolute ” velocities can be obtained. On this way, Chaill proposed that Witte experiments, in fact were measured “absolute” velocities of <b>earth</b> <b>displacement</b> in space, which maybe associated to the large gravitational fields references frames. In this paper the author explains the Witte Effect, using only the Especial Relativity models, more specifically, rotating the Einstein’s light clock and demonstrate that this Effect not is really connect to the Michelson-Morley Interferometer experiment. If this is true the Witte Effect can be used to update the gravitational wave detector, like the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) [5], and make it work...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} {{experiments}} to measure large scale <b>Earth</b> surface <b>displacements</b> such as caused by solid Earth tides with centimetre-level accuracy using TerraSAR-X radar images. With two totally different approaches, corner reflectors and image correlation techniques, we show clear interrelation between the radar range measurements and the projection of the solid Earth tide motion vector onto the radar line of sight. Pixel location accuracies of up to 2. 6 cm standard deviation can be achieved after a single calibration. We further demonstrate that solid Earth tides and tropospheric water vapour variations are the largest sources of ranging error if not compensated for. Alternatively, tropospheric water vapour can be estimated with centimetre accuracy using our proposed technique of SAR image correlation and solid Earth motion compensation by existing models. We also consider ionospheric delays which improve the results marginally in X-band. Our results show the best ranging accuracies so far reported for space-borne radar amplitude images and make TerraSAR-X - together with our simple compensation methodology - suitable for imaging of centimetre-level <b>Earth</b> <b>displacements.</b> Absolute measurements of volcanoes or glaciers are possible {{without the use of}} ground equipment and without the use of SAR interferometry, thus avoiding the associated problems of phase ambiguity, phase unwrapping and reference points. ...|$|R

40|$|The Space Borne Event Timer {{is a part}} of the NASA laser ranging {{system that}} is {{intended}} to operate aboard the Space Shuttle orbiting over California. The object is to measure, by laser ranging, the earth movement along the San Andreas fault and possibly forecast future earthquakes. A number of cube reflector targets will be placed along both sides of the fault. The ranging system aboard the Space Shuttle will fire a burst of laser pulses at each target and detect the reflected light.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of Earth deformation, earthquakes and tides has been undertaken using Earth tide and interferometric SAR data from ESA satellites. The ability of Earth tides to trigger earthquakes {{has been investigated}} by measuring the statistical relationship between earthquake occurrence and Earth tides. Analysing Earth tides data with earthquakes occurrence using Shuster’s test has shown {{that there is a}} correlation between Earth tides and earthquake occurrence. The significance of this correlation has been examined as a function of location, earthquake depth and magnitude. It has been found that the correlation is especially significant for low magnitude earthquakes. The two regions in California examined show similar correlations but significant differences in the phase angle of the correlation. Possible reasons for these differences and the role of ocean load tides are discussed in this thesis. SAR data are used to detect the <b>Earth</b> <b>displacement</b> related to two recent earthquakes in the Californian area. InSAR technique has been applied successfully to the Bam earthquake in Iran in 2003. The results for Earth displacements in the Parkfield area are less satisfactory but a number of interference fringes over a wide area due to a particular earthquake have been observed.

50|$|Conversely, many pseudoarchaeologists, whilst criticising the {{academic}} archaeological establishment, also {{attempt to get}} support from people with academic credentials and affiliations. At times, they quote historical, {{and in most cases}} dead academics to back up their arguments; for instance prominent pseudoarchaeologist Graham Hancock, in his seminal Fingerprints of the Gods (1995), repeatedly notes that the eminent physicist Albert Einstein once commented positively on the pole shift hypothesis, a theory that has been abandoned by {{the academic}} community but which Hancock supports.

40|$|Physics. However, {{the impact}} of Einstein’s ideas was not {{restricted}} to physics. Among numerous other disciplines, Einstein also made significant and specific contributions to Earth Sciences. His geosciences-related letters, comments, and scientific articles are dispersed, not easily accessible, and are poorly known. The present review attempts to integrate them {{as a tribute to}} Einstein in commemoration of this centenary. These contributions can be classified into three basic areas: geodynamics, geological (planetary) ca-tastrophism, and fluvial geomorphology. Regarding geo-dynamics, Einstein essentially supported Hapgood’s very controversial theory called <b>Earth</b> Crust <b>Displacement.</b> With respect to geological (planetary) catastrophism, it is shown how the ideas of Einstein about Velikovsky’s proposals evolved from 1946 to 1955. Finally, in relation to fluvial geodynamics, the review incorporates the elegant work in which Einstein explains the formation of meandering rivers. A general analysis of his contributions is also carried out from today’s perspective.

40|$|<b>Earth</b> surface <b>displacement</b> {{measurement}} {{from space}} using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery {{is an interesting}} alternative to SAR interferometry (InSAR). The advantages are that 2 D information can be retrieved (InSAR only 1 D), absolute displacements can be retrieved (no reference point required) {{and it is very}} robust (phase unwrapping not required). On the other hand, the accuracy is limited by the pixel resolution, the object contrast, the orbit accuracy, by wave propagation distortion and by geodetic effects. Therefore the accuracy was more in the meter / decimeter level in the past, compared to millimeter accuracy of InSAR.

The Moon shadowing effect has been used to verify the pointing capability of the detector and to determine the instrument resolution for the search of muon excesses from any direction of the celestial sphere.

40|$|The {{principle}} and applications of tethering are examined. Tethering works by momentum transfer; {{the center of}} mass of a system consisting of (for example) a Space Shuttle and a tethered payload such as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysical Facility continues to follow the original orbit. Given a slight outward velocity, the payload begins to lag behind because {{it has the same}} linear velocity as the Shuttle but is at a greater distance from the <b>earth.</b> Any <b>displacement</b> from the local vertical causes a restoring force at each end tending to restore the system to a vertical orientation. When vertically above the Shuttle, the payload has the same angular velocity but a greater linear velocity; thus momentum is transferred from the Shuttle to the payload. It is computed that a tether 32 nautical miles long could deploy AXAF into a 320 -nautical mile orbit from a lower, elliptical Shuttle orbit, thus saving 5000 pounds of Shuttle propellant. Various types of tether are considered: Kevlar and steel, uniform and tapered. Numerous cases appear to be feasible for boost and deboost as well as momentum transfer, using such reaction masses as the Space Station, a lunar orbiter, the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, various asteroids, and moons of the major planets...|$|R

Plate tectonic phenomena dominate tectonics on the <b>earth.</b> Horizontal <b>displacements</b> are associated with the creation of new crust at ridges and destruction of crust at trenches. The presence of plate tectonics on Venus is debated, but there is certainly no evidence for the trenches associated with subduction on the earth. An essential question is what kind of tectonics can be expected if there is no plate tectonics on Venus. Mars and the Moon are reference examples. Volcanic constructs appear to play a dominant role on Mars but their role on Venus is not clear. On single plate planets and satellites, tectonic structures are often associated with thermal stresses. Cooling of a planet leads to thermal contraction and surface compressive features. Delamination has been propsed for Venus by several authors. Delamination is associated with the subduction of the mantle lithosphere and possibly the lower crust but not the upper crust. The surface manifestations of delamination are unclear. There is some evidence that delamination is occurring beneath the Transverse Ranges in California. Delamination will certainly lead to lithospheric thinning and is likely to lead to uplift and crustal thinning...|$|R
