6000|$|If any uninspired {{writer has}} been {{entitled}} to the name of Boanerges, or a son of thunder, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the following treatise. Here we have a most searching and faithful display of the straitness or exact dimensions of that all-important gate, which will not suffer many professors to pass into the kingdom of heaven, encumbered as they are with fatal errors. Still [...] "it is no little pinching wicket, but wide enough for all the truly gracious and sincere lovers of Jesus Christ; while it is so strait, that no others can by any means enter in." [...] This is a subject calculated to rouse and stimulate all genuine professors to solemn inquiry; and it was peculiarly intended to dart at, and fix convictions upon, the multitudes of hypocritical professors who abounded in Bunyan's time, especially under the reigns of the later Stuarts.|$|E
6000|$|Of the deistical {{writers of}} the early eighteenth century, Anthony Collins (1676-1729) is, perhaps, the most celebrated. He was born near Hounslow and educated at Eton and Cambridge. His {{writings}} were mainly attacks on Christianity, and, {{in addition to the}} [...] "Discourse on Freethinking," [...] he published: [...] "Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion;" [...] "Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered;" [...] "Priestcraft in Perfection;" [...] "Historical and Critical Essay on the Thirty-Nine Articles;" [...] and [...] "A Philosophical Enquiry concerning Human Liberty." [...] Most of these writings engaged him in many and violent controversies with some of the ablest divines of his time. Among these, beside Swift, may be named, Whiston, Hare, Hoadly, Bentley, and Samuel Clarke. Steele, also, had his fling at Collins, and thought that [...] "if ever man deserved to be denied the common benefits of air and water, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of 'A Discourse upon Freethinking'" [...] ("Guardian," [...] No. 3). But then Steele's opinion on such a matter was of no great moment. What was of more, {{was the fact that the}} school to which Collins belonged found a decided opponent in Locke, from the writings of whom the members of the school professed to draw their strongest arguments. For a philosophical appreciation of Toland, Collins, and the rest, see Mr. Leslie Stephen's [...] "English Thought in the Eighteenth Century" [...] (chaps. iii. and iv. of vol. i. 1881).|$|E
6000|$|The {{manager of}} a theatre {{is a man of}} business. He is not an expert in politics, religion, art, literature, philosophy, or law. He calls in a playwright just as he calls in a doctor, or consults a lawyer, or engages an architect, {{depending}} on the playwright's reputation and past achievements for a satisfactory result. A play by an unknown man may attract him sufficiently to induce him to give that unknown man a trial; but this does not occur often enough to be taken into account: his normal course is to resort to a well-known author and take (mostly with misgiving) what he gets from him. Now this does not cause any anxiety to Mr Forbes Robertson and Sir Herbert Tree, because they are only incidentally managers and men of business: primarily they are highly cultivated artists, quite capable of judging for themselves anything that the most abstruse playwright is likely to put before them, But the plain sailing tradesman who must be taken as the typical manager (for the West end of London is not the whole theatrical world) is by no means equally qualified to judge whether a play is safe from prosecution or not. He may not understand it, may not like it, may not know what the author is driving at, may have no knowledge of the ethical, political, and sectarian controversies which may form the intellectual fabric of the play, and may honestly see nothing but an ordinary [...] "character part" [...] in a stage figure which may be a libellous and unmistakeable caricature of some eminent living person of whom he has never heard. Yet if he produces the play he is legally responsible just as if he had written it himself. Without protection he may find himself in the dock answering a charge of blasphemous libel, seditious libel, obscene libel, or all three together, not to mention the possibility of a private action for defamatory libel. His sole refuge is the opinion of the Examiner of Plays, his sole protection the licence of the Lord Chamberlain. A refusal to license does not hurt him, because he can produce another play: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> who suffers. The granting of the licence practically places him above the law; for though it may be legally possible to prosecute a licensed play, nobody ever dreams of doing it. The really responsible person, the Lord Chamberlain, could not be put into the dock; and the manager could not decently be convicted when he could procure in his defence a certificate from the chief officer of the King's household that the play was a proper one.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{covers the}} time span from roughly 1910 to about 1950.

5000|$|Reviewing {{the novel}} for The New York Times, critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, [...] "The minute he starts talking, Peter Jernigan, {{the narrator of}} David Gates's {{astonishing}} first novel, grabs you by the lapels and compels {{you to listen to}} the sad-funny-tragic story of his life. His voice is one of those distinctive, all-American voices: brash, sarcastic, rueful and boyish, all at the same time. He sounds like a Holden Caulfield who has grown up to find himself trapped in a novel by Richard Yates." [...] Douglas Seibold of The Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "It is a compelling ride, and makes for compelling reading. But it is Jernigan's voice, the hectoring, profane, desperate voice with which he tells the story of his fall, that is the motivating force." [...] In reviewing the 2015 UK reissue of Jernigan for The Independent, Doug Johnstone wrote, [...] "Re-reading Jernigan, I was struck all over again at how brutal and brilliant <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> <b>author</b> Stuart Evers, in his insightful and passionate foreword to this new edition, claims that it deserves to be rediscovered in a similar fashion to Stoner or Revolutionary Road. While I agree with that sentiment entirely, Jernigan feels like a more powerful piece of writing than those books, a howl into the abyss, a very modern American rage against the indignities of life and death." ...|$|E
5000|$|When we {{consider}} the nature and the theory of our institutions of government, the principles upon which {{they are supposed to}} rest, and review the history of their development, we are constrained to conclude that they do not mean to leave room for the play and action of purely personal and arbitrary power. Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> and source of law; but, in our system, while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts. And the law is the definition and limitation of power. It is, indeed, quite true that there must always be lodged somewhere, and in some person or body, the authority of final decision, and in many cases of mere administration, the responsibility is purely political, no appeal lying except to the ultimate tribunal of the public judgment, exercised either in the pressure of opinion or by means of the suffrage. But the fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, considered as individual possessions, are secured by those maxims of constitutional law which are the monuments showing the victorious progress of the race in securing to men the blessings of civilization under the reign of just and equal laws, so that, in the famous language of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights, the government of the commonwealth [...] "may be a government of laws, and not of men." [...] For the very idea that one man may be compelled to hold his life, or the means of living, or any material right essential to the enjoyment of life at the mere will of another seems to be intolerable in any country where freedom prevails, as being the essence of slavery itself.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to {{interpret}} Witold Gombrowicz’s first novel in the context of cynicism, which is first conceptualized within the Foucauldian tradition as a practice of “frank speech” (parrhesia), and then, according to Peter Sloterdijk’s critical philosophy, as a form of modern consciousness based on inverted idealism. The opposition between an ancient subversive cynicism and its modern schizoid form allows one to analyze the complexity of Ferdydurke. In the course of interpretation it turns out that there are some intersecting planes: the protagonist searches in vain for lost insolence, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> who manages to find it {{at the end of the}} novel. </span...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{examines}} {{the problem of}} not-being in Plato’s Sophist. “Not-being” is strictly connected, in Plato’s Sophist, {{with the notion of}} the “other” or “difference”, as not-being can be understood as “not-being something”, i. e. as “different from” something. In fact, what “is not” beautiful, e. g., is not only what is “contrary” to beautiful, but also what is “different” from beautiful. In this way, the “other” introduces and explains a notion of a relative “not-being” as “different” from what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> <b>author</b> puts this notion at the centre of its analysis trying to verify its coherence and legitimacy, establishing some relations with two contemporary thinkers (Meinong and Frege) who clearly depend on Plato’s reflection on this point...|$|E
