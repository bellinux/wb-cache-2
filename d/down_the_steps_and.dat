25|$|A five-bay {{pavilion}} projects {{from the}} east, with a veranda running its full length. It is enclosed by a baluster railing, which continues <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> supported by freestanding columns {{at the front}} and engaged ones at the rear. Similar, smaller verandas {{can be found on}} the other sides.|$|E
2500|$|When Servius Tullius {{arrived at}} the senate-house to defend his position, Tarquinius threw him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> Servius was murdered in the street by Tarquin's men. Soon after, Tullia drove her chariot over her father's body. For Livy, Tarquinius' [...] impious refusal to permit his father-in-law's burial earned him the sobriquet [...] "Superbus" [...] (arrogant or proud), and Servius' death is a [...] "tragic crime" [...] (tragicum scelus), a dark episode in Rome's history and just cause for the {{abolition}} of the monarchy. Servius thus becomes the last of Rome's benevolent kings; the place of this outrage [...] which Livy seems to suggest as a crossroads [...] is known thereafter as Vicus Sceleratus (street of shame, infamy or crime). His murder is parricide, the worst of all crimes. This morally justifies Tarquin's eventual expulsion and the abolition of Rome's aberrant, [...] "un-Roman" [...] monarchy. Livy's Republic is partly founded on the achievements and death of Rome's last benevolent king.|$|E
60|$|The King bounded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> smacked Provost Wayne on the back.|$|E
60|$|Brogard {{had come}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> again, <b>and</b> Marguerite {{was ready to}} go up to her safe retreat.|$|R
60|$|And {{with this}} parting threat <b>the</b> {{merchant}} hurried <b>down</b> <b>the</b> loft <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> rapped loudly for Booth {{to come and}} let him out.|$|R
6000|$|Some one was {{standing}} at the foot--not the sexton--but a young man bending as with an intolerable load of grief. Rachel saw him first, when Alick was helping her <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> <b>and</b> her start of dismay made him turn and look round. His brow contracted, and she clutched his arm with an involuntary cry of, [...] "Oh, don't," [...] but he, with a gesture that at once awed and tranquillized her, unclasped her hold and put her back, while he stepped forward.|$|R
60|$|Just then Nairn came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> {{waved his}} hand to them.|$|E
60|$|Rilla shrieked {{and lost}} her head. She sprang <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> {{jumped off the}} train.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hardy, {{feeling that}} {{something}} strange was happening, ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> hurried toward them.|$|E
60|$|To Jerry surprise, the rascal {{offered no}} resistance. Instead, he came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> backward, <b>and</b> {{fell on his}} back on the sidewalk, his hat rolling toward the gutter.|$|R
5000|$|The active pool {{experience}} {{was built for}} people to walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> terraced <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> experience <b>the</b> power, sounds and motion of water crashing around them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Go <b>down,</b> far <b>down</b> <b>the</b> steep <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> escape!' whispered <b>the</b> madman, in soft, beguiling tones. 'The {{darkness}} above {{leads to}} the light below! Go down, far down!' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned away}} abruptly. The door was softly closed. Arnold went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> set his face citywards.|$|E
60|$|Nina came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> joined Babalatchi, who put {{his hand}} to his forehead, and squatted down with great deference.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, for a guide, {{carrying}} {{fishing rods}} and landing nets, went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> Stannard {{came out of}} the hotel.|$|E
60|$|He {{disappeared}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> basement <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> {{in another}} minute a harsh voice apparently vituperating him rose up, {{and when he}} rejoined his comrade his face was redder than ever.|$|R
60|$|But {{she slammed}} the door in his face, and he sat <b>down</b> upon <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> wiped his {{forehead}} with his pink handkerchief and fanned himself with his hat {{and tried to think}} what he should do next.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Nathan," [...] said Rollo, [...] "I {{will lie}} <b>down</b> upon <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> make believe I am a bear gone to sleep, {{and you come}} and poke me with your stick, and then I will growl at you." ...|$|R
60|$|She swept <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> passed him. Before {{he could}} reach her side she was tugging at {{the handle of the}} {{carriage}} door.|$|E
6000|$|Demorest passed quickly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> disappeared. At {{the same}} moment a voice came from the {{banisters}} of the landing above. [...] "Who's there?" ...|$|E
60|$|He went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> {{along the}} street, {{and when he}} came back some time later he found Alison waiting for him on the veranda.|$|E
60|$|The {{connection}} was gone. Laverick laid <b>down</b> <b>the</b> receiver <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> out of <b>the</b> booth.|$|R
60|$|Mumps led <b>the</b> way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rocky <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> Josiah Crabtree followed, {{moving slowly}} {{that he might}} not fall. Creeping {{to the edge of the}} cliff, the Rover boys saw the pair reach the Falcon and go on board.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it you," [...] said Defarge, {{in a low}} voice, as {{they went}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> guardhouse <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> turned into Paris, [...] "who married the {{daughter}} of Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. Is this a story? I {{want to hear}} a story. [She runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> sits on {{the altar}} at Arjillax's feet].|$|E
60|$|Seeing that I was {{not being}} noticed, I slipped from the {{forecastle}} to the companionway. In a moment I was <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> in the cabin.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Holland {{had already}} come <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> {{as the girl}} turned towards her, she took her in her arms, and kissed her in motherly fashion.|$|E
60|$|Selena gave {{a little}} gasp. She sat <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> lowest <b>step</b> <b>and</b> untied her bonnet strings.|$|R
60|$|She sat <b>down</b> upon <b>the</b> lowest <b>step,</b> <b>and</b> Elizabeth-Jane obeyed her {{directions}} and stood among the idlers.|$|R
60|$|Little Jon sat <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> bottom <b>step,</b> <b>and</b> nodded. Bella came close, {{and looked}} him over.|$|R
6000|$|Just then Nairn came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> {{waved his}} hand to them. [...] "Ye will no forget that Mrs. Nairn is expecting both of ye this evening." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} the policeman, {{followed}} by the negro, ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> pulled the black-headed man off the captain, and the limp body slipped down several steps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Davy!" [...] Anne choked back an unholy {{shriek of}} laughter. [...] "Would {{you call it}} fun to see poor little Dora fall <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> get hurt?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had almost}} reached the {{pavilion}} {{when one of}} the M.C.C. team came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> saw him, <b>and</b> stopped dead.|$|R
60|$|Mr Smith, {{who always}} went in last for his side, and who so far had not {{received}} a single ball during <b>the</b> week, was <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pavilion <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> half-way to <b>the</b> wicket before the retiring batsman had taken half a dozen steps.|$|R
60|$|His {{companion}} had put <b>the</b> lanthorn <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> <b>and</b> by {{its light}} {{she could see}} him distinctly: a mysterious, masked figure who, with wanton infamy, had placed the satisfaction of his dishonesty and of his greed athwart the destiny of the King of France.|$|R
