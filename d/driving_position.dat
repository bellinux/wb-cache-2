5|$|The Nclass {{incorporated}} {{the principles of}} power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running up to , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b> These features are attributed to Holcroft, {{who worked on the}} GWR 4300class before joining the SECR. The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsellâ€™s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mid-engined}} {{car with}} central <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> (albeit Lancia deposited a patent for a central driven design in 1934).|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} are configured with {{a single}} cab, with <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> for both directions. The overhauled diesel engines are from Henschel.|$|R
50|$|While most of {{the older}} trams are unidirectional, and thus have to be turned on a loop in order to reverse direction, the newer ones are bi-directional, with <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> and doors on both end/sides.|$|R
50|$|The line {{is unusual}} in that all {{platforms}} are {{on one side of}} this single track line. In view of this, the cars that run on it only have doors on one side but have <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> at both ends.|$|R
25|$|The {{first ten}} had a central cab and {{were known as}} camel-backs, and these entered service in 1906. A year later another ten units with a box design and a <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> both ends arrived. These were {{replaced}} by more powerful units in the early 1920s.|$|E
25|$|M-55S-USP - M-55S {{converted}} into a driver trainer vehicle. The turret {{has been replaced by}} a training enclosure with seats for an instructor and two trainee drivers. A third driver is in the normal <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> of the vehicle. It is also known as LM-55, M-55USP and USP9.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} power car, numbered 43002, {{was delivered}} in late 1975, with a significantly different appearance from the prototype. The streamlined front end lacked conventional buffers, and the drawgear was hidden under a cowling. The single cab front window was {{much larger than}} the prototype's, and side windows were included. There was also no <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> at the inner end.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} is configured with {{a single}} cab, with <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> for both directions. The diesel engine (Maybach MB83B built under licence) produces [...] though documentation shows a peak rating of 415 bhp from a normally aspirated engine. Transmission occurs by means of hydraulic transmission TH5R-V6. Train braking is via the single pipe air system.|$|R
2500|$|Railcars Nos.3 and 4 {{were built}} in 1935 and 1938 {{respectively}} and were virtually identical. Like No.2, they were [...] long with elevated <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> but there the similarity ended as the cars had [...] "air smoothed" [...] bodywork. Each seating 80 passengers, they too were powered by two [...] Leyland Diesel engines with hydraulic transmission.|$|R

25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{shape of}} the car was designed by Oscar Jankovits, probably inspired by contemporary aerodynamic theories such as Paul Jaray's,and built at the Jankovits garage between 1935 and 1937. It was a barchetta with central <b>driving</b> <b>position,</b> with fully integrated wings (ponton styling). The body shell was streamlined to minimise turbulence in the air flow, fully enveloping the underbody and integrating door handles and lights.|$|E
25|$|For the 1974 F1 season, Amon revived Chris Amon Racing. Gordon Fowell {{designed}} the car, the AF101, which featured a single central fuel tank, titanium torsion bars and a forward <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b> Structurally, however, {{it proved to}} be weak and was not ready for an F1 appearance until the fourth race of the season, the Spanish GP. Amon was only able to qualify 23rd, thanks to brake-disc vibration that only became worse with the tyres for the wet race that followed. Despite cautious driving, a brake shaft finally broke and Amon was forced to retire after 22 laps.|$|E
25|$|Project Blueprint saw {{the chassis}} pick-up points, wheelbase, track and <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> become common across both manufacturers. The Holdens were now {{required}} to use double wishbone front suspension, {{similar to that of}} the Falcon, rather than the MacPherson struts used previously. The aerodynamic packages were comprehensively tested and revised and differences in the porting of each of the manufacturers' engines were also removed. The performance of the new Ford BA Falcon and Holden VY and VZ Commodores was fairly even for the next four years, with Ford winning the championship in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and Holden winning in 2006. Reverse-grid races were used at certain events in 2006 before unpopularity with the drivers, teams and fans saw them abolished halfway through the season.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As the {{development}} of space structures is increasing fast, analyses {{on the characteristics of}} those deployable structures deserve to be paid enough attention to ensure a reliable deployment on orbit. For a deployable truss structure, more than one position can be chosen as the <b>driving</b> <b>positions,</b> especially when the structure has not only one degree of freedom (DOF), an available choice of the <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> shows significant importance on the performance of the space deployable structure. This paper mainly deals with a planar deployable support truss structure for space antenna by means of the closed loop equations and the Kane equation to discuss the deployment characteristics by comparisons of the driving torque needed over time. A full comparison of all the possible examples of deployment analysis results under different driving modes is presented. The results show the importance of the choice of driving movements and the design of parameters and also provide a useful reference to other related truss structures...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the concept for a mobile vehicle system which {{performs}} an in situ science mission to Mars is described.

25|$|This {{generation}} Taurus was {{exported to}} Japan in limited numbers, and sold at Japanese auto dealerships called Autorama (a {{joint venture with}} Mazda), where the Taurus SHO was the only model available in both sedan and wagon versions with left-hand <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> until 1995. To Japanese buyers, it {{was regarded as a}} luxury vehicle as the exterior dimensions and engine displacement exceeded Japanese government regulations, and buyers in Japan were liable for additional taxes.|$|R
25|$|Cooper's own route into Formula One was {{somewhat}} unorthodox. Following on from producing the Vanwall Maddock {{began work on}} a new sportscar, designed around Coventry Climax's new FWA 1,098 cc inline-four engine. Maddock and John Cooper decided to adapt the Mark IX Formula Three chassis to accept the larger, more powerful engine, retaining the engine mounted behind the driver and the driver's seat on the car's centre-line, per the single-seater's arrangement. The T39 chassis consequently featured Cooper's curved tube design, with the upper longerons sweeping up from the front suspension mounts, passing {{on either side of}} the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> and engine, before looping back down the rear suspension. The passenger seat, mandated by sportscar rules of the time, was mounted outboard of the chassis on the driver's left.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} a {{successful}} racer herself, Patsy Burt and her manager Ron Smith also ran a well-regarded race preparation garage. Their operation, PMB Garages Ltd. (PMB being Burt's initials), of Great Bookham, Surrey, prepared Arthur Owen's winning Cooper T53 car for the 1962 British Hill Climb Championship, and repeated their triumph eight years later with Sir Nick Williamson's F5000 specification McLaren M10A. PMB were, naturally, also responsible for Patsy Burt's own cars {{during the rest of}} her career. The car with which Burt became synonymous, her modified Cooper T59, was built up at PMB Garages in the winter of 1962-63. Chassis number C/PMB/1/63, originally supplied as a 1litre Formula Junior car, was adapted to accept a 2litre Coventry Climax FPF engine by moving the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> forward. Burt's short stature allowed the larger engine, with its concomitantly larger fuel and oil tanks, to be mounted in the usual position without having to lengthen the car's wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|Fred Dixon and Tony Rolt {{considered}} {{the possibility of using}} 4WD in circuit racing, and with Harry Ferguson keen to promote the transmission systems of his Ferguson tractor firm work began on the P99 in 1960. With a 50â€“50 torque distribution front to rear the car, Claude Hill's design was built to have an even weight distribution over both axles, which along with the position of the gearbox necessitated a front-engined design despite Cooper's and Lotus's overwhelming recent success with mid-engined cars. Just as the project was nearing completion it was dealt something of a body blow by the governing body's decision {{to reduce the size of}} F1 engines by 40% for , making the extra weight of the 4WD transmission a much bigger penalty. Nevertheless the team persevered and fitted a standard 1.5-litre Climax 4-cylinder engine, mounted at a slant to make room for the front driveshaft. In addition the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> was moved slightly off-centre to accommodate the gearbox and rear driveshaft to the driver's left hand side.|$|E
50|$|The Csaba had a 20 mm cannon and an 8 mm {{machine gun}} fixed on a {{centrally}} mounted turret, with 9 mm armoured plating. The vehicle was also {{equipped with a}} detachable 8 mm light machine gun fired through the rear hatch in the anti-aircraft role. The crew could dismount and carry this MG when conducting reconnaissance on foot. It also had two <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> - one at the front as normal, and an additional one at the rear.|$|R
25|$|Launched while Japan {{was in a}} {{recession}} following the 1991 collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, this generation Taurus was exported to Japan in limited numbers, and sold at Japanese auto dealerships called Autorama (a joint venture with Mazda), where the sedan and wagon versions with right-hand <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> until 1997. To Japanese buyers, it {{was regarded as a}} luxury vehicle as the exterior dimensions and engine displacement exceeded Japanese Government regulations, and buyers in Japan were liable for additional taxes. The engine displacement also put operating costs for Japanese owners in a higher annual road tax obligation.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, the Taurus was {{exported}} to Japan in limited numbers, and sold at Japanese auto dealerships called Autorama (a {{joint venture with}} Mazda), where the Taurus LX and the SHO were available in both sedan and wagon versions with left-hand <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> until 1991. To Japanese buyers, it {{was regarded as a}} luxury vehicle as the exterior dimensions and engine displacement exceeded Japanese government regulations, and buyers in Japan were liable for additional taxes. The engines offered to Japanese customers, both the 2.5 litre four cylinder and the 3.0 litre V6, also obligated Japanese driver to pay more annual road tax which affected sales.|$|R
500|$|On {{the plus}} side, the C5's {{handling}} characteristics were praised by reviewers. The Guardian called it [...] "very easy to master {{once you have}} {{become familiar with the}} under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> with feet on bicycle-type pedals." [...] The Daily Mirror described the arrangement as [...] "surprisingly easy" [...] to master, although it cautioned that [...] "on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels." [...] The Daily Express motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 [...] "stable, comfortable and easy to handle".|$|E
500|$|The Kclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell's team in 1914 {{as part of his}} proposed standardisation programme following the Nclass, but the designs were not shown to the railway directors until early 1915 to enable all six designs to be shown at once. The design incorporated the principles of power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running at high speeds, a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b> The inclusion of these features is attributed to Holcroft, Maunsell's personal assistant, who had worked on the GWR 4300class and the Nclass. James Clayton, Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, brought simpler and more functional Midland Railway influences to the design, such as the shape of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. The latter was fitted with Ross pop safety valves and pressed to [...]|$|E

25|$|Commencing in 2013, five GB Railfreight Class 73 were re-engined as Class 73/9 by Brush Traction Wabtec {{at their}} factory in Loughborough. The first three {{converted}} locomotives, renumbered 73961-3 from 73209, 73204 and 73206 respectively, were fitted with MTU 1,600hp V8 engines. All existing mechanical and electrical components were removed {{prior to the}} re-fit, and the frontal appearance of the locomotives has been altered by the provision of light clusters and the installation of a more central location for the jumper cables. The dual <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> have been retained although with a new design for the driver's controls.

2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938. The conductor rails were fed direct, without any distribution. Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the positive outer rail set [...] from the running rail. The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets. The <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> controlled all the motors on the train by the means of a low voltage control signal.|$|R

2500|$|The latest {{incarnation}} of Land Roverâ€™s acclaimed Terrain Response system was also included offering sport and eco modes {{in addition to}} the existing grass, gravel, snow, and sand modes. Typical Land Rover design traits aim at improving off-road performance included a prominent <b>driving</b> <b>position,</b> hill descent control, and useful [...] A Land Rover first was an air intake system integrated into the roof which offered exceptional wading capabilities though this feature did not make it to the production model. Land Rover's Range Rover styling was visually apparent {{in the form of the}} clamshell bonnet, the â€˜floatingâ€™ roof, dual-pocket headlamps, and raked roof line.|$|E
2500|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were small}} and short to fit within the small diameter tunnels, which were [...] at {{the northern end of}} the railway, and [...] on the straighter southern section, to allow higher speeds. The cab was built along the centre line of the locomotive with a door at each end and the controls and equipment mounted on the sides. There was a single <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> {{at one end of the}} locomotive with the power controller on one side and the Westinghouse air-brake valve and hand-brake column on the other. The controls worked directly so no form of multiple-unit control was ever possible.|$|E
50|$|The front section, an {{open area}} between the tracks, was flanked by tall narrow structures, above {{the front of the}} track frame at each side, that acted as {{armoured}} cabs for driver on the left and brakesman to the right. In the prototype these <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> had been {{directly in front of the}} superstructure; moving them forward greatly improved visibility, but made communication very difficult. This arrangement had obvious disadvantages where, as in the Mark I, four men, including the gearsmen, had to coordinate their actions to drive and manoeuvre a most ungainly vehicle. Between these two structures lay a low-slung pivoting platform able to accommodate a 60-pounder (5-inch) gun, a 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer or any equivalent in stores or personnel.|$|R
50|$|Traction {{equipment}} {{is concentrated in}} the middle car. Designing the car body to {{be strong enough to}} support transformer and air conditioning equipment on the roof whilst limiting the weight proved difficult, delaying delivery by about a year.Each end car has a <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> and a pantograph. To allow lateral movement each pantograph is mounted on a sledge. At standstill the sledge can be moved by 1.3 m from the centre to the side. Contacts on the sledge engage with fixed contacts on the car roof to route the current to either the AC (centre position) or DC equipment. The pneumatic cylinder allows movement to the right only, but, should the EMU be turned, provision can be made for movement to the other side with a simple intervention at the workshop.|$|R
30|$|In {{this context}} of {{assisted}} or autonomous <b>driving,</b> <b>positioning</b> solutions complementary to the satellite-based systems are needed. One such solution is visual odometry: {{the measurement of}} a vehicleâ€™s trajectory using vehicle-mounted cameras. Visual odometry {{is closely related to}} simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) in the field of robotics, but there are clear distinctions between the two. Whereas SLAM places equal emphasis on constructing a virtual map of the unknown environment as on positioning relative to that environment, visual odometry methods do not need to explicitly map the environment. The two problems remain strongly intertwined, as positioning relies on finding fixed points in the environment of the vehicle, but for visual odometry, the mapping itself is of little interest. In fact, in some cases (especially consumer automotive applications), some information about the environment may already be known (e.g., the local road network layout).|$|R
