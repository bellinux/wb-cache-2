40|$|Immediate and {{residual}} {{effects of}} two lengths of low plane of nutrition (PON) on {{the synthesis of}} milk protein and protein fractions were studied at the Mutdapilly Research Station, in south-east Queensland. Thirty-six multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows, between 46 and 102 days in milk (DIM) initially, were used in a completely randomised design experiment with three treatments. All cows were fed on a basal diet of ryegrass pasture (7. 0 kg DM/cow. day), barley-sorghum concentrate mix (2. 7 kg DM/cow. day) and a canola meal-mineral mix (1. 3 kg DM/cow. day). To increase PON, 5. 0 kg DM/cow. day supplemental maize and forage sorghum silage {{was added to the}} basal diet. The three treatments were (C) high PON (basal diet + supplemental silage); (L 9) low PON (basal diet only) for a period of 9 weeks; and (L 3) low PON (basal diet only) for a period of 3 weeks. The experiment comprised three periods (1) covariate â€“ high PON, all groups (5 weeks), (2) period of low PON for either 3 weeks (L 3) or 9 weeks (L 9), and (3) period of high PON (all groups) to assess ability of cows to recover any production lost as a result of treatments (5 weeks). The low PON treatment periods for L 3 and L 9 were <b>end-aligned</b> so that all treatment groups began Period 3 together. Although there was a significant effect of L 9 on yields of milk, protein, fat and lactose, and concentrations of true protein, whey protein and urea, these were not significantly different from L 3. There were no residual effects of L 3 or L 9 on protein concentration or nitrogen distribution after 5 weeks of realimentation. There was no significant effect of low PON for 3 or 9 weeks on casein concentration or composition...|$|E
