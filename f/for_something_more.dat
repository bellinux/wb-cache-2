5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E

25|$|The Julian Marriage Laws of 18 BC, which {{promoted}} monogamous marriage {{to increase the}} population's birth rate, were fresh in the Roman mind. Ovid's writing in the Ars Amatoria concerned the serious crime of adultery. He may have been banished for these works, which appeared subversive to the emperor's moral legislation.

25|$|In late March 1966 in Michigan, {{two days}} of mass UFO {{sightings}} were reported, and received significant publicity. After studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis {{for some of the}} sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken swamp gas <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> spectacular. At the press conference where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the Michigan UFO reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term swamp gas was repeated ad infinitum in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to national derision.|$|E

500|$|Producer Tonino Cervi, {{head of the}} {{production}} company Italy Film, {{was the first person}} to propose a film adaptation of the Diabolik comic strip. During this period, Andre Hunebelle's film Fantomas was popular. Cervi was ambiguous when describing his production, stating once that [...] "I think that with a few retouches [...] could turn into an extraordinary character for the silver screen." [...] In another interview, he acknowledged that [...] "nowadays a good film based on Flash Gordon would be a sensational success [...] but it would cost as much as Cleopatra. I have to settle <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> modest, so I'm doing Diabolik."

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Sea Change, Beck felt newer {{compositions}} were sketches <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase. During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck {{was never able to}} recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003. Feeling as though it might take him a while to [...] "get back to that [...] territory", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to Odelay.

500|$|GQ writer Dan Fierman said Parks and Recreation {{appeared}} to be [...] "approaching early Simpsons-levels in its absurdity and comic pacing". He suggested this {{could be due to}} the use of Mike Scully, a veteran comic writer with the animated series, as a consulting producer on Parks and Recreation. In an article reflecting on the Parks and Recreation second season, which became critically acclaimed following poor season one reviews, Slate magazine writer Jonah Weiner said the plot of [...] "The Camel" [...] "can be read as something of a Season 2 mission statement".

25|$|Some logical {{systems are}} not {{adequately}} represented by the set of theorems alone. (For example, Kleene's logic has no theorems at all.)

Since Narissa appears in three media: hand drawn animation, live-action, and computer animation, May had {{to make sure that the}} costume would be the same throughout in terms of [...] "color, shape, and texture". The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked [...] "reptilian", as well as a cape. Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the dragon's form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like wings, the [...] of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.|$|E
500|$|According to Menken, the [...] "plot-furthering songs" [...] in Beauty and the Beast, {{including}} [...] "Belle", developed {{quite naturally}} {{as a result}} of the fact that the film was written to [...] "almost ... exist as a stage musical", having been [...] "presented in the style of a traditional Broadway musical." [...] According to Broadway actress and singer Paige O'Hara, who both recorded the song and provided the voice of Belle, Ashman and Menken [...] "wanted to leave the pop music sound of Mermaid behind and go <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> Jerome Kern/Rodgers & Hammerstein" [...] for Beauty and the Beast. The film's songs and musical numbers, which were written to both [...] "propel the plot" [...] and offer [...] "character development", were heavily influenced by French, classical and traditional Broadway music.

Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest.

He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that [...] "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best.
