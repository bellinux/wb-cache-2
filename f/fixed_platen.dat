The typeball and carriage mechanism was similar to the design of the Teletype Model 26 and later, which used a rotating cylinder that moved along a <b>fixed</b> <b>platen.</b>|$|E
40|$|Using micro-machined silicon technology, an ultra-sensitive {{miniature}} acce.,rometer can {{be constructed}} which meets the requirements for microgravity experiments in the space environment. Such an accelerometer will have a full scale sensitivity of 1 C 2 g a resolution of lC 8 g, low cross axis sensitivity, and low temperature sensitivity. Mass of the device is approximately five grams and its footprint is 2 cm x 2 cm. Innovative features of the accelerometer, which are patented, are: electrostatic caging to withstand handling shock up to 150 g, in-situ calibration, in situ performance characterization, and both static and dynamic compensation. The transducer operates on a force balance principle wherein the displacement of the proof mass is monitored by measuring tunneling electron current flow between a conductive tip, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>platen.</b> The four major parts of the accelerometer are tip die, incorporating the tunneling tip and four field plates for controlling pitch and roll of the proof mass; two proof mass dies, attached to the surrounding frame by sets of four leg" springs; and a force plate die. The four parts are fuse-bonded into a complete assembly. External electrical connections are made at bond pads on the front surface of the force plate die. Materials and processes used {{in the construction of}} the transducer are compatible with volume production...|$|E
40|$|This paper deals with, the {{solution}} of problem occurred for reciprocating screw of Injection molding machine. It identifies and solves the problem by using the modeling and simulation techniques. The problem occurred in the reciprocating screw of machine which was wearing of threads due to affect of temperature of mold materials (flow materials) i. e. Nylon, low density polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC etc., The main work was to model the components of machine with dimensions, assemble those components and then simulate the whole assembly for rotation of the screw. The modeling software used is PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 for modeling the machine components like body, movable platen, <b>fixed</b> <b>platen,</b> barrel, screw, nozzle, etc. The analysis software ANSYS is {{used to analyze the}} reciprocating screws. The objectives involved are:-• To model all the components using modeling software Pro-E 4. 0 • To assemble all the components of the machine in the software. • To make the assembly run in Pro-E software. • Analysis of screw of machine using Ansys 11. 0 software. • To identify the wearing of threads and to provide the possible solutions. This problem is major for all industrial injection molding machines which the industries are facing and they need the permanent solution, so if the better solution is achieved then the industries will think for implementing it. The industries are having temporary solution but it will affect the life of the screw, because the stresses will be more in machined screw on lathe machine as compared to normal screw. Also if the screw will fail after some years of operation, the new screw available in the market will have the same problem. Also the cost associated with new screw and its mounting is much more as it is the main component of machine...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{observations}} {{suggests that}} concrete specimens subjected to uniaxial tension {{may have different}} responses depending on the imposed kinematic ‘‘constrains”. A simple model is proposed here to explain the experimental findings. Concrete specimens are schematized as a system composed of three trusses. This model can thus consider the non-homogeneity of the material, and the eccentricity between {{the head of the}} testing machine and the specimen. Two kinds of tests are considered: imposed uniform displacement (<b>fixed</b> <b>platens)</b> and freely rotating platens. The results of the model show that the tests based on <b>fixed</b> <b>platens</b> provide higher peak loads. Only for a perfect specimen and testing conditions (homogeneous material and absence of geometric eccentricity) the results of a <b>fixed</b> <b>platens</b> test and of a rotating platens test coincide. Furthermore, the same results are obtained by energy balance...|$|R

The selected umbilical system concept {{consists of four}} assemblies and command and display equipment to be installed at the Orbiter payload specialist station: (1) a movable platen assembly which {{is attached to the}} power system with EVA operable devices; (2) a slave platen assembly which is attached to the payload with EVA operable devices; (3) a <b>fixed</b> secondary <b>platen</b> permanently installed in the power system; and (4) a <b>fixed</b> secondary <b>platen</b> permanently installed on the payload.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) should ideally have {{mechanical properties}} {{similar to those}} of the bone tissue the material is used to replace or repair. Usually, the compressive strength of the CPCs is reported and, more rarely, the elastic modulus. Conversely, scarce or no data are available on Poisson's ratio and strain-to-crack-initiation. This is unfortunate, as data on the elastic response is key to, e. g., numerical model accuracy. In this study, the compressive behaviour of brushite, monetite and apatite cements was fully characterised. Measurement of the surface strains was done using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique, and compared to results obtained with the commonly used built-in displacement measurement of the materials testers. The collected data showed that the use of <b>fixed</b> compression <b>platens,</b> as opposed to spherically seated ones, may in some cases underestimate the compressive strength by up to 40 %. Also, the built-in measurements may underestimate the elastic modulus by up to 62 % as compared to DIC measurements. Using DIC, the brushite cement was found to be much stiffer (24. 3 ± 2. 3  GPa) than the apatite (13. 5 ± 1. 6  GPa) and monetite (7. 1 ± 1. 0  GPa) cements, and elastic moduli were inversely related to the porosity of the materials. Poisson's ratio was determined to be 0. 26 ± 0. 02 for brushite, 0. 21 ± 0. 02 for apatite and 0. 20 ± 0. 03 for monetite. All investigated CPCs showed low strain-to-crack-initiation (0. 17 – 0. 19 %). In summary, the elastic modulus of CPCs is substantially higher than previously reported and it is concluded that an accurate procedure is a prerequisite in order to properly compare the mechanical properties of different CPC formulations. It is recommended to use spherically seated platens and measuring the strain at a relevant resolution and on the specimen surface. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|R
40|$|Tissue-engineered {{scaffolds}} should mimic, {{as closely}} as possible, {{the one of the}} tissues to be replaced. Hence, mechanical tests are of paramount importance. However, as there are various biomaterials, with distinct mechanical properties, performing a conventional compression test is complicated. The objective of this thesis was to study the reliability and limitations of static conventional compression test and compression testing device. Accuracy and reproducibility of the compression tests were considered. The results showed that the compressive properties are dependent on many factors (sample size, microstructure, etc.). Biomaterial’s properties, such as viscoelasticity and brittleness, complicated the compression test and hampered the reliability. <b>Fixed</b> uniaxial compressive <b>platen</b> led to uneven load distribution on sample cross-section area. Careful sample preparation, surface finish or self-aligning platen could improve the reliability. The testing device showed good reproducibility, and accuracy for compressive strength. However, compressive modulus underestimated the results by > 34 %. The strain was measured from the platen displacement that may have caused error in strain measurements. With an optical extensometer, strain could be measured precisely from the center part of the sample. In conclusion, the accuracy and reproducibility of conventional compression test are questionable. The compression test should be performed with caution...|$|R
40|$|Steel fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC) {{is more often}} considered as a profitable re-placement of diffused reinforcement, like welded steel mesh, especially for thin cross section. In this case, fire becomes a crucial condition for design. An experi-mental investigation {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the benefits in fire resis-tance of steel fibre when structural elements are bent (di Prisco et al. 2003). First of all, four point bending tests were carried out on notched 600 mm long beams with a 150 x 150 mm cross section and a notch/depth ratio equal to 0. 3. Once car-ried out the bending tests, two cylinder specimens were cored from each beam: one was tested in uniaxial compression while the other, once notched, was tested in direct tension. The average uniaxial tension and compression test results are first used as con-stitutive relationships to reproduce the bending tests, neglecting notch effects. A brief description of the experimental set-up used in direct tension is instru-mental to present and discuss the eccentric tension imposed in the specimens by an active control designed to keep the press <b>platens</b> <b>fixed.</b> The measured bending moment was adopted to quantify the heterogeneity degree of SFRC specimens, be-fore and after cracking...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic lateral {{crushing}} behaviour of short empty and sandwich circular tubes is {{examined in this}} paper. Unlike the conventional impact method, the specimens {{were placed on the}} bottom platen of an Instron machine with a constant upwards velocity and then the tube collided with the <b>fixed</b> upper rigid <b>platen.</b> Load-deflection curves of empty tubes were first obtained and analysed. From the viewpoint of deformation modes and plastic strain energy absorbed by the tube quadrants around the proximal surface and distal surface, a critical velocity of impact is determined which corresponds to a mode change. A relationship is found to exist between the critical velocity and thickness-to-diameter ratio as well as the yield stress and density of the material. To understand the dynamic crushing behaviour of short aluminium foam-filled sandwich tubes by two rigid platens, further tests and corresponding finite element analysis were performed, respectively. Similar to the observations in the quasi-static tests, the mode of dynamic collapse is bending, with the formation of plastic bending zones accompanied with core crushing. Corresponding FE models for ABAQUS/Explicit were developed and validated against the experimental observations. Detailed deformation features and energy absorption characteristics during the crushing process were identified. It was found that increasing the compression velocity leads to an increase in the total internal plastic energy dissipation for both empty and sandwich tube. The propagation of plastic bending in the form of double-moving-hinges is the main mechanism of energy dissipation, as opposed to the low velocity impact which involves stationary plastic deformation zones...|$|R
