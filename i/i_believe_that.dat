5|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> my large {{statue in}} ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, {{it would look}} very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> {{beyond a}} doubt, {{we are now}} facing the best {{opportunity}} we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East.

I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement {{to be the most}} important final goal to which we must devote ourselves.|$|E
5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this year I am going to do some serious things.|$|E

5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> real {{education}} presupposes a {{sense of}} proportion in physical, mental, and moral development; and that he alone is educated who has learned the lessons of self-control and open-mindedness.|$|E

25|$|I {{was born}} Jewish and so I remain, {{even if that}} is {{unacceptable}} for many. For me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my hope and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Christianity is the means for achieving it.|$|E

25|$|To put {{artifacts}} {{in their proper}} context I consider it most important {{to pay attention to}} the chronological sequence, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.|$|E
25|$|America has {{a unique}} record. We never lost a war and we never won a conference in our lives. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we could without any degree of egotism, single-handed lick any nation in the world. But we can't confer with Costa Rica and come home with our shirts on.|$|E

25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{education}} {{is one of}} the keys to lasting peace in the Middle East... Ever since we first raised this issue some years ago there still has not been an adequate repudiation of incitement by the Palestinian Authority. It is even more disturbing that the problem appears to have gotten worse. These textbooks don't give Palestinian children an education, they give them an indoctrination.|$|E
25|$|If {{there had}} been no Ashes and £1,000 a man for winning today's game, I daresay {{there would have been a}} result. the fact that these matches are played in a series is a damper. The fact that the Ashes must be fought for is a further damper. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> if a series is drawn, then the Ashes should at least go into pawn so that no one holds them.|$|E
