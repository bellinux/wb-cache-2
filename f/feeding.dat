5|$|A typical female {{vampire bat}} weighs 40grams and can consume over 20grams (1 fluid ounce) {{of blood in}} a 20-minute feed. This <b>feeding</b> {{behavior}} is facilitated by its anatomy and physiology for rapid processing and digestion of the blood to enable the animal to take flight soon after the <b>feeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the core}} territory, {{there is a}} larger <b>feeding</b> range which is {{variable}} in size, but typically ten or more times {{the area of the}} breeding territory.

Samples were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 lb for the Ultra- Drop <b>feed</b> dispenser due to a smaller storage capacity for <b>feed</b> with this <b>feed</b> drop. There were five replications (five drops of each type) at each <b>feed</b> setting.

In this study unique livestock <b>feed</b> demand relationships for <b>feed</b> grains and total concentrates are estimated for each of seven major livestock categories. The estimated relationships show substantial differences in elasticities of concentrate and <b>feed</b> grain <b>feed</b> demand with respect to <b>feed</b> prices and with respect to livestock price across livestock groups.
