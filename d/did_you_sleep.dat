During Love's pregnancy, Hole {{recorded}} a cover of [...] "Over the Edge" [...] for a Wipers tribute album, and recorded their fourth single, [...] "Beautiful Son", which was released in April 1993. Love and Cobain married in February 1992 and, {{after the birth of}} their daughter Frances Bean Cobain, relocated to Carnation, Washington and then to Seattle. On September 8, 1993, Love and Cobain made their only public performance together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Hollywood, performing two acoustic duets of [...] "Pennyroyal Tea" [...] and [...] "Where <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Sleep</b> Last Night". Love also performed electric versions of two new Hole songs, [...] "Doll Parts" [...] and [...] "Miss World", both written for the band's upcoming second album.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Lanegan {{released}} his first solo album, The Winding Sheet via label Sub Pop (which {{at the time}} was home to friends Nirvana and The Afghan Whigs). Lanegan had intimated that the album came around following a Leadbelly project he was working on with Mark Pickerel, Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic. The project was short lived and eventually other musicians became involved in the evolution to the debut solo record. From the Leadbelly sessions a version of [...] "Where <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Sleep</b> Last Night?" [...] appeared on The Winding Sheet. [...] "Ain't It a Shame" [...] is available on the Nirvana box set, With the Lights Out. Cobain also supplied backing vocals on [...] "Down in the Dark" [...] on Lanegan's debut. The majority of the album was recorded with Pickerel on drums, Mike Johnson (who would later go on to play bass with Dinosaur Jr) on guitar, Steve Fisk on piano and organ, and Jack Endino on bass.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{many artists}} who {{appeared}} on the show, Nirvana filmed its entire performance in a single take. The band's fourteen-song setlist included a single song from its debut album, Bleach, four songs from the 1991 album Nevermind, three tracks from the then-recently released In Utero, and six cover songs. The group shied away from playing its better-known songs; the only contemporary hit the band performed was its 1992 single [...] "Come as You Are". Ten songs in, Cris and Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets joined the band onstage to perform three of their group's songs with Nirvana. The set ended with a performance of the traditional song [...] "Where <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Sleep</b> Last Night", following the arrangement of blues musician Lead Belly, whom Cobain described right before the song as [...] "his favorite performer ever". This rendition has been {{regarded as one of}} the greatest live single song performances of all time. As The Atlantic critic Andrew Wallace Chamings described, [...] "For the final line, 'I would shiver the whole night through,' Cobain jumps up an octave, forcing him to strain so far he screams and cracks. He hits the word 'shiver' so hard that the band stops, as if a fight broke out at a sitcom wedding. Next he howls the word 'whole' and then does something very strange in the brief silence that follows, something that's hard to describe: He opens his piercingly blue eyes so suddenly it feels like someone or something else is looking out under the bleached lank fringe, with a strange clarity. Then he finishes the song." [...] After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show's producers, who wanted an encore. Cobain refused because he felt he could not top the performance of that song.|$|E

6000|$|The men {{scattered}} by the dissolving contact of {{the land}} came together once more in the shipping office.---"The Narcissus pays off," [...] shouted outside a glazed door a brass-bound old fellow with a crown and the capitals B. T. on his cap. A lot trooped in at once but many were late. The room was large, white-washed, and bare; a counter surmounted by a brass-wire grating fenced off {{a third of the}} dusty space, and behind the grating a pasty-faced clerk, with his hair parted in the middle, had the quick, glittering eyes and the vivacious, jerky movements of a caged bird. Poor Captain Allistoun also in there, and sitting before a little table with piles of gold and notes on it, appeared subdued by his captivity. Another Board of Trade bird was perching on a high stool near the door: an old bird that did not mind the chaff of elated sailors. The crew of the Narcissus, broken up into knots, pushed in the corners. They had new shore togs, smart jackets that looked {{as if they had been}} shaped with an axe, glossy trousers that seemed made of crumpled sheet-iron, collarless flannel shirts, shiny new boots. They tapped on shoulders, button-holed one another, asked:--> [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>sleep</b> last night?" [...] whispered gaily, slapped their thighs with bursts of subdued laughter. Most had clean, radiant faces; only one or two turned up dishevelled and sad; the two-young Norwegians looked tidy, meek, and altogether of a promising material for the kind ladies who patronise the Scandinavian Home. Wamibo, still in his working clothes, dreamed, upright and burly in the middle of the room, and, when Archie came in, woke up for a smile. But the wide-awake clerk called out a name, and the paying-off business began.|$|E
