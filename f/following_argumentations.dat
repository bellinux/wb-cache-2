The agent can be a person or a technical device, such as a robot or a software device for multi-agent communications. It is a type of reasoning used all the time in everyday life and all kinds of technology where autonomous {{reasoning is}} required. Argumentation theorists have identified two kinds of practical reasoning: instrumental practical reasoning that does not explicitly take values into account, and value-based practical reasoning.

40|$|Argumentation {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} {{communications}} and can broadly {{be broken down into}} problem solving (dialectic) and quarrelling (eristic). Techniques used within argumentation can likewise be classified as fact-based (logical), or emotion/audience-based (rhetorical). Modelling arguments on the social web is a challenge for those studying computational argumentation as formal models of argumentation tend to assume a logical argument, whereas argumentation on the social web is often largely rhetorical. To investigate the application of logical versus rhetorical techniques on the social web, we bring together two ontologies used for modelling argumentation and online communities respectively, the Argument Interchange Format and the Semantic Interlinked Online Communities project. We augment these with our own ontology for modelling rhetorical argument, the Argumentation on the Social Web Ontology, and trial our additions by examining three case studies <b>following</b> <b>argumentation</b> on different categories of social media. Finally, we present examples of how rhetorical argumentation is used {{in the context of the}} social web and show that there are clear markers present that can allow for a rudimentary estimate for the classification of a social media post with regards to its contribution to a discussion...|$|R

I will also point out the many and far-reaching consequences if these magnetic photon rays would be confirmed. The discovery of a second kind of light would be a multi-dimensional scientific revolution. It would shake the foundations of modern physics in many ways. It would be experimental evidence of physics beyond the standard theory of particle physics. The standard theory includes the Weinberg-Salam theory from 1967 / 1968 and quantum chromodynamics from 1973. The observation would require {{not only that the}} theory of quantum electrodynamics formulated in 1948 / 1949 has to be extended. It would challenge also the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated in 1927 / 1928. Furthermore, the new kind of light would violate the relativity principle of special relativity from 1905 and would require a symmetrization of Maxwell’s equations from 1873. The existence of the second kind of light was predicted theoretically. It can be understood by the <b>following</b> <b>argumentation...</b>|$|R

In particular however, the results will be used of those few social science studies that have dealt in recent years with issues of the diffusion of information technologies and their impact on labor. Specifically, these are several studies in the psychology of work and a few, especially more recent, reports from the sociology of work and industrial sociology. 1 And finally, the analysis is based on information and production technology studies that deal more or less directly with the question of the consequences of digitization for work. Because of the particularly intensive discussion in Germany over the perspectives on Industry 4.0, these resources are most often original German-language studies. Overall, the studies are directed at both social and macro-structural changes in the labor landscape, as well as possible conversion processes at the micro-level of individual companies and workplaces. As far as possible in the further argumentation these different levels will be taken up analytically in complement to each other.|$|R

The excerpted source material shows how the multitude of receivers designed to be reached by different mass media communication channels and diversity in taste and expectations of audiences makes it possible for journalists to create subjective interpretations of the world. Once created and tailored to the context of the audience, they function in parallel pathways and, should a clash between them ensue, the only outcome is that their rhetorical nature gets even more accentuated. With these circumstances given, what we experience then is a situation when different truths collide, while each of them surfaces within a given context of human conversation and each is validated by its respective audience to be reached and goals to be attained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Extension-based argumentation {{semantics}} {{have been}} shown to be a suitable approach for performing practical reasoning. Since extension-based argumentation semantics were formalized in terms of relationships between atomic arguments, it has been shown that extension-based argumentation semantics (such as the grounded semantics and stable semantics) can be characterized by logic programming semantics with negation as failure. Recently, it has been shown that argumentation semantics such as the preferred semantics and the CF 2 semantics can be characterized in terms of logic programming semantics. In this paper, we make a short overview w. r. t. recent results in the close relationship between extension-based semantics and logic programming semantics with negation as failure. We also show that there is enough evidence to believe that the use of declarative approaches based on logic programming semantics with negation as failure is a practical approach for performing practical reasoning <b>following</b> an <b>argumentation</b> reasoning approach. ...|$|R

Our framework allows one to represent positive and explicitly negative knowledge, as well as uncertainty. Both concepts are used in agent communication languages such as KQML and FIPA ACL. One source of uncertainty in open systems stems from mismatches in parameter and predicate names and missing parameters.

40|$|Recent discussions by Mermin [1] and Stapp [2] in {{this journal}} on non-locality and counterfactuality are shown to contain {{linguistic}} problems that require verification. As such they can at most {{provide us with}} two subjective choices for the meaning of 'counterfactual statements' in quantum mechanics. We shall show that the word 'counterfactual' is in fact inappropriate here and should {{be replaced by the}} word 'hypothetical'. Mermin's choice imposes a strictly contextual meaning based upon an interpretation of counterfactuality which he used to refute, without proof as we shall see, Stapp's logical proof [3] of non-locality in quantum theory. In linguistic theory both authors' choices of meaning: counterfactual versus hypothetical are equally acceptable and therefore some of the issues they discussed lie outside the domain of physics. The issues they discussed are further confused by the fact that in his reply Stapp [2] seems to have adopted Mermin's counterfactual interpretation against his own original [3] hypothetical interpretation. In the rest of this paper we shall adopt the hypothetical sense of Stapp's original statements but we modify his crucial statement LOC 2 appropriately, then <b>following</b> his <b>argumentations,</b> we shall show that there is no conflict between relativity and quantum mechanics. We suggest that this should be the natural (pragmatic) choice of meaning in defining the predictions of events in the Hardy experiment.

Several competing hypotheses are tested. The resource hypothesis, <b>following</b> a supply-side <b>argumentation,</b> posits that relationships generate resources (i. e. social capital) that facilitate exchange with parents; relationship breakup implies resource deprivation and produces strain, which adversely affects the parent-child relationship (spillover hypothesis). Accord-ing to the demand-based compensation hypothesis, horizontal relationships and vertical intergenerational relations are substitutively associated with each other; hence, exchanges between generations should be strongest when children {{are not involved in}} romantic relationships. The analyses yield evidence in line with both the compensation hypothesis (particularly among adolescents) and the spillover hypothesis (among adults). The effects are largely gender neutral...|$|R

Next, we prove the existence of one-way functions contradicts this fact, and thus, they should not exist.

40|$|T. N. Srinivasan While freer trade, or “openness ” in trade, is {{now widely}} {{regarded}} as economically benign, {{in the sense that}} it increases the size of the pie 1, the recent anti-globalization critics have suggested that it is socially malign on several dimensions, among them the question of poverty. 2 Their contention is that trade accentuates not ameliorates, deepens not diminishes, poverty in both the rich and the poor countries. The theoretical and empirical analysis of the impact of freer trade on poverty in the rich and in the poor countries is not symmetric, of course. We focus here therefore only on the latter. But in doing so, we distinguish between two different strands of argumentation: static and dynamic. In the former case, we treat the resources and technology to be given and then ask: how does freer trade affect poverty in this static framework. In the latter case, we admit growth effects that impact on the state of poverty over time. I: Static Arguments The central effect on poverty is assumed to come from the effects on real wages of the unskilled workers, endowed with labor but no human or financial capital. The natural presumption <b>following</b> the Stolper-Samuelson <b>argumentation,</b> would be that, if anything, freer trade should help in the reduction of poverty in the poor countries which use their comparative advantage to export labor-intensive goods.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of {{travelling}} across Estonian-Finnish borders, most widely positioned {{in the field}} of migration, mobility and border-crossing practises. The subjects of travelling are the Estonians who live permanently in Finland for the purpose of work, studies or other reasons and travel regularly to Estonia in order to facilitate lasting transnational connections. Thus, I treat travelling in this study as a necessity, which is a different approach compared to travel as leisure or self-exploration which are part of many other contemporary discourses on travel. Recent critical literature talks against the mystified perception of travel, a product of colonialism, and argues that travel should instead be viewed through its practical manifestations in people’s daily lives. People’s daily practises again, including travelling and border-crossing are culturally, politically, ideologically and economically bounded. For grasping better the travel in a deeply contextualised way I have firstly drawn out geographical, cultural, linguistic, political and economic connections between Estonia and Finland in historical perspective. Subsequently, I concentrate on the period of the communist régime in Estonian history and discuss the practical issues related to travelling abroad in Soviet Estonia. The latter approach is especially useful in my attempt to demystify the travel and border-crossing behind the “Iron Curtain”. The methodological approach to the study is the combination of ethnography and auto-ethnography. The ethnography is based on thematic interviews with travellers, experts on travelling, and observations in the travel settings. Autoethnographic narrations are present, because I have been an active traveller in the Estonian-Finnish borderlands and my own experiences shape considerably the interpretations of the whole phenomenon as presented herein. The Estonian-Finnish border-crossing practises are specifically defined, because the travelling takes place overseas, and usually the means of transportation used is a passenger ferry, which is a central element in the studied ethnographies. The special characteristics of the overseas connections lead the <b>following</b> in-depth <b>argumentations</b> about the meanings and practises of journey today and in the past focussing on the time-distance relations, space-place-nonplace connections, travel functionality, and handling transitions in transnational spaces. 	Finally I show one possible way how to understand the individual’s agency in the everyday-life applications of a travel, which are overwhelmingly moulded by state policies and economic forces. I argue that if the world is organised in global projects then as a parallel there are existent the personal life projects that people try to realise in the best way within the given macro conditions. The manifestations of a travel thus are the negotiations between the global and personal projects. Keywords: travelling, border-crossing, ferry-trip, ethnography, Estonians, Finlan...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{consider}} argumentative discourse in poetry, and {{to attempt to}} detect the arguments in the poetic discourse of the Diwan Group {{in the light of}} their principles, trying to present a different insight into the examination of modern Arabic poetry by exploring its ability to persuade and influence. The study applies the argumentation theory to the Diwan Group’s poetic output by attempting to answer the question of how the three members of the Diwan Group imbued their poems through the process of argumentation. The study aims to reveal the effectiveness of argumentation {{in the structure of the}} group’s poetic discourse considering the presuppositions. This means that the concept of poetry and critical works of the three members of the Diwan Group could be presupposed to be ‘ideal’ and any poetic analysis is made in the light of this concept. In other words, the study highlights the argumentative process in order to illustrate how the Diwan Group’s trend towards the romantic rebelled against the Classical school. By applying the theory of argumentation to the poetic output, it would essentially mean that the poem seeks to create a special meaning through language in the communicative process between the poet and the reader. This process is the essence of the theory of argumentation: to persuade the reader of the argument and to reach the desired result through justification and evidence. As the meaning of each of the selected poems is significant and considerable, this study relies on the pragmatics method, where argumentation itself is an essential branch of pragmatics. The pragmatic approach examines how the purposes of the writer (or speaker) are detected by the receiver. It considers literary works as essential verbal works that have been expanded to encourage the addressee to full persuasion. It can be seen that pragmatics is based on the study of the meaning that the speaker or writer wants to communicate and the listener or reader explains. It is worth noting that both the pragmatic approach and the theory of argumentation endeavour to throw light on the characteristics and implications of literary discourse in different genres, based on communication between two parties. As the title suggests, this study is designed coherently in three parts: The Foundation, the Structure of Argumentation and the Structure of Poetry respectively. Part I includes two chapters; the introductory chapter and the background of both the Group and Theory which considers the dialectic of Argumentation and Poetry. Chapter Three, the first in part II, discusses the Constituents of Argumentation by studying three aspects; the bonds of convergence between Argumentation and Romanticism, repetition and finally, poetic dialogue. Chapter Four covers the Patterns of Argumentation, which are: Syllogism, Fallacy, and thirdly, Argumentation by Example. Chapter Five, the first in part III, conducts a deeper analysis into the common-places where arguments are found, which are Love, Meditation and Nature. Each poetic theme is divided into related arguments. Chapter Six examines Argumentative Images through a theoretical preface concerning the link between imaginary and <b>argumentation,</b> <b>following</b> by the Sources of Argumentative images through Human being, Nature, Religion and Philosophy. Finally, the Functions of images of Wisdom and comparison are examined. Chapter Seven presents the Conclusion, which summarises the most important points deduced from the study and the recommendations made. Finally, as I have studied the group’s poetic material, I have found that one of them can simultaneously be regarded as a poet, writer and critic; and that argumentation was the ideal way for the poets to disseminate their ideas and principles. Moreover, it can concluded that the poetic discourse of the Diwan Group’s focus concerns two aspects: the critical and the poetic. The critical element relies on the poets’ critique (especially that of the revival poets), that clarifies the nature of poetry, and the impact of emotion on it, as well as portraying both Life and Self in various aspects. The poetic discourse that was formed in the first fruits of the 'new poetry' was an attempt to replace Classical poems with another focus that was related to emotion and Romanticism...|$|R
