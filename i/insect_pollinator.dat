Converting natural landscapes to agricultural land, such as oil palm and rubber plantations, affects the insects. The research aims to study diversity and abundance of <b>insect</b> <b>pollinators</b> in three different agricultural land uses, i. e. oil palm plantation, rubber plantation, and jungle-rubber. Scan sampling method was used to explore the diversity of <b>insect</b> <b>pollinators.</b> Observations of the insects were conducted from 08. 00 to 10. 00  AM and 02. 00 to 04. 00 PM in sunny days. There were 497 individuals of <b>insect</b> <b>pollinators</b> collected, which belong to 43 species in three orders (Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera). Number of species and individual of <b>insect</b> <b>pollinators</b> found in rubber plantations (31 species, 212 individuals) and oil palm plantation (23 species, 188 individuals) were higher than that in jungle rubber (7 species, 97 individuals). <b>Insect</b> <b>pollinators</b> in oil palm plantations were dominated by giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) and stingless bee (Trigona sp.

50|$|As California's {{population}} grew, {{especially after}} the gold rush, {{a number of other}} varieties were brought to California by individuals and nurserymen from the East Coast of the United States and from France and England, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century, it became apparent that California had potential for being a great fig-producing state with its Mediterranean climate and a latitude of 38 degrees, lining San Francisco up with Smyrna, Turkey. G. P. Rixford first brought true Smyrna figs to California in 1880. The effort was amplified by the San Francisco Bulletin Company, which sought to bring new varieties from Smyrna to California and distribute the cuttings to the Bulletin's subscribers, with the expectation that the subscribers would report back which varieties were most fit for California or regions of California. In 1881, some 14,000 cuttings were shipped in good condition to California and distributed to Bulletin Company subscribers as promised. However, not one of the trees planted produced a single mature fruit. George Roeding concluded this was due to the lack of pollination since the <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> was not present in California. After a couple of failed attempts, wild fig trees carrying fig wasps were successfully introduced to California on April 6, 1899 to allow for fruit production of Smyrna-type figs.|$|E
40|$|Insect {{pollination}} {{service is}} widely used in agriculture. This pollination service contributes significantly to the total economic value of crop production and can be valued this way. A better economic valuation is be to assess the welfare loss resulting from <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> decline, this welfare loss being the sum of producer and consumer surplus variation. In this study, we {{assess the impact of}} insect pollinators on the social welfare within a general equilibrium analysis. What would be the consequences of a production loss due to an <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> decline considering the adaptation of the overall economy and more particularly considering the possible spillovers on others markets? How are changes in profits distributed between producers of pollinated goods and other producers? These two questions will be studied within two alternative scenarios for the distribution of property rights over the firms: the case where agents possess and equal share of the productive sector (the egalitarian ownership structure) and the case where each agent possess one firm (the polarized ownership structure). For each scenario, we considered two states of the economy. In the first state, agent and firms are homogeneous. In the second state, firms are heterogeneous. The social welfare {{is a function of the}} profile of consumers' utilities weighted by a ratio expressing the social preferences. We will analyze and measure the variation of the social welfare after the <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> decline. Under the egalitarian ownership structure, we found that an <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> decline will cause a social welfare loss. However this loss is reduced by the possibility of agents to consume the good, for which production does not depends on insect pollination. This result no longer holds when the distribution of the property right of firms is heterogeneous between agents. In this case the owner of the firm that does not produce insect pollination dependent good, would experience a gain in utility. As a result, the social welfare could increase after a pollinator decline. This social welfare gain would raise if production function of the firm of the non agricultural sector would be more efficient than the agricultural one. ...|$|E

In landscapes dominated by agriculture, such as those found in Iowa, the availability of mass flowering crop species show strong positive effects on the density of generalist, native pollinators. While soybean, a self-pollinated plant, and corn, a wind pollinated plant, do not require physical pollination for fruit production, they can be a source of nectar and/or pollen for <b>insect</b> <b>pollinators.</b> The first objective is to develop methodology to accurately describe the in-field abundance and diversity of <b>insect</b> <b>pollinators</b> associated cornfields in Iowa.

40|$|Large {{mammalian}} herbivore {{populations in}} Kenya are declining in numbers because of habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss. Hunting practices {{are also a}} contributing factor. The loss of large mammalian herbivores can have cascading effects in an ecosystem. Interactions between large mammalian herbivores and plants are well known and widely studied, as well as interactions between flowers and their insect pollinators. However, the indirect effects of large mammalian herbivores on insect pollinators have not been as widely studied. This thesis examines the indirect effects that large mammalian herbivores have on insect pollinators. In order to do this, I conducted research at the Mpala Research Centre in Kenya collecting insect pollinators and recording flower species in different herbivore exclosures spanning a wide aridity gradient. These data show that <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> communities respond directly to flower communities, in addition to any direct effects herbivory and rainfall have on insect communities. These results suggest that large mammalian herbivores and rainfall {{have a significant effect}} on insect community composition, both through their direct effect on <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> communities and through their effect on flower communities.

40|$|Insect {{pollination}} {{constitutes an}} ecosystem service of global importance, providing significant economic and aesthetic benefits {{as well as}} cultural value to human society, alongside vital ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems. It is therefore important to understand how <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> populations and communities respond to rapidly changing environments {{if we are to}} maintain healthy and effective pollinator services. This chapter considers the importance of conserving pollinator diversity to maintain a suite of functional traits and provide a diverse set of pollinator services. We explore how we can better understand and mitigate the factors that threaten <b>insect</b> <b>pollinator</b> richness, placing our discussion within the context of populations in predominantly agricultural landscapes in addition to urban environments. We highlight a selection of important evidence gaps, with a number of complementary research steps that can be taken to better understand: (i) the stability of pollinator communities in different landscapes in order to provide diverse pollinator services; (ii) how we can study the drivers of population change to mitigate the effects and support stable sources of pollinator services and (iii) how we can manage habitats in complex landscapes to support insect pollinators and provide sustainable pollinator services for the future. We advocate a collaborative effort to gain higher quality abundance data to understand the stability of pollinator populations and predict future trends. In addition, for effective mitigation strategies to be adopted, researchers need to conduct rigorous field testing of outcomes under different landscape settings, acknowledge the needs of end-users when developing research proposals and consider effective methods of knowledge transfer to ensure effective uptake of actions...|$|E

Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application.
