5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's {{residence}} at 11a.m. looking for evidence, {{and found a}} blood-smeared shirt {{at the bottom of}} a burn barrel. The blood was smeared <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E

50|$|Allobates chalcopis was {{originally}} described from forested ravines of Mount Pelée at {{an elevation of}} about 500 m asl. Extensive search in 2011 failed to spot the species in this habitat, but it was discovered <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the mountain, at about 800 - 1400 m asl, that is, to {{the summit of the}} mountain. The current range starts from the transition zone between forest and savanna, the latter being the vegetation type found <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the mountain.|$|R

25|$|Of {{particular}} concern to Zille was the government's response to alarming crime statistics released in July 2007. She has accused {{the national government}} of rewarding criminals by placing individuals convicted of serious crimes <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> their national parliamentary lists. Zille {{has said that the}} DA would reinstate child protection units, the South African Narcotics Bureau and the Scorpions unit, all of which have been disbanded.|$|E
25|$|The same snails {{that some}} people raise or gather as food also are {{agricultural}} pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably {{due in part to}} the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> trees.|$|E
25|$|The alpine {{tree line}} {{boundary}} is seldom abrupt: it usually forms a transition zone between closed forest below and treeless alpine tundra above. This {{zone of transition}} occurs “near {{the top of the}} tallest peaks in the northeastern United States, <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the giant volcanoes in central Mexico, and on mountains in each of the 11 western states and throughout much of Canada and Alaska”. Environmentally dwarfed shrubs (krummholz) commonly forms the upper limit.|$|E

25|$|On 11 May 1996 eight climbers {{died after}} several expeditions {{were caught in}} a {{blizzard}} <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the mountain. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche. The disaster gained wide publicity and {{raised questions about the}} commercialisation of climbing Mount Everest.|$|E
25|$|When the Scandinavian hero Arrow-Odd, in a 13th-century Icelandic tale, {{finds his}} path {{blocked by a}} deep gorge, he is lifted into the air by an eagle and carried to the eagle's nest <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a sea cliff. Soon, a giant appears in a stone boat and rows up to the nest. Arrow-Odd is taken by this giant to Giantland where he spends some time, before {{continuing}} an extraordinary life that is destined to last for three hundred years.|$|E
25|$|In 1826, {{a severe}} drought forced farmers to collect {{water from the}} Monk's Well in Kilmaurs, a spring never known to be dry. They drove their carts along the dry bed of the Carmel to catch the water, which poured from an exit <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the wall.

At this point if you wish to visit the church and village you must walk south into the village and then retrace your footsteps back to rejoin the Paston Way.|$|E
25|$|Unsurprisingly, {{security}} and fire protection were major concerns. Horrea were frequently built with very thick walls (as much as 1 m / 3ft thick) {{to reduce the}} danger of fire, and the windows were always narrow and placed <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the wall to deter theft. Doors were protected with elaborate systems of locks and bolts. Even the largest horrea usually only had two or three external doors, which were often quite narrow {{and would not have}} permitted the entrance of carts. The arduous task of moving goods into, out of and around horrea was most probably carried out by manual labour alone; the biggest horrea would thus have had an enormous staff of labourers.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Whymper, {{weary of}} the defeats he had {{sustained}} on the south-west ridge, tried a new way. The stratification of the rocks on the east face seemed to him favourable, and the slope not excessive. His plan of attack was complicated: a huge rock couloir, the base of which lies on the Italian side below the Breuiljoch, on the little Matterhorn glacier, would be ascended to a point <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Furggen ridge; from there, traversing the east face of the mountain, he meant to reach the Hörnli (north-east) ridge and follow it to the summit. However, when this route was attempted, the mountain discharged an avalanche of stone upon the climbers, and the ascent failed. His guides refused to make any further attempts by this route.|$|E

25|$|In early 1944, a Dornier Do 217 crashed <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Vehner moor in Lower Saxony, between Osnabrück and Oldenburg, and it {{was decided}} to send the V11 to recover the wreckage. Unfortunately the V11 ended up {{crashing}} nearby before it could attempt to lift the Do 217's remains. It was then decided to attempt to recover both using the V14. Flown by Karl Bode and Luftwaffe helicopter pilot Helmut Gerstenhauer, the operation was begun on 11 May 1944. A small team of Focke-Achgelis men and a Luftwaffe recovery company had already dismantled the V11, and the V14 made 10 flights carrying loads beneath it in a cargo net and setting them down where they could be loaded onto road vehicles. All the major parts of the V11 and the Do 217 were retrieved, and much useful experience was gained.|$|E
25|$|The joyous {{celebration of}} February {{takes on a}} somber mood as the liturgical {{calendar}} moves on to Cuaresma or Lent. In Santa Maria, the solemn commemoration begins not on Palm Sunday but a week before that. The Church of La Purisima Concepcion holds the annual Solemne Septenario or seven-day devotion in honor of La Virgen Esperanza. It ends on Viernes de Dolores or the Friday before Palm Sunday. The highlight of the feast is the Misa Pontifical followed by the besamanos or kissing of the Virgin's hand {{in the morning and}} the Procession of the Virgen Macarena under palio in the evening which is known as Via Matris. During this procession, the Virgin makes seven stops to specific houses and <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a balcony, a tenor and a soprano sing the dialogue of Christ and the Virgin. They are assisted by a choir and a brass band.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E
