5|$|In {{terms of}} entertainment, raptors {{have been used}} in falconry, while cagebirds have been <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> their song. Other birds have been raised for the {{traditional}} sports of cockfighting and pigeon racing. Birdwatching, too, has grown to become a major leisure activity.|$|E
5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp.

Rutherford <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are raised}} {{for a wide}} variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, isinglass and rennet. Animals are also <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E
5|$|As a prisoner, he battled starvation, {{receiving}} {{only a small}} meal of mush {{served in}} a tin cup—a utensil he <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of his}} life. With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in calisthenics to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E

5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> baiting in Europe at least since the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% {{of the animal}} protein eaten by the world's human population {{in the form of}} meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> their feathers, and for leather from their skin.|$|E

There she began working on her first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. In 1993, she was hired by Simon & Schuster in Cambridge to edit cookbooks, a job she <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> the next ten years.|$|E

From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> use for a cement factory. Until 2001 only the three first kilometers (two first miles) of the line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all traffic on the line.|$|E

5|$|Hispanic Americans, also {{referred}} to as Latinos, served in all elements of the American armed forces in the war. They fought in every major American battle in the war. Between 250,000 and 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II, {{out of a total of}} 12,000,000, constituting 2.3% to 4.7% of the U.S. Armed Forces. The exact number is unknown as, at the time, Hispanics were not tabulated separately, but were generally included in the general white population census count.

5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial shark fisheries, dusky sharks are also caught as bycatch on longlines meant for tuna and swordfish (and usually <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of dusky sharks, mostly juveniles, are caught by sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia. This shark was {{once one of}} the most important species in the Florida trophy shark tournaments, before the population collapsed.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} to be a dovecote took place around 1780. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> their eggs, flesh, and dung. Although {{it is now}} a roofless ruin with some of the windows blocked up, it previously had a chimney and the fireplace can still be seen. The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets, whose family seat was at Stourhead, in 1915. The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building (Grade II*) in 1961.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of the dovecote was in 1393 although the exact date of construction is not known. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875. The manor previously belonged to Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, founded between 1078 and 1102 {{although it is not}} known if the construction of the dovecote was undertaken by the priory or the Lovel family who later held the manor.

5|$|The first {{poultry breed}} {{to have its}} own {{specialist}} club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to poultry exhibition standards not long after their establishment. Today, they are among the most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay tiny, white eggs and are not <b>kept</b> <b>for</b> meat production.|$|E
