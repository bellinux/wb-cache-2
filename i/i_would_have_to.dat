25|$|In 1939, I {{was officially}} demanded {{to join the}} National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea). The {{technical}} work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.|$|E

500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> conform to standard. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put up the shutters... And so I came to the Second Test in Sydney ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman.|$|E

[...] "I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block because now <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live up to something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but {{at the same time}} I thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E

[...] Spielberg and Lucas attributed the film's tone, which was darker than Raiders of the Lost Ark, to their personal moods following the breakups of their relationships (George with his wife, and Spielberg with his girlfriend).

Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of Enterprise due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to The Original Series, such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode [...] "Space Seed" [...] and later in the 1982 film, [...] The first episode of this Enterprise story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of Star Trek, [...] "". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, [...] "What I really wanted to do this season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see. You know, as a fan of the original series, if I heard that they were doing the Orion slavers and the Eugenics Wars, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be in front of that TV." ...|$|E

When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical.

500|$|In the 1956 season, Feller started {{four games}} and {{appeared}} in 15 others, {{and finished with}} an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97ERA. The Indians held [...] "Bob Feller Night" [...] on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance.

She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.

He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy.
