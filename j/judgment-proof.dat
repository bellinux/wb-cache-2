The deterrence goal is undermined because, irrespective of the liability rule, <b>judgment-proof</b> tortfeasors will not fully internalize the costs of the accidents they cause. The insurance goal will be undermined {{to the extent that the}} <b>judgment-proof</b> tortfeasor will not be able to compensate fully its victims and that first-party insurance markets do not provide an adequate response.

This is because when a <b>judgment-proof</b> tortfeasor has purchased liability insurance, not only the tortfeasor 2 ̆ 7 s assets but also the assets of the insurance company can potentially be used to compensate tort victims. However, because virtually all liability insurance policies contain policy limits and because only some liability insurance policyholders have sufficient assets to cover tort judgments that exceed those policy limits, some liability insureds will nevertheless be <b>judgment-proof...</b>|$|E

Of course, indigent persons would be <b>judgment-proof</b> even without these rules, because they have so few assets and so little income.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{delegation}} {{of activities that}} pose serious risks to {{health and the environment}} in an economy regulated by strict liability schemes. Strict liability induces <b>judgment-proof</b> possibilities. Two civil liability regimes are then compared: a strict liability scheme and a capped strict liability one. The argument is led under a twofold asymmetric information assumption between the principal and the agent: the efficiency level in effort for safety and the agent’s level of wealth. The paper shows that standard strict liability under information asymmetries deters the efficient agent to compete and favors adverse selection. Then, under conditions, a capped strict liability regime is a better regime than a standard strict liability one because it induces the efficient agent to supply the level of safety effort equivalent to the first best solution. The counterpart is the perception of an informational rent by the efficient agent. At the optimum, this rent is minimized by the efficient contract supplied by the principal.

40|$|An {{important}} contribution of economics to public policy {{rests on the}} precept that price signals should force producers of externalities to internalize the welfare of other economic agents.

In fact, use of penalty multipliers further strengthens the case for joint use. ...|$|E

This chapter shows that vicarious liability, the current rule governing organizations’ liability for their agents’ torts, does not satisfy these objectives. By holding organizations liable for torts committed by employees, but not by independent contractors, vicarious liability discourages organizations from asserting direct control over agents, even when control is {{an efficient way to}} regulate care.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} how {{the duty}} to settle, which requires liability insurers to pay damages awarded against their insured {{in excess of the}} policy limits when the insurers reject a reasonable settlement offer within the limits, may have indirectly led certain of their insureds [...] small business recreational vendors like horse riding stables or some motels offering swimming pools with diving boards [...] to sanitize the recreational activities they offer. More generally, {{the duty to}} settle 2 ̆ 7 s effect on the lawsuits injured customers brought against small business recreational vendors may have led a wide variety of such vendors to sanitize activities the vendors previously offered in a manner that disassociates the activities from the most severe injuries, but leaves them less enjoyable for many. This paper 2 ̆ 7 s scope is narrow. In sum, the duty to settle helps the severely injured plaintiff, or, more precisely, any plaintiff whose suit might result in a larger judgment, bargain for the limits of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s liability insurance. The duty to settle achieves this effect by making it harder for the small business defendant and its liability insurer to exploit the advantages that arise from the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>judgment-proof</b> status. The liability insurer can no longer take advantage of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>judgment-proof</b> status and of the ceiling that imposes upon the best possible outcome for a plaintiff continuing to litigate. In the absence of the duty to settle, or of some other method for giving plaintiffs access to unlimited liability insurance, the plaintiffs understandably resign themselves to bargaining down from those limits. By undermining the effect of those limits, the duty to settle dramatically increases the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s exposure, especially for severe injuries, and, hence, leads the insurer to pressure its insured to alter its activities so as to reduce the chance, for whatever reason, of a customer suffering a severe injury...|$|E

40|$|For two reasons, the {{conventional}} wisdom is that the poor are not heavy users of the insolvency system. First, creditors are reluctant to extend credit to the poor because the risks of non-payment are high. Not having been able to borrow, the poor are not over-indebted and are therefore not in need of bankruptcy protection. Second, some poor debtors - lone parents on social assistance for example - are <b>judgment-proof</b> meaning that judgments for money recoveries obtained by their creditors are of no effect because these debtors do not have sufficient non-exempt property or income to satisfy the judgment. Developments in two areas may challenge {{the conventional}} view. Undoubtedly, credit is now widely available across the spectrum of income groups. Even a short-term, low-wage job can bring a credit card to the doorstep of the poor and the slogan no credit, no problem testifies to the availability of retail credit. In addition, we now know that poverty is often a temporary state for many Canadians, with many moving in and out of low-income. Accordingly, the <b>judgment-proof</b> state is not a permanent condition, but a temporary status for many. While this may be welcome news in some respects, it means that debts can be accumulated during periods of relative economic well-being only to go unpaid when a job ends or when hard times return. These developments suggest the possibility that some of those who are poor at any point in time are in fact in need of bankruptcy protection. They have debts that they are unable to pay and little likelihood of being able to repay in the near future. We begin the paper by presenting evidence from the 1999 Survey of Financial Security on indebtedness among families in the lower income deciles. We then turn to the main question: should the Canadian bankruptcy process be more readily available to poor debtors. We draw on two sources to shed light on this question: a) a comparative analysis (considering England and Wales, the United States, Australia and New Zealand) and b) a series of semi-structured interviews with Canadian bankruptcy trustees and other insolvency professionals...|$|E
40|$|We {{survey the}} {{theoretical}} and empirical literature on the law and economics of liability insurance. The canonical Shavell model predicts that, {{despite the presence of}} some ex ante moral hazard (care-reduction by insureds), liability insurance will generally raise welfare because its risk-spreading gains will likely be larger than its adverse effects on precautionary activities. We discuss the numerous features of liability insurance contracts that are designed to reduce ex ante moral hazard, and examine the evidence of their effects. Most studies conclude that these features work reasonably well, so that liability insurance probably does not generate substantial ex ante moral hazard. Its effects on ex post moral hazard (the increased tendency of victims to sue in the presence of insurance) are not as clear, however, and the welfare consequences of increased litigation are ambiguous, for reasons we explain. We discuss additional issues such as the effects of liability insurance when some defendants are <b>judgment-proof,</b> the problems posed by non-independence of liability risks owing to changes in legal doctrines, and the cyclical nature of liability insurance markets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{literature}} on corporate crime {{has focused on}} crimes committed by employees who are not necessarily acting {{in the interest of}} the firm. In this setting it is clear employees should be sanctioned; the question is whether the firm should be as well. The recent wave of corporate scandals has a different character: in many of these cases, the crime serves firm owners ' direct interest; employees commit crimes only in response to incentives provided by the firm. In this latter setting it is clear the firm should be sanctioned; the question is whether employees should be as well.

40|$|This is {{a survey}} of legal {{liability}} for accidents. Three general aspects of accident liability are addressed. The first {{is the effect of}} liability on incentives, both whether to engage in activities (for instance, whether to drive) and how much care to exercise (at what speed to travel) to reduce risk when so doing. The second general aspect concerns risk-bearing and insurance, for the liability system acts as an implicit insurer for accident victims and it imposes risk on potential injurers (because they may have to pay judgments to victims). In this regard, victims' accident insurance and injurers' liability insurance are taken into account. The third general aspect of accident liability is its administrative expense, comprising the cost of legal services, the value of litigants' time, and the operating cost of the courts. A range of subtopics are considered, including product liability, causation, punitive damages, the <b>judgment-proof</b> problem, vicarious liability, and nonpecuniary harm.

40|$|Veil-piercing is an {{equitable}} remedy. This simple insight {{has been lost}} over time. What started {{as a means for}} corporate creditors to reach into the personal assets of a shareholder has devolved into a doctrinal black hole. Courts apply an expansive list of amorphous factors, attenuated from the underlying harm, that engenders under-inclusive, unprincipled, and unpredictable results for entrepreneurs, litigants, and scholars alike. Veil-piercing is misapplied because it is misconceived. The orthodox approach is to view veil-piercing as an exception to limited liability that is justified potentially only when the latter is not, a path that invariably leads to examining scenarios based on different types of creditors/claims, corporations, and shareholders. But the occasion to seek derivative relief from a shareholder arises only when a claim cannot be enforced against a defendant corporation. Veil-piercing is thus a secondary remedy, detached from limited liability and its rationales. To fix veil-piercing, corporate law must look beyond itself. For centuries the law of restitution has featured the constructive trust, {{an equitable}} remedy that disgorges misappropriated assets from unjustifiably enriched parties. This Article novelly re-conceives veil-piercing as constructive trust and demonstrates how its application to <b>judgment-proof</b> corporations can yield more coherent and effective results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the conditions for}} setting up strict civil liability schemes. For that it compares the social efficiency of two main civil liability regimes usually enforced to protect the environment: the strict liability regime and the “capped strict liability scheme”. First, {{it shows that the}} regulator faces an effective dilemma when he has to enforce one of these schemes. This because the social cost of a severe harm (and the associated optimum care effort) is determined independently of any liability regime. This independency has economic consequences. First, victims and polluters pit one against another about the liability regime that the government should enforce. Hence, financially constrained polluters prefer the ceiling of responsibilities while victims wish to extend the amount of redress under a “standard” strict liability. Economic criteria for enforcing a regime rather than another one are lacking. Second, the paper shows that implementing civil strict liability rules may be done by setting up care standards as for instance in the nuclear or the maritime sectors and demanding to the injurers to comply with them. We show that this goal can be achieved by resorting to some friendly monitoring corresponding to frequent random controls with low fines rather than few controls that should involve heavy fines.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} and justifies {{a revised}} {{formulation of the}} unilateral accident model based on relaxing two assumptions of the standard model: the precaution function and the harm function. The revised model is, therefore, more general and corresponds better to various situations. A resulting trait of the generalized model is its account for {{the interaction between the}} injurer's care and activity levels, which was implicitly assumed away so far. The revised model is examined using a few standard issues in tort and the analysis brings new results and insights for the unilateral accident case. For example, the view that, under a negligence regime, due care can be defined regardless of the optimal level of activity holds under very restrictive assumptions. In general, due care must be defined simultaneously with the optimal activity level. In addition, the common view suggests that underestimation of the level of actual damages under strict liability would induce injurers to take insufficient care and to engage excessively in a risky activity (and vice versa, for overestimation). This paper shows that underestimation of actual damages may counter-intuitively lead to insufficient activity or excessive care levels. Similarly, the results of underestimating harm under a negligence regime prove to be different than commonly thought. In addition, the revised model questions the intuitive similarity between the underestimation of harm and the <b>judgment-proof</b> problem, and provides some new results for the latter problem.

40|$|With the {{new wave}} of claims against {{corporations}} for human rights violations – particularly in the context of aiding and abetting government abuse – there are unusually difficult problems of joint tortfeasor liability. In many circumstances, one tortfeasor – the corporation – is a deep-pocketed defendant, easily subject to suit, but only marginally involved in the unlawful conduct. Another tortfeasor – the sovereign – is a central player in the unlawful conduct, but, with limited exceptions, is immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. A third tortfeasor – the low-level security personnel – accused of actually committing the atrocity, is beyond the jurisdictional reach of the forum and is an insolvent, <b>judgment-proof</b> defendant. How should an adjudicator apportion responsibility among these joint tortfeasors? Does it matter that the principal players are immune or insolvent, while the marginal player is not? In apportioning responsibility, is it relevant that one tortfeasor simply knew of the misconduct or was negligent with respect to its likely occurrence, although it did not intend for the violation to occur? Despite the saliency of these questions, international law does not provide the answers. These problems are only exacerbated by the fact that international law violations can be pursued in multiple arenas – in national courts, international tribunals, and international arbitral bodies. As a general rule, international tribunals will resolve the question of apportioning liability using public international law, while domestic courts will resolve the question by recourse to private international law, and arbitral panels will rely on the governing law of the contract. The approach for resolving questions of apportionment will differ in these contexts, although each will resort to domestic tort law in one way or another...|$|E
40|$|The Article {{proceeds}} as follows. Part II {{offers a}} primer on the Coase Theorem, {{beginning with the}} classic case of neighbor externalizing on neighbor (farmer and rancher), and it explains the basic invariance propositions. Part III shifts the focus to Coasean situations involving buyers and sellers in a market or contractual relationship, buyers and sellers whose market interactions cause harm to third parties. Using supply-and-demand diagrams, we illustrate (in a new way) {{some of the most}} basic findings of the economic analysis of law, including both the Coasean invariance and efficiency propositions and the Calabresian least-cost avoider idea. Also in Part III we make an efficiency argument for vicarious employer liability for employee torts and suggest this doctrine in theory could be expanded in certain situations to (1) independent contractors and (2) torts beyond the scope of employment. Our analysis builds on the standard law and economics analysis of vicarious liability, but emphasizes the need to minimize not only the costs of third-party harms but also administrative costs. Part IV then moves from torts to tax-specifically, to taxes triggered by buyer/seller market relationships, such as employer/employee interactions. That Part uses supply-and-demand curves to illustrate the tax remittance invariance propositions in their classic form, as found in every public finance textbook, under the assumptions of zero (or symmetrical) compliance and administrative costs. Part IV then uses those same diagrams to explain how the invariance propositions no longer apply under the more realistic assumptions of asymmetric compliance and administrative costs. More specifically, we show that the optimal assignment of tax remittance responsibility (as between buyer and seller) turns on which assignment minimizes the sum of compliance and administrative costs incurred to raise a given amount of revenue. We argue that, in general, the least-overall cost tax remitter, for taxes triggered by buyer/seller transactions, will be the larger, wealthier party-both because there are economies of scale to enforcement against large tax remitter 2 ̆ 7 s and because wealthier taxpayers {{are less likely to be}} <b>judgment-proof.</b> Part V discusses some of the real-world implications of our analysis, both normative and positive. As a positive matter, our analysis provides an explanation for why the U.

Likewise, our analysis explains why the remittance obligation for sales taxes is usually imposed on sellers rather than buyers. In addition, our framework explains why tax remittance obligations are generally made mandatory (or nontransferable) in the sense that Coasean bargaining over the tax remittance obligation is not permitted. Finally, our analysis also helps to explain why the remittance obligation for the gift tax is imposed, initially, on the donor and, secondarily, on the donee...|$|E
