60|$|But to digress {{no further}} from the {{consideration}} of the Phænomena, more immediately explicable by this Experiment, we shall proceed to shew, That, as to the rising of Water in a <b>Filtre,</b> the reason {{of it will be}} manifest to him, that does take notice, that a <b>Filtre</b> is constituted of a great number of small long solid bodies, which lie so close together, that the Air in its getting in between them, doth lose of its pressure that it has against the Fluid without them, by which means the Water or Liquor not finding so strong a resistance between them as is able to counter-ballance the pressure on its superficies without, is raised upward, till it meet with a pressure of the Air which is able to hinder it. And as to the Rising of Oyl, melted Tallow, Spirit of Wine, &c. in the Week of a Candle or Lamp, it is evident, that it differs in nothing from the former, save only in this, that in a <b>Filtre</b> the Liquor descends and runs away by another part; and in the Week the Liquor is dispersed and carried away by the Flame; something there is ascribable to the Heat, for that it may rarifie the more volatil and spirituous parts of those combustible Liquors, and so being made lighter then the Air, it maybe protruded upwards by that more ponderous fluid body in the Form of Vapours; but this can be ascribed to the ascension of but a very little, and most likely of that only which ascends without the Week. As for the Rising of it in a Spunge, Bread, Cotton, &c. above the superficies of the subjacent Liquor, what has been said about the <b>Filtre</b> (if considered) will easily suggest a reason, considering that all these bodies abound with small holes or pores.|$|E
60|$|This {{therefore}} being thus explained, {{there will}} be divers Phænomena explicable thereby, as, the rising of Liquors in a <b>Filtre,</b> the rising of Spirit of Wine, Oyl, melted Tallow, &c. in the Week of a Lamp, (though made of small Wire, Threeds of Asbestus, Strings of Glass, or the like) the rising of Liquors in a Spunge, piece of Bread, Sand, &c. perhaps also the ascending of the Sap in Trees and Plants, through their small, {{and some of them}} imperceptible pores, (of which I have said more, on another occasion) at least the passing of it out of the earth into their roots. And indeed upon the consideration of this Principle, multitudes of other uses of it occurr'd to me, which I have not yet so well examined and digested as to propound for Axioms, but only as Queries and Conjectures which may serve as hints toward some further discoveries.|$|E
60|$|And {{that we may}} {{the better}} finde what the cause of Congruity and Incongruity in bodies is, it will be {{requisite}} to consider, First, what {{is the cause of}} fluidness; And this, I conceive, to be nothing else but a certain pulse or shake of heat; for Heat being nothing else but a very brisk and vehement agitation of the parts of a body (as I have elswhere made probable) the parts of a body are thereby made so loose from one another, that they easily move any way, and become fluid. That I may explain this a little by a gross Similitude, let us suppose a dish of sand set upon some body that is very much agitated, and shaken with some quick and strong vibrating motion, as on a Milstone turn'd round upon the under stone very violently whilst it is empty; or on a very stiff Drum-head, which is vehemently or very nimbly beaten with the Drumsticks. By this means, the sand in the dish, which before lay like a dull and unactive body, becomes a perfect fluid; and ye can no sooner make a hole in it with your finger, but it is immediately filled up again, and the upper surface of it levell'd. Nor can you bury a light body, as a piece of Cork under it, but it presently emerges or swims as 'twere on the top; nor can you lay a heavier on the top of it, as a piece of Lead, but it is immediately buried in Sand, and (as 'twere) sinks to the bottom. Nor can you make a hole {{in the side of the}} Dish, but the sand shall run out of it to a level, not an obvious property of a fluid body, as such, but this dos imitate; and all this meerly caused by the vehement agitation of the conteining vessel; for by this means, each sand becomes to have a vibrative or dancing motion, so as no other heavier body can rest on it, unless sustein'd by some other on either side: Nor will it suffer any Body to be beneath it, unless it be a heavier then it self. Another Instance of the strange loosening nature of a violent jarring Motion, or a strong and nimble vibrative one, we may have from a piece of iron grated on very strongly with a file: for if into that a pin screw'd so firm and hard, that though it has a convenient head to it, yet it can by no means be unscrew'd by the fingers; if, I say, you attempt to unscrew this whilst grated on by the file, it will be found to undoe and turn very easily. The first of these Examples manifests, how a body actually divided into small parts, becomes a fluid. And the latter manifests by what means the agitation of heat so easily loosens and unties the parts of solid and firm bodies. Nor need we suppose heat to be any thing else, besides such a motion; for supposing we could Mechanically produce such a one quick and strong enough, we need not spend fuel to melt a body. Now, that I do not speak this altogether groundless, I must refer the Reader to the Observations I have made upon the shining sparks of Steel, for there he shall find that the same effects are produced upon small chips or parcels of Steel by the flame, and by a quick and violent motion; and if the body of steel may be thus melted (as I there shew it may) I think we have little reason to doubt that almost any other may not also. Every Smith can inform one how quickly both his File and the Iron grows hot with filing, and if you rub almost any two hard bodies together, they will do the same: And we know, that a sufficient degree of heat causes fluidity, in some bodies much sooner, and in others later; that is, the parts of the body of some are so loose from one another, and so unapt to cohere, and so minute and little, that a very small degree of agitation keeps them always in the state of fluidity. Of this kind, I suppose, the Æther, that is the medium or fluid body, in which all other bodies do as it were swim and move; and particularly, the Air, which seems nothing else but a kind of tincture or solution of terrestrial and aqueous particles dissolv'd into it, and agitated by it, just as the tincture of Cocheneel is nothing but some finer dissoluble parts of that Concrete lick'd up or dissolv'd by the fluid water. And from this Notion of it, we may easily give a more Intelligible reason how the Air becomes so capable of Rarefaction and Condensation. For, as in tinctures, one grain of some strongly tinging substance may sensibly colour some hundred thousand grains of appropriated Liquors, so as every drop of it has its proportionate share, and be sensibly ting'd, as I have try'd both with Logwood and Cocheneel: And as some few grains of Salt is able to infect as great a quantity, as may be found by præcipitations, though not so easily by the sight or taste; so the Air, which seems to be but as 'twere a tincture or saline substance, dissolv'd and agitated by the fluid and agil Æther, may disperse and expand it self into a vast space, if it have room enough, and infect, as it were, every part of that space. But, as on the other side, if there be but some few grains of the liquor, it may extract all the colour of the tinging substance, and may dissolve all the Salt, and thereby become much more impregnated with those substances, so may all the air that sufficed in a rarfy'd state to fill some hundred thousand spaces of Æther, be compris'd in only one, but in a position proportionable dense. And though we have not yet found out such strainers for Tinctures and Salts as we have for the Air, being yet unable to separate them from their dissolving liquors by any kind of <b>filtre,</b> without præcipitation, as we are able to separate the Air from the Æther by Glass, and several other bodies. And though we are yet unable and ignorant of the ways of præcipitating Air out of the Æther as we can Tinctures, and Salts out of several dissolvents; yet neither of these seeming impossible from the nature of the things, nor so improbable but that some happy future industry may find out ways to effect them; nay, further, since we find that Nature does really perform (though by what means we are not certain) both these actions, namely, by præcipitating the Air in Rain and Dews, and by supplying the Streams and Rivers of the World with fresh water, strain'd through secret subterraneous Caverns: And since, that in very many other proprieties they do so exactly seem of the same nature; till further observations or tryals do inform us of the contrary, we may safely enough conclude them of the same kind. For it seldom happens that any two natures have so many properties coincident or the same, as I have observ'd Solutions and Air to have, and to be different in the rest. And therefore I think it neither impossible, irrational, nay nor difficult to be able to predict what is likely to happen in other particulars also, besides those which Observation or Experiment have declared thus or thus; especially, if the circumstances that do often very much conduce to the variation of the effects be duly weigh'd and consider'd. And indeed, were there not a probability of this, our inquiries would be endless, our tryals vain, and our greatest inventions would be nothing but the meer products of chance, and not of Reason; and, like Mariners in an Ocean, destitute both of a Compass and the sight of the Celestial guids, we might indeed, by chance, Steer directly towards our desired Port, but 'tis a thousand to one but we miss our aim. But to proceed, we may hence also give a plain reason, how the Air comes to be darkned by clouds, &c. which are nothing but a kind of precipitation, and how those precipitations fall down in Showrs. Hence also could I very easily, and I think truly, deduce the cause of the curious sixangular figures of Snow, and the appearances of Haloes, &c. and the sudden thickning of the Sky with Clouds, and the vanishing and disappearing of those Clouds again; for all these things may be very easily imitated in a glass of liquor, with some slight Chymical preparations as I have often try'd, and may somewhere else more largely relate, but have not now time to set them down. But to proceed, there are other bodies that consist of particles more Gross, and of a more apt figure for cohesion, and this requires somewhat greater agitation; such, I suppose [Mercury], fermented vinous Spirits, several Chymical Oils, which are much of kin to those Spirits, &c. Others yet require a greater, as water, and so others much greater, for almost infinite degrees: For, I suppose there are very few bodies in the world that may not be made aliquatenus fluid, by some or other degree of agitation or heat.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe images {{acquired}} by a Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (POLSAR) {{are characterized by}} an inherentmultiplicative noise called speckle. It corrupts both the amplitude and the phase, which complicates data interpretation,degrades segmentation performance and reduces target detectability. Hence, we need to preprocess the images byadaptive filtering methods before their analysis. In this paper, we present the Lee Sigma filter and its two enhanced versions {{that are based on}} knowledge of the radarprobability density. The Sigma filter uses the calculation of the local mean from the pixels included in a two-Sigmainterval. The improved Sigma filter is based on the estimation of the Minimum Mean Square Error MMSE. Theimproved Sigma filter with strong scatterer detection is based on the point targets preservation and application of theMMSE on the pixels of image. The methods are applied on three polarimetric images (HH, HV, VV) {{acquired by}} the ESAR sensor corresponding tothe area located in Oberpfaffenhofen, in Munich, Germany, and on the bi - polarization images acquired by theENVISAT satellite corresponding to the region of Oran in Algeria, and on the fully polarimetric images acquired by theRADARSAT- 2 satellite on the area of Algiers, Algeria. Les images acquises par les systèmes radar SAR polarimétrique (POLSAR) sont caractérisées par la présence d'un bruit nommé bruit de chatoiement ou speckle. Ce dernier, de nature multiplicative, corrompt à la fois l'amplitude des images et la phase, ce qui complique l'interprétation des données, dégrade la performance de segmentation et réduit la détectabilité des cibles. D'où la nécessité de prétraiter les images par des méthodes de filtrage adaptées, avant de procéder à leur analyse. Dans cet article, nous présentons le <b>filtre</b> Sigma de Lee et ses deux versions améliorées qui se basent sur la connaissance de la densité de probabilité du signal radar. Le <b>filtre</b> Sigma utilise le calcul de la moyenne locale à partir des pixels compris dans un intervalle de valeur égale à deux-Sigma. Le <b>filtre</b> Sigma amélioré repose sur l'estimation de l'erreur quadratique moyenne minimale EQMM (MMSE : Minimum Mean Square Error). Le <b>filtre</b> Sigma amélioré avec détection de forts diffuseurs se base sur la préservation des points fortement réfléchis et l'application de l'EQMM sur les pixels de l'image. Les méthodes sont appliquées sur trois images polarimétriques (HH, HV, VV) acquises par le capteur ESAR correspondant à la zone d'Oberpfaffenhofen, de Munich en Allemagne, sur des images d'Oran en Algérie en bi-polarisations acquises par le satellite ENVISAT, ainsi que sur des images totalement polarimétriques d'Alger, Algérie, acquises par le satellite RADARSAT- 2. Mots clés : Images POLSAR, filtrage de chatoiement, polarimétrie, <b>filtre</b> de Lee adaptatif, <b>filtre</b> Sigma de Lee, <b>filtre</b> Sigma amélioré. Abstract The images acquired by a Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (POLSAR) are characterized by an inherent multiplicative noise called speckle. It corrupts both the amplitude and the phase, which complicates data interpretation, degrades segmentation performance and reduces target detectability. Hence, we need to preprocess the images by adaptive filtering methods before their analysis. In this paper, we present the Lee Sigma filter and its two enhanced versions that are based on knowledge of the radar probability density. The Sigma filter uses the calculation of the local mean from the pixels included in a two-Sigma interval. The improved Sigma filter is based on the estimation of the Minimum Mean Square Error MMSE. The improved Sigma filter with strong scatterer detection is based on the point targets preservation and application of the MMSE on the pixels of image. The methods are applied on three polarimetric images (HH, HV, VV) acquired by the ESAR sensor corresponding to the area located in Oberpfaffenhofen, in Munich, Germany, and on the bi-polarization images acquired by the ENVISAT satellite corresponding to the region of Oran in Algeria, and on the fully polarimetric images acquired by the RADARSAT- 2 satellite on the area of Algiers, Algeria...|$|E

These tunable frequency filters {{operate in a}} pure current mode. In {{the first part of}} this work are presented the different types of current active elements. Universal current conveyor, multiple-output current follower, digitally controlled current amplifier (UCC, MO-CF, DCCA). In the second part of this work are introduced particular methods of design tunable frequency filters. Special attention is given to using the design method of via autonomous circuits because it is one of the most. In the last part of this thesis are designed and computer-simulated individual multifunction tunable frequency filters with those already active yet elements. These filters were designed via autonomous circuits or modification of existing circuits. The functionality of the proposed <b>filtres</b> have been verified by computer simulation. Snap 3 program was used for the symbolic analyse of circuit and OrCad PSpice program was used to simulate the characteristics of multifunction filters...|$|R

The extraction of gelatine <b>filtred</b> by lint and dryed in the oven in 50 oC until 48 hours its becomes film gelatine. The extraxtion analyzed physicaly (yield, viscosity, gel strength) and chemical (pH, moisture content, ash content, protein content, fat content, amino acid). The analysis result indicates that dissolation in acid does not effect significantly to physic characteristic but it shows significant effect to chemical characteristic on pH dan fat content, mean while temperature treatment effect significantly to phisic characteristic but not on to chemical characterictic of gelatin. Treatment by using clorid acid on 45 oC result the highest yield (11. 94 %) viscosity (4. 13 cPs) gel strength (140. 57 bloom) from treatment by using other acid (acetic or citric) and temperature 55 oC...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the moderate deviations behaviors for two (co-) volatility estima-tors: generalised bipower variation, Hayashi-Yoshida estimator. The results are obtained {{by using a}} new result about the moderate deviations principle for m-dependent random variables based on the Chen-Ledoux type condition. In the last decade {{there has been a}} considerable development of the asymptotic theory for processes observed at a high frequency. This was mainly motivated by financial applications, where the data, such as stock prices or currencies, are observed very frequently. As under the no-arbitrage assumptions price processes must follow a semimartingale, there was a need for probabilistic tools for functionals of semimartingales based on high frequency observations. Inspired by potential applications, probabilists started to develop limit theorems for semimartingales. Statisticians applied the asymptotic theory to analyze the path properties of discretely observed semimartingales: for the estimation of certain volatility functionals and realised jumps, or for performing various test procedures. We consider X t = (X 1,t, X 2,t) t∈[0,T] a 2 -dimensional semimartingale, defined on the <b>filtred</b> probability space (Ω, F, (F t) [0,T], P), of the for...|$|R
