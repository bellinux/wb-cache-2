40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} horizontal inequalities in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> over the past 20 years. Using data from three recent <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> population censuses (1989, 1999, and 2009) and three <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> Household Living Standard Surveys (1998, 2008, 2012), we estimated numerous measures on inequalities between different 'ethnic' groups against several welfare indicators. Our results show that horizontal inequality matters in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam,</b> in particular for ethnicity, region, and rural/urban groups. While {{there has been an}} improvement in horizontal inequality in education, this paper shows little change in other welfare indicators, in particular poverty. We also found that horizontal inequality does matter for poverty reduction in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> and it needs more attention when designing poverty policies in the future...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} liberalizing tariffs and textile export quotas under <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam’s</b> accession to the WTO. To undertake the analysis, we develop a model of <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam’s</b> economy that reflects {{the importance of the}} duty exemption arrangements that allow export-oriented manufacturers to obtain intermediate inputs at world prices. The resulting GTAP-DD model is applied first to <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam’s</b> fourth multilateral tariff offer, and then to a hypothetical, deeper offer that takes <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam’s</b> average tariff below a simple average of 10 percent. The fourth offer is estimated to generate global gains of $ 460 million per year, of which over 60 percent accrues to <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam.</b> The deeper tariff experiment leads to annual gains of around $ 600 million per year, with $ 376 million accruing to <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam.</b> Under the fourth offer, most of the gains accrue from liberalization of the textile quotas, while the gains are roughly evenly split between tariff reform and textile quota abolition under the deeper reform scenario...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to investigate, from an {{institutional}} perspective, {{the implications of}} the new anti-corruption law in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> with a particular focus on its impact on civil society and individual rights to report on corruption. The overarching research question is: How do formal and informal institutions affect whistle-blowers possibilities to engage in combat of corruption in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam?</b> To blow the whistle in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> can be problematic, with consequences such as loosing his/hers job and social exclusion. Whistle-blowers in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> today seem to have an insufficient confidence to official authorities.

40|$|In {{recent years}} <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> has been {{pursuing}} the twin goals of promoting inward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) and regional development {{in the context of}} the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The paper surveys transnational corporations (TNCs) with operations in ASEAN, and finds that <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> has now largely achieved its initial objective of being a major FDI recipient. The regional aspect is especially manifest in consumer electronics, although most subsidiaries in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> still perform assemblytype operations oriented toward the local market. This has to change if <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> is to maintain its development momentum. Under the threat of international competition and in order to maximize the dynamic gains from FDI, <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> has to reorient its policies and emphasize a shift toward targeting efficiency-seeking investments and developing more advanced links with TNC regional and global value chains. This new approach would benefit from a full-scale development of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (providing access to a regional market) and the ASEAN Investment Area (securing capabilities in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> and other ASEAN countries), as well as other regional trade and investment initiatives.

40|$|To {{establish}} {{baseline data}} on the distribution, abundance and threats to marine turtles in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> we conducted surveys with local fishers, community members and provincial Ministry of Fisheries staff from 17 of <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam’s</b> 29 coastal provinces.

It is evident from these data that significant declines have occurred in both foraging and nesting populations of all five marine turtle species found in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam.</b> The greatest current threats to marine turtle populations in <b>Viet</b> <b>Nam</b> are habitat degradation, the accidental and opportunistic of turtles capture by fishers and the direct take of nesting females and their eggs. Successful conservation efforts {{have been made in}} recent years through collaboration between international Non Government Organisations and several Vietnamese Government Ministries.
