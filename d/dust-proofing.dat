40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} differences in the incidence characteristics of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) based on data from four large state-owned colliery groups of China, by comparing the cumulative incidence rates of CWP. We investigated 87, 904 coal workers from the Datong, Kailuan, Fuxin, and Tiefa Colliery Groups, who were exposed to dust for at least 1 year. The cumulative incidence rate of CWP was calculated with the life-table method and stratified analysis among coal workers with different occupational categories during different years of first dust exposure. Our results showed the cumulative incidence rate of Datong was higher than that of any other colliery group among workers with different occupational categories during different years of first dust exposure. For Datong workers who started their dust exposure in the 1970 s, the cumulative incidence rates of CWP among tunneling, mining, combining, and helping workers were 34. 77 %, 10. 20 %, 34. 59 %, and 4. 91 % during the observed time of 34 years, respectively. For those in the 1980 s, the cumulative incidence rates were 32. 29 %, 13. 51 %, 2. 98 %, and 0. 47 %, respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of Fuxin and Tiefa were the lowest. In conclusion, the Datong colliery has the highest cumulative incidence rate of CWP among the four studied collieries, followed by Kailuan. The cumulative incidence rates of Fuxin and Tiefa were the lowest. Additional <b>dust-proofing</b> measures for decreasing dust concentrations are still necessary...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{techniques}} {{enable the}} nondestructive evaluation of surface and bulk stress states {{by using the}} influence of strain or stress states on the propagation velocities of ultrasonic waves. By using different wave modes, evaluation equations are obtained in which only the ultrasonic time-of-flight is needed as measured quantity. AUSTRA is developed and optimized for the automated evaluation of stress states in metallic components. All operational functions are completely controlled by the computer. Besides the time-of-flight, the coordinates of the measuring point and the temperature are also taken. The software enables the evaluation of surface and bulk stress states. In order to evaluate the stress state, the particular evaluation equations are taken from the storage; the processor proves whether the appropriate data are measured and performs the evaluations. If necessary, the influence of temperature on the measuring quantities is corrected, using stored temperature coefficients.

50|$|Removing {{even more}} modern non-asbestos {{coatings}} can expose the operator to hazardous dust particles. Older coatings, containing asbestos, pose a particularly serious hazard. Inhaling microscopic asbestos fibers can cause asbestosis, a fibrosing lung disease; pleural mesothelioma, a {{cancer of the}} lining (pleura) of the lung; and peritoneal mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining (peritoneum) of the abdomen. Professional expertise to identify the presence of asbestos is recommended. Only those trained to remove the coating or working with a surface covered with the substance should do so only wearing effective <b>dust-proof</b> protective clothing and masks and the area being worked on should be sealed off. Removal of asbestos-containing Artex is covered by the UK's Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, although in many cases this work falls within exemptions to the licensing requirements and so does not usually require use of a licensed contractor. In cases where the risk is higher, the regulations make it unlawful for a contractor not licensed by the country's Health and Safety Executive to undertake the work.In the UK, once removed, Artex and any other substance containing asbestos must be disposed of as hazardous waste. If the coating is left alone and coated with paint and undamaged, it may be safe to leave the coating in place and managed in situ by annual inspection.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} an innovative compliance control architecture for hybrid multi‐legged robots. The approach was verified on the hybrid legged‐wheeled robot ASGUARD, which was inspired by quadruped animals. The adaptive compliance controller allows the system to cope with a variety of stairs, very rough terrain, and is also able to move with high velocity on flat ground without changing the control parameters. Design/methodology/approach – The paper shows how this adaptivity results in a versatile controller for hybrid legged‐wheeled robots. For the locomotion control we use an adaptive model of motion pattern generators. The control approach takes into account the proprioceptive information of the torques, which are applied on the legs. The controller itself is embedded on a FPGA‐based, custom designed motor control board. An additional proprioceptive inclination feedback is used to make the same controller more robust in terms of stair‐climbing capabilities. Findings – The robot is well suited for disaster mitigation as well as for urban search and rescue missions, where it is often necessary to place sensors or cameras into dangerous or inaccessible areas to get a better situation awareness for the rescue personnel, before they enter a possibly dangerous area. A rugged, waterproof and <b>dust‐proof</b> corpus and the ability to swim are additional features of the robot. Originality/value – Contrary to existing approaches, a pre‐defined walking pattern for stair‐climbing was not used, but an adaptive approach based only on internal sensor information. In contrast to many other walking pattern based robots, the direct proprioceptive feedback was used in order to modify the internal control loop, thus adapting the compliance of each leg on‐line...|$|R
40|$|The dust-rising {{depends on}} the {{moisture}} content of the pavement surface. This paper describes the effect of <b>dust-proof</b> when the simple pavement consisting of the limestone dust (smaller than 2 mm in diameter) and No. 7 crushed stone (from 2 mm to 5 mm) {{was applied to the}} play ground. The test was done by using an electric cleaner, in the laboratory and the amount of dust was observed under various conditions. By this test it was found that when wind velocity is 10 m/sec., loam dust does not rise under 60 Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide characteroisture content and lime-stone dust does not rise under about 10 Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide characteroisture content. And it was found that in order to prevent loam dust, which is very apt to rise, from rising by No. 7 crushed stone, we have to use No. 7 crushed s one with the ratio of more than 2 grs. per 20 cm^ 2, or to use the mixture of 100 grs. of No. 7 crushed stone and 100 grs. of loam (that is the ratio of weight is 1 : 1). The pavement material which consists of limestone dust and No. 7 crushed stone lacks binding force. Then in order to increase binding force and to make dust-rising difficult, we tried an experiment on the pavement material which consists of lime-stone dust and No. 7 crushed stone mixed with loam. By this experiment it is available for pavement on the play ground to use the simple paving material which is mixed 100 am on a weight basis in lime-stone dust and No. 7 crushed stone for the dust-prevention, ground-freezing, particle distribution and so on...|$|R
