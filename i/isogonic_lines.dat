5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with <b>isogonic</b> <b>lines</b> (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E

50|$|In {{the study}} of the Earth's {{magnetic}} field, the term isogon or <b>isogonic</b> <b>line</b> refers to a line of constant magnetic declination, the variation of magnetic north from geographic north. An agonic line is drawn through points of zero magnetic declination. An isoporic line refers to a line of constant annual variation of magnetic declination.|$|R
50|$|In either case, the {{underlying}} concept {{is that for}} a declination of 10° W, the red orienting arrow on the cylinder must lie 10° W of 0°/N on the bezel. (Basically, in this case, you are permanently subtracting 10° from your future bearings {{to compensate for the}} &minus;10° declination. If your declination was 10°E you would rotate the baseplate's red orienting arrow 10° E of 0°/N to compensate for the +10° declination.) In this sense, {{it can be said that}} the compass has been adjusted to indicate true north instead of magnetic north (as long as the compass remains within an area on the same <b>isogonic</b> <b>line).</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1698, Halley {{was given}} {{command of the}} , a 52 ft pink, {{so that he could}} carry out {{investigations}} in the South Atlantic into the laws governing the variation of the compass. On 19 August 1698, he took command of the ship and, in November 1698, sailed on what was the first purely scientific voyage by an English naval vessel. Unfortunately problems of insubordination arose over questions of Halleys competence to command a vessel. Halley returned the ship to England to proceed against officers in July 1699. The result was a mild rebuke for his men, and dissatisfaction for Halley, who felt the court had been too lenient. Halley thereafter received a temporary commission as a Captain in the Royal Navy, recommissioned the Paramour on 24 August 1699 and sailed again in September 1699 to make extensive observations on the conditions of terrestrial magnetism. This task he accomplished in a second Atlantic voyage which lasted until 6 September 1700, and extended from 52 degrees north to 52 degrees south. The results were published in General Chart of the Variation of the Compass (1701). This was the first such chart to be published and the first on which <b>isogonic,</b> or Halleyan, <b>lines</b> appeared.|$|R
50|$|A rough {{estimate}} of the local declination (within a few degrees) can be determined from a general isogonic chart of the world or a continent, such as those illustrated above. <b>Isogonic</b> <b>lines</b> are also shown on aeronautical and nautical charts.|$|E
50|$|By convention, {{declination}} {{is positive}} when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative {{when it is}} to the west. <b>Isogonic</b> <b>lines</b> are lines on the Earth's surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called agonic lines. The lowercase Greek letter δ (delta) is frequently used as the symbol for magnetic declination.|$|E
50|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north.

50|$|Halley also {{hoped that}} careful {{observations}} of magnetic deviations {{could provide a}} determination of longitude. The magnetic field of the Earth was not well understood at the time. Mariners had observed that magnetic north deviated from geographic north in many locations. Halley and others hoped that the pattern of deviation, if consistent, {{could be used to}} determine longitude. If the measured deviation matched that recorded on a chart, the position would be known. Halley used his voyages on the pink Paramour to study the magnetic variance and was able to provide maps showing the halleyan or <b>isogonic</b> <b>lines.</b> This method was eventually to fail as the localized variations from general magnetic trends make the method unreliable.|$|E
