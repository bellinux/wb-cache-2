The main growth parameters controlled in this work in the CNT growth were CO 2 level, pretreatment time and temperature. Pretreatment times of 15, 10, 5, 2 minutes were studied. CO 2 flow rates were send in system during both pretreatment time and growth time at 10 : 1, 10 : 2, 5 : 1, 5 : 2, 2 : 1 and 2 : 2 sccm ratios, respectively. We also studied two different growth temperatures at 740 oC and 760 oC. Secondly, the influence of O 2 for effective CNT growth was investigated by utilizing different pretreatment times and O 2 levels. Pretreatment times of 15, 10, 5, 2 minutes were studied.

In this respect, the C 12 E 5 /dodecane system more closely resembles the sodium dodecyl sulfate/dodecanol system, and this is attributed to a favorable interaction between the dodecane and the ethylene glycol chain, which encourages a closer approach of the oil to the water surface.

A few major reasons that make this venture unprofitable are the high cost of catalyst, the high equipment cost, and the short catalyst lifespan. After in depth analysis of the financials, we recommend that this project only be executed if market prices for input components significantly decrease, prices for BTX significantly increase, or catalyst lifetime significantly increases...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{illustrates}} {{key features}} of charge transfer between calcium atoms and prototype conjugated <b>hydrocarbons</b> (<b>ethylene,</b> benzene, and coronene) as elucidated by electronic structure calculations. One- and two-electron charge transfer {{is controlled by}} two sequential conical intersections. The two lowest electronic states that undergo a conical intersection have closed-shell and open-shell dominant configurations correlating with the 4 s 2 and 4 s 13 d 1 states of Ca, respectively. Unlike the neutral-ionic state crossing in, for example, hydrogen halides or alkali halides, the path from separated reactants to the conical intersection region is uphill and the charge-transferred state is a biradical. The lowest-energy adiabatic singlet state shows at least two minima along a single approach path of Ca to the π system: (i) a van der Waals complex with a doubly occupied highest molecular orbital, denoted, and a small negative charge on Ca and (ii) an open-shell singlet (biradical) at intermediate approach (Ca⋯C distance ≈ 2. 5 – 2. 7  Å) with molecular orbital structure ϕ 1 ϕ 2, where ϕ 2 is an orbital showing significant charge transfer form Ca to the π-system, leading to a one-electron multicentered bond. A third minimum (iii) at shorter distances along the same path corresponding to a closed-shell state with molecular orbital structure has also been found; however, {{it does not necessarily}} represent the ground state at a given Ca⋯C distance in all three systems. The topography of the lowest adiabatic singlet potential energy surface is due to the one- and two-electron bonding patterns in Ca-π complexes...|$|R
30|$|The {{dependence}} on oil over last century {{is expected to be}} gradually offset in this century by an increasing {{dependence on}} natural gas (the main constituent of which is methane). Much attention has therefore been paid to methane conversion to more commercially useful chemicals [1]. However, direct CH 4 conversion into condensable chemicals such as oxygenates (methanol, formaldehyde) or higher hydrocarbons pose key technical challenges [2, 3]. It was demonstrated that higher hydrocarbons can be formed from methane by a two-stage procedure, namely catalytic deposition of carbonaceous species, followed by Fischer–Tropsch like hydrogenation. They were operated at different reaction temperatures and conditions in order to overcome thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]. Similar processes have also been reported using other light alkanes [6]. It is interesting to extend this fundamental research to ethylene molecule, {{which is one of the}} key petrochemicals. It is expected that the use of <b>ethylene,</b> an unsaturated <b>hydrocarbon</b> can facilitate the first stage of carbonaceous deposition process hence enabling their surface coupling to higher hydrocarbons in the second stage. It is noted from previous research that a significant quantity of propylene was selectively formed when ethylene was in contact with cobalt catalyst at elevated temperature [7]. Similar results could also be obtained over Ru catalyst under defined reaction conditions, suggesting the possibility of obtaining selective higher hydrocarbon products [8]. The homologation of ethylene on metal surfaces, more often, was reported in the presence of H 2 [9]. The use of two-step sequence is expected to be more favorable to maximize the hydrocarbon chain length than those of co-feeding C 2 H 4 and H 2 [10], which should be systematically explored.|$|R
40|$|Ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) from Nitrosomonas europaea catalyzes the {{oxidation}} {{of ammonia}} to hydroxylamine {{and has been}} shown to oxidize a variety of halogenated and nonhalogenated hydrocarbons. As part of a program focused upon extending these observations to natural systems, a study was conducted to examine the influence of soil upon the cooxidative abilities of N. europaea. Small quantities of Willamette silt loam (organic carbon content, 1. 8 %; cation-exchange capacity, 15 cmol/kg of soil) were suspended with N. europaea cells in a soil-slurry-type reaction mixture. The oxidations of ammonia and three different <b>hydrocarbons</b> (<b>ethylene,</b> chloroethane, and 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane) were compared to results for controls in which no soil was added. The soil significantly inhibited nitrite production from 10 mM ammonium by N. europaea. Inhibition resulted from a combination of ammonium adsorption onto soil colloids and the exchangeable acidity of the soil lowering the pH of the reaction mixture. These phenomena resulted in a substantial drop in the concentration of NH 4 + in solution (10 to 4. 5 mM) and, depending upon the pH, in a reduction in the amount of available NH 3 to concentrations (8 to 80 μM) similar to the Ks value of AMO for NH 3 (∼ 29 μM). At a fixed initial pH (7. 8), the presence of soil also modified the rates of oxidation of ethylene and chloroethane and changed the concentrations at which their maximal rates of oxidation occurred. The modifying effects of soil on nitrite production and on the cooxidation of ethylene and chloroethane could be circumvented by raising the ammonium concentration in the reaction mixture from 10 to 50 mM. Soil had virtually no effect on the oxidation of 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane...|$|R
