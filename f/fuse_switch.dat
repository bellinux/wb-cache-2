5000|$|Another {{issue was}} that the car's fuse blew on {{numerous}} occasions. Each time, our engineers explored all possible explanations and {{were never able to}} find anything wrong with the car. Still, just to be sure, we replaced several parts that could have been related to the alleged problem - all at no expense to the customer. When the fuse kept blowing despite the new parts, and faced with no diagnosis showing anything wrong with the car, the engineers were moved to consider the possibility that the fuse had been tampered with. After investigating, they determined that the car's front trunk had been opened immediately before the fuse failure on each of these occasions. (The fuse is accessed through the front trunk.) Ultimately, Tesla service applied non-tamper tape to the <b>fuse</b> <b>switch.</b> From that point on, the fuse performed flawlessly." ...|$|E

This paper proposes {{the implementation of}} a new type of <b>switch</b> <b>fuse</b> to be used in areas with high saline pollution, to reduce significantly the occurrences of lack of improper <b>switch</b> <b>fuses</b> and thereby improve the rates of DEC and FEC. Distribution networks were used as field experiment in the towns of Aracati, Fortim and IcapuÃ, in which there was an excellent performance of the <b>switch</b> <b>fuse</b> with double insulation for situations where there is a high rate of saline pollution. The switch, which {{is in the form of}} fuse, is a device composed of elements designed to protect the circuit from damage and dynamic effects resulting from faults in power distribution system. The use of double isolated <b>switch</b> <b>fuse</b> was responsible for the reduction of saline pollution occurrences in the dry season. To achieve this type of <b>switch</b> <b>fuse,</b> several prototypes were developed to try the elimination the leakage current caused by pollution saline. By using this new equipment, we could see the preservation of fuse links and the reduction of improper operations records, which caused an increase in working time of staff, loss of material and especially customer dissatisfaction.

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the {{coordination}} and selectivity of the protection in a low voltage industrial electrical installation, so that the protection devices isolate and eliminate the fault quickly and selectively. To achieve this objective, {{a survey of the}} installed loads was carried out, a conference of fuse values and adjustment of the thermal relays, verification of the gauge of the cables connecting the respective loads and calculations of the short-circuit current through a software. Therefore, we want to demonstrate the importance of the correct selection of protection equipment and the impact that it can cause in productivity when incorrectly designed, impacting the continuity of the electric power supply to the manufacturing process. The analyzes presented here are based on the IEEE 242 standard, coordination and selectivity reports, and authors such as Caminha, Mamede Filho, Hewitson and Mardegan. The study was carried out within a pulp and paper industry, which, because it was an old plant, some protective equipment had to be replaced by modern ones. For example, the <b>fuse</b> <b>switches</b> and the bimetallic relays were replaced by electronic thermal relays and motor circuit breaker, since the old equipment did not allow us to make the correct coordination and selectivity, while others were only adjusted to work accordingly with the nominal data of the motors information plates. in this way, the objective of adapting the coordinated and selective protection system for overload, short-circuit and blocked rotor disarms was reached...|$|R

It {{presents the results of}} the evaluation and impact assessment of solar photovoltaic lighting systems in the region of Sunderbans, West Bengal, that were deployed by a reputable non-governmental organization (Ramakrishna Mission) {{under the auspices of the}} INDO-US collaborative project. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the solar photovoltaic systems for their impact on the individual households as well as on the community, to assess the effectiveness of the implementation and financial mechanisms, and to draw a long-term strategy for NREL's activities in Sunderbans based on case studies of similar interventions. Under the project, provision was made to supply 300 domestic lighting systems (DLS) based on 53 -Wp module capacity to individual households and a few other systems such as for lighting, medical refrigeration, and pumping water to community centers. For this study, 152 households were surveyed, of which 29 had also been a part of earlier pre- and post-installation surveys, 47 had been a part of the earlier post-installation survey, and 76 were households that were surveyed for the first time. A set of 46, out of the total 152 households, was selected for evaluating the systems for their technical performance with respect to module output, condition of the battery, and daily energy consumption. Of the total 300 modules, 2 had been stolen, 9 out of the total 300 batteries needed to be replaced, and 10 out of the 300 charge controllers were non-functional.

2500|$|Design {{features}} of {{plugs and sockets}} have gradually developed {{to reduce the risk}} of electric shock and fire.

According to British author John Mellanby the first shuttered socket was introduced by British manufacturer Crompton in 1893. [...] Electrical insulation of the pin shanks was added to some designs, to reduce live contact exposure when a plug is partially inserted in a socket, Mellanby shows such a plug from British manufacturer Diamond [...] "H" [...] dated 1905.

50|$|Breaking {{capacity}} or {{interrupting rating}} {{is the current}} that a fuse, circuit breaker, or other electrical apparatus is able to interrupt without being destroyed or causing an electric arc with unacceptable duration.

Otherwise breaking of the current cannot be guaranteed. Breaking capacity current corresponds to a voltage, so an electrical apparatus may {{have more than one}} breaking capacity current, according to the voltage. Breaking current may be stated in terms of the total current or just in terms of the alternating-current (symmetrical) component. Since the time of opening of a <b>fuse</b> or <b>switch</b> is not coordinated with the reversal of the alternating current, in some circuits the total current may be offset and can be larger than the alternating-current component by itself.|$|R
