2500|$|According to the Babylonian Mul.Apin, {{which dates}} from 1000–686 BCE, this {{constellation}} {{was known as}} [...] "The Furrow", representing the goddess Shala and her <b>ear</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain.</b> One star in this constellation, Spica, retains this tradition as it is Latin for [...] "ear of grain", {{one of the major}} products of the Mesopotamian furrow. For this reason the constellation became associated with fertility. According to Gavin White the figure of Virgo corresponds to two Babylonian constellations: the [...] "Furrow" [...] in the eastern sector of Virgo and the [...] "Frond of Erua" [...] in the western sector. The Frond of Erua was depicted as a goddess holding a palm-frond– a motif that still occasionally appears in much later depictions of Virgo.|$|E
2500|$|Demeter as mare-goddess was {{pursued by}} Poseidon, and hid from him among the horses of King Onkios, {{but could not}} conceal her divinity. In {{the form of a}} stallion, Poseidon caught and covered her. Demeter was furious (erinys) at Poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she is known as Demeter Erinys. But she washed away her anger in the River Ladon, {{becoming}} Demeter Lousia, the [...] "bathed Demeter". [...] "In her alliance with Poseidon," [...] Karl Kerenyi noted, [...] "she was Earth, who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an <b>ear</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> or a mare." [...] She bore a daughter Despoina (: the [...] "Mistress"), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian Mysteries, and a horse named Arion, with a black mane and tail.|$|E

2500|$|At Eleusis {{inscriptions}} {{refer to}} [...] "the Goddesses" [...] {{accompanied by the}} agricultural god Triptolemos (probably son of Ge and Oceanus), and [...] "the God and the Goddess" [...] (Persephone and Plouton) accompanied by Eubuleus who probably led {{the way back from}} the underworld. The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases: the [...] "descent", the [...] "search", and the [...] "ascent" [...] ( [...] Greek [...] "anodos") with contrasted emotions from sorrow to joy which roused the mystae to exultation. The main theme was the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter. At the beginning of the feast, the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out, the one towards the west, and the other towards the east. The people looking both to the sky and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme [...] "rain and conceive". In a ritual, a child was initiated from the hearth (the divine fire). The name pais ( [...] child [...] ) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions, It was the ritual of the [...] "divine child" [...] who originally was Ploutos. In the Homeric hymn the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god Triptolemos. The goddess of nature survived in the mysteries where the following words were uttered :" [...] Mighty Potnia bore a great son". Potnia ( [...] Linear B po-ti-ni-ja : lady or mistress), is a Mycenean title applied to goddesses. and probably the translation of a similar title of Pre-Greek origin. The high point of the celebration was [...] "an <b>ear</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> cut in silence", which represented the force of the new life. The idea of immortality didn't exist in the mysteries at the beginning, but the initiated believed that they would have a better fate in the underworld. Death remained a reality, {{but at the same time}} a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed. [...] A depiction from the old palace of Phaistos is very close to the image of the [...] "anodos" [...] of Persephone. An armless and legless deity, grows out of the ground, and her head turns to a large flower.|$|E
