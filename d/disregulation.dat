40|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} functional somatic syndromes {{is the presence}} of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related <b>disregulations</b> in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological <b>disregulations</b> thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological <b>disregulations.</b> They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network. This alternative approach is {{based on the fact that}} self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments...|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} of CSCs is under debate, because many studies found no cells with their specific characteristics. Cancer cells must {{be capable of}} continuous proliferation and self-renewal to retain the many mutations required for carcinogenesis and to sustain {{the growth of a}} tumor, since differentiated cells (constrained by the Hayflick Limit) cannot divide indefinitely. For therapeutic consideration, if most tumor cells are endowed with stem cell properties, targeting tumor size directly is a valid strategy. If they are a small minority, targeting them may be more effective. Another debate is over the origin of CSCs - whether from <b>disregulation</b> of normal stem cells or from a more specialized population that acquired the ability to self-renew (which is related to the issue of stem cell plasticity). Confounding this debate is the discovery that many cancer cells demonstrate a Phenotypic plasticity under therapeutic challenge, altering their transcriptomes to a more stem-like state to escape destruction.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} activity of mature sebaceous glands is producing and secreting sebum, {{which is a}} complex mixture of lipids. Sebum composition is different among species and this difference is {{probably due to the}} function that sebum has to absolve. In human sebum there are unique lipids, such as squalene and wax esters not found anywhere else in the body nor among the epidermal surface lipids. Moreover, they correspond to major components supplying the skin with protection. However, the ultimate role of human sebum, as well the metabolic pathways regulating its composition and secretion rate, are far from a complete understanding. Increased sebum secretion is considered, among all features, the major one involved in the pathophysiology of acne. Along with increased sebum secretion rate, quali- and quantitative modifications of sebum are likely to occur in this pathology. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that regulate sebum production is needed in order to identify new targets that can be addressed to achieve a selective modulation of lipid biosynthesis as a novel therapeutic strategy to correct lipid <b>disregulations</b> in acne and other disorders of the pilosebaceous unit...|$|R

Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, has been shown the potential of ameliorating <b>disregulations</b> of {{lipid metabolism}}. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of feed intake and RSV on lipid metabolism in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The adult males were randomly allocated to 6 groups: control (Con, 8 mg cysts/fish/day), control with 20 μmol/L RSV (Con+RSV), calorie restriction (CR, 5 mg cysts/fish/day), calorie restriction with RSV (CR+RSV), overfeed (OF, 60 mg cysts/fish/day), and overfeed with RSV (OF+RSV) groups. The treatment period was 8 weeks. Results showed that CR reduced body length, body weight, and condition factor of zebrafish. CR reduced levels of plasma triglyceride (TG) and induced protein expression of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase-α (pAMPKα), silent information regulator 2 homolog 1 (Sirt 1), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator- 1 α (PGC 1 α). RSV attenuated CR-induced pAMPKα/AMPKαincreases. RSV increased levels of Sirt 1 protein in the OF zebrafish, and decreased OF-induced increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) protein level. Additionally, RSV down-regulated caveolin- 1 and up-regulated microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 -II (LC 3 -II) protein levels in OF zebrafish. In conclusion, these results suggest that 1) CR reduces plasma TG level through activation of the AMPKα-Sirt 1 - PGC 1 α pathway; 2) under different dietary stress conditions RSV might regulate AMPK phosphorylation bi-directionally; 3) RSV might regulate lipid metabolism through the AMPKα-Sirt 1 -PPARγ pathway in OF zebrafish...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{neurotransmission}} in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) requires the precise control of the duration and the magnitude of neurotransmitter action at specific molecular targets. At the molecular level, neurotransmitter signaling is dynamically regulated by a diverse set of macromolecules including biosynthetic enzymes, secretory proteins, ion channels, pre- and postsynaptic receptors and transporters. Monoamines, 5 -hydroxytryptamine or serotonin (5 -HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) play an important modulatory role in the CNS and are involved in numerous physiological functions and pathological conditions. Presynaptic plasma membrane transporters for 5 -HT (SERT), NE (NET), and DA (DAT), respectively, control synaptic actions of these monoamines by rapidly clearing the released amine. Monoamine transporters are the sites of action for widely used antidepressants and are high affinity molecular targets for drugs of abuse including cocaine, amphetamine, and 3, 4 -methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA) “Ecstasy”. Monoamine transporters also serve as molecular gateways for neurotoxins. Emerging evidence indicates that regulation of transporter function and surface expression can be rapidly modulated by “intrinsic” transporter activity itself, and antidepressant and psychostimulant drugs that block monoamine transport {{have a profound effect on}} transporter regulation. Therefore, <b>disregulations</b> in the functioning of monoamine transporters may underlie many disorders of transmitter imbalance such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. This review integrates recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of monoamine transporter regulation, in particular, posttranscriptional regulation by phosphorylation and trafficking linked to cellular protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and transporter interacting proteins. The review also discusses the possible role of psychostimulants and antidepressants in influencing monoamine transport regulation...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate sex-specific HPA response patterns with a focus on the contribution of gonadal steroids as possible mediators. Methods: A total of 81 healthy adults were investigated in the present study. Twenty men, 19 women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, 21 women in the luteal phase, and 21 women using oral contraceptives (OC) were exposed to a brief psychosocial stress test (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) and injected with 0. 25 mg ACTH 1 – 24 on consecutive days. Basal HPA activity was investigated by repeatedly measuring cortisol levels immediately after awakening, as well as in 30 -minute intervals from 9 : 00 AM to 9 : 00 PM. Additionally, questionnaires were used to assess psychological state and trait parameters. Results: Results show that the TSST induced significant increases in ACTH, salivary-free cortisol, total plasma cortisol, and heart rates, as well as increased wakefulness and reduced calmness in the total group. Significant group differences emerged for ACTH and salivary-free cortisol stress responses: Although men showed higher ACTH responses to the TSST compared with each of the three groups of women, salivary cortisol responses showed the following response pattern: Luteal 5 Men.

40|$|MicroRNA are {{believed}} to be generally involved in more quantitative regulation of mammalian trait: therefore, mammalian conditions that have a strong genetic component and involve quantitative differences between the physiological and pathological conditions are strong candidates to be influenced by miRNA <b>disregulations.</b> The pool of this study is thus to investigate the possible role for miRNA imbalance in adipose tissue in the development of obesity. To date, microRNAs have been identified and evaluated in human preadipocytes (miR- 143) and mouse hepatocytes (miR- 122). There is no study dealing with microRNA in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of obese patients. For this reason, we have performed an high-throughput screening by microarray analysis on 1, 458 microRNAs in SAT from 20 morbidly obese patients (10 men and 10 female) versus pools of RNA from non obese subjects (3 men and 5 female). We were able to identify miRNAs differentially expressed comparing SAT from obese patients with respect to SAT from non-obese patients. The miR- 519 d was significantly higher in obese subjects than in the non obese pools. Using bioinformatic and functional analyses, we have demonstrated that the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor A (PPARA) gene resulted be a target of miR- 519 d. PPARA regulates the genes involved in fatty acid, glucose metabolism and inflammation (Cho et al., 2008). Therefore, it is conceivable that loss of PPARA could cause metabolic imbalance, thereby resulting in adipocyte hypertrophy in SAT from morbidly obese subjects. This project set the goal {{to be a part of}} the effort in understanding the biology and the role of this miR- 519 d during biogenesis of obesity...|$|R
40|$|Several neuroendocrine <b>disregulations</b> {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} in patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea, but a definite therapeutic strategy {{has not yet been}} found. Since acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) has been reported to have a specific effect on central cholinergic, serotoninergic, dopaminergic and opioidergic systems, 20 patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea were treated with ALC (2 g/day, per os). Both the clinical efficacy and the endocrine parameters were evaluated after 6 months. The patients were subdivided in two groups according to their LH plasma levels: A) hypogonadotropic: 10 subjects with plasma LH less than 3 mIU/ml, and B) normogonadotropic: 10 subjects with plasma LH greater than 3 mIU/ml. All subjects underwent: 1) a pulsatility study (4 h sampling every 10 min), 2) GnRH test (two bolus injections of 10 micrograms at time 0 and + 120), 3) TRH test (200 micrograms). These parameters were evaluated before and after 6 months of ALC administration. The occurrence of a spontaneous menstruation was observed in 6 out of 10 hypogonadotropinemic and in 4 out of 10 normogonadotropinemic patients. Menstrual bleeding occurred between the 3 rd and the 6 th month of therapy. Major hormonal changes after ALC administration were observed in the hypogonadotropic subjects. They showed a significant increase in baseline plasma LH levels (from 0. 9 +/- 0. 1 to 3. 5 +/- 0. 7 mIU/ml, p less than 0. 05) (mean +/- SEM), a significant increase in LH pulse amplitude (p less than 0. 01) with no changes in LH pulse frequency, and a significantly increased response of LH to the latter GnRH bolus during the GnRH test. Hypogonadotropic patients also showed a significant increase in both estradiol (from 18. 8 +/- 2. 5 to 48 +/- 3. 3 pg/ml, p less than 0. 05) and PRL (from 6 +/- 1 to 11. 4 +/- 1. 7 ng/ml, p less than 0. 05). No significant differences were observed in the hormonal parameters of normogonadotropic patients after 6 months of ALC therapy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: Since a decade, the {{evidence}} for a Stroke Induced Immunodepression Syndrome (SIDS) has been growing. The SIDS is linked to an increased mortality and morbidity during the acute treatment of stroke. Despite {{the high level of}} attention, there is still need for clinically applicable measuring methods of the phenomenon. The following dissertation presents a method for measuring thymic function by PCR analysis of T-cell Receptor Excision Circles (TREC), a byproduct of thymic T-cell development. Modern PCR assays enable sensitive detection of TREC DNA even in elderly populations. Methods: The measuring method for PCR analysis of human and murine TREC DNA is described. Furthermore, an experimental and a clinical study was designed to verify the impact of stroke on TREC numbers. The survey included analysis of blood and tissue samples of 29 murine specimen as well as a prospective 6 months follow-up of 36 patients after an acute ischemic stroke. The patients were subject to a double-blinded placebo-controlled antibiotic treatment with moxacillin. The clinical study was complemented with singular blood samples of 12 thymectomized and 9 healthy probands as controls. Results: The hypothesis of a postischemic decrease of TREC numbers was confirmed by trend in the animal model. Corresponding to the known phenomenons of postischemic lymphopenia and Th 1 /Th 2 shift, a significant increase of TREC numbers in the spleen and a decrease in blood was observed in the animal model. In the clinical survey, the decrease of TREC numbers was confirmed by trend. Further examinations revealed a significant increase of TREC numbers in the subgroup of deceased patients, contrary to the age expectations of this subgroup. On the other hand, according to the initial hypothesis the TREC numbers in the subgroup of survivors decreased significantly. There was no difference between the antibiotic and placebo subgroups. Conclusion: The reproducibility, sensitivity and specifity of the TREC PCR assay is excellent whereas processing time is acceptable. The following work gives an insight in a subsidiary aspect of SIDS, focusing on the thymic and T cell responses after ischemic stroke. It strenghtens the thesis of stroke derived neuroimmunomodulation. The measuring of TREC numbers is defined as an immunological marker helping to identify immune <b>disregulations</b> as SIDS. It helps to establish a broader understanding of the complex neuroimmunological interactions...|$|R

CREATING A SYSTEM OF MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION OF EXTREME PROFESSIONS REPRESENTATIVES (FIREMEN-RESCUERS AS A MODEL) Julia Chumaeva 1, Vladislava Golikovа 1, 2, Julia Nekhoroshkova 1, Alexey Ogulenko 1, Leonid Shafran 1 1 Ukrainian Scientific and Research Institute of Transport Medicine, Odessa, Ukraine 2 Odessa National Maritime Academy, Odessa, Ukraine Abstract Background. Working conditions of representatives of extreme professions (firemen-rescuers are a good example), are connected with <b>disregulations</b> and disorders of physiologic functions, fatigue accumulation and disadaptation. The medical and psychological rehabilitation is an effective way for occupational health and reliability restoration. However, last one is characterized by an empirical approach and conducted by priority of medical component, that significantly reduces effectiveness of the undertaken measures. So, it is necessary to develop {{a system of}} combined medical and psychological rehabilitation (MPR). Materials and methods. In this progect MPR was carried out in 238 specialists of three professional groups: firemen-rescuers (146), fire-engine drivers (44) and inspectors of fire safety (48 - control). Psychophysiological examination included the computerized program “MORTEST”, variant “SPAS- 14 ” performance, answers to the individual-typological questionnaire (ITQ) and Eysenck personal test (EPT). The levels of epinephrine (Е), norepinephrine (NЕ), dopamine (DА) and dioxyphenylalanine (DOPA) urinal excretion, the vanillylmandelic (VMA) and homovanillic acids (HVA) levels in urine were also defined. The survey is conducted three times: at the beginning, middle and the end of a 12 -day rehabilitation course. Statistical data processing was carried out by common programs in Microsoft Excel. Results and discussion. The studies have shown that the attributes to identify individual-typological differences are indicators of extroversion-introversion and anxiety in tests ITO and EPT. The results were divided into three clusters: extroverts with low anxiety (52. 9 %); ambiverts with low (27. 7 %) and high anxiety (19. 4 %). Simultaneously it was assigned different types of SAS response in the rehabilitation process: basic or balanced, epinephrinic, norepinephrinic, and with low secretory activity. Low efficiency of rehabilitation measures occurred in 40. 7 ± 5, 1 % of surveyed firefighters with epinephrinic response type and SAS functional exhaustion. The type of SAS response allocated 3 levels of stress in fire-rescuers: adequate to professional load, with the signs of hormonal and mediatorial dissociation, and dangerous - with the depletion of all links of SAS. Conclusion. According to the results of the performed researches it was developed a system of MPR, which allows to conduct a differentiated remediation of firemen-rescuers in the view of occupational features, individually-typological properties of the rehabilitants’ personality, the nature and degree of changes in the central nervous, autonomic and hormonal systems.
