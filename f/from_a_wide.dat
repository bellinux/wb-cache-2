His second came after he won a penalty which he converted to secure the victory. His efforts in this game won him Goal.com's World Player of the Week Award. In the following game, a Scottish Cup tie against Berwick Rangers, Samaras again started but failed to last the 90 minutes after sustaining a hamstring injury.

Vassar's yearbook, the Vassarion, {{as well as its}} weekly newspaper, The Miscellany News, were also headquartered in the Students' Building.

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began.

By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the policy}} implications of territorial competition; {{that is the}} promotion of local economic development in competition with other territories. It does so both in analytical and empirical terms moving <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> supranational and analytical standpoint to a more practical and local one. The impact of territorial competition in welfare terms depends critically on the perspective adopted. Some policies are pure waste even {{from the point of}} view of the initiating territory. Other policies may have a positive impact in economic welfare terms, viewed from the perspective of the territory, but be zero sum <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective. There may also be policies, however, which increase economic welfare, both locally and <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective. This suggests that there is a case for providing a supranational regulatory framework. The empirical section first examines the evidence as to whether local policies for economic growth do, in fact, have any impact. The paper concludes with an examination of the actual policies pursued in a sample of European regions and draws out some conclusions for local policy makers. ...|$|R
