40|$|The {{spawning}} of pike was {{studied in}} 1965 and 1966 in five large Irish limestone lakes-Loughs Sheelin, Ennell, Mask, Corrib and Arrow. The spawning period {{was found to}} be February to April. Spawning took place in shallow, sheltered situations where there was a carpet of dead or living vegetation on the bottom at a depth of 20 to 60 cm. Spawning took place by day, at a water temperature of at least 9 - 1 O C, when lake levels were high or rising. Gill-net catches reached a peak during periods of spawning. Weather conditions in February and March were much milder in 1966 than in 1965, and spawning began about a month earlier than in 1965. The eggs of Irish pike are 2. 7 to 3. 0 cm in diameter. They are golden to <b>honey</b> <b>coloured,</b> with a great many minute oil-globules distributed through the yolk in numerous tiny clusters. The incubation period in the field is probably 8 - 14 days, and the newly hatched larva is 8. 0 - 9. 0 mm long. For the first 10 days or so, the larvae hang vertically from the vegetation by means of adhesive glands on the head. They then become free-swimming, and soon afterwards begin to feed. At this stage they measure 13. 0 - 13. 5 mm. Their first food consists of small cladocera and copepods. Later, they feed on larger cladocera, amphipods, isopods, young stages of aquatic insects, and fish fry...|$|R

There are various potential underlying causes: {{it may be a}} hereditary defect that causes an abnormally thin and sensitive skin, it may be caused by infectious or systemic diseases, or by immune-mediated disorders such as hyperadrenocorticism. PHOTO 2 : Crusting is formed by dried exudate or secretions adhering to the skin surface. Dried material tends to adhere more tightly to hairy areas than in glabrous skin, causing crust to have the potential to become unusually thick. The nature of crusting can give insight to the underlying cause; for example, <b>honey</b> <b>coloured</b> crust is typically caused by an infectious agent, while dark crusts imply tissue damage or haemorrhage.

5000|$|The 1999 {{excavations}} {{consisted of}} four trenches designed to gain {{as much information}} as possible about the east end of the Abbey Church. ...Two phases of construction were identified. The church, as built in 1110, was constructed of flint and chalk rubble bonded by a pale brown chalky mortar. ...The choir was defined by the arcade that separated the body of the church from the surrounding ambulatory. ...Pilgrims, visiting shrines and chapels located at the east end of the church, would have walked along the ambulatory alongside the choir. One such chapel, projecting from {{the south side of the}} church, consisted of a small rectangular room with an apsidal east end. Part of a second chapel, of similar plan, was identified to the north of the church.The original east end of the 1110 church consisted of a small chapel that had been rebuilt in the late 12th or early 13th century using a pale, <b>honey</b> <b>coloured,</b> fine-grained limestone bonded by a hard orange mortar.The stratigraphic sequence suggests that the original chapel was standing while the new structure was built. It was demolished on completion of the work, possibly to limit the interruption to services. The date of construction is uncertain, but it may be associated with the programme spurred on by the 'miraculous events' that occurred at the shrine of St. Barnabas in 1182.....Directly in front of the high altar was a group of deep intercutting pits that represent past attempts to find the tomb of Alfred the Great. At the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539, graves in front of the high altar are said to have produced small lead tablets bearing the names Alfred and Edward. No archaeological trace of this first recorded breaching has survived, but subsequent discoveries suggest that the graves were left intact. Within a year the church and cloisters were demolished and the site of the church was lost from the landscape. However, late 18th century maps show that the site was littered with mounds of rubble....A few years after the event, the site was visited by Captain Howard, a noted antiquarian, who was aware of the discoveries made by Henry VIII's Commissioners. He interviewed Mr Page, the Prison Warden, who told him that during works in the Governor's garden the site of the high altar was found, with three graves located before it.The coffin thought to be Alfred's was made of a single block of stone encased with lead. He was also told of its fate - the prisoners threw the bones about, broke up the coffin and sold the lead. Then the original grave pit was dug deeper to the level of the watertable, and the broken coffin reburied.The earliest pit in the area accords well with Page's description. It extended across the full width of the high altar area and had been dug down to the watertable.... Slight hints of earlier cuts were found that might represent the three royal tombs.|$|R
40|$|Gur (Jaggery) is a natural, {{traditional}} {{product of}} sugarcane. It can define as a <b>honey</b> brown <b>coloured</b> raw lump of sugar. Kushinagar district of Uttar-Pradesh has {{large number of}} Gur manufacturing units, mostly located {{in the rural areas}} and the manufacturers are following conventional methods for producing this. In the district the major clusters which are having more numbers of manufacturing units are Sukraouli, Kasia, Hata and Padarauna. Around half of the rural population is employed in gur making industry in this region. Although, there is no R & D assistance and marketing institutions for support. It is found that the manufacturers are producing majorly for distilleries and local licker producers, not for the food-plate or common man's consumption. The paper examines the cost-return analysis, profitability and operational efficiency of Gur manufacturing units in study area. The study revealed that units of medium and large sizes were able to cover their operating expenses with significant level of profit but small size units were earning a marginal profit. The profit earned by this category was very low as compared to other two sizes. The manufacturers are not interested in any new product of Gur, they just want to earn more profit through Gur only. This research will urged the policymakers to streamline strategies that promote stabilization of sugarcane economy and make the nation credible supplier of Gur in the International market, benefiting Gur makers, sugarcane growers and related stakeholders. ...|$|R

Of the honey samples analysed, only pine honeydew were grouped in dark category of honey (L* 50) and possessed both red and yellow components. The concentrations of mineral content were found highest in pine honeydew followed by multi floral and least in acacia honey. All the physico-chemical properties and enzymatic activity indicated that all the three analysed varieties of honey met the criteria set by the International Honey Commission and revised codex standards for honey. The source of honey {{had a significant effect}} (p< 0. 05) on physico-chemical characteristics, enzymatic activity, mineral content and colour properties. Strong and positive correlations exhibited among minerals, colour (mmpfund) and L* value indicated that dark <b>coloured</b> <b>honey</b> contained high mineral content.

40|$|This {{study was}} focused on the {{establishment}} of statistical correlation between physical and chemical properties of honey samples, namely Tualang, Gelam and Acacia honey from Malaysia. The physical properties studied were pH, colour, moisture, ash, electrical conductivity, total soluble solid (TSS) and acidity. The chemical properties evaluated were hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), total phenolics (TPC), total flavonoids (TFC) and mineral content, as well as radical scavenging activity. The methods used for the physical properties were based on Official Method of Analysis (AOAC), while the chemical composition of honey was determined using mass spectrometric and spectrophotometric methods. The results showed that the physical and chemical properties of honey samples were positively correlated (r> 0. 700) by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. From dendrogram, three major groups were clustered based on the cluster distance between parameters of honey. The colour and TSS exhibited the longest cluster distance than the other parameters. Therefore, both parameters were used as a rapid physical indicator to estimate the concentration of HMF, mineral content, TPC and TFC with the confident level 95 %. The presence of apigenin, luteolin, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid was believed to contribute to the dark <b>coloured</b> <b>honey,</b> besides HMF. The TSS was contributed by the chemical compounds such as polyphenols and mineral content. The finding was also supported by the high percentage of the total variance in the first principal component (PC 1 = 97. 8 %) of multivariate analysis. As a conclusion, the relationship between physical and chemical properties of honey has been established based on the available samples. The relationship showed that for honey with colour less than 80. 00 mm Pfund scale, the TPC and TFC value can be less than 42. 92 mgGAE/ 100 g and 7. 54 mgRE/ 100 g, respectively. For TSS, a value of around 74 % will contribute to about 1700 mg/kg of total mineral conten...|$|R
40|$|The gradual {{exhaustion}} {{of classic}} hydrocarbon reservoirs and increasing global energy demand, {{lead to the}} exploration of new, more complex oil and gas plays. Hydrothermal dolomites (HTDs), which form by the interaction of a limestone host rock with high temperature dolomitising brines, represent a newly discovered type of reservoir rock. Ironically, the first commercial hydrocarbon discovery in a carbonate reservoir (i. e. the Lima-Indiana field in the Trenton Formation) was in a HTD. These HTDs are not only of great interest for their economic aspects, but are also a matter of much debate in fundamental research. At this time, some questions regarding the genesis of HTDs remain unanswered and the parameters controlling their characteristics and their distribution are virtually unknown. Over the last decades many studies focussed on the genesis of HTD, but {{only a limited number}} investigated their (reservoir) characteristics. Moreover, the latter are generally based on a limited set of cores or borehole logs, which hampers the investigation of the distribution of the HTDs characteristics. In this study, both the diagenesis and characteristics of different HTD bodies are addressed. This requires the combination of a classic diagenetic study including petrography, geochemistry and fluid inclusion microthermometry {{on the one hand and}} a qualitative and/or quantitative characterisation of the HTD bodies by digital outcrop model analysis, systematic sampling, standard petrophysical measurements and (geo) -statistics on the other hand. The area selected for this study is located in northern Spain in the Ramales Platform, which developed in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin (BCB) during the Aptian and Albian. This carbonate platform hosts several relatively small fault-controlled HTD bodies in the platform edge and large stratabound HTD bodies in inner-platform deposits. Both types of HTD bodies are associated with deep seated sinistral strike-slip faults. The fault-controlled HTD bodies exposed in the platform edge are characterised by a systematic spacing and mainly develop along their feeder faults. The largest fault-controlled HTD body, defined as the Pozalagua body, occurs along the Pozalagua Fault. Along this fault a horizontal displacement of 500 m was inferred and more joint sets developed compared to the rest of the platform edge. The combination of these observations suggests that the Pozalagua body developed along the most active fault, i. e. accommodating most of the sinistral strike-slip deformation. In addition, this Pozalagua body developed more extensively in inner-platform deposits. There, the dolomite-limestone contact is controlled by three joint sets (N 30 W, N 40 E and N 75 E) which could be related to the development of Riedel shears in a sinistral strike-slip regime. Part of the Pozalagua body crops out north of the Ramales platform edge. It is defined as the Pico del Carlista body and is selected for the quantitative study of its (reservoir) characteristics. Based on the macroscopic texture, three types of HTD aredistinguished, i. e. matrix, coarse crystalline and zebra dolomite. The spatial distribution of these types is characterised by clusters of the same type and the preferential occurrence of matrix dolomite and the host rock at neighbouring sites. Two directions of anisotropy can be observed in the spatial distribution of the three HTD types in the Pico del Carlista body, i. e. N 30 - 35 W and N 60 E, which correspond to the strike of the Pozalagua Fault and the platform edge. The latter two are interpreted as the main fluid conduits for the Pico del Carlista body. Three zones dominated by a specific type of HTDs can be defined in this body. 1) Along and close to the fluid conduits coarse crystalline dolomite occurs. This is interpreted as the result of the recrystallisation of earlier matrix and zebra dolomite phases. 2) In the central part of the body, zebra dolomites dominate. Since zebra dolomites preferentially develop along faults or in fault zones the occurrence of the zebra dolomite in the central part of the HTD body is related to the Pozalagua Fault zone. 3) At the dolomite-limestone contact matrix dolomite is the main HTD type. Despite the difference in texture and pore types observed in the matrix, coarse crystalline and zebra dolomite, based on plug analysis no significant difference in porosity and permeability was inferred for the three types. In general, the porosity of the HTD ranges between 1. 8 and 12. 1 % and the permeability between 0. 01 and 17. 4 mD. No relation between porosity and permeability of the HTD (types) exists. These findings are based on an extensive dataset consisting of HTD types and poro-perm measurements of the HTDs sampled in the Pico del Carlista body. Comparison of the (geo) -statistical data obtained from the entire dataset with data obtained from a limited number of sections sampled, shows that studying one or two well-chosen sections would have yielded similar results. In the stratabound body of Matienzo, the HTDs characteristics are analysed in a qualitative way. The geometry of the HTD body is controlled by joints, bedding planes and the presence of massive limestone units and faults. No relation is observed between the precursor limestone facies and the occurrence of HTD, massive limestone units however form impermeable barriers for dolomitising fluids. Matrix, coarse crystalline and zebra dolomite can also be discerned in this HTD body. The distribution of these types in three sub-horizontal zones is interpreted as the result of fluid flow, degree of oversaturation relative to dolomite, water-rock interaction and the presence of faults. In the lower part of the HTD body, matrix dolomites are dominant and interpreted as the result of the reaction of a highly oversaturated dolomitising fluid with the host rock. As a consequence of the high degree of oversaturation, dolomite mineralisation starts on many nucleation points resulting in a fine crystalline dolomite. As the dolomitising fluid flows to the upper part of the body, the degree of oversaturation with respect to dolomite decreases. Dolomitewill nucleate on fewer points and not all the dissolved CaCO 3 is replaced by CaMg(CO 3) 2. This explains the occurrence of a porous coarse crystalline dolomite in the upper part of the HTD body. The presence of zebra dolomite in the middle part of the HTD body is attributed to the injection of dolomitising fluids along tributary faults. The HTDs of the Matienzo body are characterised by similar porosity (1. 8 - 13. 7 %) and permeability (0. 01 - 4. 4 mD) values as in the Pico del Carlista body, which are obtained from standard petrographic analyses on small plugs. The upper 80 m of the Matienzo HTD body, composed of porous coarse crystalline dolomite, represents a potentially interesting rock from a reservoir point of view. In the Pozalagua body, a saw-cut quarry exposes multiple diagenetic phases and allows the reconstruction of a detailed paragenetic sequence. In the rest of the study area the outcrops do not generally allow observation of all the diagenetic phases seen in the Pozalagua Quarry, but a consistent paragenetic sequence can be inferred for the entire study area. The diagenetic phases observed in the Ramales Platform are attributed to the eogenetic, mesogenetic or telogenetic realm depending on their relation with different sets of stylolites. Early diagenetic cements, which developed prior to burial stylolites, occlude most of the primary pores and no synsedimentary/early diagenetic dolomite is observed in the host limestone. Four diagenetic phases cross cut the first set of burial stylolites. These burial diagenetic phases consist of two calcite and two dolomite phases. The first phase is a coarse crystalline calcite (CCC). It differs from the other burial diagenetic phases present in the study area by its geographic distribution, i. e. it has only been observed in the Ramales Platform edge, and its composition, i. e. it is the only phase that precipitated from a H 2 O-NaCl-CaCl 2 fluid. The parent fluid has a moderate salinity (with an average of 15. 9 eq. wt. % NaCl) and a radiogenic Sr isotope signature. It is suggested that the parent fluid originated from dewatering of basinal sediments. This CCC is cross cut by sinistral shear veins cemented by dolomite. Though multiple sub-phases of dolomite can be observed in the Pozalagua Quarry, these can be grouped into a ferroan and a non-ferroan dolomite phase. Both major phases have similar cathode luminescence, stable and Sr isotope signatures, salinity and Th within each HTD body. The ferroan dolomites have however higher Fe and Mn concentrations and are associated with MVT ores. The depleted delta 18 O values, radiogenic Sr isotope signature, high salinity (18 eq. wt. % NaCl on average at Ranero) and high Th (140  160 &# 176;C on average in the different bodies) of the dolomitising fluid combined with Pb isotope and crush-leach data reported in the literature indicates that the dolomitising fluid is a residual brine originating from the Triassic Keuper deposits of the BCB, which possibly interacted with basement rocks. The variation in Th for the different HTD bodies is attributed to a different relation between the HTD and their respective feeder fault systems. The HTDs are cross cut by a second calcite phase, i. e. a blocky calcite that occurs in sigmoidal veins and veins containing angular clasts of the host rock. Late calcite phases are reported over and over again in association with HTD. The parent fluid of this calcite is less saline (8. 6  14. 7 eq. wt. % NaCl) and has a lower Th (51  77 &# 176;C) than the dolomitising fluid, which does not exclude a genetic link between both. The blocky calcite is the last burial diagenetic phase and is cross cut by burial and tectonic stylolites. A relative timing for the burial diagenetic phases was inferred based on literature of the BCB and observations made during this study. The association of the HTD with sinistral strike-slip faults leads to the conclusion that the HTD precipitated in a transtensional regime, which prevailed during the late Cretaceous. Additional indications for a late Cretaceous and more precisely late Albian age for the dolomites is given by the presence of hydrothermal vents along faults in the BCB, the cross-cutting relation of the CCC with Supra-Urgonian sandstones at Jorrios, the emplacement of volcanics along major faults of the BCB and the onset of metamorphism by the convection of hot fluids in the Pyrenees. Two late diagenetic phases are attributed to the telogenetic realm of the inverted BCB, i. e. the <b>honey</b> <b>coloured</b> calcite and associated dedolomite. The zoned cathode luminescence, low Sr concentration, the meteoric calcite line formed by the stable isotope signatures and the inferred delta 18 O VSMOW signatures of the parent fluid, support a meteoric origin of the honey calcite and by consequence of the associated dedolomite. The meteoric alteration of the dolomite and its host rock probably started during the Miocene. The results of this study can be used for the prediction of the occurrence of HTD bodies in basins that experienced a similar geodynamic evolution as the BCB. If fault-controlled and/or stratabound HTD bodies are encountered a comparable distribution of the HTD bodies and (reservoir) characteristics within the HTD bodies can be assumed. nrpages: 183 status: publishe...|$|R
