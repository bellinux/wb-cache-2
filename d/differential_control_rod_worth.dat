40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work carried out by MTA KFKI Atomic Energy Research Institute in Hungary, is to develop and {{validate}} a method for predicting the ex-core detector responses in the Russian pressurized water type VVER reactors. The time and space dependent neutron flux in the core during these measurements have been calculated by the KIKO 3 D nodal diffusion code. For calculating the ionization chamber signals the Green function technique has been applied. The Green functions of ionization chambers have been evaluated via solving the neutron transport equation in the reflector regions with MCNP Monte Carlo code. The detector signals have been calculated and compared with measured ones using the inverse point kinetics transformation. Large number of asymmetric rod drop measurements (with one rod stuck) and some differential rod worth measurements from the Zero Power Physics Tests were provided by the Paks NPP for validation. The initial state of experiments covers different fuels (without and with enrichment zoning) and loading patterns. The intermediate range ionization chambers have been used during the scram measurements. The newly developed method provides fairly sufficient match of measured and calculated results. The time behavior of the detector readings is well modeled. Their space dependent effects observed in the measurement are described by the code in a consistent manner. The uncertainty of scram rod worth is established by statistical analysis.

The ASTRA Critical Facility at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow {{was used}} to perform {{critical}} experiments to simulate the PBMR reactor core design as being developed by PBMR (Pty) Ltd. The aim of these benchmarks is to validate the code system VSOP, currently used for PBMR core neutronics calculations. In this work these benchmark calculations are discussed and investigated. Experiments performed at the facility include criticality experiments, control rod worth measurements and reactivity measurements. To aid in the verification, the Monte Carlo code MCNP {{was used to}} calculate some of the experiments and compared to the VSOP results. The flux solver in VSOP uses the finite difference diffusion method to determine the neutron distribution in the core. The problem of modelling a highly absorbing region, such as control rods, in diffusion calculations is well known and many methods {{have been developed to}} accommodate the transport effects in diffusion theory. This problem is compounded {{in the case of the}} ASTRA facility (and PBMR) due to the positioning of the control rods in the side reflector and the associated directional dependence of the flux. One of the methods that can be used for the control rod model is that of equivalent cross sections. This method has been shown in the past to yield acceptable results for pebble bed type reactors. In this work the method of equivalent cross-sections is evaluated by applying it to calculations of control rod experiments performed at the ASTRA facility. It is shown that results are favourable for control rods situated within the first ring of reflector blocks, with larger error obtained for control rods situated further from the core.

40|$|International audienceThe VENUS-F {{reactor core}} is very modular and its {{reactivity}} {{can range from}} deep subcritical to critical by varying the number of fuel assemblies in the core. It is also equipped with six safety rods, one absorbent rod for rod drop experiments and two boron carbide <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> which allow for a finer tuning of the reactivity. Ten fission chambers, spread throughout the reactor reflector and the core, allow recording count rates during steady-state and time-dependent measurements. In order to test on-line subcriticality monitoring techniques, the reactivity of all the VENUS-F configurations used must be known beforehand to serve as benchmark values. Thus the reactivity <b>worth</b> of the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> must be known as accurately as possible so that the reactivity of every new reactor configuration created by moving the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> can be estimated correctly. Although reactor asymptotic period measurement is a usual technique to determine the reactivity <b>worth</b> of <b>control</b> <b>rods,</b> it {{is limited to a}} very small reactivity range (from  - 0. 3 $ to + 0. 3 $) and consequently does not always allow measuring the total reactivity. Furthermore it is obviously inapplicable to <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> <b>worth</b> measurement in deep subcritical reactors. This is the reason why the Modified Source Multiplication Method (MSM) was used as an alternative method for estimating the reactivity worth of the VENUS-F <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> The unknown reactivity is determined by comparing detector count rates driven by an external neutron source in the configuration of interest with those obtained in another subcritical configuration whose reactivity is known (reference configuration). However, to account for the flux shape differences between the two reactor configurations, some position-dependent correction factors (the so-called MSM factors) must be calculated using a neutron transport code. In this paper, we will present calculations of MSM factors performed with the Monte Carlo neutron transport code MCNP for estimating the VENUS-F <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> <b>worth</b> when the reactor is subcritical and near critical. (Dis-) advantages of using a stochastic code instead of a deterministic one will be discussed. General trends in the MSM factor behavior depending on neutron source and detector locations, {{as well as on the}} subcriticality level will be outlined. Finally the calculated MSM correction factors will be applied to detector count rates measured for various <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> heights, with the GENEPI- 3 C source in subcritical configuration and with an Am-Be source in near-critical configuration. Consistency between reactivity values given by all detectors will be discusse...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe GUINEVERE {{project was}} {{launched}} in 2006, within the 6 th Euratom Framework Program IP-EUROTRANS, in order to study the feasibility of transmutation in Accelerator Driven subcritical Systems (ADS). This zero-power facility hosted at the SCK·CEN site in Mol (Belgium) couples the fast subcritical lead reactor VENUS-F with an external neutron source provided by interaction of deuterons delivered by the GENEPI- 3 C accelerator and a tritiated target located at the reactor core center. In order to test on-line subcriticality monitoring techniques, the reactivity of all the VENUS-F configurations used must be known beforehand to serve as benchmark values. That is why the Modified Source Multiplication Method (MSM) is under consideration to estimate the reactivity <b>worth</b> of the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> when the reactor is largely subcritical as well as near-critical. The MSM method {{appears to be a}} technique well adapted to measure <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> <b>worth</b> over a large range of subcriticality levels. The MSM factors which are required to account for spatial effects in the reactor can be successfully calculated using a Monte Carlo neutron transport code...|$|R
40|$|A 2 D RZ VENTURE {{model has}} been {{developed}} for the Nigeria Research Reactor- 1 (NIRR- 1) and this model was used to perform neutronic analysis for the system using the code “VENTURE-PC”. The major homogenized regions in the 2 D VENTURE model include the active fuel region and the control region while the remaining components in the system geometry where modelled as closely as possible. The reactor physics parameters generated from the neutronic calculations include excess reactivity, <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> <b>worth,</b> shim worth, shutdown margin. The model predictions of these parameters for NIRR- 1 system were in good agreement with experimental results {{as well as the}} results from similar calculations using different nuclear analysis tools. This 2 D RZ VENTURE model gives an excellent simulation of the Nigeria Research Reactor- 1 and the model will be very helpful in the future analysis of the system, as well for developing an LEU core model for future conversion of NIRR- 1 from HEU to LEU fuelled research reactor...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{scenarios}} {{defined in the}} OECD-NEA benchmark "PBMR Coupled Neutronics/Thermal Hydraulics Transient Benchmark of the PBMR- 400 Core Design", a code-to-code comparison was performed between the reactor dynamics program TINTE (Time Dependent Neutronics and Temperatures) using two neutron energy groups and the advanced code MGT (Multi Group TINTE) which is able {{to take into account}} up to 43 energy groups. The effect of an increasing number of energy groups on time- and space dependent safety-related parameters like the fuel and moderator temperature, the reactivity or the <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> <b>worth</b> has been studied. In a first step, calculations were carried out to compare the results obtained from MGT and TINTE using two energy groups. Afterwards the MGT two-group model was compared to a scenario using 43 energy groups. In addition, the benchmark was well suited to validate the new nuclear library of MGT now based on ENDF/B-VII. 0 data. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|The {{different}} types of transmutation systems under investigation include accelerator driven (ADS) and critical systems. To switch off an accelerator {{in case of an}} accident initiation is quite important for all accidents. For a fast ADS the grace times available for doing so depend strongly on the total heat capacity and the natural circulation capability of the primary coolant. Cooling with heavy metal Pb-Bi has considerable advantages in this regard compared to gas cooling. Moreover it allows passive ex-vessel cooling with natural air or water circulation. In the remote likelihood of fuel melting, oxide fuel appears to mix with the Pb-Bi coolant. Fast critical systems that are cooled by Pb-Bi will automatically shut off if the flow or heat sink is lost. Reactivity accidents can be limited by a low total <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> <b>worth.</b> High temperature reactors can achieve only incomplete burning of actinides. If an accelerator is added to increase burn-up, a fast spectrum region is needed, which has a low heat capacity. 50...|$|R
