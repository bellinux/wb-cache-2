2500|$|The {{braking surface}} is {{farther from the}} ground and {{possible}} contaminants like mud which can coat or freeze on the rim and pads. [...] With rim brakes, the first point that mud builds up on a mountain bike ridden in thick mud is usually the brakes. [...] A mountain bicycle with disc brakes is [...] less susceptible to mud buildup provided the rear frame and front <b>fork</b> <b>yoke</b> have sufficient clearance from the wheels.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 the Atlas was {{upgraded}} to 12-volt electrics, and gained an extra carburettor and wider <b>fork</b> <b>yokes.</b> A UK version was launched with flat bars and twin instruments. The Atlas {{continued to be}} built until 1968 but by then the Norton Commando had taken over.|$|R
50|$|Steering of {{the front}} wheel must be by a {{non-adjustable}} handlebars securely fixed to the <b>forks</b> or <b>yokes</b> of the motorcycle with no intermediate push or pull rods and all steering elements must be located on the sprung portion {{of the front}} suspension unit.|$|R
50|$|The Silk 700S was {{launched}} in 1975 and featured the new engine in a steel tubular frame made by Spondon Engineering of Derbyshire, who also made the <b>forks,</b> <b>yokes,</b> disc/drum brakes and rotors. Priced at £1,355 {{it was the most}} expensive production motorcycle of the time. The 700S continued to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes - British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream - and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time.|$|R
50|$|Tilting {{the polar}} axis adds {{a level of}} {{complexity}} to the mount. Mechanical systems have to be engineered to support one or both ends of this axis (such as in <b>fork</b> or <b>yoke</b> mounts). Designs such as German equatorial or cross axis mounts also need large counter weights to counterbalance {{the mass of the}} telescope. Larger domes and other structures are also needed to cover the increased mechanical size and range of movement of equatorial mounts. Because of this, equatorial mounts become less viable in very large telescopes and have been pretty much replaced by altazimuth mounts for those applications.|$|R
50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double tongue and groove joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two <b>forks</b> (a.k.a. <b>yokes,</b> one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a wear analysis of die inserts {{used in the}} hot forging process of a <b>forked</b> forging (<b>yoke),</b> an element applied in steering systems of passenger vehicles. Studies involved the application of an original reverse scanning method intended for rapid and reliable wear analysis of forging tools (with complicated shape) affording easy assessment without the need to dismount tools from the forging unit. The developed method involves analysis of progressive wear of forging tools based on measurements (scanning) of forgings periodically collected from the process and constitutes {{a useful tool for}} measurement and testing. As the authors’ earlier works have demonstrated, the proposed new approach to analysis of tool wear with the application of reverse 3 D scanning has proven successful in multiple instances in the case of axially symmetrical objects. The presented results of studies indicate {{that it is possible to}} utilize the expanded method to analyze the lifetime of forging tools, including tools with complex geometry. Application of the reverse scanning method allows for continuous and practical monitoring of the condition of forging tools over the course of the forging process and should have a positive impact on improving production output and reducing production costs...|$|R
