5000|$|As the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) increased, {{the need}} for wider, all-weather, paved roads became {{increasingly}} apparent. As early as the 1930s, various Saskatchewan cities, towns, and rural municipalities lobbied the provincial government to develop hard surfaced roads, including Highway 11, to connect its major centers, particularly Regina, Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Moose Jaw. Saskatoon mayor R.M. Pinder argued that Highway 11 should receive priority because [...] "it serves {{the greatest number of}} people for the longest period of time" [...] and its <b>hard</b> <b>surfacing</b> would facilitate the travel of American tourists to Prince Albert National Park and support transport operations to and from the Dundurn Military Camp. A dispute flared up between Saskatoon and Prince Albert community organizations over whether Highway 11 or Highway 2 should be paved first. Prince Albert advocated prioritizing Highway 2 as a more direct route between the northern and southern parts of the province and a more attractive route for American tourists driving to Prince Albert National Park. Saskatoon preferred Highway 11 because the alternative would bypass it and not provide as many Saskatchewan residents the transportation benefits of direct access to a paved highway. In 1950, the provincial government indicated that it would prioritize the paving of Highway 11 between Saskatoon and Regina; by October 1952 this section was completely paved.The improved highway was also rerouted in some places, including the section between Bladworth and Dundurn which was completely rebuilt, and bypasses were built around some towns and villages through which it had formerly passed. Although the highway's route had not entirely reached its present contours, it was made straighter; the distance traversed between Saskatoon and Regina was reduced by 27 miles. It more closely followed the CNR tracks and contained fewer right angle corners than it had in 1926. The highway between Saskatoon and Prince Albert received less attention during this period; a 1956 highway map shows that it was still almost entirely gravel.|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of Fe-TiC {{metal matrix composite}} during metal deposition with laser and arc welding techniques is of technical and economic interest for <b>hard</b> <b>surfacing</b> of engineering components. Recent studies linked the resistance to abrasive wear with the size and morphology of TiC precipitates, which are strongly dependent on the deposition conditions and, more importantly, on the alloy chemistry. In this study, the effect of silicon and manganese on the TiC precipitates was explored and different processing conditions were assessed. The characterisation included optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and microhardness testing. The results indicate that silicon and manganese can {{have a significant effect}} on TiC size and morphology. Therefore, the composition of the matrix alloy offers an effective pathway to modify the microstructure of in-situ precipitated Fe-TiC metal matrix composites. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

Overview of the composite manufacturing technology at home and abroad At present, high-alloy materials surfacing composite manufacturing technology has been used wildly. It uses high-alloy material with high strength, high wear resistance, good thermal fatigue properties as the dies working layer, and makes the core and working layer combined with surfacing (metallurgical bonding) method.

In this research, the engineering properties and economics of using soil cement were evaluated using Amarillo fine sandy loam, {{one of the most common}} granular soils in the Texas Panhandle region. Soil cement specimens were prepared in compaction molds to determine the optimum moisture content and cement content for compaction. Specimens were subjected to field conditions including exposure to manure for nine months, then subjected to unconfined compressive strength tests, freezing-thawing tests, and wetting-drying tests. The unconfined compressive strength of soil cement increased linearly with cement content between 5 and 20 percent (R 2 = 0. 99). At a cement content of 7. 5 percent, the specimens disintegrated when exposed to field conditions for nine months, while the specimens at 15 percent cement stayed intact. Exposure to manure for nine months did not affect unconfined compressive strength or mass lost during freezing-thawing and wetting-drying. The total cost for installing a 15 cm thick soil cement surface was estimated to be $ 8, 110 per pen.

40|$|For {{trees to}} become {{functionally}} useful within our urban landscapes, {{they need to}} establish and reach a state of healthy, productive maturity. Unfortunately, tree planting is often seen {{as a piece of}} 'window dressing' to assist a development scheme through the planning process, with little thought about the long-term requirements of the planting shown on the drawings and in the promotional visualisations. After all, how difficult can it be? Trees seed themselves and grow naturally in woodlands and forests with no assistance or intervention from us. However, human impacted landscapes such as those found in urban areas bear virtually no relationship to those of woodlands and forests. urban soils have invariably been fundamentally altered through excavation, filling, grading and compaction, compounded by contamination from the construction and use of buildings and roads. Planting sites are often surrounded by the hard materials which typify the built environment and so are subject to high temperatures from reflected and re-radiated energy from the sun. The <b>hard</b> <b>surfacing</b> necessary to facilitate the unimpeded flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic through our urban centres prevents the even spread of rainfall being absorbed by the soil. As a consequence, water availability for plants tends to be highly erratic. Tall buildings can modify the behaviour of wind, sometimes concentrating or funnelling it through gaps and along roads. These are hostile conditions for the majority of plants and can make tree establishment especially problematic. We can see this from national tree surveys...|$|E
40|$|Wear is a {{property}} of material {{to resist the}} component and replace for the functional usage. There are methods to prevent the wear by surface coating that is one, by heat treatment and another by hardfacing by welding. In heat treatment {{it is not possible}} to deposit the coatings on the base metal to maximum thickness. This is possible by hardfacing using welding process. The abrasive wear characteristics of different hardfacing electrodes deposited on Mild steel (M. S) plate was studied using the dry sand rubber wheel abrasion tester. The results illustrates that different hardfacing electrodes as well as the weld procedures variation using the variation of chromium, silicon, and carbon have large effects on the abrasion resistance are mainly attributed to the variation in deposit chemistry and microstructures. Carbon and chromium content is an important factor in determining microstructure of such hardfacing electrodes and therefore abrasive wear resistance. Hardfacing materials tend to be suited to specifications of wear. Further more the prime requirements of a metal part is that it has exceptionally good resistance to wear, corrosion or high temperatures. Rather than make the entire part from expensive wear resistance alloy, it is more economical to make it from ordinary steel and then cover the critical surfaces with a layer of weld metal capable of withstanding the service conditions. The application of a durable surface layer to a metal is called hardfacing and a simple way to apply <b>hard</b> <b>surfacing</b> materials is by arc welding.

To explore the effect of welding fumes on cardiac function, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by intratracheal instillation to 2 mg/rat of manual metal arc <b>hard</b> <b>surfacing</b> welding fume (MMA-HS) once per week for 7 wk. Control rats received saline. Cardiomyocytes were isolated enzymatically at d 1 and 7 postexposure. Intracellular calcium ([Ca(2 +) ]i) transients (fluorescence ratio) were measured on the stage of an inverted phase-contrast microscope using a myocyte calcium imaging/cell length system. Phosphorylation levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were determined by Western blot. The levels of nonspecific inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Contraction of isolated cardiomyocytes was significantly reduced at d 1 and d 7 postexposure. Intracellular calcium levels were decreased in response to extracellular calcium stimulation at d 7 postexposure. Changes of intracellular calcium levels after isoprenaline hydrochloride (ISO) stimulation were not markedly different between groups at either time point. Phosphorylation levels of cTnI in the left ventricle were significantly lower at d 1 postexposure. The serum levels of CRP were not markedly different between groups at either time point. Serum levels of IL- 6 were not detectable in both groups. Cardiomyocyte alterations observed after welding fume treatment were mainly due to alterations in intracellular calcium handling and phosphorylation levels of cTnI.
