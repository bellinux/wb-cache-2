In 1700, five years later, the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry; her <b>inheritance,</b> however, {{remained}} sequestered, and relations with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending <b>inheritance.</b> But with blending <b>inheritance,</b> genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian <b>inheritance.</b> The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic <b>inheritance</b> systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic <b>inheritance</b> systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological <b>inheritance</b> {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the <b>inheritance</b> of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E

40|$|Due to a {{changing}} retirement landscape, many {{baby boomers are}} likely to have insufficient resources for a secure retirement. 1 One potential source that could improve their situation is <b>inheritances.</b> This study quantifies the aggregate amount of <b>inheritances</b> that baby boomers – those individuals born between 1946 and 1964 – can expect to receive over their lifetimes, and the distribution of past and prospective receipts by household type. The discussion is organized as follows. The first section quantifies the aggregate amount that boomers will receive. The second section investigates who will receive how much. The third section considers the impact of the recession on <b>inheritances,</b> specifically the declining values of equities and housing. The final section concludes that, while <b>inheritances</b> will augment the resources of aging baby boomers, they will be insufficient to ensure secure retirements. ...|$|R

Using a household-level panel data set, entry to self-employment is {{shown to be a}} function of household net worth. We use <b>inheritances</b> and unanticipated movements in house prices as instruments for shocks to liquidity. Results indicate that <b>inheritances</b> are a poor instrument for liquidity constraints because both past and future <b>inheritances</b> predict entry to self-employment. House prices shocks are a more plausible instrument because self-employed households disproportionately re-mortgage, but our results again indicate little evidence of house price shocks unbinding liquidity constraints facing the would-be self-employed.

Dynasties that exhibit asexual reproduction and altruism are modeled. Earnings ability, which may be correlated across generations, is exogenous and drawn from a station ary distribution. Taxing <b>inheritances</b> increases inequality by reducing the inter generational averaging of "luck.

40|$|Housing equity {{withdrawal}} (HEW) {{was very}} high in New Zealand. In fact it was at unprecedented levels between 2004 and 2007. It has been postulated that {{a significant proportion of}} this equity withdrawal could be the result of <b>inheritances,</b> which would have increased in value as house prices rose over the period. This report looks at how much of recent HEW might be due to the sale of inherited dwellings. It briefly surveys earlier work on <b>inheritances</b> in New Zealand, and reviews various sources of data on <b>inheritances.</b> It then uses data from household wealth surveys, together with mortality data, to estimate the value of <b>inheritances</b> in 2001 and 2006. Estimates of the equity withdrawn from inherited houses are also derived. The results suggest that transactions related to inherited houses probably accounted for no more than about one-seventh of the change in net HEW between 2001 and 2006. Clearly other factors more active forms of equity withdrawal accounted for most of the change in HEW over the period. Classification-D 31, E 21, E 24...|$|R
