In addition, in view of the re-evaluation of lycopene from tomatoes within the re-evaluation programme of all food colours, the Panel decided to make a global safety assessment of lycopene from all sources. Thus, in the present opinion the Panel evaluates the safety in use of lycopene from different sources as a food colour. Results from animal and human intervention studies with synthetic lycopene or tomato extract as lycopene source indicate that lycopene from these sources is bioavailable. It is expected that lycopene from B. trispora when used in foodstuffs of comparable composition will be bioavailable to a similar extent as lycopene from tomatoes...|$|E
40|$|The {{controversial}} {{topic of}} synthetic dyes in food {{has been discussed}} for many years. The scrutiny and negative assessment of synthetic food dyes by the modern consumer have raised {{a strong interest in}} natural colouring alternatives. Nature is rich in colours (minerals, plants, microalgae, etc.), and pigment-producing microorganisms (fungi, yeasts, bacteria) are quite common. Among the molecules produced by microorganisms are carotenoids, melanins, flavins, quinones, and more specifically monascins, violacein or indigo. The success of any pigment produced by fermentation depends upon its acceptability on the market, regulatory approval, {{and the size of the}} capital investment required to bring the product to market. A few years ago, some expressed doubts about the successful commercialization of fermentation-derived food grade pigments because of the high capital investment requirements for fermentation facilities and the extensive and lengthy toxicity studies required by regulatory agencies. Public perception of biotechnology-derived products also had to be taken into account. Nowadays some fermentative food grade pigments are on the market: Monascus pigments, astaxanthin from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, Arpink Red from Penicillium oxalicum, riboflavin from Ashbya gossypii, b-carotene <b>from</b> <b>Blakeslea</b> <b>trispora.</b> The successful marketing of pigments derived from algae or extracted from plants, both as a food colour and a nutritional supplement, reflects the presence and importance of niche markets in which consumers are willing to pay a premium for »all natural ingredients«...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of carotenoids <b>from</b> <b>Blakeslea</b> <b>trispora</b> cells in a synthetic medium has been reported, {{with the main}} products being β-carotene, lycopene, and γ-carotene. The effect of biomass pretreatment and solvent extraction on their selective recovery is reported here. Eight solvents of class II and III of the International Conference of Harmonization: ethanol, methanol, acetone, 2 -propanol, pentane, hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethyl ether, and HPLC analysis {{were used for the}} evaluation of their selectivities towards the three main carotenoids with regard to different biomass pre-treatment. The average Cmax values (maximum concentration of caronoids in a specific solvent) were estimated to 16 mg/L with the five out of eight solvents investigated, whereas methanol, pentane, and hexane gave lower values of 10, 11, and 9 mg/L, respectively. The highest carotenoid yield was obtained in the case of wet biomass, where 44 - 56 % is recovered with one solvent and three extractions and the rest is recovered only after subsequent treatment with acetone; thus, four extractions of 2. 5 h are needed. Two extractions of 54 min are enough to recover carotenoids from dehydrated biomass, with the disadvantage of a high degree of degradation. Our results showed that, for maximum carotenoid recovery, ethyl ether, 2 -propanol, and ethanol could be successfully used with biomass without prior treatment, whereas fractions enriched in β-carotene or lycopene can be obtained by extraction with the proper solvent, thus avoiding degradation due to time-consuming processes.

The fungus exists in a (+) and (-) mating type, of which the (+) type- DS 30627 - synthesises trisporic acid, a precursor of ß-carotene.

40|$|International audienceGeneral {{aspects of}} the {{production}} and use of carotenoids as colourants and supplements were discussed in Chapter 4. For several decades, these carotenoids have been produced commercially by chemical synthesis or as plant extracts or oleoresins, e. g. of tomato and red pepper. Some unicellular green algae, under appropriate conditions, become red due to the accumulation of high concentrations of ‘secondary’ carotenoids. Two examples, Dunaliella spp. and Haematococcus pluvialis, are cultured extensively as sources of β-carotene (3) and (3 S, 3 ′S) -astaxanthin (406), respectively. Non-photosynthetic microorganisms, i. e. bacteria, yeasts and moulds, may also be strongly pigmented by carotenoids, so commercial production by these organisms is an attractive prospect. Penetration into the food industry by fermentation-derived ingredients is increasing year after year, examples being thickening or gelling agents (xanthan, curdlan, gellan), flavour enhancers (yeast hydrolysate, monosodium glutamate), flavour compounds (γ-decalactone, diacetyl, methyl ketones), and acidulants (lactic acid, citric acid). Fermentation processes for pigment production on a commercial scale were developed later but some are now in use in the food industry, such as production of β-carotene <b>from</b> the fungus <b>Blakeslea</b> <b>trispora,</b> in Europe, and the non-carotenoid heterocyclic pigments from Monascus, in Asia [1 – 3]. Efforts {{have been made to}} reduce the production costs so that pigments produced by fermentation can be competitive with synthetic pigments or with those extracted from natural sources.

The different carbon sources greatly affect the final composition of carotenoids, with lactose medium to preferentially accumulate the all-trans-β-carotene. Furthermore, the use of lactose and starch as carbon sources, respectively, gives a first indication that B. trispora is able to metabolise various homo- and hetero-saccharides, thus leading to different carotenoid percentages. The presence of oils as co-substrates resulted in enhanced fungus growth and subsequent higher carotenoid production. Substrates containing linoleic acid or other oils rich in it led to less lycopene accumulation.
