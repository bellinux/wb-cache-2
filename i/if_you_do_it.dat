500|$|He led the AL in power-speed#, with a 31.0. Through 2009, he had {{the second-highest}} steal success rate among active players with at least 100 attempts, at 87.5% (91-of-104). Carlos Beltrán was the best, at 88.3%. Sharing his {{philosophy}} on stealing bases, he said: [...] "It takes the art of stealing away <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> when you're four runs up or four runs down, and the opposing team is just worried about getting outs, not stolen bases. The idea is to steal them when you need them." ...|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki {{began his}} racing {{career as a}} 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work {{involved}} travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying {{to find someone to}} transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for a while, you can do it better.'" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> will be great. If you don't, it will suck." ...|$|E

500|$|Wolpaw {{said that}} while many story {{elements}} of Portal are revisited in Portal 2, he avoided some of the memes—such as the frequently repeated [...] "the cake is a lie". He said, [...] "if {{you thought you were}} sick of the memes, I was sick of it way ahead of you". Wolpaw [...] "couldn't resist putting in just one" [...] cake joke. The writers did not try to predict or write new memes, and Wolpaw said, [...] "you can't really plan for [...] because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> probably seems weird and forced". Portal 2 produced its own memes, including a space-obsessed personality core. Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game [...] (see below), and the Space Core also appeared as a laser-based engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station.|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most {{of the time we}} have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{was missing}} for a {{performance}} one evening, and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman. He broke up the tête-à-tête with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both, and ordered Lennon onto the stage. Lennon was furious, and complained {{that he could not}} go on stage dripping wet. Fascher snapped back: [...] "I don't give a shit, you're going onstage and I don't care <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> naked." [...] A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter. Fascher ran to see what the commotion was, and saw Lennon playing guitar, but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck. (Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants). Fascher's brother, Fred, sang lead vocals with the group on [...] "Be Bop A Lula", while he sang with them on [...] "Hallelujah I Love Her So", and his alliance with the Beatles continued, as he later went to work at the Star-Club.|$|E

500|$|In Cowboys & Aliens, Director Jon Favreau sought [...] a {{plausible}} approach to how humans {{from the late}} 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, [...] "It was very well laid out, well planned, {{and there were a}} lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step." [...] The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, [...] "It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in Independence Day." [...] Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own, referencing Alien, Predator, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He said of both genres, [...] "It's about finding the intersection of those two genres [...] [...] [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Cowboy Jack Clement, {{who took}} over {{production}} duties from Sam Phillips, [...] "There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound comes along and it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, {{it goes to the}} playback head. But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, you can have a separate machine and do that. <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
2500|$|Uber {{announced}} on September 25, 2016, {{that it was}} looking into urban transportation with flying vehicles. At Re/code's Nantucket Conference, the head of Uber's products, Jeff Holden stated that the company wanted to [...] "someday offer our customers as many options as possible to move around ... {{doing it in a}} three-dimensional way is an obvious thing to look at." [...] A statement at the American Helicopter Society International-led joint workshop on Transformative Vertical Flight on September 29, Uber product manager Nikhil Goel stated that [...] "To us, urban air transportation is simply a key initiative or our mission, right? Not only because it can cut congestion – it's got massive potential to do that – but it allows us to move people from Point A to B much, much faster than you would otherwise. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in all-electric vehicles, you can do it with zero emissions." [...] Uber published a 99-page [...] "white paper" [...] exploring the possibility of developing a [...] "fully electric, vertical-takeoff-and-landing plane" [...] network (called [...] "Elevate") within ten years, for use in short journeys. Although technically feasible, the development of such a program is expected to encounter safety and regulatory obstacles.|$|E
