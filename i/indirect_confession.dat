[...] After performing a Freudian-based analysis of the ode, William Galperin, in 1989, argues that [...] "Criticism, in short, cannot accept responsibility for The Excursions failings any more than it is likely to attribute the success of the 'Intimations Ode' to the satisfaction it offers in seeing a sense of entitlement, or self-worth, defended rather than challenged." ...|$|E

50|$|Gilmore tells several {{previously}} unrevealed {{stories at}} once, each filled {{with its own}} bizarre elements through which the book transcends the true crime genre. One is the tale of victim Elizabeth Short, small-town beauty queen with big hopes, who seemed to float through her tragically futile life as an alluring yet doom-laden enigma. Another is the tangled inside story of the police investigation and the remorseless, Hearststoked press hoopla that paralled it. Finally Gilmore reveals the twisted psychology and down-and-out life story of the actual murderer— {{as well as the}} startling circumstances and gruesome details of the killer's <b>indirect</b> <b>confessions</b> to him. The book contains a thirty-two-page photo section with many never before-published photos from the life of Elizabeth Short and from the case, including graphic crime scene and postmortem police photos.|$|R
