40|$|The {{quantitative}} and structural analysis of proteins {{is of great}} importance in numerous fields (from industrial to academic research). Requirements like ease of analysis, sample handling, robustness, analysis time, the amount of analytical information provided and affordability may all be essential and {{must be taken into}} account when developing any analytical method. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a highly attractive method that can fulfill many of these requirements and has an ever-increasing number of applications aimed towards the study of proteins, based either on the use of intrinsic fluorescence or extrinsic labels. 	One of the most important industrial sectors where new protein analysis techniques are in great demand is the BioPharma manufacturing industry. A typical bioprocess consists of growing cells or cell components (predominantly mammalian cells) in culture media (complex and often ill-defined mixtures) in order to produce recombinant therapeutic proteins. During these processes, proteins not only represent the final product (i. e. glycoproteins), but are also often used as additives (i. e. albumins, insulins) in some, if not most, culture media. Therefore, in many parts of the bioprocess it is vitally important to be able to measure both protein concentration and stability. This is especially challenging when the matrix (i. e. cell culture media or bioprocess broth) in which the protein is located is chemically complex. The first part of this thesis research was based on developing new fluorescence based methods for the quantitative analysis of proteins in highly complex biogenic mixtures (which are themselves intrinsically fluorescent). Due to the complexity of such mixtures, the main issue was the unambiguous discrimination of protein emission from that of free amino acids present in the media. Anisotropy/polarization was the method of <b>emission</b> <b>discrimination</b> used and was integrated into multi-dimensional fluorescence (MDF) measurements (Chapter 3). This new method enabled the protein signal to be isolated based on the proteinâs size compared to the free amino acids in media and enabled accurate protein concentration measurements (Chapter 4). 	The MDF anisotropy spectra of albumin solutions showed a striped pattern that was a unique feature of multi-fluorophore proteins. We also noticed that these MDF anisotropy patterns changed differently depending on the specific unfolding pathway. The emission of albumins is complicated because of the multiple fluorophores present (Trp, Tyr, and to a lesser extent Phe). Combining anisotropy with MDF and chemometric data analysis allowed us to resolve emission from groups of Tyr and Trp and obtain a more in-depth understanding of the structural changes that occur compared to conventional fluorescence spectroscopy. Chemometric data analysis was used to extract the contributions of individual emitting fluorophores to the overall anisotropy pattern changes of human serum albumin during thermal and chemical unfolding. This new method was called Anisotropy Resolved Multi-dimensional Emission Spectroscopy (ARMES) and allowed for the tracking of specific protein domains during different unfolding/refolding processes (Chapter 5). 	Chapter 6 focuses on the similarities and differences in photo-physics and unfolding/refolding behavior of human and bovine serum albumins. HSA and BSA, although are structurally very similar, they produced different MDF anisotropy patterns. The main differences in the photo-physics of the two albumins came from the extra Trp present in BSA. Although these differences are well known, the ARMES method represented a new way of comparing proteins based on their polarized emission and anisotropy patterns. ARMES analysis resolved the contribution of the second Trp residue in BSA and was used to track the slightly different unfolding pathway of BSA compared to HSA. 	In the final part of the thesis (Chapter 7), the ARMES method was used to assess the more subtle protein structural changes that occur during processes such as: flash freezing/thawing (used for storing of protein products or to decouple the protein purification step in a bioprocess cycle), exposure to repeated thermal cycles and refolding upon cooling. In this chapter, the ARMES method, as it is currently implemented, was tested to its limits. ARMES showed that there were some small structural changes induced by different freezing methods, for example, but the errors associated with the chemometric data analysis were too high for a conclusive interpretation of results. 2017 - 03 - 2...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of a nuisance-emissions-discriminating smart mine fire sensor system was made in an operating coal mine. These field evaluations were conducted to determine the sensor system's ability to discern nuisance emissions, such as diesel exhaust, emissions from flame cutting and welding operations or hydrogen gas from a charging station, from real fires and to compare the number of falsely reported fire alarms generated between the sensor system and a standard carbon monoxide (CO) monitor. The sensor system's ability to operate successfully in the working environment of an operating coal mine was also evaluated. The smart mine fire sensor system consisted of four sensors whose data outputs were fused {{with the use of}} a neural-network-type computer program. Long-term trials were conducted in a haulage way, a belt entry, and a track entry. The system functioned successfully in the belt entry, in accordance with its developmental goals, where the sensor system even discriminated events not anticipated during development. It was not totally effective in the haulage way and track entry, though, due to a combination of significant diurnal air temperature variations, dust, and mechanically induced vibrations. Also, deteriorating rib conditions contributed to operational problems in the haulage way evaluation. In general, the smart mine fire sensor provided nuisance <b>emissions</b> <b>discrimination</b> and was shown to be a viable new approach for mine atmospheric monitoring, enhancing miner safety. This paper describes the in-mine {{evaluation of}} the smart mine fire sensor system and discusses recommendations for improving the system...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} CO 2 and NOx {{emissions}} from 149 Euro 5 and 6 diesel, gasoline and hybrid passenger cars were compared using a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). The models sampled accounted for 56 % of all passenger cars sold in Europe in 2016. We found gasoline vehicles had CO 2 emissions 13 - 66 % higher than diesel. During urban driving, the average CO 2 emission factor was 210. 5 (sd. 47) gkm- 1 for gasoline and 170. 2 (sd. 34) gkm- 1 for diesel. Half the gasoline vehicles tested were Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI). Euro 6 GDI engines < 1. 4 ℓ delivered ~ 17 % CO 2 reduction compared to Port Fuel Injection (PFI). Gasoline vehicles delivered an 86 - 96 % reduction in NOx emissions compared to diesel cars. The average urban NOx emission from Euro 6 diesel vehicles 0. 44 (sd. 0. 44) gkm- 1 was 11 {{times higher than}} for gasoline 0. 04 (sd. 0. 04) gkm- 1. We also analysed two gasoline-electric hybrids which out-performed both gasoline and diesel for NOx and CO 2. We conclude action is required to mitigate the public health risk created by excessive NOx emissions from modern diesel vehicles. Replacing diesel with gasoline would incur a substantial CO 2 penalty, however greater uptake of hybrid vehicles would likely reduce both CO 2 and NOx <b>emissions.</b> <b>Discrimination</b> of vehicles {{on the basis of}} Euro standard is arbitrary and incentives should promote vehicles with the lowest real-world emissions of both NOx and CO 2...|$|R

The fluorescence excitation and emission matrix {{was used to measure}} for defects, sound surface and stem areas to determine the optimal fluorescence excitation and <b>emission</b> wavelengths for <b>discrimination.</b> Two-way ANOVA revealed the optimal excitation wavelength for detecting defect areas was 410 nm. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the fluorescence emission spectra of all regions at 410 nm excitation to determine the emission wavelengths for defect detection. The major emission wavelengths were 688 nm and 506 nm for the detection. Fluorescence images combined with the determined emission wavebands demonstrated the feasibility of detecting defective cherry tomatoes with > 98 % accuracy.

40|$|Two {{common types}} of wood (beech and fir) were burned in {{commercial}} pellet (11. 1 kW) and wood (8. 2 kW) stoves following a combustion cycle simulating {{the behavior of}} a real-world user. Ultrafine particulate matter (UFP, dp< 100 nm) was sampled with three parallel multistage impactors and analyzed for metals, main water soluble ions, anhydrosugars, total carbon, and PAH content. The measurement of the number concentration and size distribution was also performed by a fourth multistage impactor. UFP mass emission factors averaged to 424 mg/kgfuel for all the tested stove and wood type (fir, beech) combinations except for beech log burning in the wood stove (838 mg/kgfuel). Compositional differences were observed for pellets and wood UFP samples, where high TC levels characterize the wood log combustion and potassium salts are dominant in every pellet sample. Crucial aspects determining the UFP composition in the wood stove experiments are critical situations in terms of available oxygen (a lack or an excess of combustion air) and high temperatures. Whereas for the automatically controlled pellets stove local situations (e. g., hindered air-fuel mixing due to heaps of pellets on the burner pot) determine the emission levels and composition. Wood samples contain more potentially carcinogenic PAHs with respect to pellets samples. Some diagnostic ratios related to PAH isomers and anhydrosugars compiled from experimental UFP data in the present study and compared to literature values proposed for the <b>emission</b> source <b>discrimination</b> for atmospheric aerosol, extend the evaluation usually limited to higher particle size fractions also to UFP...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{the most}} {{difficult}} task in developing devices for fluorescence ratiometric sensing is the isolation of signals from overlapping <b>emission</b> wavelengths. Wavelength <b>discrimination</b> {{can be achieved by}} using monochromators or bandpass filters, which often lead to decreased signal intensities. The result is a device that is both complex and expensive. Here we present an alternative system—a low-cost standalone optical fluorimeter based on luminescence lifetime assisted ratiometric sensing (LARS). This paper describes the principle of this technique and the overall design of the sensor device. The most significant innovation of LARS is the ability to discriminate between two overlapping luminescence signals based on differences in their luminescence decay rates. Thus, minimal filtering is required and the two signals can be isolated despite significant overlap of luminescence spectra. The result is a device that is both simple and inexpensive. The electronic circuit employs the lock-in amplification technique for the signal processing and the system is controlled by an onboard microcontroller. In addition, the system is designed to communicate with external devices via Bluetooth...|$|R
