While often clashing with British officials on civic issues, he did not show any interest in politics. Upon hearing of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, he joked to the lawyer and political activist, Ganesh Vasudev Mavlankar, that [...] "Gandhi would ask you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> shift pebbles from wheat. And {{that is supposed to}} bring independence." [...] A subsequent meeting with Gandhi, in October 1917 brought a radical change in Patel and ushered him into the Indian independence struggle.|$|E

6000|$|... "'I {{should think}} he was,' said the young woman. 'In fact, I {{think you are}} a funny lot, toll-gate woman and all. Now here is a quarter; please take the toll and give me the change, that is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> calculate.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, satin is too dignified, and chiffon too perishable, {{and blue}} net is too tessie. Why don't you try black net over black satin? You know there's really lots {{of color in}} black satin <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use it.

6000|$|... 'Savages are all Fridays, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> treat them' is {{a saying}} of Patteson's {{in one of}} his letters, and a true one. In truth, there was no word that he so entirely repudiated as this of savage, and the {{courtesy}} and untutored dignity of many of his native friends fully justified his view, since it was sure to be called forth by his own conduct towards them.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{light has}} come, Baas. Shall I blow out the candle, {{which it is}} a pity to waste? Also, does the Baas wish me to cook the breakfast, now that the snake devil is making his off Bena, as I hope to make mine off him before all is done.

He's an old soldier--also on sick-leave, though he does not look like it. He came originally from the west of Ireland, I believe; but there's little of the Irishman left, save the brogue and the honesty.

60|$|So I said it again, and he {{said his}} again, and I said mine again, and then he did, and then I did, and then he did, and we kept on doing it, and doing it, and I never had such a good time, {{and he said}} the same.

60|$|We bound this beast {{with leather}} thongs of the punkah-rope, and tied its thumbs and big toes together, and gagged {{it with a}} shoe-horn, which makes a very {{efficient}} gag <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> arrange it. Then we carried it into the dining-room, and sent a man to Dumoise, the doctor, telling him to come over at once. After we had despatched the messenger and were drawing breath, Strickland said, 'It's no good. This isn't any doctor's work.' I, also, knew that he spoke the truth.|$|E
60|$|This {{will be a}} short letter, but I {{hope not}} unwelcome. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> often I write to you--in intention--I don't <b>know</b> where <b>you</b> would find room for the correspondence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't go just yet, dear Constance," [...] she said. [...] "Why {{do you try}} to--shut me out of your heart? Oh, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> much--how {{very much}} I feel for you!" ...|$|R
