50|$|The actual {{effectiveness}} of the wall is disputable, given the relatively small size of the city's garrison. The entire combined strength of the Praetorian Guard, cohortes urbanae, and vigiles of Rome was only about 25,000 men - far too few to defend the circuit adequately. However, the military intention of the wall was not to withstand prolonged siege warfare; it was not common for the barbarian armies to besiege cities, as they were insufficiently equipped and provisioned for such a task. Instead, they carried out <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>raids</b> against ill-defended targets. The wall was a deterrent against such tactics.|$|R

Thereafter it had confined itself to <b>hit-and-run</b> <b>raids</b> on British coastal towns. Meanwhile, the RAFs night bombing offensive had been shown to be largely ineffective, culminating in the Butt report in August 1941, and by Christmas the offensive had largely petered out.|$|R

In July, however, Leclerc ordered Sans-Souci's arrest, suspecting him of plotting a rebellion. But before he could be arrested Sans-Souci defected back to the rebel side.
