25|$|The {{number of}} {{varieties}} of cheese made in Mexico is uncertain because different regions can have different {{names for the}} same cheese or different cheeses called by the same name. Most {{of the most popular}} varieties are <b>fresh</b> <b>cheeses,</b> such as queso fresco, panela and asadero. The two most popular aged cheeses are Cotija and Chihuahua. Four cheeses produced in Mexico are entirely Mexican inventions: Oaxaca, Cotija, and Chihuahua and manchego. The last shares its name with the Spanish cheese, but in Spain it is made with sheep’s milk and Mexican manchego is made with cows’ or cows’ and goats’ milk. Many of Mexico’s cheeses are regional specialties, but the most common ones mentioned here are known and made throughout the country. Most of the time cheese is used to top dishes as a condiment rather than as a main ingredient.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{commercial}} starter cultures in <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> production from pasteurized milk {{results in the}} loss of typical characteristics of artisan <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> due to the replacement of complex native microbiota with a defined starter culture. Hence, the aim of this research is to isolate and characterize dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in artisan <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> and to evaluate their capacity as autochthonous starter cultures for <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> production. Fifteen most prevalent Gram-positive, catalase-negative and asporogenous bacterial strains were selected for a more detailed characterization. Eleven lactic acid bacterial strains were determined to be homofermentative cocci and four heterofermentative lactobacilli. Further phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that those were two different LAB strains with high acidifying and proteolytic activity, identified as Lactobacillus fermentum A 8 and Enterococcus faecium A 7. These two autochthonous strains, alone or in combination with commercial starter, were used to produce different types of <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese,</b> which were evaluated by a panel. Conventional culturing, isolation, identification and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) procedures, applied to the total <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> DNA extracts, were employed to define and monitor the viability of the introduced LAB strains and their effect on the final product characteristics. Production of <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> using a combination {{of commercial}} starter culture and selected autochthonous strains resulted in improved sensorial properties, which were more similar to the ones of spontaneously fermented <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> than to those of cheese produced with only starter culture or selected strains. After 10 days of storage, that cheese retained the best sensorial properties in comparison with all other types of cheese. The presence of inoculated autochthonous and starter cultures and their identification was demonstrated by DGGE analysis. The obtained results indicate that autochthonous strains have a strong potential to enrich the flavour of industrially produced <b>fresh</b> type <b>cheese</b> under controlled conditions...|$|R
40|$|Freshly {{prepared}} rennet-coagulated {{soft cheese}} was high-pressure (HP) treated {{at up to}} 291 MPa and 29 min and using a full 2 -factor central composite design of experiment, its physico-chemical properties (colour, fat, lipid oxidation, moisture and protein content, pH, and texture) were examined. HP treatment influenced significantly (p< 0. 05) the colour, fat, moisture, lipid oxidation, hardness and adhesiveness of the <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese.</b> Fat content increased apparently as moisture decreased significantly after HP treatment of above 100 MPa. Increased pressures reduced lipid oxidation but increased yellowness although the latter showed more effect over redness in the HP-treated <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese.</b> Also, increased pressures increased hardness, decreased acidity and adhesiveness in HP-treated <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> although increased exposure was found to increase acidity.

50|$|Some <b>fresh</b> <b>cheeses</b> are curdled only by acidity, {{but most}} cheeses also use rennet. Rennet sets the cheese into {{a strong and}} rubbery gel {{compared}} to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity—important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, fresher cheeses are curdled with {{a greater proportion of}} acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.|$|E
