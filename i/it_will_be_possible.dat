25|$|Provision {{has been}} made for the {{building}} of a section of tunnel below the rail tracks for the planned extension of the Berlin city ringroad (construction phase 17). This is 130 metres-long and consists of 3,000 m² of reinforced concrete floor, supported by 20 to 30 metres-deep diaphragm walls. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to build the road tunnel without further interruption of rail traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} Nuremberg and Fürth will receive an {{additional}} two tracks, {{with a pair}} of tracks being assigned to the Nuremberg S-Bahn in the future. The 7.6kilometre-long line will be able to be operated at up to 160km/h. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to operate all four tracks in both directions and they will run directly to Nuremberg station. In addition to the four-track upgrade between Nuremberg and Fürth, there are several essentially local measures, in particular the elimination of level crossings.|$|E

The trust is currently working to restore part {{of the line and}} is working with the Rotorua District Council to assist with its plans to continue the national cycleway system in the District. Once the track is repaired, the trust hopes that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> for freight and passenger services to resume, with steam enthusiast operators from around New Zealand, able to bring their own excursion trains to Rotorua.|$|E

He argues for his procedure to Trajan {{by saying that the}} temples and religious festivals, which before had been deserted, are now flourishing again {{and that there is a}} rising demand for sacrificial animals once more – a dip and rise which A.N. Sherwin-White believes is an exaggeration of the toll Christianity had taken on the traditional cult.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of the mind is {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.|$|E

25|$|In February 2015, TEPCO {{started the}} muon {{scanning}} process for Units 1, 2, and 3. With this scanning setup <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> {{to determine the}} approximate amount and location of the remaining nuclear fuel within the RPV, but not the amount and resting place of the corium in the PCV. In March 2015 TEPCO released {{the result of the}} muon scan for Unit 1 which showed that no fuel was visible in the RPV, which would suggest that most if not all of the molten fuel had dropped onto the bottom of the PCV – this will change the plan for the removal of the fuel from Unit 1.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and reasoning {{are a key}} enabling technology for the Semantic web. Languages based on the Frame model with automatic classification provide a layer of semantics {{on top of the}} existing Internet. Rather than searching via text strings as is typical today <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to define logical queries and find pages that map to those queries. The automated reasoning component in these systems is an engine known as the classifier. Classifiers focus on the subsumption relations in a knowledge base rather than rules. A classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology as new information becomes available. This capability is ideal for the ever changing and evolving information space of the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The table shows average {{temperatures}} in degrees Celsius at ten Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) weather stations in Scania and three stations further north for comparison issues. Average temperature {{in this case}} means {{the average of the}} temperature taken throughout both day and night unlike the more usual daily maximum or minimum average. This is done for specific measured periods of thirty years. The last period began at 1 January 1961 and ended at 31 December 1990. The current such period started at 1 January 1991 and will end by 31 December 2020.

She did acknowledge the widening gap between {{the rich and the poor}} in Taiwan as well as the younger generations dissatisfaction towards the government that also exist in many other countries due to the global trend of moving towards free trade. She said that the government would be more open and tolerant to negotiate with the public and take challenges.|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean to tell us that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E
500|$|Accum became {{involved}} with the production of gas for lighting purposes {{through the efforts of}} Friedrich Albert Winsor (1763–1830), another German émigré, who had been waging a longstanding publicity campaign. In 1809, Accum was asked to appear before a Parliamentary committee that was considering granting a charter for a gaslight company Winsor had been promoting. While unsuccessful in its first attempt, the bill passed in 1810 and the company was incorporated under the name [...] "Gas Light and Coke Company". The newly incorporated company met the conditions laid out in the bill and began operating in 1812 with Accum as a member of its board of directors. Accum oversaw the construction of a gas plant on Curtain Road, which was the first such plant in the history of gaslight. After that time, gaslight was no longer limited to industrial mills and was introduced into urban life. Westminster Bridge was lighted with gas lamps in 1813, and a year later, the streets in Westminster followed. In 1815, Accum published [...] "Description of the Process of Manufacturing Coal-Gas". In the introduction, Accum compared the newly formed gas utility with the water companies that had been operating in London since the early 18th century: [...] "Through gas, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to have light in all rooms, as is presently the case with water." [...] When this book was translated into German in Berlin in 1815, an explanatory note had to be added, as no such water utilities existed there: [...] "There are many private homes in England that are provided with pipes in the walls so that in almost all rooms, all one needs to do to get water is open a faucet." ...|$|E
