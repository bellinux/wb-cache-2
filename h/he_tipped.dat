5|$|The {{first half}} was dull. Brugge held back, using tight marking and the offside trap to {{restrict}} Liverpool's attacking threat. Towards {{the end of}} the first half, Liverpool started to have more scoring chances. Ray Kennedy volleyed across the face of the goal, and Jimmy Case took a free kick that needed to be punched away by Brugge goalkeeper Birger Jensen. In the closing minutes of the first half, Jensen made two crucial saves: he blocked David Fairclough, who had made a run towards goal, and <b>he</b> <b>tipped</b> a header by Alan Hansen over the crossbar. So the score at half-time was 0–0.|$|E

Liverpool did score on the hour mark, but the goal was disallowed. García's headed goal was ruled out for offside. Soon afterwards Morientes had another chance to score, but his overhead kick went over the crossbar. Liverpool had another goal disallowed soon afterwards.

5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which <b>he</b> <b>tipped</b> his cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 1973, Dean {{began his}} {{testimony}} before the Senate Watergate Committee. The committee had voted to grant him use immunity (doing so in a divided vote in a private session that was then changed to a unanimous vote and announced that way to the public). In his testimony, Dean implicated administration officials, including Nixon fund-raiser and former Attorney General John Mitchell, Nixon, and himself. Dean's testimony attracted very high television ratings since he was breaking new ground in the investigation, and media attention grew apace, with more detailed newspaper coverage. Dean was the first administration official to accuse Nixon of direct involvement with Watergate and the resulting cover-up in press interviews. Such testimony against Nixon, while damaging to the president's credibility, had little impact legally, as it was merely his word against Nixon's. Nixon vigorously denied all accusations against {{him that he had}} authorized a cover-up, and Dean had no corroboration beyond various notes he had taken in his meetings with the president. It was not until information about secret White House tape recordings having been made by President Nixon (disclosed in testimony by Alexander Butterfield, on July 16, 1973) and the tapes having been subpoenaed and analyzed that many of Dean's accusations were largely substantiated. Earlier, Dean had had suspicions that Nixon was taping conversations, but had not known this for sure, and <b>he</b> <b>tipped</b> prosecutors to ask witnesses questions along this line, leading to Butterfield's revelations.|$|E
500|$|In January 1993, Tom Gosinski, an AVMT {{employee}} who had discovered her illegal drug use, was terminated on budgetary grounds. [...] Subsequently, <b>he</b> <b>tipped</b> off the Drug Enforcement Administration about her prior actions {{and a federal}} investigation ensued. McCain's defense team, led by John McCain's Keating Five lawyer John Dowd, secured {{an agreement with the}} U.S. Attorney's office for McCain, a first-time offender, which avoided charges while requiring her to pay financial restitution, enroll in a diversion program and do community service. Meanwhile, in early 1994, Gosinski filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against McCain, in which he alleged she ordered him to conceal [...] "improper acts" [...] and [...] "misrepresent facts in a judicial proceeding"; he told her he would settle for $250,000. [...] In response, Dowd characterized this request as blackmail, and requested Maricopa County attorney Rick Romley to investigate Gosinski for extortion. In the end, Gosinski's credibility was undermined by testimony in Romley's report from other charity staffers who asserted Gosinski privately vowed to blackmail McCain were he ever fired, and both Gosinski's lawsuit and the extortion investigation against him were dropped.|$|E

He {{advocated}} free TV licences for elderly people and was against museum entrance charges. Archer voted against restoring capital punishment, saying it was barbaric and obscene. In 1971, he employed David Mellor, then needing money for his bar finals, to deal with his correspondence. <b>He</b> <b>tipped</b> Mellor to reach the cabinet.

In 1976, after having encouraged Al Gore to consider entering public life, <b>he</b> <b>tipped</b> off Gore that a nearby U. S. House representative was retiring. In 1981, Seigenthaler urged Sen. Sasser to return to the Democratic party's [...] "liberal tradition": [...] "I keep telling him that Reagan's going to make it respectable to be a liberal." [...] In 1984, Reagan's reelection team vetoed Seigenthaler as a debate panelist for being too liberal.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{did meet}} each other on one occasion, purely by chance, in August 1879, while Tchaikovsky was staying at the Meck estate at Simaki.

2500|$|Adelaide {{continued}} to dominate proceedings {{in the second}} half and Mabil wasted another chance just after the break, blazing over the bar once again after some neat build up play from Cirio. The hosts took full advantage when Risdon's tug on Carrusca's shorts saw him earn a second yellow card just before the hour mark and the deadlock was broken not 10 minutes later. Carrusca slipped Cirio through {{from the edge of the}} area, and the player rounded Vukovic and slotted his shot from a tight angle. Perth had Vukovic to thank for keeping the score at 1–0 when <b>he</b> <b>tipped</b> over a 30-metre shot from Isaías with five minutes remaining. Late into the match, Adelaide [...] were content to maintain possession and saw out the final few minutes without any incident, ensuring they held on for the win.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's claim that <b>he</b> <b>tipped</b> off Patterson exactly {{where to look}} for a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
