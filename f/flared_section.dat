In the page about pipes and harmonics, we saw that closed conical pipes have resonances whose frequencies are both higher and more closely spaced than those of a closed cylindrical pipe. So one can think of introducing a conical or <b>flared</b> <b>section</b> of the pipe as raising the frequencies of the standing waves, and raising the frequencies of the low pitched resonances most of all. The bell also contributes to this effect: in the rapidly flaring bell, the long waves (with the low pitches) are least able to follow {{the curve of the}} bell and so are effectively reflected earlier than are the shorter waves. (This is because their wavelengths are very much longer than the radius of curvature of the bell.) One might say therefore that the long waves 'see' an effectively shorter pipe." ...|$|E

The current project presents design of Quad-Ridge Flare Horn (QRFH) for 1 - 4 GHz band. The Horn utilizes coax line to quad-ridge waveguide transition and <b>flared</b> exponential <b>section.</b> Those two parts are first modeled and analyzed independently {{and then they}} are optimized together for achieving the desired antenna performance. The feeding part is implemented as coax line to quad-ridge waveguide transition. Airline and dielectric coaxial feeding approaches has been studied as alternatives for dual polarized quad ridge waveguide with impedance of 50 Ω. The transition is terminated with back short. Two different parametric models were built in CST to evaluate the reflection coefficient and optimize it over 4 : 1 bandwidth. The <b>flare</b> <b>section</b> was modeled in MATLAB by using exponential function to match it over 4 : 1 bandwidth.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that quad-ridged horn antennas in general have {{impedance}} and radiation characteristics that are significantly worse than that of their double-ridged counterparts. Normally a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of 3 over the operational bandwidth is used for the design specification of quad-ridged horn antennas. The bandwidth of operation is severely restricted due to the excitation of higher order modes in the co-axial to waveguide transition of the antenna. The higher order modes cause a break-up in the radiation pattern of the antenna and large dips in the boresight gain. The performance of the quad-ridged horn antenna with pyramidal sidewalls is improved by separating the antenna into the transition and <b>flared</b> horn <b>sections,</b> and optimizing these sections individually. It is shown that a transition section with a pyramidal cavity and steps, and a <b>flared</b> horn <b>section</b> with an exponential profile with a circular segment for the ridges deliver the best performance. These configurations for the transition and <b>flared</b> horn <b>sections</b> are combined in the complete antenna. The optimized antenna has a 12. 5 : 1 operational bandwidth with improved performance in terms of the VSWR, the coupling between the ports and the boresight gain. A prototype of this antenna is manufactured. Good agreement between the measured and simulated performance is achieved.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{installation}} of a second superconducting wiggler in the SRS in 1992 [1] was the second major upgrade to the light source, the first having been a lattice upgrade to achieve higher brightness in 1986 / 87.

40|$|Water {{entry and}} exit, green water on deck, {{sloshing}} in tanks and capsizing in intact and damaged conditions are examples on violent fluid motion. The combination of model tests, theoretical analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods is emphasized in treating these problems. Because mixing {{of air and}} liquid may occur, {{the interaction between the}} flow in the air and in the liquid ought to be considered in numerical simulations. Further, the mixing of air and liquid represents a scaling problem of model tests. In order to make a rational step in improving the analysis of nonlinear wave-induced ship motions and loads, it is necessary to base a solution on the Navier-Stokes equations, i. e. a CFD method has to be used. The Constrained Interpolation Profile (CIP) method described in this thesis is used as a CFD method for exterior water-body interaction studies. Because it is a rather new method, careful validation and verification are needed. This includes linear flow cases and sub-problems associated with large amplitude water entry and exit. In this method, the solid body and free surface interaction is treated as a multiphase problem, which includes liquid (water), gas (air) and solid (rectangular cylinder, circular cylinder, bow <b>flare</b> <b>section,</b> V-shaped section, etc.) phases. The flow is represented by one set of governing equations, which are solved numerically on a non-uniform, staggered Cartesian grid by a finite difference method. The free surface as well as the body boundary is immersed in the computational domain. First of all, linear and weakly nonlinear wave-body interaction problems are investigated by using a CIP-based finite difference method. The numerical wave tank (NWT) encounters difficulties in handling the long time simulation of large amplitude motions. Therefore, the wave-body interaction problem is isolated into water entry and water exit sub-problems. This thesis describes the fully nonlinear free-surface deformations of initially calm water caused by water-entry and water-exit of a horizontal circular cylinder with both forced and free vertical motions. This has relevance for marine operations {{as well as for the}} ability to predict large amplitude motions of floating sea structures. The numerical results of the water entry and exit force, the free surface deformation and the vertical motion of the cylinder are compared with experimental results, and favorable agreement is obtained. The CIP method is also applied to 2 D water entry of vertical and heeled bow <b>flare</b> and Vshaped <b>sections.</b> The results for the bow <b>flare</b> <b>section</b> have relevance for slamming loads on a ship in bow sea with large roll oscillations and relative vertical motions. The results for the heeled V-shaped section can be combined with a 2 D+t numerical method to study how the steady heel moment on a prismatic planing hull on a straight course in calm water depends on the Froude number (Faltinsen, 2005). A generally satisfactory agreement with experimental drop test results of vertical water entry velocity, vertical and horizontal hydrodynamic forces as a function of time is demonstrated. This includes the effect of flow separation from the knuckles. The experimental results have bias errors due to eigenfrequency oscillations of the test rig and the use of elastic ropes to stop the models. The occurrence of ventilation of the leeward hull side is examined. An example on 3 D calculations by means of the CIP method is presented. Green water on the deck of a Wigley hull at Froude number 0. 25 in head sea is studied. Our studies are a step towards developing rational CFD methods for predicting strongly nonlinear wave-induced motions and loads on a ship. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

The measurements were obtained in flight from a rocket-propelled model up to a peak Mach number of 4. 08 and a peak Reynolds number of 22 x 10 (exp 6) per foot. Temperature distributions indicated that the heating on the forward 3. 5 inches of the 100 deg cone was lower than the heating on the rearward portion. Likewise, measured temperatures on the flare portion of the test nose were generally lower than the temperatures on the 100 deg cone portion. The data indicated that the local Reynolds numbers of transition, based on calculated boundary-layer momentum thicknesses, ranged from 530 to 940 for a Mach number range from 2. 72 to 3. 75. Comparison of measured cone pressures with theory for a sharp cone showed that theory overestimates the cone pressures. Pressure measurements on the flare portion of the nose showed that in the lower speed range the flow expands below atmospheric pressure in going from the cone to the flare; however, as the speed increased, the expansion diminished and for speeds greater than a Mach number of approximately 3. 0 the flare pressure coefficients were at or near a value of zero...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{both the}} release of energy in solar flares, and the {{acceleration}} and transport of particles in various astrophysical situations. While numerical simulations are central to this thesis, these are always motivated by analytical arguments. A review of flare energy release is given in Chapter 2, with results presented in Chapters 3 and 4. The main goal of the flare work is to investigate the effect of viscosity on energy release rates. Scaling arguments and exact solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equations are used {{to interpret the results}} of two-dimensional numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection. The results support viscous energy dissipation accounting for a significant fraction of flare energy release. Chapter 5 contains an introduction to astrophysical particle acceleration, using the Fokker-Planck formulation. The theory introduced in this chapter is used to study electron transport in solar <b>flare</b> loops (<b>Section</b> 5. 5). A key aspect of the analysis is the expression of the Fokker-Planck equation as a system of stochastic differential equations. A generalisation to the flare loop hard X-ray emission prediction of Conway et al. (1998) is obtained, giving a stronger dependence on density for dispersed initial distributions. Chapter 6 uses the methods of the previous chapter to study the acceleration of cosmic-rays at the heliospheric termination shock. The applicability of the focused acceleration mechanism of Schlickeiser and Shalchi (2008) is examined using numerical simulations, which are interpreted using analytical arguments based on averaging the stochastic equations. The results show significant limitations in assuming a near-isotropic distribution, a requirement for the focused acceleration mechanism. In addition, momentum diffusion provides a significant effect that cannot be neglected. The theory is extended to include focused deceleration and pure momentum diffusion...|$|R
40|$|The binding of rabbit muscle myosin subfragment 1 (S 1) to glycerinated insect {{flight muscle}} fibers {{has been studied}} by low-angle x-ray diffraction, {{quantitative}} sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, quantitative interference microscopy, and electron microscopy. Changes induced in the rigor x-ray diffraction pattern {{are consistent with the}} idea that vacant myosin-binding sites on thin filaments are filled by exogenous S 1. Electron microscopy indicates that S 1 permeates and labels fibers and fibrils completely. Electron micrographs also show that cross-bridges are not displaced by exogenous S 1 under the conditions used, and this is supported by the unchanged mechanical stiffness of the S 1 -labeled fibers. The amount of bound S 1, as measured by gel electrophoresis and interference microscopy, together with the magnitude of the intensity changes in the x-ray diffraction pattern, is consistent with a thick filament structure that contains four molecules of endogenous myosin per 14. 5 nm of its length, but does not agree well with earlier estimates of six myosins per crown. Lack of information on possible inhibition of S 1 -binding by factors other than the presence of cross-bridges, e. g., troponin, render uncertain calculations of the number of attached cross-bridges in the rigor state. However, it appears that at least 75 % of the endogenous myosin heads are attached. Occupancy of binding sites on thin filaments after incubation with S 1 is high, probably greater than 85 %, so that x-ray scattering from those parts of the structure that adhere to the symmetry of the thin filaments can be treated as diffraction from S 1 -decorated thin filaments.

40|$|Currently, solar flares {{are under}} {{observation}} on the RT- 7. 5 radio telescope of BMSTU. This telescope operates in a little-studied {{range of the}} spectrum, at wavelengths of 3. 2 and 2. 2 mm (93 and 140 GHz), thereby providing unique information about parameters of the chromosphere plasma and zone of the temperature minimum. Observations on various instruments provided relatively small amount of data on the radio emission flare at frequencies close to 93 GHz, and at frequency of 140 GHz such observations were not carried out. For these reasons, data collected from the RT- 7. 5 radio telescope are of high value (Shustikov et al., 2012). This work describes modeling and gives interpretation {{of the reason for}} raising flux density spectrum of sub-millimeter radio frequency emission using as an example the GOES flare of class M 5. 3 occurred on 04. 07. 2012 in the active region 11515. This flare was observed on the RT- 7. 5 radio telescope of BMSTU and was described by Shustikov et al. (2012) and by Smirnova et al. (2013), where {{it has been suggested that}} the reason for raising radio frequency emission is a bremsstrahlung of the thermal electrons in the hot plasma of the solar chromosphere. Rough estimates of the plasma temperature at the flare source were obtained. This paper proposes model calculations of the flux density spectrum of the sub-millimeter radio emission based on the gyrosynchrotron Fleischman-Kuznetsov code (Fleishman & Kuznetsov, 2010). Section 1 briefly describes observational data, tools and processing methods used in the work. Section 2 shows results of modeling the <b>flare</b> radio emission. <b>Section</b> 3 discusses results and conclusions. Numerical modeling the sub-millimeter part of the spectrum of the radio flux density for the GOES flare of class M 5. 3 has been carried out. This flare occurred in the active region 11515 on 04. 07. 2012. Modeling was based on the observations on the BMSTU’s RT- 7. 5 radio telescope. The paper draws conclusion based on the model that the reason for raising flux density spectrum of sub-millimeter radio emission of flare is thermal bremsstrahlung plasma radiation with a temperature of 0. 1 mK. </p...|$|R
