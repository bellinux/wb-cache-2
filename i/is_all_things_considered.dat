Most {{people think it}} is permissible to divert a train {{so that it will}} kill one innocent person instead of five, but most people think that it is not permissible to push a stranger in front of a train to save five innocents. We argue that recent emotion-based explanations of this asymmetry have neglected the contribution that rules make to reasoning about moral dilemmas. In two experiments, we find that participants show a parallel asymmetry about versions of the dilemmas that have minimized emotional force. In a third experiment, we find that people distinguish between whether an action violates a moral rule and whether it <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> wrong. We propose that judgments of whether an action is wrong, all things considered, implicate a complex set of psychological processes, including representations of rules, emotional responses, and assessments of costs and benefits. q 2005 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|Looking at I Am Love [Io sonno l’amore] (2009), a film by Luca Guadagnino, {{in light}} of three {{possible}} genre categories: the family melodrama, the “melodrama of the unknown woman” (Cavell 1996) and the contemporary melodrama, I verify in what ways it deviates from the Italian film tradition to represent a new social paradigm (contemporary and capitalist), {{at the same time}} as it pertains to a cinematic matrix that <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> that of North American classical melodrama. Exploring the identity-questioning device provided in the title through a (self-) metonymic effect (“I am love”), my major topics for analysis and cornerstones in the representation of the film’s protagonist — Emma, an “unknown woman” — are the dilution and refinement of individual boundaries, the problems of recognition and non-recognition, or of self-affirmation and repression among society, and the process of naming in its ontological, literary and cinematic repercussions. These will also function as references to the melodramatic mode itself in cinema, from a classical Hollywood paradigm to a contemporary and international — critically independent — appropriation and recycling of the genre. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The independent, autonomous self whose annihilation we fear is the product of a particular self–conception, a particular way of seeing ourselves in relation to others. There is an alternative.

40|$|In this {{research}} report, I question the moral justification of bureaucracy. After pointing out some arguments {{in favour of}} bureaucracy and some teleological, or result-based, arguments against bureaucracy, I {{pay particular attention to}} deontological, or process-based, moral arguments against bureaucracy. The two main arguments against bureaucracy that I address are (1) that bureaucracies constitute unfair decision making procedures in democratic societies, and (2) that bureaucracies treat their participants (both clients and workers) disrespectfully. I then give some suggestions of what a promising alternative to bureaucracy might look like, based on the two main arguments against bureaucracy that I consider. Ultimately, I conclude that it is still an open question whether bureaucracy is morally justified, but that my research brings to the fore some serious moral problems with bureaucracy that are worth taking note of.

This {{is not a}} proposition that has been given much attention in academic 'Political Theory'; nor has it played very much part in informing the practice of twentieth century English governance. Nevertheless, there is academic work (theoretical and empirical) across a number of disciplines, some of it less well known, which is supportive of the claim, and which can be brought together into a comprehensive argument which can rebut most commonly-voiced objections. That argument, set out in this thesis, concludes {{that a number of}} factors aid the healthy development of democratic {{local community}}, but that the most significant involve the structure of local government. A central element of that structure is scale: it is argued that while all community-based local government is valuable, small "human scale" communities of 5, 000 - 10, 000 adults are particularly important for expressing values relating to local community and democracy. The conclusions of the thesis are contrasted with the policies of recent UK governments - including David Cameron's "Big Society" - which have typically been inimical to the role of democratic local community in English government and society.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{confirming}} federal judges is {{in large part}} a political affair, and so opinions regarding {{the health of the}} confirmation process tend to differ in predictably partisan ways. With a Republican president in the White House, Republicans complain about Democratic obstruction of nominations and urge reforms that would streamline what they regard as a broken process. Democrats, in contrast, point out {{that the vast majority of}} President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s nominees have been confirmed and contend that the process is working just fine or, at least, much more smoothly and fairly than it did for President Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s nominees. During the Clinton years, of course, Democrats railed against alleged Republican abuses and proposed reforms not unlike those now favored by Republicans. It may be that all of the turmoil over judicial confirmations is simply ordinary politics at work. If a Democrat wins the 2008 election, the roles will reverse once again, there will be recriminations and counter-recriminations over alleged obstructionism, some nominations will be held up, but the Republic will surely get along just fine. The appointments process is to some degree engineered to produce conflict, and one should be wary of those who contend that things are uniquely more politicized and turbulent now than they have been in the past. All the same, many respectable institutional players with longterm interests that transcend transient partisan advantage really do seem to believe that something has gone seriously awry. If one tries to abstract away from one 2 ̆ 7 s own partisan feelings and (at the risk of quaintness) adopt a good-government, commonweal-regarding perspective on the matter, one might well be sympathetic to the idea that things can be and ought to be better.

40|$|La dynamique de {{transformation}} de l’organisation du travail dans un contexte de changements technologiques et organisationnels dans une organisation industrielle de haute technologie {{a conduit}} à la fragmentation de la communauté technicienne et à la refonte de son identité professionnelle historique. Cette dynamique n’apparaît pas comme le résultat d’un quelconque déterminisme technologique. Les changements technologiques ont été, en dernière instance, un enjeu stratégique autour duquel se sont cristallisés les rapports de force dans l’organisation. Ils ont fait l’objet d’une instrumentalisation sur laquelle se sont appuyées les instances de l’entreprise pour légitimer leurs choix stratégiques en matière d’organisation du travail. The {{goal of this}} research is to study the impacts of technological changes on the professional identity of a specific category of workers: technicians. This research is based on a case study of a major high-tech organization working in the telecommunications sector. This group of “technical workers” establishes itself both as a key social actor and also as a professional category weakened by a deep identity malaise. This malaise itself can be attributed to its own specific social history and to the recent technological changes that have had a major impact on the production structures of its “natural” activity space. The study, carried out in a factory in a suburb west of Montreal, started just after the beginning of a complex process of technological and organizational change. The study has a dual goal. The first goal is to understand the dynamics of change brought about by these transformations, which have led to a new distribution of qualification spaces and a redefinition of negotiation powers for the members of the community. A second goal is to analyse the mechanisms which were in place for the remaking of the technician position and which make up the basis for the reconstruction of her social and professional identity. It is the deconstruction of this process which lies at the basis of this research which also set out to question the explanatory impact of the controversial notion of technological determinism as related to the recent transformations which have affected industrial work. The analysis model calls on three notions. The first notion is that the dynamics of the social work space within the enterprise set up a transformation process that leads to a structuring of new disqualification and requalification spaces. The second is that these dynamics are not the result of technological change alone; other factors much be taken into consideration in the redefinition of the technician’s identify and function. The third notion establishes a structural relation, of cause and effect, between the transformation process of the qualification spaces, their respective zones of uncertainty, and the technician identity through its technical, professional, and social components. The case study of this work sets up a constructivist and inductive approach, which {{takes the form of a}} long-term study, based on direct observation, personal conversations, and use of the organization’s documentary sources. The research results bring out two major phenomena. The first is the homogenization of the production space. The research is presented in two parts: first the bringing together of manufacturing operations into a single ad hoc space linked to the function rather than the product but in line with the same methods of task distribution; and thereafter, the definition of identical tasks, with the constraint of operation automation and equipment computerization. The second phenomenon is that of the fragmentation of the technician community. This is based on a transversal fracture of the technical population as a socioprofessional community and on the division of the technician’s function. The result of this phenomenon has been the disappearance of the largest of the sub-groups which previously made up the technician collective and which defined professional and collective identities; and the reconstitution of the community around two differentiated components: production technicians, and “specialized” technicians. The first group is by far the largest and includes, from this point in time on, operator technicians who have been greatly disqualified. Our results associate the second group with a redefined identify as a technician, a new collective group characterized by the appropriation of power spaces and technical means of authority, all of this to the detriment of both technical support (engineering) and hierarchical support (management). Each group draws its resources from the same formerly homogenous population for which the enterprise’s social space allowed a “long maturation period”—from the 1960 ’s—and an identity affirmation based on professional function and on a technical mastery which were institutionally recognized in the industrial space. This global transformation dynamic also led to the restructuration of the organization’s professional and social system. The results show that technological changes did not play an exclusive or overly developed role. The determinism attributed to the changes <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> relative when these are part of a complex dynamic with which other factors are associated, among which the enterprise’s strategy as an actor plays a decisive role. This is not because this role is more or less decisive than the dynamic stemming from technological changes, but rather because the former acts as a catalyst creating the conditions favourable to such an action. The technological changes appear, in the final analysis, as a strategic issue around which the power relations between different actors crystallized, particularly between technicians and leadership. Parallel to the irrefutable impacts of the “technical logic”, other strategic issues contributed to creating the social conditions for the institutional and collective action. The conduct and strategy of the leaders within the business are evident in a decisive manner at the very source of the main social transformations brought into focus by this study. This transformation dynamic cannot be seen as the sole result of some technological determinism, or of an unavoidable logic over which actors have no control. Research shows that technological changes are the focus of an instrumentalization as a contextual platform which leaders use as a basis to legitimize their strategic choices in the field of work organization. La dinámica de transformación de la organización del trabajo en un contexto de cambio tecnológico y organizacional, en una organización industrial de alta tecnología, ha conducido a la fragmentación de la comunidad de trabajadores tecnicos y a recomponer su identidad profesional histórica. Los cambios tecnológicos han sido, en última instancia, un desafío estratégico alrededor del cual se han cristalizado las correlaciones de fuerza en la organización.
