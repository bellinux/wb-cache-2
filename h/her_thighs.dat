5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
5|$|Many of the henchmen {{employed}} by the villains may have unique weapons; Oddjob, Auric Goldfinger's enforcer, carries a bowler hat with a razor-sharp blade concealed in the rim, while Xenia Onatopp is known to crush victims to death with <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> during intercourse. In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses {{and his ability to}} feel pain.|$|E

5|$|Nine years later, in Monte Carlo, Bond follows Xenia Onatopp, {{a member}} of the Janus crime syndicate, who has formed a {{suspicious}} relationship with Charles Farrel, a Canadian Navy admiral. As Onatopp crushes the admiral to death with <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> during sex, his credentials are stolen by Ourumov, who uses them to board a French Navy destroyer with Onatopp to steal a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter. Ourumov and Onatopp later fly the helicopter to a bunker in Severnaya, Siberia, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the GoldenEye satellites, two Soviet electromagnetic weapon satellites from the Cold War. They program the first GoldenEye (Petya) to destroy the complex, and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in Saint Petersburg, where he betrays her to Janus.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
25|$|She was {{comatose}} for 12 days. She suffered severe hypothermia, severe brain damage, Class 4 (the most severe) hemorrhagic shock, {{and loss}} of 75–80 percent of her blood from five deep stab wounds and a gash on one of <b>her</b> <b>thighs,</b> and internal bleeding. Her skull had been fractured so badly that her left eye was dislodged from its socket, which in turn was fractured in 21 places, and she suffered as well from facial fractures.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} Mixer {{had not been}} {{subjected}} to a sexual assault, the fact her tights had been lowered to expose <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> and sanitary towel suggested a sexual motive behind the murder, and although the victim had not been beaten, stabbed or mutilated, her student status, the tying of a garment around her neck, and the proximity of her abduction and murder led investigators to tentatively link her murder to those of Fleszar and Schell, despite lingering doubts she {{had been killed by}} the same perpetrator.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old {{woman from}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, ordered a 49-cent {{cup of coffee}} from the drive-through window of a local McDonald's {{restaurant}} located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast. Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled {{the far side of}} the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding <b>her</b> <b>thighs,</b> buttocks, and groin.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé is then {{announced}} by the contest's host as [...] "Miss 3rd Ward", and she then appears on stage, smiling and singing the first verse of the song a cappella. An applause follows from the crowd while the contest's judges write notes about her. The song then begins during a depiction of Beyoncé in the preparations for the show, in which she combs and sprays her hair, depilates her face and whitens her teeth. The scene transitions to a judge, played by the fashion model Shaun Ross, directing the contestants, during which Beyoncé is seen consuming diet pills. He measures her abdomen with tape and hits <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> {{as an indication of}} preferred onstage behaviour. The second verse follows, during which Beyoncé is pictured exercising at her home and measuring her weight to her own dissatisfaction.|$|E
500|$|When {{producing}} Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, co-director Takeshi Nozue {{had difficulty}} developing {{a framework for}} Tifa's body that was [...] "balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities." [...] Her outfit too was redesigned at this point, with emphasis on expressing those qualities, while still being pleasing to the eye. A white tank top with black zipped up vest covers her front, a pink ribbon wraps around her left biceps, and boots cover her feet. A black buttoned-up skirt covers <b>her</b> <b>thighs,</b> and she wears shorts beneath, {{with a piece of}} cloth similar to a coattail extending {{from the back of the}} skirt's waistband and ending at her ankles. While her gloves remain, they are worn only during the film's fight scenes. Her hairstyle was changed to end at the middle of her back, with the removal of the dolphin tail from her original design. This alteration was because of the difficulty of animating her original length of hair, as well as problems that arose due to its black color and lighting.|$|E
500|$|Ivy {{appears as}} a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard covers her torso and arms, with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, {{buttocks}} and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings cover her legs midway below <b>her</b> <b>thighs,</b> connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material covers her right arm and hand, while armor covers her left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron covers her right shoulder, while high heels cover her feet, and a white glove covers her right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering {{the right side of}} her face and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, {{with the exception of the}} removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands [...] tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100cm (39in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV.|$|E

2500|$|At 7.40am on 28 July 1993, three {{officers}} from the ADG, accompanied by two {{officers from}} Hornsey police station and an official from the UK Immigration Service, raided Gardner's home with orders to [...] "detain and remove" [...] her and her 5-year-old son for immediate deportation to Jamaica. The officers had with them a 4-inch wide restraint belt with attached handcuffs, and leather straps and rolls of adhesive tape to restrain <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> and ankles. When Gardner resisted the officers' attempts to place her in the restraint belt, she was overpowered, shackled, gagged, and adhesive tape was also wrapped around her head and face.

She died on 1 August 1993 due to cerebral hypoxia and cardiac arrest, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sexual Health Resource, [...] "The man-on-top sex {{positions}} {{are very good}} for couples {{who are trying to}} have a baby, because penetration can be very deep. If the woman holds on to her legs behind her knees and draws <b>her</b> <b>thighs</b> right back, sperm can be deposited deep in the vagina—at the neck of the womb. This provided the best chance of conception occurring." [...] Getting Pregnant Tips notes the importance of not using too large a sex pillow while in the missionary position as it can cause the sperm to pool behind the cervix. Francoeur states that [...] "male-above sex promotes fertility by keeping the opening of the vagina higher than the seminal pool, which, in turn, helps sperm get into the womb and find the egg." [...] However, according to BabyCenter, [...] "There is no evidence that any particular sexual position is more likely to lead to conception." [...] Donnica Moore agrees, stating that while there are no scientific studies regarding the best sexual positions for reproduction, the missionary (man on top) position is typically considered optimal for conception.|$|E
