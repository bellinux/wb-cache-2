Due to the CFL's import ratio requirements, Hamilton Spectator reporter Steve Milton speculated that Akins would be cut before the regular season.

25|$|The {{addition}} of Arroyo and Miličić, plus {{the return of}} point guard Jameer Nelson from the <b>injured</b> <b>list,</b> sparked a resurgence of the Magic {{in the last quarter}} of the 2005–2006 season, as they finished with a 12–3 run, nearly reaching the playoffs. During this run, the team had an eight-game winning streak, beating top teams such as the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs, Miami Heat and the Detroit Pistons. During the stretch run, Arroyo averaged 22.1 MPG, 10.8 PPG, 2.8 APG, and 2.2 RPG off the bench, which earned Arroyo the back-up point guard position behind Nelson. These averages were significant improvements from the statistics he accumulated with the Pistons, when he averaged only 12 minutes per game. He scored a season-high 21 points against the Phoenix Suns on March 3, 2006. On April 9, 2006, Arroyo injured his left hamstring and was sidelined for four games, returning on April 17 and scoring 17 points in the last game of the season.|$|E

25|$|After a {{promising}} 13–6 start, the Magic {{began to fall}} apart. First, Weisbrod traded Mobley for Doug Christie from the Sacramento Kings. Christie, because of his emotional ties to the Kings, at first refused {{to play for the}} Magic. Later on, Christie claimed he had bone spurs and was placed on the <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> after playing only a few games for the Magic. Near the end of the season, with a playoff-push faltering, Weisbrod fired Davis after leading Davis to believe {{he was going to be}} the team's head coach for the entire 2004–05 NBA season. He then promoted Chris Jent to interim head coach. Throughout the season, bolstered by Hill's return, the Magic played spectacularly, defeating top NBA teams. However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game. Hill was chosen an All-Star starter by NBA fans for the 2005 All-Star Game, and Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson were named to the All-Rookie first and second teams, respectively. Howard was a unanimous selection.|$|E
25|$|Given the team's recent {{offensive}} struggles, United fans {{might have}} thought they caught a break on the timing of a cross-country trip to face Seattle Sounders. The Sounders were playing without stars Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins, but United were soon without their starting forwards, in fairly short order, too. Once again, Luis Silva had to leave a game because of muscle injury, {{this time in the}} 5th minute. About 20 minutes later, the team was also down a man, after Espindola was shown a straight red card, for a retaliatory elbow. Despite conceding a man advantage, United held strong until a cannon shot Goal-of-the-Week game-winner off the foot of fullback Tyrone Mears in the 88th minute, against back-up netminder, Dykstra. Despite the loss, United remained atop the Supporters Shield standings, just 3 points ahead of the Sounders. United also had a two-week break to nurse a number of injured players to health in advance of a trip to Dallas. The <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> included, Silva, Pontius, Franklin, Farfan and Hamid. The news was especially disappointing regarding Hamid, who was leading the league in several categories, despite battling a few injuries. It was announced that Hamid had undergone surgeries on his knee and hand, and would miss another 4–6 weeks. 2 days before the Dallas game, DC United also announced the trade of Luis Silva to Real Salt Lake in exchange for the Costa Rican striker Alvaro Saborio. While Saborio's addition seemed promising for a team desperate to find a goal-scorer, he could not yet join his new club, because Costa Rica was still involved in the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup. United's match against FC Dallas followed a troubling pattern that was becoming all-too familiar for United. Playing without the suspended Espindola in addition to all the missing, injured players, the DC side had little possession or attack, leaving the defense and goalie Andrew Dykstra under regular pressure. The United dam finally broke in the 73rd minute with a goal by Kellyn Acosta. United seemingly had managed to claim a draw and a point a few minutes later when Taylor Kemp's attempted cross to Arrieta was knocked into the Dallas net by an FC Dallas defender. However, once again, United's stout defense folded in the final minutes, allowing a stoppage-time winner by Fabian Castillo.|$|E
500|$|Twodays {{prior to}} the game, Las Vegas casinos favored Texas by 39points. Sportswriters John Bridges and Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman {{predicted}} the Longhorns would have a big lead {{early in the game}} and that true-freshman quarterback John Chiles would enter the game in the secondor thirdquarter as the back-up to Colt McCoy. [...] Redshirt freshman quarterback Sherrod Harris was on the <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> and was not expected to play.
