5|$|The Volt's {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded battery packs. The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s battery pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the battery pack is operating safely and 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E
5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the plant was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This was the second time in 2012 that <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> halted Volt production.|$|E
25|$|World of Motion {{closed in}} 1996. <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{continued}} its sponsorship in World of Motion's replacement attraction, Test Track, since its opening in 1999. Since that attraction's 2012 overhaul, <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> sponsored the attraction through its Chevrolet division.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> {{begun to}} apply the Mark of Excellence, which was {{actually}} the <b>GM</b> logo. <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> stopped putting their logo on the cars in 2009, but GM did apply the GM logo {{on some of the}} early 2010 GM models.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> renamed {{itself as}} General Motors Company, {{replacing}} its former appellation: General Motors Corporation.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> {{introduced}} downsized RWD midsize {{cars on the}} A-body platform (Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac Le Mans, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Buick Regal). Then in 1982, a {{new line}} of separate FWD midsize cars were introduced, also referred to as A-bodies, but actually based on the compact X-body platform. Since <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> not monetized the tooling costs of the RWD A-body platform, they were forced to continue producing them alongside the newer FWD models.|$|R
25|$|In Australia, <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> been {{represented}} by the Holden brand since 1948, GM having acquired the company in 1931. In 2012, GM Opel cars began to be imported into Australia as a niche marque under their own brand name. However, as of August 2013, <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{made the decision to}} remove the Opel brand from Australia noting poor adoption and sales.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011 General Motors (GM) {{blocked the}} Chinese buy out, since <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{technology}} licenses in SAAB.|$|E
25|$|<b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{discontinued}} {{production of}} the WN Caprice and all other Australian-made models as of October 2017.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{following}} the first Gulf War and a recession, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> taken on more debt. By the late 1990s, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> regained market share; its stock had soared to over $80 a share by 2000. However, in 2001, {{the stock market}} drop following the September 11, 2001 attacks, combined with historic pension underfunding, caused a severe pension and benefit fund crisis at GM and many other American companies {{and the value of}} their pension funds plummeted.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> {{completed}} the divestiture of 51% of its financing unit, GMAC. Currently GM is a 10% owner in GMAC.|$|R
50|$|For the 25 years {{following}} its formation in 1908, General Motors Company (GM) hadn't participated in any major negotiations with labor unions. This inexperience {{is viewed by}} some as a major factor in how the company reacted to changes in political climate and the increasing role of organized labor. Headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> already established itself as a multinational automaker by the 1930s. In 1939, the year of the strike, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> a successful business year; car and truck production was increased by one-third and market penetration stood at more than 43 percent.|$|R
25|$|<b>GM</b> <b>has</b> participated {{over the}} years in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC), 24 Hours of Le Mans, NASCAR, SCCA, Supercars Championship, and many other world venues.|$|E
25|$|<b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{also used}} many {{cars in the}} American racing series NASCAR. Currently the Chevrolet SS is the only entry in the series, {{but in the past}} the Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Malibu and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo were also used. <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> won a total of 40 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series manufacturer's championships, {{including}} 34 with Chevrolet, the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. GM leads all other automobile manufacturers in races won in NASCAR's premier series at 1,011. Chevrolet leads individual makes with 677 wins.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{with the}} {{subsequent}} discontinuation of its Chevrolet platform mates, the HHR and the Cobalt, <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{withdrawn from the}} high-performance, low-cost sedan market completely. The Ion's most direct successor today is the Chevrolet Cruze, which {{does not have any}} high-performance engine options.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, Toyota {{launched}} 14 new products {{which is more}} than whole of GM. At that point, Toyota had just 70,000 employees, while <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> more than five times as many (360,000).|$|R
50|$|Chrysler and <b>GM</b> <b>have</b> {{designed}} larger displacement V8s {{based on}} modern small-block V8 archtictures such as Chrysler's 6.1 L and 6.4 L Eagle and Apache Hemis, and the LS7 7.0 L version of GM's LS and latest new LT engines.|$|R
50|$|Prior to bankruptcy, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> {{considered}} a rear-drive sedan, {{powered by the}} new Ultra V8 engine (replacement for the Northstar), to bow for 2010. GM later stopped development of new North American Zeta-based models and canceled the Ultra V8 engine.|$|R
25|$|As of March 28, 2014, <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{halted the}} sale of 2013 and 2014 Chevrolet Cruze {{compacts}} with 1.4-liter engines—models that account for about 60% of Cruze sales—but GM originally didn't say why it issued the order. GM later announced that the cars were being recalled due to a faulty right-side axle shaft.|$|E
25|$|<b>GM</b> <b>has</b> a {{long history}} in Egypt which began in the 1920s with the {{assembly}} of cars and light pickup trucks for the local market. In the mid of the 1950s, GM withdrew from the Egyptian market. Some years later, the Ghabbour Brothers began to assemble Cadillac, Chevrolet and Buick models up to the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|GM's engines {{were highly}} {{successful}} in the Indy Racing League (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small V-8 class. <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> also done much work {{in the development of}} electronics for GM auto racing. An unmodified Aurora V-8 in the Aerotech, captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the Cadillac V-Series has entered motorsports racing.|$|E
5000|$|... certain {{paragraphs}} of {{the statement}} of claim should be struck out as disclosing no cause of action because <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> never made any sales directly to CNL or to its competitors, and thus s. 34(1)(a) of the Act did not apply ...|$|R
50|$|In February 2005, GM {{successfully}} bought {{itself out}} of a put option with Fiat for $2 billion USD (€1.55 billion). In 2000, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> sold a 6% stake to Fiat {{in return for a}} 20% share in the Italian automaker. As part of the deal, GM granted Fiat a put option, which, if the option had been exercised between January 2004 and July 2009, could <b>have</b> forced <b>GM</b> to buy Fiat. <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> agreed to the put option at the time, perhaps to keep it from being acquired by another automaker, such as DaimlerChrysler, competing with GM's German subsidiary Opel. The relationship suffered and Fiat had failed to improve. In 2003, Fiat recapitalized, reducing GM's stake to 10%.|$|R
50|$|Following its discontinuation, the {{bodyshell}} of the Outlook was revived as a mid-cycle refresh of the 2013 GMC Acadia. The bodyshell of the 2013 Acadia {{was mostly}} unchanged from the Saturn Outlook, <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> only made {{changes to the}} 2013 Acadia where necessary.|$|R
25|$|In May 2004, GM {{delivered}} the world's first full-sized hybrid pickups, the 1/2-ton Silverado/Sierra. These mild hybrids {{did not use}} electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. In 2005, the Opel Astra diesel Hybrid concept vehicle was introduced. The 2006 Saturn Vue Green Line was the first hybrid passenger vehicle from GM and is also a mild design. <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds in freeway driving.|$|E
25|$|Underpinned by the {{front-wheel drive}} GM Delta II platform, <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> {{confirmed}} the Cruze development program occurred under a global design and engineering team. GM Daewoo in South Korea played {{a leading role}} in the design and engineering of the Cruze, along with GM's German-based Opel division. This development program spanned over 27 months at a cost of US$4 billion. A total of 221 prototypes were tested in Australia, Canada, China, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, however, {{outgoing}} CEO of GM Rick Wagoner {{said the}} biggest mistake he ever made as chief executive was killing the EV1 car and failing to direct more resources to electrics and hybrids after such an early lead in this technology. <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> since championed its electric-car expertise as {{a key factor in}} development of its 2010 Chevrolet Volt, the first electric car that uses a gas generator to create electricity when the battery is depleted, furthering the range by over 270 miles.|$|E
50|$|Since 1992 and to date (2017) HVLA has {{had five}} (5) other General Managers and five (5) Interim General Managers. Some of these <b>GM's</b> <b>had</b> {{professional}} credentials, some did not. In addition to Mr. Hutton, three other GM's left under questionable circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|The Chevrolet Celebrity {{was based}} on the front wheel drive A-body {{platform}} shared with the Buick Century, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and the Pontiac 6000. <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> previously used the [...] "Celebrity" [...] name as a body style designation on pillared Oldsmobile sedans in the 1960s ...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the early}} success at Fremont, by 1998 (15 years later) <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> still {{not been able}} to {{implement}} lean manufacturing {{in the rest of the}} United States, though GM managers trained at NUMMI were successful in introducing the approach to its unionized factories in Brazil.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to brands selling assembled vehicles, <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> also had various automotive-component and non-automotive brands, {{many of which}} it divested in the 1980s through 2000s. These have included Euclid and Terex (earthmoving/construction/mining equipment & vehicles); Electro-Motive Diesel (locomotive, marine, and industrial diesel engines); Detroit Diesel (automotive and industrial diesel engines); Allison (aircraft engines, transmissions, gas turbine engines); Frigidaire (appliances including refrigeration and air conditioning); New Departure (bearings); Delco Electronics and ACDelco (electrical and electronic components); GMAC (finance); General Aviation and North American Aviation (airplanes); GM Defense (military vehicles); and Electronic Data Systems (information technology).|$|E
25|$|A {{prototype}} of the never-produced 1990 Fiero was displayed at the 20th Anniversary show in July 2003, at Fierorama 2005, at the Michigan show in 2006 and most recently at the 25th Anniversary Show in Pontiac, Michigan in 2008. Continued showing of the prototype {{may no longer be}} an option in the near future, as <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> taken to cutting funding to relieve the pressure of its financial woes. GM Heritage Center continues storing the 1989/1990 Fiero. Many of the 89/90 coupe prototypes have been demolished in a scrap yard in Australia.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 2009, GM {{announced}} that the Saturn brand would be sold to the Penske Automotive Group. GM was to continue to build the Aura, Outlook and Vue for Penske for two years, however, as of September 30, 2009, the deal had fallen through. Penske had asked GM to extend {{the time it was}} to build Saturns until it could reach a deal with the Renault Group for vehicle replacements in 2012, but since that deal fell through Penske cancelled the planned sale. <b>GM</b> <b>has</b> said that the Saturn brand will be phased out by the 2010 model year, and the brand was declared defunct on October 31, 2010.|$|E
50|$|Production of the EXT {{model was}} {{handled by the}} Oklahoma City Assembly plant in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The last TrailBlazer EXT rolled off the {{assembly}} line on February 20, 2006, because <b>GM</b> <b>had</b> reportedly closed that plant, making 2006 the final year for the TrailBlazer EXT.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{automakers}} including American Motors (AMC) and General Motors (<b>GM)</b> <b>have</b> publicized certain {{models with}} truncated tails as [...] "Kammbacks" [...] {{even though they}} do not meet the classic [...] "50% cross-section" [...] definition, i.e. the AMC AMX-GT and Pontiac Firebird-based [...] "Type K" [...] concept cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{general manager}} (GM) {{is the key}} {{position}} in a hotel, but the changing structure of the industry has altered {{the scope of the}} GM’s decision-making autonomy. In many hotels, the GM is an employee of a hotel operating firm and is effectively an agent of the operator or owner (and sometimes both parties). These principals have authority over several aspects of hotel operation, although the <b>GM</b> also <b>has</b> responsibility. A study of the GM’s role and authority in 115 upscale European hotels finds a mixed picture in decision autonomy, depending on the individual’s experience and education, as well as whether the hotel is independent or chain managed. Overall, independent <b>GMs</b> <b>have</b> greater autonomy in their properties than chain GMs, and highly experienced managers are often given greater autonomy by independent owners, while operating companies give greater autonomy to GMs who offer a combination of education and experience. With regard to individual functional areas, chain <b>GMs</b> <b>have</b> relatively greater authority in human resources, marketing, and strategy but limited autonomy in finance and operations...|$|R
