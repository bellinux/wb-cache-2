40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels {{are widely used}} in the chemical, petrochemical and food-processing industries due to their excellent corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties. However, due to their inherent austenitic structure, they have relatively low hardness, as well as poor wear resistance and short fatigue life. Thermochemical surface treatments are used to improve the wear resistance, hardness and fatigue life. Austenitic {{stainless steels}} are difficult to carburise due to the tenacious Cr 2 O 3 layer on the surface, although plasma and <b>gas</b> <b>carburising</b> {{have proven to be}} very effective. However, this investigation sought to understand the effect of high carburising temperature on the mechanical properties of AISI 316 L steel, without the removal of the tenacious Cr 2 O 3 surface layer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{the great}} {{majority}} of carburising is still carried out at atmospheric pressure, recent developments in vacuum furnaces and steel technology have meant that carburising can now be carried out in a more environmentally friendly way under low pressure. The range of material types being carburised under vacuum is increasing with a strongly upward trend towards vacuum carburising evident in many areas. In choosing a suitable carburising process, three main choices have to be made:- which <b>carburising</b> technique and <b>gas</b> (or gases) to employ; which type of vacuum pump system to install; and which quenching gas to use. In particular, the selection of <b>carburising</b> <b>gas</b> has {{a significant impact on the}} efficiency and cleanliness of the process, and on deciding the most appropriate vacuum pump system. This paper describes the current state of the art and practical experiences with low-pressure carburising techniques and examines the various options within these three essential choices. It also considers the safety and environmental implications of these choices. 1...|$|R
40|$|Metal dusting {{is a type}} of high {{temperature}} corrosion in which Fe-, Ni- or Co-base alloys are disintegrated from bulk materials into metal or carbide particles in a coke deposit formed in strongly <b>carburising</b> <b>gas</b> atmospheres (carbon activity ac > 1) at elevated temperatures (400 - 800 °C). Mechanism study reveals that dusting occurs only when graphite grows into the metal or carbide interior, disrupting its structure and converting it to the dust. Therefore, prevention of dusting requires a surface barrier to carbon entry. The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of nano-crystalline structure on carburization and metal dusting of nickel-chromium alloys. Nano-crystalline Ni-Cr structure was prepared by either sputtering coating or electro-plating, which was then reacted in 47 %CO- 47 %H 2 - 6 %H 2 O gas for 50 h or pre-oxidised first in 47 %Ar- 47 %H 2 - 6 %H 2 O gas for 24 h and then in carburizing gas for 50 h at 650 °C. The coarse grained Ni-Cr alloys were also reacted in the same reaction conditions for the comparison. In general, increasing Cr content reduced weight gain kinetics. For sputtering coated Ni-Cr alloys, without pre-oxidation, Ni- 5 Cr experienced a significant metal dusting. Higher Cr content, Ni- 10 Cr and 20 Cr alloys, however, appeared little attack due to the formation of chromia scales on the surface and along the interfaces among the columns. Both alloys formed other reaction products inside of columnar coating scales, with fine graphite deposits for Ni- 10 Cr and relatively large Cr 7 C 3 precipitates for Ni- 20 Cr. For electroplated samples, the rates of weight gain performed a slow increase first, followed by an accelerated increase. Pre-oxidation before dusting significantly improved the resistance of alloy against carburization and metal dusting for all cases. This effect is especially significant for low Cr content Ni- 5 Cr and for nano-coated alloys as fine grain size accelerates chromium diffusion and therefore the protective oxide scale formation. The effect of chromium content on protective chromia scale formation and chromium carbide formation is analysed using Wagner’s analysis and product solubility calculation. The prediction is basically in agreement with the experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{corrosion}} control of alloys exposed to severe and complex conditions in industrial applications {{has been a}} great challenge. Currently, corrosion costs are increasing and preventive strategies have become an important industrial demand. The SCAPAC project funded by the French National Research Agency has proposed to study the corrosion for two separate processes: Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) and Waste to Energy (WtE). Although the operating conditions of both processes are different, the modeling approaches can be similar. Metallic components in the SMR process are subjected to metal dusting corrosion, which is a catastrophic form of damage that affects alloys exposed to highly <b>carburising</b> <b>gases</b> (aC> 1) at high temperatures (400 – 800 °C). [1]. Likewise, metallic components in the Waste to Energy (WtE) process are subjected to high temperature corrosion under deposit that takes place in equipment exposed to atmospheres with high content of corrosive products of combustion. Metal dusting corrosion is considered as a critical phenomenon that has led to worldwide material loss for 50 years. A basic understanding of the degradation mechanisms is available. However, the effect of some process parameters is still not well understood in current literature and requires further study. Otherwise for high temperature corrosion, a considerable amount of literature has been published over the last few decades and the mechanisms are well documented. Also many materials and coatings have been developed. However, the material performance in different environments has not been sufficiently well understood to define suitable criteria for lifetime prediction models regarding operating conditions, due to the high complexity of the corrosion phenomena involved. Literature research in both fields revealed modeling approaches in different kinds of complex conditions and applications. Nevertheless, there are no lifetime models currently available in the open literature for commercial materials that consider a wide range of conditions and the relative weight of the variables involved in the corrosion processes. This dissertation presents a methodology to develop lifetime prediction models to evaluate materials performance under metal dusting and high-temperature corrosion conditions. Two databases were created to integrate experimental results from the SCAPAC project, as well as results from literature to enable sufficient amount of data for modeling. The databases allowed analyzing approximately 4000 corrosion rates by different statistical methods over different scenarios. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methodology was performed to identify the key parameters to create lifetime prediction models using Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR). For high-temperature corrosion, three models were obtained in the thermal gradient scenario for three families of alloys: low alloyed steels, Fe/Ni-based high temperature alloys and Ni-based alloys, showing agreeable results. For metal dusting corrosion, two models were obtained to explain the incubation times and the kinetic of pit depth growing, showing satisfactory results. The statistical models in both cases were compared with experimental and theoretical results showing good agreement with experimental findings, which allows performing the lifetime assessment of materials under defined conditions...|$|R
