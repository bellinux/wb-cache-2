2500|$|The {{maximum length}} of stay that Medicare Part A covers in a <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatient</b> stay or series of stays is {{typically}} 90 days. The first 60 days would be paid by Medicare in full, except one copay (also and more {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "deductible") {{at the beginning of the}} 60 days of $1,288 as of 2016. Days 61–90 require a co-payment of $322 per day as of 2016. The beneficiary is also allocated [...] "lifetime reserve days" [...] that can be used after 90 days. These lifetime reserve days require a copayment of $644 per day as of 2016, and the beneficiary can only use a total of 60 of these days throughout their lifetime. A new pool of 90 hospital days, with new copays of $1288 in 2016 and $302 per day for days 61–90, starts only after the beneficiary has 60 days continuously with no payment from Medicare for hospital or nursing home confinement.|$|E

2500|$|Some [...] "hospital services" [...] {{can be done}} as {{inpatient}} services, {{which would}} be reimbursed under Part A; or as outpatient services, which would be reimbursed, not under Part A, but under Part B instead. The [...] "Two-Midnight Rule" [...] decides which is which. In August 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a final rule concerning eligibility for <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatient</b> services effective October 1, 2013. Under the new rule, if a physician admits a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient with an expectation that the patient will require hospital care that “crosses two midnights,” Medicare Part A payment is “generally appropriate.” However, if it is anticipated that the patient will require hospital care for less than two midnights, Medicare Part A payment is generally not appropriate; payment such as is approved will be paid under Part B. The time a patient spends in the hospital before an inpatient admission is formally ordered is considered outpatient time. But, hospitals and physicians can {{take into consideration the}} pre-inpatient admission time when determining if a patient’s care will reasonably be expected to cross two midnights to be covered under Part A. In addition to deciding which trust fund is used to pay for these various outpatient vs. inpatient charges, the number of days for which a person is formally considered an admitted patient affects eligibility for Part A skilled nursing services.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the Spanish version of the patient health questionnaire (PHQ) has validity and utility for diagnosing mental disorders in general <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients.</b> Methods: Participants {{in the study were}} 1003 general <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients,</b> randomly selected from all admissions over an 18 -month period. All of them completed the PHQ, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and measures of functional status, disability days, and health care use, including length of hospital stay. They also had a structured interview with a mental health professional. Results: A total of 416 (42 %) of the 1003 general <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients</b> had a PHQ diagnosis. There was good agreement between PHQ diagnoses and those of an independent mental health professional (for the diagnosis of any PHQ disorder, k 5 0. 74; overall accuracy, 88 %; sensitivity, 87 %; specificity, 88 %), similar to the original English version of the PHQ in primary care patients. Patients with PHQ diagnoses had more functional impairment, disability days, and health care use than did patients without PHQ diagnoses (group main effects for functional status measures and disability days, p,. 001; group main effects for health care use, p,. 01). The group main effect for hospital length of stay was not significant. An index of depression symptom severity calculated from the PHQ correlated significantly both with the number of depressive symptoms detected at interview and the total BDI score. PHQ administration was well accepted by patients. Conclusions: The Spanish version of the PHQ has diagnostic validity in general <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients</b> comparable to the original English version in primary care. Key words...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) in Asia. The aims of our study were to explore (i) the prevalence, risk factors and molecular epidemiology of CDI and colonization in a tertiary academic hospital in North-Eastern Peninsular Malaysia; (ii) the rate of carriage of C. difficile among the elderly in the region; (iii) the awareness level of this infection among the hospital staffs and students. For stool samples collected from <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients</b> with diarrhea (n = 76) and healthy community members (n = 138), C. difficile antigen and toxins were tested by enzyme immunoassay. Stool samples were subsequently analyzed by culture and molecular detection of toxin genes, and PCR ribotyping of isolates. To examine awareness among hospital staff and students, {{participants were asked to}} complete a self-administered questionnaire. For the hospital and community studies, the prevalence of non-toxigenic C. difficile colonization was 16 % and 2 %, respectively. The prevalence of CDI among <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients</b> with diarrhea was 13 %. Out of 22 C. difficile strains from <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients,</b> the toxigenic ribotypes 043 and 017 were most common (both 14 %). In univariate analysis, C. difficile colonization in <b>hospital</b> <b>inpatients</b> was significantly associated with greater duration of hospitalization and use of penicillin (both P < 0 · 05). Absence of these factors was a possible reason for low colonization in the community. Only 3 % of 154 respondents answered all questions correctly in the awareness survey. C. difficile colonization is prevalent in a Malaysian hospital setting but not in the elderly community with little or no contact with hospitals. Awareness of CDI is alarmingly poor...|$|R
