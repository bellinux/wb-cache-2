5|$|In {{the early}} hours of May 19, PC-815's sonar {{detected}} what the crew believed to be an enemy submarine off Cape Lookout, about ten to twelve miles offshore. Over the next two and a half days, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire a total of 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds to target what Hubbard believed to be two Imperial Japanese Navy submarines. The PC-815 was joined by the US Navy blimps K-39 and K-33, the US Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>patrol</b> boats Bonham and 78302 and the subchasers USS SC-536 and USS SC-537 to assist it in the search for the suspected enemy vessels. Hubbard was given temporary command of the vessels on the afternoon of May 19. The larger subchaser PC-778 also joined the submarine search, though it found no indication of submarines and its commander was subsequently castigated by Hubbard for his refusal to lay its own larger stock of depth charges or resupply the PC-815.|$|E

25|$|September 7, 2010: The Chinese fishing trawler Minjinyu 5179 collides {{with two}} Japanese Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>patrol</b> boats in disputed waters near the Senkaku Islands. The {{collisions}} occur between 10AM to 11AM (Yonakuni around 10:16AM, Mizuki around 10:56AM.), after the Japanese Coast Guard ordered the trawler {{to leave the}} area. After the collisions, Japanese Coast Guard sailors boarded the Chinese vessel and arrest the captain, Zhan Qixiong. On the same day, Song Tao, Chinese associate minister of foreign affairs, called in Japan's ambassador to China Uichiro Niwa and requested Japan to stop its interception operation.|$|E
25|$|From October 1943 Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>Patrol</b> Bombing Squadron Six {{operated}} twelve Consolidated PBY Catalinas from Narsarsuaq Air Base, Naval Station Argentia, and Reykjavík Airport providing reconnaissance, antisubmarine patrol, mail delivery, rescue service, {{and observation}} surveys of ice conditions for ships of the Greenland Patrol. Aircraft greatly improved patrol efficiency when weather conditions were suitable for flying. Ships of the Greenland Patrol acted as plane guards on weather patrol {{stations in the}} Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and south of Cape Farewell maintaining radio contact with trans-Atlantic aircraft flights and provided rescue service for aircraft ditching at sea.|$|E
25|$|The first ship {{to arrive}} on the scene was the small Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>Patrol</b> Boat USS CG-218, which found a {{lifeboat}} holding three survivors and three bodies; the survivors {{reported that they had}} dived overboard and swum to the boat. Next on the scene was the Coast Guard cutter , which had heard the gunfire and arrived just fifteen minutes later. The Legare found a second lifeboat with a body aboard; the boat was discovered to have been riddled by gunfire, and lent strength to the widespread belief at the time that U-boats were deliberately murdering the survivors of ships they had sunk. The Legare landed the three survivors and four bodies at Chincoteague Island Coastguard Station, then returned to sea to search further.|$|E

25|$|The small Seychelles Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>patrol</b> boat Topaz {{engaged in}} another battle with pirates {{five days later}} on 30 March. While patrolling just {{off the coast of}} Somalia, Topaz {{encountered}} a captured dhow. After warning shots were fired, the dhow seemed to ignore the patrol boat and its occupants eventually opened up with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire. The Seychellois then engaged and after shooting off 10,000 rounds of machine gun fire, the dhow was burning and eventually sank. Twenty-seven members of the dhow's crew were rescued and the Topaz was returning to base when she was attacked by a trawler and two skiffs. Again the Seychellois responded with counter battery and the trawler exploded. One of the skiffs was sunk as well. Pirate casualties are unknown and one member of the dhow's crew was wounded.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{uncertainty}} in Gabrielle's track led the National Hurricane Center's five-day track forecast cone {{to include the}} Mid-Atlantic, southeastern New York, and southern New England. Forecasters predicted rough surf and rip currents, prompting the Coast Guard to perform preparations in the Northeastern United States. On Cape Cod, Massachusetts, an HU-25 Falcon jet flew along the coastline, broadcasting storm advisories to offshore vessels. A Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>patrol</b> boat was deployed offshore for search and rescue. Boaters and mariners were advised to exercise caution, and were told to [...] "make safe decisions". However, the storm passed well to the south with little effect.|$|E
500|$|The outerbands of Ella {{produced}} gale force winds in the Florida Keys, causing damage {{mainly to}} antennas, fences, shrubbery, and signs. Winds on Stock Island damaged and overturned 4trailers. Further north in Miami, a freighter was disabled {{and had to}} be towed in to port by the United States Coast Guard. Due to fears of a storm similar to Hurricane Audrey in the previous year, some residents evacuated southwestern Louisiana. An estimated 1,500fled inland as Ella approached, leaving only 100people to ride out the storm. In Louisiana, squalls from Ella caused the collision of two ocean-bound freighters along the Mississippi River near New Orleans. Impact elsewhere in Louisiana was limited to minor damage to rice crops in the southwestern portion of the state. On 35oil platforms offshore of Houston, Texas, 1,400people were alerted about possible evacuations if Ella were to approach the area. Along the coast, there were evacuations in Indianola, Port Alto, Port O'Connor, and Sabine Pass. Ella brought heavy rains to eastern and southern Texas, including [...] in Galveston. Precipitation brought minor flooding to low-lying areas of the Bolivar Peninsula, Galveston Island, Kemah, La Marque, the Matagorda Peninsula, Seabrook, and Texas City. Ella also brought swells to the coast of Texas. A portion of Texas State Highway 87 was closed due to inundation between Sabine Pass and High Island. Further south, tidal flooding along Texas State Highway 316 caused the closure of the portion near Indianola. Offshore, a [...] shrimp trawler sank during the storm, after being smashed against the rocks near Galveston. The crew fled to the life boats and were later rescued by a United States Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>Patrol</b> Vessel. The captain of the snapper boat E. W. Fowler went missing after he was washed overboard; the man was later presumed to have drowned.|$|E

As street protests continued throughout Catalonia, additional police reinforcements were sent by the Spanish government to block any moves to hold the referendum on 1 October. Spanish prosecutors formally accused some protesters in Barcelona of sedition, after several Civil <b>Guard</b> <b>patrol</b> cars had been vandalised on Wednesday night. By 23 September, the Spanish government announced that the Mossos d'Esquadra—the regional police force—were to be subordinated to a single command dependent of the Spanish government and that the Interior Ministry would assume co-ordination over all security forces in Catalonia. The previous day, several hundred students had announced a permanent occupation of the historic building of the University of Barcelona, protesting the state's actions.|$|E
