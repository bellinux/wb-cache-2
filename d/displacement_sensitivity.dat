40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of gradient-based methods to structural optimization problems usually requires {{the determination of}} <b>displacement</b> <b>sensitivities</b> with respect to design variables. In this regard, {{it is important to}} have at hand comprehensive methods for sensitivity analysis, which show stability, efficiency and accuracy. Particularly, {{application of}} the semi-analytical method for linear and nonlinear problems is generally a good trade-off between formulation simplicity and accuracy. In spite of that, semi-analytical methods are known to behave pathologically for shape design variables when the structure is subjected to rigid rotations. A large number of solutions for this problem have been presented in last years, although the formulation involved is generally not trivial, especially in the nonlinear case. A recent method, which adopts the semi-analytical approach and uses complex variables has rendered very promising results for all the aforementioned aspects: stability, efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, it is simple to codify. The present contribution is concerned with the application of this sensitivity analysis method to geometrically nonlinear truss problems. To this end, a finite element formulation is presented and <b>displacement</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are evaluated with respect to material and shape design variables. The results are compared to those obtained using the semi-analytical method with real variables and to global finite differences. An example demonstrates the potentiality of this new approach...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSensitivity to slow {{movement}} improves substantially {{during the}} early postnatal months. Thresholds were measured for slow oscillatory displacements for 68 infants aged 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Standing wave line stimuli were used; 6 -week-olds were tested at 1. 2 Hz, and infants in the three older age groups were tested at either 0. 6 or 1. 2 Hz. Six-week-olds as a group were very insensitive to these slow <b>displacements.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> increased systematically across the three older ages. Thresholds were marginally lower at 1. 2 Hz than at 0. 6 Hz, {{and there was some}} indication that these thresholds may reflect a mixture of detection by position-sensitive and motion-sensitive mechanisms. Several factors are hypothesized to be responsible for this development: (1) improvements in spatial resolution; (2) improvements in temporal contrast sensitivity; (3) decreases in the size of second order motion integration mechanisms; and (4) increased neural connectivity in the motion pathways.

40|$|Contour maps of {{thickness}} {{changes were}} obtained for three quasi-isotropic graphite-epoxy plates with central holes, loaded in compression. Thickness changes were determined for six load increments from nearly zero to within a few percent of the failure load. The largest change of thickness occurred near the hole {{but not at the}} boundary of the hole. Below 90 percent of the failure load, the thickness changes were nearly proportional to load. Irregularities of thickness changes occurred in zones of compressive stresses and they were attributed to localized fiber buckling.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. A {{wavelength}} scanning interferometry system {{is used to}} measure all the orthogonal components of the displacement field inside semitransparent scattering materials. A near infrared tunable laser illuminates a sample from multiple directions. The image of the sample is recombined with a reference beam on a photodetector array. As the laser frequency is linearly tuned during a scan, a sequence of speckle interferograms is recorded. In order to reconstruct the sample structure, Fourier transformation is performed on a pixel by pixel basis along the temporal axis of the 3 -D data cube obtained. Multiple <b>displacement</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are achieved by introducing different optical delays between the reference and the illumination beams, which separate the reconstruction signals in the frequency domain.

40|$|The {{conventional}} compliance minimization of load-carrying structures {{does not}} directly deal with displacements that are of practical importance. In thin?s paper, a global displacement control is realized through topology optimization with a global constraint that sets a displacement limit on the whole structure or certain sub-domains. A volume minimization problem is solved by an extended evolutionary topology optimization approach. The local <b>displacement</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are derived following a power-law penalization material model. The global control of displacement is realized through multiple local displacement constraints on dynamically located critical nodes. Algorithms are proposed to secure the stability and convergence of the optimization process. Through numerical examples and by comparing with conventional stiffness designs, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach is capable of effectively finding optimal solutions which satisfy the global displacement control. Such solutions are of particular importance for structural designs whose deformed shapes must comply with functioning requirements such as aerodynamic performances...|$|R

This is crucial to achieve picometer level sensitivities in the 0. 1 mHz to 1 Hz regime, where laser frequency noise is usually high and couples into the measurement phase via arm-length mismatches in the interferometers. Here we describe the results achieved by frequency stabilising an external cavity diode laser to a quasi-monolithic unequal arm-length Mach-Zehnder interferometer read out at mid-fringe via balanced detection.

ON-center cells signal positive contrasts and OFF-center cells signal negative contrasts. In this study we address the question whether initial motion analysis is performed separately in these two channels, or also through combination of signals from ON and OFF cells. We quantitatively compared motion coherence detection for regular and for reverse-phi motion stimuli. In reverse-phi motion the contrast of a pattern flips during <b>displacements.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> is therefore based on correlating positive and negative contrasts, whereas for regular motion {{it is based on}} correlating similar contrasts. We compared tuning curves for step size and temporal interval for stimuli in which motion information was limited to a single combination of step size and interval. Tuning for step size and temporal interval was highly similar for the two types of motion. Moreover, minimal coherence thresholds for both types of motion matched quantitatively, irrespective of dot density. We also measured sensitivity for so-called no-phi motion stimuli, in which the contrast of displaced dots was set to zero. Sensitivity for no-phi motion was low for stimuli containing only black or only white dots. When both dot polarities were present in the stimulus, sensitivity was absent. Thus, motion information based on separate contrasts was effectively cancelled by a component based on different contrasts. Together these results show equal efficiency in correlating dots of opposite contrast and of similar contrast, which strongly suggests efficient detection of correlations across ON and OFF channels...|$|R
40|$|Crystalline materials, such as metals, {{are known}} to exhibit {{deviation}} from a simple linear relation between strain and stress when the latter exceeds the yield stress. In addition, {{it has been shown}} that metals respond to varying external stress in a discontinuous way in this regime, exhibiting discrete releases of energy. This crackling noise has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically when the metals are operating in the plastic regime. In our study, we focus on the behavior of metals in the elastic regime, where the stresses are well below the yield stress. We describe an instrument that aims to characterize non-linear mechanical noise in metals when stressed in the elastic regime. In macroscopic systems, this phenomenon is expected to manifest as a non-stationary noise modulated by external disturbances applied to the material, a form of mechanical up-conversion of noise. The main motivation for this work is for the case of maraging steel components (cantilevers and wires) in the suspension systems of terrestrial gravitational wave detectors. Such instruments are planned to reach very ambitious <b>displacement</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> and therefore mechanical noise in the cantilevers could prove to be a limiting factor for the detectors’ final sensitivities, mainly due to non-linear up-conversion of low frequency residual seismic motion to the frequencies of interest for the gravitational wave observations.
