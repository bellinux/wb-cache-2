5|$|Before {{turning to}} the {{district}} court's rulings, we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering {{at the same time}} whether the Act encompasses the controverted land transactions with Maine. Whether the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would best be decided, under ordinary circumstances, along with the Tribe's specific land claims, for the Act only speaks of tribes {{in the context of their}} land dealings.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> he was entrapped. She also expressed fears that the court had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case.|$|E
5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> {{to prescribe}} an antibiotic {{to a person}} with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E

5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> nominative determinism {{is a real}} effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

25|$|Since general {{taxes are}} not legally {{dedicated}} for specific purposes, they can generally be {{spent at the}} complete discretion of local politicians, including on public employee salaries and benefits.

25|$|In her {{discourse}} on Ex parte Coughlan, Melanie Roberts opined that {{the requirement of}} abuse of power could apply in cases of ultra vires promises as well. <b>In</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to allow a public body which had made a promise beyond its power to renege on its promise, the court would need to balance the public interest and the private interest, legality and certainty.

However, the courts also considered whether the decision-makers had taken irrelevant factors into account <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> the decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. This is not necessarily inconsistent with Wednesbury unreasonableness as Lord Greene said that taking extraneous factors into account could be seen an aspect of such unreasonableness.|$|E

25|$|In a line {{of cases}} {{beginning}} with Crawford v. Washington, decided in 2004, Thomas has joined with Justice Scalia and several liberals on the court in reasserting {{the importance of the}} Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, by declaring testimonial statements inadmissible at trial unless the witness is unavailable and there has been ample opportunity for cross-examination; however, his decisions in these cases had not always aligned with Scalia's. In his concurring opinion in the 2011 case Michigan v. Bryant, for example, Thomas explains that <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a statement is testimonial, one must consider the formality of the circumstances in which it was given.|$|E

25|$|Addressing {{the first}} counterargument, Judicial Commissioner Menon held that show cause {{proceedings}} {{before the court}} of three judges were not an alternative to judicial review, because the two forms of inquiry were different in nature. The court of three judges was allowed to examine {{the merits of the}} Committee's decision {{on the basis of the}} evidence presented, while judicial review was concerned with the legality of the entire decision-making process. Judicial review could thus be granted even if show cause proceedings were available. Menon thus declined to accept this submission, although he accepted that the availability of show cause proceedings was a factor to be considered by the court <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to grant judicial review.|$|E
25|$|The Minister must {{consult the}} PCRH before issuing a {{restraining}} order, and must inform the Council once an order is made.

If the Council's recommendations are contrary to the Minister's views on the matter, the President may act in his personal discretion <b>in</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to cancel or confirm the order. A restraining order cannot exceed two years in duration, but may be extended for periods not exceeding two years at a time. The Minister must review an order every 12 months or less. The Act declares decisions of the President, the Minister and the Council to be final and not subject to being called in question in any court.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{consequences}} of non-compliance with procedural or formality requirements in a written law is wholly or partly dependent on whether the requirement in question is mandatory or directory. Courts may read a requirement as both mandatory and directory; that is, mandatory as to substantial compliance, and directory as to precise compliance. Old cases usually regarded an act done or decision reached in breach of a mandatory requirement as a nullity and void ab initio (that is, from the beginning). On the other hand, an act done in breach of a directory provision is merely voidable, and therefore effective until set aside. <b>In</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a statutory provision is mandatory or directory, the courts will look at its purpose and relationship with the scheme, subject matter and object of the statute in question, and must assess the importance attached to it by Parliament.|$|E
