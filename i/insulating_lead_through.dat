40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of current leads for an orbiting superconducting magnetic spectrometer that were required to achieve a zero-current heat leak of 0. 03 W with a total coolant flow rate as low as 0. 011 g/sec cooling only the coldest third of the length of a lead. Analysis of heat flow phenomena in an <b>insulated</b> current <b>lead</b> in thermal contact with cryogenic gas flow is given for prediction of lead performance. A basic lead design was then tested and modified by such techniques as tapering, adding superconducting sections, and operating above the optimum current, until a lead satisfying the low-leak requirements was obtained. Operating the <b>insulated</b> <b>leads</b> at well above their optimum current for short periods at high mass flow is possible, and instability behavior is predictable...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{adaptive}} time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method, we study the time evolution of strongly correlated spinless fermions on a one-dimensional lattice after a sudden {{change of the}} interaction strength. For certain parameter values, two different initial states (e. g., metallic and <b>insulating),</b> <b>lead</b> to observables which become indistinguishable after relaxation. We find that the resulting quasi-stationary state is non-thermal. This result holds for both integrable and non-integrable variants of the system. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, published versio...|$|R
50|$|The faustino {{platform}} is geared towards {{measurement and control}} engineering by the hobby enthusiast. For that purpose, it is equipped with vibration resistant connectors, a wide temperature range (for example, silicone <b>insulated</b> <b>leads</b> are used), galvanic isolation of the PC interface and support for typical sensors such as ratiometric pressure sensors, thermocouples and a flow meter. Unlike other development platforms such as Arduino, only a few I/O pins of the microcontroller are unassigned and available for use with or by other circuits.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} RF-induced power deposition (p) {{generated by}} <b>insulated</b> <b>leads</b> with different lengths located in proximity to two tissues. The first tissue surrounding the leads was shaped as a cylinder with {{a diameter of}} 11 mm and located in a very large box filled with the second tissue. Lead electromagnetic models and p substantially depended on electrical properties of both tissues. If the cylinder and the box were filled with the same tissue, discrepancy to results of the two-tissue setup was up to 280 %...|$|R
50|$|These {{elements}} {{nearly always}} require <b>insulated</b> <b>leads</b> attached. PVC, silicone rubber or PTFE insulators are used at temperatures below about 250 °C. Above this, glass fibre or ceramic are used. The measuring point, and usually {{most of the}} leads, require a housing or protective sleeve, often made of a metal alloy that is chemically inert to the process being monitored. Selecting and designing protection sheaths can require more care than the actual sensor, as the sheath must withstand chemical or physical attack and provide convenient attachment points.|$|R

50|$|In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped {{selling its}} Riata and Riata ST line of {{defibrillator}} leads over {{concerns that the}} leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion. The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor {{the performance of the}} Durata and Riata ST ICD leads. The results of the analysis found that the <b>insulated</b> <b>leads</b> had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.|$|R
2500|$|A {{multimeter}} can use {{many different}} test probes {{to connect to}} the circuit or device under test. Crocodile clips, retractable hook clips, and pointed probes are the three most common types. Tweezer probes are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance surface-mount devices. The connectors are attached to flexible, well <b>insulated</b> <b>leads</b> terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while benchtop meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today. [...] Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Worldwide, most PILC MV {{underground}} cables in use {{are approaching}} {{the end of}} their design life; hence, failures are likely to increase. This paper studies the electric field and potential distributions within the PILC insulted cable containing common void-defect. The finite element model of the performance of the belted PILC MV underground cable is presented. The variation of the electric field stress within the cable using the Finite Element Method (FEM) is concentrated. The effects of the void-defect within the insulation are given. Outcomes will lead to deeper understanding of the modeling of Paper <b>Insulated</b> <b>Lead</b> Covered (PILC) and electric field response of belted PILC insulted cable containing void defect...|$|R
