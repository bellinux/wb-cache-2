5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E
5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{women who}} have not been {{eliminated}} stand in rows at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and the bachelor faces them. The bachelor has a tray with roses.|$|E
50|$|The {{great hall}} is 50 by 112 feet (15 m by 34 m) {{and has a}} {{wrap-around}} mezzanine level. There are 4-by-6 foot (1.2 m by 1.8 m) stone fireplaces at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> mezzanine level was added in 1925.|$|R
50|$|Lansdowne House, (1816-19) interiors, {{notably the}} {{sculpture}} gallery, {{central part of}} room has a shallow barrel vault with plain coffering; antae mark off <b>the</b> part circular <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{even before}} <b>the</b> gentle echo <b>of</b> these blandly spoken words had {{penetrated}} to <b>the</b> further <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Monsieur le Comte de Stainville had measured his full length face downward on the ground.|$|R
25|$|At one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{near the}} Old Supreme Court Chamber is {{a statue of}} John C. Calhoun. On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the 1998 {{shooting}} incident is clearly visible. The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back {{right side of the}} statue.|$|E
25|$|In her anger, she menaces the {{sleeping}} King. At the same moment, a curtain parts and Pythia appears, bearing a golden cup. She tells Nisia that it contains poison and urges her to satisfy her revenge, for Gyges will marry {{her and she}} will again become a Queen. A vision of Gyges is seen at the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|All of the {{paintings}} have the same height although they vary in width in order to fit {{the shape of the}} room they were intended for. The sixteen paintings that covered the long walls of the gallery measure about four meters tall by three meters wide, the three larger paintings at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> are four meters high by seven meters wide.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} looked round; his courtiers obsequiously applauded. Then, at {{opposite}} <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> doors opened, and through each filed a string <b>of</b> soldiers; <b>the</b> citizens looked at one another, wondering. A flourish of trumpets was heard in the piazza, outside, and <b>the</b> tramp <b>of</b> soldiers. Girolamo waited; at last he proceeded,-- ...|$|R
25|$|Marcotte & Co. also designed, manufactured, and {{installed}} gilded ceiling decorations. <b>The</b> central section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceiling {{was decorated with}} a large plaster panel featuring an intricate medallion flanked by swags, acanthus, escutcheons, and scrollwork. A border of acanthus, scrollwork, and egg-and-dart moldings bordered the section. On <b>the</b> narrow <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> were smaller sections, similarly decorated.|$|R
6000|$|I {{saw the two}} {{officers}} rush from opposite <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to a great opening in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> it. <b>The</b> trap-door on which the doctor had been standing, and on which he had descended, closed up with a bang at the same moment; and a friendly voice from the lower regions called out gayly, [...] "Good-by!" ...|$|R
25|$|Auvinen {{then began}} pouring {{two-stroke}} engine fuel (a gasoline and oil mixture) on corridor walls and floors, {{but he was}} not able to ignite the fuel. He then went to the school canteen on the first floor and tried to enter it, but the sliding glass doors were locked. After demanding to be let in, he fired through the glass, hitting some chairs inside. People hiding in the canteen were able to escape through the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and hid in the rooms behind the kitchen. No one was hit in the canteen.|$|E
25|$|The State Room is {{the seat}} and office of the President of Singapore. The hall is used for {{events such as the}} {{swearing-in}} of a newly elected Cabinet or President, or for presentations of awards. When it was the sitting room of Sir Shenton Thomas, he had a statue of Queen Victoria at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The statue was later removed to make way for what is now the Presidential Chair and two state flags: the National Flag and the Presidential Standard. The statue of Queen Victoria now stands {{at the end of the}} Victoria Pond located south of the Istana Grounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{imposing}} Great Hall {{originally had}} two storeys but, in the mid-17th century, John Batt's grandson removed {{the ceiling and}} inserted a gallery and a large mullioned and transomed window. It was the main thoroughfare for the house linking the wings and hub of domestic life. It was a reception room for visitors, tenants and businessmen and large gatherings. It is sparsely furnished and uncluttered. The table is placed at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as it would have}} been {{towards the end of the}} 17th century, rather than in its earlier position in the centre. The size of the room is intended to impress visitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{hall was}} fitted with {{enclosed}} pews with two aisles. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> could accommodate up to 3,500 people. Because there were pulpits on both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> pews had movable backs {{which could be}} swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding – the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood. The first floor also included a mezzanine with fourteen small rooms.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the front}} foyer opens to two <b>rooms</b> on <b>the</b> {{northern}} and southern sides. A vent with decorative fretwork is located in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at <b>the</b> southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the.</b> <b>The</b> strong <b>room</b> is accessed from this room.|$|R
2500|$|Similar to the Kirtland Temple, {{the hall}} was fitted with {{enclosed}} pews with two aisles running down its length. [...] There were also pews for a band and choir. [...] <b>The</b> <b>room</b> could accommodate up to 3,500 people. [...] Because there were pulpits on both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> pews had movable backs which could be swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding - the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood.|$|R
25|$|The kitchen area {{reflects}} {{the original design}} concept; it includes separate stations for baking and pastries and was never reduced when the original project was downsized. High quality kitchen appliances were installed so the hotel could compete with fine dining establishments, and the facility was specifically constructed to handle special events and functions. The wood beames {{in the dining room}} are actually hollow, with steel beams going through them for fire safety reasons. Every detail was carefully thought out. The alcove window at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> perfectly framed Yosemite Falls when the hotel was completed. The dining room is 130 feet long and 51 feet wide, with a 34-foot ceiling supported with rock columns creating a cathedral like atmosphere. While the dress code for the park is usually very casual, the Ahwahnee Dining Room used to require a jacket for men, but it later relaxed that tradition. Now collared shirts for men are allowed and women may wear either a dress or slacks and a blouse.|$|E
25|$|The Great Hall is sited on the castle's {{southern}} side, {{where some}} of the more visible remains still stand. This was a large room used for dining and receiving visitors. Its much enlarged windows still look south across the valley and an arched gateway leads from the west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to what was once the Kitchens {{in the basement of the}} adjacent apsidal ('D' shaped) tower. This tower, called the Welsh Tower, is a typical feature of Welsh castles of the period. It would have protruded from the castle wall into the defensive ditch and provided archers with a clear view of any attackers attempting to approach the southern wall. The tower had perhaps three storeys with living quarters on the upper floors. In the south western corner was a Postern gate. This was an additional exit from the castle, designed to be used in times of siege to allow the garrison to 'sally' out and attack their besiegers. Fragments of the arch remain as well as the slot for the door's drawbar.|$|E
25|$|Lower {{down the}} dining rooms were fitted {{out with the}} {{intention}} that the rooms would be visual equivalents of the excellent food served within them. The Chambord dining room was decorated by Mrs. Darbois-Gaudin in gold anodized aluminium, with monochrome chairs in red, orange and cream. The dome, painted black, contained an array of recessed spot-lights, and sat within a circular band of translucent, fluorescent-lit panels, all on a truncated rotunda of gold aluminium. Around all four walls of the room Jean Mandaroux's continuous mural, painted on 17 lacquered aluminium sheets, was entitled Les plaisirs de la vie: The Pleasures of Life. Less sumptuous in design, the Versailles dining room was done by Marc Simon in tones of green, white and grey. The walls were produced from Polyrey and Formica with a decoupaged gold leaf abstract pattern. Only the forward wall held a mural done in 14 engraved glass panels by Max Ingrand, {{as well as two}} tapestries, Les amoureux du printemps by Marc Saint-Saëns, and Paysage provençal by Auvigné. Lowest in the ship, the walls of the First Class swimming pool were covered with back-lit engraved glass panels by Max Ingrand, and a ceramic sculptural fountain by Jean Mayodon sat at the forward <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Egyptian Hall created c.1803, it is {{situated}} beneath the North Hall {{to which it}} is connected by the staircase by the east wall which was inserted at this time, and was created as the winter entrance, linked to the Porte-cochère created at the same time, beneath the North Portico with ramps connecting to the forecourt to allow carriages to pick up and set down passengers under cover. Decorated in the Egyptian style of decoration. The room has inward sloping walls and a vaulted ceiling, the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> has a recess flanked by two Egyptian style lotus columns that originally contained a heating stove {{in the form of a}} carved sarcophagus, removed in 1922. The frieze around the ceiling is decorated with a winged solar disk, the symbol of the god Ra and uraeus between falcon wings, alternate with Ankh the symbol of life flanked by sceptres symbols of power. There is an illuminated sun globe over the south door. Also sold in 1922 were seven canvas sepia paintings on the walls which depicted Egyptian figures and hieroglyphics and two sculptures of Sphinxes that used to be at the base of the staircase. The designer of the room is not known for certain, though Sir John Soane implied in a lecture that the 1st Marquess was responsible for the concept. In 2012 all the missing decoration and sculpture was recreated, returning the room to its original form.|$|E

500|$|The main {{corridor}} was nicknamed [...] "Peacock Alley" [...] by the New York press. The {{corridor and}} foyer {{were treated with}} pilasters and columns of Sienna marble and a color scheme {{on the walls and}} ceilings of salmon-pink, with cream-color and pale-green. The capitals of the columns and pilasters were of solid brass gilded or lacquered. The main corridor ran {{the entire length of the}} building from east to west. [...] To the left of it was the Astor Dining Room, fronting on Fifth Avenue, which measured [...] Great care was taken with it to faithfully reproduce the original dining room of the mansion, three floors above where it had stood, with all of the original paneling, carpeting, drapery and fireplace mantel and Italian Renaissance pilasters and columns, carved of marble from northern Russia. The panels of silk hangings were of rose pompadour, and a series of Charles Yardley Turner mural paintings filled arches and panels at the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> On the right of the main corridor was the Garden Court of Palms, , rising three stories to a dome-like roof of amber glass [...] above the floor. This, too, was used as a dining room. It was decorated in the Italian style, finished in gray, terracotta and Pavonazzo marble. On the 34th Street side of the corridor was the cafe, , finished in English oak in the style of the German Renaissance, with Flemish decoration. The bar formed another room [...]|$|E

60|$|As Harry {{reached the}} top, {{he found that}} <b>the</b> sill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window was two feet and a half above <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartment.

Four rows of pillars ran across it, supporting the roof above. <b>The</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> were in semi-darkness. It was not above ten feet in height. There were rude carvings on the pillars and the walls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weapons were}} guarded {{in the former}} {{building}} in large [...] "drawers" [...] of wood, i.e. large closets like cloakrooms. <b>The</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapons in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was thought thoroughly. Higher grade weapons stored inside the drawers. Firearms, archery, {{and to a lesser}} extent, some knives and small, in lanceras over the windows.

In the western headwall highlighted two small pieces of artillery and four sledges with fittings of its shots.|$|R
500|$|On {{the first}} floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, , looking out on 34th Street. The gallery, with seven French windows {{reaching}} [...] {{from floor to}} ceiling, opened out on a terrace over {{the entrance to the}} hotel. The interior was finished {{in the style of the}} Hôtel de Soubise, with a blue, gray and gold color scheme. There was a parquet floor, and on the south side, opposite the street windows, were other windows which opened into the main corridor on the second floor. The musicians' balcony, upheld by two caryatids, was at the east end. All the balcony railings were of gilded metal work. The mural paintings were notable: four panels, two at either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and twelve pendentive panels, six on either side and painted by Edward Simmons depicted the four seasons and the twelve months of the year. [...] The [...] "Colonial Room" [...] was decorated in red, contrasting with white woodwork. The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids' bedrooms and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. There was a bath for nearly every room, and every bathroom had windows opening to the air, not into shafts. In every room, there was a large trunk closet.|$|E
