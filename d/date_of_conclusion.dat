Dynamics and quantitative changes in the content of chronometric neurospecific proteins in serum of patients in acute and early periods of traumatic spinal cord disease is characterized by two-phase increase in the concentration CNTF; monotonic increase in the content of NT- 3 in all periods of observation; biphasic increase in the levels of NT- 4 to 1 - 4 th and 14 -th day from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> injury. <b>Conclusion.</b> Complex research <b>of</b> neurospecific levels of proteins in the serum allows one to evaluate selectively the individual components of the process of regeneration of nerve tissue in acute and early periods of traumatic spinal cord disease...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a model explaining why IMF programs {{are less likely}} to be concluded before national election <b>dates.</b> Since <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> an IMF arrangement may signal the incumbent’s incompetence, rational voters use this signal when deciding upon his re-election. In order to demonstrate competence, politicians may therefore decide not to conclude IMF programs prior to elections. The model also shows that re-election probabilities of politicians who nevertheless conclude ar-rangements at election times depend on the state of the economy. Using panel data for 96 countries between 1976 and 1997, the model is tested empirically. The results show that <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> an IMF arrangement within six months prior to an election increases re-election probabilities when GDP growth is low, but reduces the chance to win an election with high growth rates. 1...|$|R

40|$|Appendix A {{includes}} {{an analysis of}} conclusion and amendment dates of tax treaties. It {{is part of the}} thesis "A Multilateral Agreement for International Taxation: Designing an instrument to modernise international tax law. ' The point of Appendix A is to calculate the average time tax treaties are updated. Data from the IBFD’s tax treaty database on tax treaties, in force on 1 January 2013, was used to calculate the average time (i. e., the ‘estimated mean’) in which an OECD-member country’s tax treaty was updated. In the database, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>conclusion</b> of each selected tax treaty was coded, as well as the date of: (1) any new bilateral tax treaty concluded within the same tax treaty relationship; (2) a protocol to a treaty or (3) an exchange of notes or any other mutual agreement, provided that this agreement changed the wording of the tax treaty in question. Only the treaties of the founding states of the OECD were taken into account. These are: the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Dominion of Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Greece, the Republic of Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, the Portuguese Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation, the Turkish Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. The count includes tax treaties of these countries with non-OECD member countries. In counting the amendments to tax treaties in force, terminated treaties which have not been followed up by a new treaty, abandoned treaties as well as treaties that were not ratified before 1 - 1 - 2013, were excluded. Moreover, all pre-war (1940) treaties were not considered. [...] Appendix B includes the tax treaty case law analysis to the thesis "A Multilateral Agreement for International Taxation, Designing an instrument to modernise international tax law". Appendix B consists of a code book (description of coding per case) as well as a summary Excel file. Appendix B comprises an analysis of relevant case law decided by courts in OECD member countries. The point of the analysis is to provide some (factual) insight in the way the OECD Commentary is used to ‘modernise’ the terms of a tax treaty through interpretive rule-stretching. To circumvent discussions about the ‘status’ of the OECD Commentary under international law and in the process of tax treaty interpretation – this issue is still under debate in tax law doctrine –the reasoning of the courts as to the interpretive relevance of the OECD Commentary was not considered in the analysis. Instead, it focuses on the Commentary’s effects under five different groups of circumstances. The selection of cases as well as the relevant circumstances can be described as follows: Case selection First, a group of relevant cases, all settled within the jurisdiction of OECD member countries, was selected by using a specific search query within the database of the International Tax Law Reports. The search function was applied on 1 January 2013 and brought up about 150 judgements in which the word ‘interpretation’ was found within the same paragraph as the words ‘tax treaty’, ‘tax agreement’ or ‘tax convention’. If a case included more than one interpretative issue, each issue was assessed {{as if it were an}} individual case. This was for instance the case when a judge clearly interpreted two distinct treaty terms, or when a judgement dealt with the application of more than one tax treaty. From these ‘cases’, an additional selection excluded those which clearly fell outside the ambit of this research. Cases deselected were those in which the Commentary could clearly not have played a role, i. e.,(1) those that dealt with the interpretation of domestic tax law rather than the term of a tax treaty; (2) those not related to a tax treaty on income and capital, but e. g., to inheritance tax treaties; (3) those that dealt with tax treaty provisions that were clearly not in conformity with the OECD MTC and (4) those that dealt with the interpretation of treaty terms such as ‘profits’, ‘income’ or ‘gains’, which require domestic law rules to be calculated or determined, rather than the interpretative rules of the OECD Commentary. The use of the search function, in combination with the additional selection, resulted in a sample of ‘neutral’ cases (i. e., cases on tax treaty interpretation in which the Commentary could have been, but also in which it could not have been, of relevance). This allowed for the generalisation of the Commentary’s relevance under a set of varying circumstances. Coding and grouping of circumstances In accordance with the facts of a case, each case first coded on and then grouped within five categories of circumstances. The circumstances, here formulated in the form of questions, are: 1. 	Was a reservation on the provisions of the OECD MTC or an observation on the Commentary submitted? 2. 	Was the relevant treaty term not defined in the treaty? 3. 	Was one of the treaty parties not a member of the OECD? 4. 	Did the Commentary exist before the conclusion of the relevant bilateral tax treaty? 5. 	If question 4 was answered with no (i. e. the commentary was adopted after the conclusion of the relevant bilateral tax treaty), was that Commentary: a. 	similar to; b. 	expounding on; c. 	gap-filling in relation to; d. 	or contradictory to Commentary existing at the time of conclusion of a treaty? For each case, questions 1 to 4 were answered with either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, question 5 with ‘a’; ‘b’; ‘c’ and ‘d’. The answers were coded per case in a codebook and its related Excel database, which can be found in Appendix B. If a question could be answered with ‘yes’, that case was placed in that group. If a case could be placed in more than one group, it was. Analysis Subsequently, the influence of the Commentaries in all of the cases selected was determined, distinguishing between three possible entries: either the Commentary was used by the court, and therefore of relevance, or it was not used or disregarded by the court, and therefore not of relevance. In some cases, the Commentary’s influence could not be determined or established. These cases were coded ‘N. A (‘not applicable’). For each circumstance, this then resulted in a list of cases in which the Commentary was of relevance, a list of cases in which the Commentary was not of relevance, and a list of cases in which the relevance of the Commentary could not be determined. The gradual normative influence of the Commentary on each decision (e. g., decisive, supplementary, etc.) was not considered: coding the relative influence of the Commentary proved too problematic (one of the problems was that in most decisions, courts do not give explicit reasons for their use of Commentary). The research setup is also included in a separate PDF file...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between dislocation pile-ups and grain boundaries {{gives rise to}} heterogeneous stress distributions when a structural metal is subjected to mechanical loading. Such stress heterogeneity leads to preferential sites for damage nucleation and therefore is intrinsically linked to the strength and ductility of polycrystalline metals. To <b>date</b> the majority <b>of</b> <b>conclusions</b> have been drawn from 2 D experimental investigations at the sample surface, allowing only incomplete observations. Our purpose here is to significantly advance the understanding of such problems by providing quantitative measurements {{of the effects of}} dislocation pile up and grain boundary interactions in 3 D. This is accomplished through the application of differential aperture X-ray Laue micro-diffraction (DAXM) and high angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) techniques. Our analysis demonstrates a similar strain characterization capability between DAXM and HR-EBSD and the variation of stress intensity in 3 D reveals that different parts of the same grain boundary may have different strengths in resisting slip transfer, likely due to the local grain boundary curvature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Waiting {{times for}} cancer {{patients}} are a national {{priority in the}} UK. Previous studies have shown variation between cancer networks in the time between diagnosis and start of radiotherapy for all cancer patients. Studies {{of the relationship between}} delay in receiving treatment and survival of breast cancer patients have been inconsistent. This study aimed to examine factors associated with waiting times for radiotherapy for breast cancer patients. Methods 35, 354 women resident in South East England and diagnosed with breast cancer between 1992 and 2001 who received radiotherapy within six months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry. Time to radiotherapy was measured from either the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> diagnosis or the start of the previous treatment, whichever was shorter. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were fitted to examine whether patients received radiotherapy within 60 days of their diagnosis or previous treatment. Results The adjusted proportions of patients receiving radiotherapy within 60 days varied significantly between different cancer networks (range: 43 % to 81 %), and decreased from 68 % in 1992 to 33 % in 2001. After adjustment there was no association between deprivation of area of residence, age or stage and radiotherapy wait. Median time waited to radiotherapy increased over the study period whether measured from the start of chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery or the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> diagnosis. <b>Conclusion</b> This study covered a period of time before the investment following the Cancer Plan of 2000. Results are consistent with other findings suggesting variation between cancer networks and increasing waits over time. Further studies should examine different methods of measuring waiting time, the causes and consequences of waits for radiotherapy and the effect of current initiatives and investments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Year after year, {{we spend}} an {{increasing}} {{amount of time}} in a sitting position. Often, we sit with poor posture, as indicated by numerous pain syndromes within the musculoskeletal system. Several reports confirm that body posture and {{the amount of time spent}} in a seated position have extensive implications for our health. Previous studies and a literature review suggest there is limited knowledge regarding an ergonomic sitting position. Objective The aim of the study was to analyze the research relating to a proper sitting position and the consequences of incorrect sitting posture. A database search was conducted in Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar. Selection was made on the basis of titles, the abstracts and full texts of the studies. No limits were applied to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> publication. <b>Conclusions</b> Incorrect sitting posture contributes to many disorders, especially in the cervical and lumbar spine. It also determines the work of the respiratory system. Most authors suggest that maintenance of the physiological curvature of the spine is crucial for the biomechanics of the sitting position, as well as the location of the head and position of the pelvis. It raises awareness of work-related hazards and the introduction of education on the principles of proper seating. It is necessary to draw attention to the risks associated with work performed in a sitting posture, and education on the principles of ergonomical sitting...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{assess how}} {{involved}} patients {{wish to be}} in the compilation of their NHS core clinical record, and to assess the accuracy of general practitioner (GP) produced summaries. Design, setting, method and participants In a Scottish urban practice of 6800 patients we compiled a core clinical summary based on historical paper and electronic records. We invited a 1 in 10 sample of our patients of all ages to request, view and checka copy of their core clinical record. We offered patients the chance to discuss and correct any inaccuracies in their core clinical summary by use of a response form, telephone or meeting. Results Out of 646 patients, 258 (40 % of our sample) responded to the invitation to checktheir core clinical summary. Of those, 187 (72. 5 %) of these summaries were accurate according to patients. There were 89 inaccuracies reported by patients. Of these, 42 (47 %) were of obvious clinical importance including wrongly entered diagnoses, or missing major morbidity such as an operation, or errors in repeat medication. There were 47 (53 %) inaccuracies in lifestyle data (smoking, alcohol history or weight), or <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> illnesses. <b>Conclusion</b> Only a minority of patients chose to view and offer comment on their core clinical summaries. The majority of summaries were deemed to be accurate but there was a worrying level of omission and inaccuracy, including medication. It might be a better use of time to support doctors and patients working together to construct and check summaries rather than on information technology (IT) and the complex ethical debate surrounding the core clinical Spine...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rho kinases (ROCKs) are {{involved}} in regulating a variety of physiologic functions including cytoskeletal reorganization, migration, adhesion, survival and proliferation. They do so via activating several different downstream substrates such as myosin light chain phosphatase, LIM kinase and ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins. To <b>date,</b> most <b>of</b> the <b>conclusions</b> {{with regard to the}} function of ROCKs have involved the use of cell line models, pharmacologic inhibitors and dominant negative approaches. Importantly, the role of ROCK in hematopoiesis or leukemogenesis in the context of whole organism remains poorly understood. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies utilizing mice deficient in the expression of ROCK 1 have begun to shed some light into the physiologic role(s) of ROCK in both normal and abnormal hematopoiesis. Findings, thus far, suggest that ROCK plays an essential role in regulating growth and survival in different hematopoietic lineages via distinct mechanisms, in part, by utilizing distinct downstream substrates including maintaining the activation of tumor-suppressor genes. SUMMARY: In blood cells, emerging data suggest that ROCK plays an essential role in negatively regulating inflammatory and erythropoietic stress and positively regulates the growth and survival of leukemic cells...|$|R

Results A retrospective study on 14 patients with recurrent head and neck cancers undergone 125 I seed implantation with different seed activities. The post-plan showed that the actuarial D 90 of 125 I seeds ranged from 90 to 218 Gy (median, 157. 5 Gy). The follow-up was 3 to 60 months (median, 13 months). The median local control was 18 months (95 % CI, 6. 1 - 29. 9 months), and the 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, and 5 - year local controls were 52 %, 39 %, 39 %, and 39 %, respectively.
