The analysis was based on the use of data from the WORLDCLIM database, spatialization through GIS techniques, and the distribution of different plant species. Hence, the bioclimatic zones were characterized by spatial approach using Emberger pluviothermic Chart. The results showed that according to the different <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>aridity,</b> the hyper-arid areas in Morocco represent 45 to 55 % of the country. The spatial distribution of rainfall showed that 48 % of Moroccan territory receives less than 100 mm annually, while areas where the precipitation is more than 600 mm do not exceed 6 %. Arid, semi-arid and sub-humid zones potentially affected by desertification represent 42 %. The comparison <b>of</b> different <b>indices</b> used showed that De Martonne aridity index seems to be satisfactory for regional studies. The derivation of the bioclimatic zones map, based on the diagram of Emberger, (Q 2 and Tmin) showed the existence of five main types of climates in Morocco, ranging from humid to peraride. The per-humid bioclimatic stage is not significant and is limited to the crest of Rif mountains (< 5 km²).

40|$|Background: Measurements of tree {{heights and}} diameters are {{essential}} in forest assessment and modelling. Tree heights {{are used for}} estimating timber volume, site index and other important variables related to forest growth and yield, succession and carbon budget models. However, the diameter at breast height (dbh) can be more accurately obtained and at lower cost, than total tree height. Hence, generalized height-diameter (h-d) models that predict tree height from dbh, age and other covariates are needed. For a more flexible but biologically plausible estimation of covariate effects we use shape constrained generalized additive models {{as an extension of}} existing h-d model approaches. We use causal site parameters such as <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>aridity</b> to enhance the generality and causality of the models and to enable predictions under projected changeable climatic conditions. Methods: We develop unconstrained generalized additive models (GAM) and shape constrained generalized additive models (SCAM) for investigating the possible effects of tree-specific parameters such as tree age, relative diameter at breast height, and site-specific parameters such as <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>aridity</b> and sum of daily mean temperature during vegetation period, on the h-d relationship of forests in Lower Saxony, Germany. Results: Some of the derived effects, e. g. effects of age, <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>aridity</b> and sum of daily mean temperature have significantly non-linear pattern. The need for using SCAM results from {{the fact that some of}} the model effects show partially implausible patterns especially at the boundaries of data ranges. The derived model predicts monotonically increasing levels of tree height with increasing age and temperature sum and decreasing aridity and social rank of a tree within a stand. The definition of constraints leads only to marginal or minor decline in the model statistics like AIC. An observed structured spatial trend in tree height is modelled via 2 -dimensional surface fitting. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the SCAM approach allows optimal regression modelling flexibility similar to the standard GAM but with the additional possibility of defining specific constraints for the model effects. The longitudinal character of the model allows for tree height imputation for the current status of forests but also for future tree height prediction.

40|$|Aim {{of study}} : The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the effect of species mixing of Scots pine and Norway spruce on the productivity at the stand and species level. We also analysed to what extent the mixing effects is modified by drought stress. Area of study : The study was conducted inN-E Poland and based on three experiments located in Maskulińskie, Strzałowo and Kwidzyn Forest Districts. Material and methods : We evaluated long-term mixed-species experiments in Scots pine and Norway spruce which are under continuous survey since more than 100 years. Stand productivity was analysed based on the periodic annual increment and total yield of stem volume. Growth and yield were compared between mixed and neighbouring pure stands. As a substitute for the missing Norway spruce monocultures, we used appropriate yield table data. In order to characterize the effect of water supply on the mixing effects, we correlated the Martonne <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>aridity</b> with the ratio of Scots pine growth in mixed versus pure stands. Main results : We found that the mixed stands exceed the weighted mean of the pure stands’ volume productivity on average by 41 %. At the species level Scots pine benefits from the mixture by 34 % and Norway spruce by 83 %. Growth periods with harsh climate conditions reinforce overyielding, while periods with mild conditions reduce the benefit of mixing. The overyielding of mixed stands, especially when growing under unfavourable conditions, is explained by niche complementarity of both species and discussed in view of the stress-gradient-hypothesis. Research highlights : The revealed overyielding of mixed compared with neighbouring pure stands, particularly under harsh weather conditions, substantiates the preferences of Scots pine-Norway spruce mixtures regarding climate change.     Keywords: drought resilience; mixed stand; pure stand; facilitation; competition; overyielding; underyielding...|$|E

For this pur-pose, the {{methodology}} for generating surrogate climate-change scenarios with a RCM is employed. For the present climate (CTRL) the RCM is initialized with and driven by ECMWF/ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Two aridity indices are used: the Budyko and the UNEP indices. The results for the CTR are in agreement with other model studies which indicate future warming; rainfall increases in southeastern South America, Ecuador and Peru and decreases in the central and eastern Amazon.

Aridity indices are often used for the climate-based land classification and monitoring droughts. Hence, this study aimed at analysis of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>aridity</b> <b>indices</b> in Raya valley, northern Ethiopia. Meteorological data from eight meteorological stations located throughout the study area were used to compute the three aridity indices employed: the De Martonne aridity index (IDM), the Pinna combinative index (IP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization aridity index (IFAO).

40|$|Aridity is {{generally}} {{defined as the}} 'degree to which a climate lacks moisture to sustain life in terrestrial ecosystems'. Several recent studies using the 'aridity index' (the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation), have concluded that aridity will increase with CO 2 because of increasing temperature. However, the 'aridity index' is—counterintuitively—not a direct measure <b>of</b> <b>aridity</b> per se (when defined as above) and there is widespread evidence that contradicts the 'warmer is more arid' interpretation. We provide here an assessment of multi-model changes in a broad set <b>of</b> <b>aridity</b> metrics over a large range of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations ranging from conditions at the last glacial maximum to 4 xCO 2, using an ensemble of simulations from state-of-the-art Earth system models.
