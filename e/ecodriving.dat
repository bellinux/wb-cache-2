The present research aimed to advance understanding of HEV drivers' <b>ecodriving</b> strategies, and the challenges for optimal user-energy interaction. We conducted interviews with 39 HEV drivers who achieved above-average fuel efficiencies. Regression analyses showed that technical system knowledge and <b>ecodriving</b> motivation were both important predictors for <b>ecodriving</b> efficiency. Qualitative data analyses showed that drivers used a plethora of <b>ecodriving</b> strategies and had diverse conceptualisations of HEV energy efficiency regarding aspects such as the efficiency of actively utilizing electric energy or the efficiency of different acceleration strategies. Drivers also reported several false beliefs regarding HEV energy efficiency that could impair <b>ecodriving</b> efforts.

Because of its promise to improve fuel economy within the existing fleet, <b>ecodriving</b> has gained increased attention in North America. One strategy to improve <b>ecodriving</b> is through public education with information on how to ecodrive. This report provides a review and study of <b>ecodriving</b> from several angles. The report offers a literature review of previous work and programs in <b>ecodriving</b> across the world. In addition, researchers completed interviews with experts in the field of public relations and public message campaigns to ascertain best practices for public campaigns. Further, the study also completed a set of focus groups evaluating consumer response to a series of websites that displayed <b>ecodriving</b> information. Finally, researchers conducted a set of surveys, including a controlled stated-response study conducted with approximately 100 University of California, Berkeley faculty, staff, and students, assessing the effectiveness of static <b>ecodriving</b> web-based information as well as an intercept clipboard survey in the San Francisco Bay Area. The stated-response study consisted of a comparison of the experimental and control groups. It found that exposure to <b>ecodriving</b> information influenced people’s driving behavior and some maintenance practices. The experimental group’s distributional shift was statistically significant, particularly for key practices including: lower highway cruising speed, driving behavior adjustment, and proper tire inflation. Within the experimental group (N = 51), fewer respondents significantly changed their maintenance practices (16 %) than the majority that altered some driving practices (71 %). This suggests intentionally altering driving behavior is easier than planning better maintenance practices. While it was evident that not everyone modifies their behavior as a result of reviewing the <b>ecodriving</b> website, even small shifts in behavior due to inexpensive information dissemination could be deemed cost effective in reducing fuel consumption and emissions...|$|E

In this field, many improvements could be realized on the transportation side and more precisely on passenger cars which are an important source of pollution. A quick and efficient solution to reduce fuel consumption and so, greenhouse gases emissions, is to adopt an ecological way of driving, called <b>ecodriving.</b> However, is <b>ecodriving</b> really efficient in terms of mobility and environment at a global point of view? The benefits of <b>ecodriving</b> have often been studied for an isolated vehicle and rarely for a whole network. The aim of this work is to estimate the effects of <b>ecodriving</b> on traffic congestion and fuel consumption according to the percentage of ecodrivers in the population. This has been achieved using a class of ecodriven vehicles with a car-following model (Intelligent Driver Model) and with a transport simulation software (Aimsun). Results show that the effect of <b>ecodriving</b> on the traffic congestion and pollution is not linearly linked to the proportion of ecodrivers and this effect varies according to the driving conditions.

Strategies focused on traffic operation can achieve energy savings in short term and with associated low investments. For that purpose the main strategies are the design of efficient timetables and driving (<b>ecodriving).</b> The <b>ecodriving</b> applies coasting commands (null traction force) to reduce energy consumption, taking into account downhill slopes, speed reductions, etc (Acikbas and Soylemez, 2008). However, timetable models in literature do not typically consider energy minimization as a goal, and punctuality requirements under uncertainty.

40|$|Transportation-related {{fossil fuel}} {{consumption}} and greenhouse gas emissions have received increasing public concern in recent years. To reduce energy consumption and mitigate {{the environmental impact of}} transportation activities, this dissertation research work aims at providing technical solutions by taking advantage of recent technology development in vehicle automation, vehicle connectivity and vehicle electrification. More specifically, a driver-vehicle-infrastructure cooperative framework for energy efficient driving of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is proposed in this dissertation. Within this framework, this research improves energy efficiency of PEVs in the following ways: vehicle dynamics optimization and powertrain optimization, as well as co-optimization between them. For vehicle dynamics optimization, a connected <b>ecodriving</b> system has been designed for PEVs to optimize their speed profiles when travelling through signalized intersections, by receiving real-time signal phase and timing information obtained through wireless communications. The calculated optimal speed trajectory (in terms of energy efficiency) is provided to the driver through an in-vehicle display in real-time. The performance of this connected <b>ecodriving</b> system is implemented and evaluated at different automation levels: human driving without considering the driver error, human driving considering the driver error, and partial automated (longitudinal) driving. Numerical analysis with real-world driving data shows that there is 12 %, 14 % and 21 % potential energy savings that can be achieved by these proposed strategies respectively. For powertrain operation optimization, an evolutionary algorithm based power-split control system for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle has been designed and evaluated with real-world traffic data. The designed model is used to optimally control the power-split between two different power sources (i. e., battery and gas tank) by considering various traffic conditions to achieve the minimum fuel consumption when satisfying total power-demand. In addition, a reinforcement-learning based autonomous learning strategy is also proposed for learning the optimal power-split decision based on historical driving data. Approximately 14 % and 12 % energy savings are identified by these two different powertrain operation strategies respectively. For co-optimization of the vehicle dynamics and powertrain optimization, a bi-level optimization strategy has been designed and tested with real-world driving data to achieve augmented energy benefits from the compound effect of vehicle dynamics and powertrain operations optimization. An average of 29 % improvement of fuel efficiency for the tested PHEV is identified by combining the vehicle dynamics and powertrain operation optimization. The main contribution of this dissertation research is the design and validation of a driver-vehicle-infrastructure framework for PEV energy efficient driving. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is one of the}} first efforts to systematically investigate the potential energy benefits of both vehicle dynamics and powertrain operation optimization as well as its compound effect with real-world driving data for PEVs.

The methodology combines traffic and emission modelling at micro and macro scales. The integration of these scales is an important feature because a measure to influence the behaviour of single vehicles may {{have an impact on the}} whole network, while traffic management at the network level may influence the behaviour of the single vehicles. The paper presents results of a number of ITS systems including Variable Speed Limit (VSL), Green Navigation (GN), Urban Traffic Control (UTC), <b>Ecodriving</b> and Adaptive Cruise Control Systems (ACC). These measures have been tested for concrete application cases implemented in the cities of Turin, Madrid and Rome. Starting point were real-world data collected by means of floating cars. The investigations have taken into account different penetration rates of ICT measures, as well as different traffic conditions (e. g. free flow, congested). Each case has been modelled for the current and at least on future fleet composition. The results indicate that ITS are overall able to contribute to CO 2 emissions reduction by several percent points; the effects, nevertheless, are different depending on local conditions. The CO 2 benefit is also found to be constrained by the penetration rates of the on-road ITS equipped vehicles: as this share increases a maximum is reached at up to 50 % penetration rate and under non-congested conditions...|$|E

Several factors critical to the likelihood of success of instigating an <b>ecodriving</b> program within a corporate fleet, {{and the ability to}} assess both the benefits and full range of costs, are tied to the organisation’s management principles, policies and practices. While all proponents of ecodrive training note the importance of such corporate and management factors, no example was found in the literature assessing the reality of actually applying them. Here we describe the experience of trialling an ecodrive training program and monitoring outcomes for six months across four corporate fleets of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles; in two of those fleets the monitored vehicles were driven by dedicated drivers (i. e. one driver per vehicle), a third involved pool vehicles, and the fourth was a mix of fleet types. Initial results provide insight into the impact of ecodrive training and highlight shortcomings with existing management information systems that need to be overcome for organisations to more effectively manage fuel economy. The lessons are relevant for those who market such training, those who seek to apply it, and those tasked with determining whether it is a worthwhile expense and disruption to the business.

This paper estimates energy and GHG emissions intensities of the Irish construction sector and subsectors and estimates its contribution to Irish national emissions. This information is used to identify and assess the impacts of policy measures which {{would result in a}} reduction in emissions from the sector in a cost-effective manner. Energy and emissions intensities are estimated using input-output analysis techniques applied to Irish construction sector.

This is especially important on high speed lines, in expansion in many countries, given that very high levels of consumption are involved. Energy saving strategies focused on traffic operation can be applied in the short term with low levels of investment, in particular <b>ecodriving,</b> timetable design and the on line regulation of trains. However approaches in the literature to minimize energy do not normally consider specific models for manual driving in high speed lines and the commercial punctuality constraints of this type of services, and do {{not take into account the}} uncertainty associated with manual driving. The aim of this paper is the on line regulation of high speed trains recalculating the energy efficient manual driving to be executed by the driver when significant delays arise. The manual driving is modeled by means of fuzzy parameters: the speed regulation and the response time of the driver when a new driving command has to be applied. The punctuality requirement of the railway operator is represented as a necessity fuzzy measure of punctual arrival at stations. The proposed method for the on line recalculation of efficient driving is a Genetic Algorithm with fuzzy parameters based on an accurate simulation of the train motion.

40|$|Conventional road {{transport}} has {{negative impact on}} the environment. Stimulating eco-driving through feedback to the driver about his/her energy conservation performance has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions and promote fuel cost savings. Not all drivers respond well to the same type of feedback. Research has shown that different drivers are attracted to different types of information and feedback. The goal {{of this paper is to}} explore which different driver segments with specific psychographic characteristics can be distinguished, how these characteristics can be used in the development of an <b>ecodriving</b> support system and whether tailoring eco-driving feedback technology to these different driver segments will lead to increased acceptance and thus effectiveness of the eco feedback technology. The driver segments are based on the value orientation theory and learning orientation theory. Different possibilities for feedback were tested in an exploratory study in a driving simulator. An explorative study was selected since the choice of the display (how and when the information is presented) may have a strong impact on the results. This makes testing of the selected driver segments very difficult. The results of the study nevertheless suggest that adapting the display to a driver segment showed an increase in acceptance in certain cases. The results showed small differences for ratings on acceptation, ease of use, favouritism and a lower general rating between matched (e. g., learning display with learning oriented drivers) and mismatched displays (e. g., learning display with performance oriented drivers). Using a display that gives historical feedback and incorporates learning elements suggested a non-verifiable increase in acceptance for learning oriented drivers. However historical feedback and learning elements may be less effective for performance oriented drivers, who may need comparative feedback and game elements to improve energy conserving driving behaviour.

One way to help reduce the detrimental impact of motorized road transportation is to lead drivers, particularly car-dependent ones, to adopt eco-driving. However numerous drivers do not abide by highway laws or display driving-anger behaviors, which are in opposition to eco-driving. Unfortunately, few people practice eco-driving and many new adopters often have trouble maintaining this driving style. What is more, most studies on this issue have focused on eco-driving gains, the ability of people to put it into effect, and/or the continuous {{decline in the number of}} people who practice eco-driving. They usually do not take into account people's self-perceptions about their driving style, nor the associated beliefs. The aim of the present self-report study was twofold: identify drivers' self-perceptions about being an eco-driver, and determine how these self-perceptions about being an eco-driver or not are linked to eco-driving-friendly behaviors, levers favoring eco-driving (concern for the environment), and brakes on eco-driving (driving anger and road violations), according to gender. An online survey was carried out with 300 French drivers (127 men) ages 19 - 83. In our sample, 11. 3 % of the drivers said they felt they were eco-drivers (G 1); 50 % said they feel trying to eco-drive (G 2); 9. 7 % said they had never heard of eco-driving and 25 % said they knew about eco-driving but didn't do it (G 3, felt they were not eco-driver), and 4 % said they felt they had abandoned eco-driving (G 4). The differences between the first three groups (G 1 vs. G 2 /G 3) were in line with their eco-driving self-perceptions: G 1 had higher scores on three eco-driving-friendly behavior scale components and on environmental conservation, and lower scores on one factor of the driving-anger scale. Also in line with the groups' eco-driving self-perceptions, G 2 's scores were higher than G 3 's scores on one eco-driving friendly behavior component. A gender-by-group interaction was found for G 1 vs. G 3 on one eco-driving friendly behavior component, with a larger increase in the men's than the women's scores on <b>ecodriving</b> self-perceptions. Finally, violation scores, once again, were higher for men than for women on the speed and anger subscales. The findings of this study are discussed with respect to improving eco-driving learnin...|$|E
