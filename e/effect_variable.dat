The main difference between causal inference and inference of association is that the former analyzes the response of the <b>effect</b> <b>variable</b> when the cause is changed.

40|$|While {{psychologists and}} {{behavioral}} economists {{emphasize the importance}} of social influences, an outstanding issue is how to capture such influences in behavioral models used to inform urban planning and policy. In this paper we focus on operational models that do not require explicit knowledge of the individual networks of decision makers. We employ a field <b>effect</b> <b>variable</b> to capture social influences, which is calculated as the percent of population in the peer group that has chosen the specific alternative. We define the peer group based on socio-economic status and spatial proximity of residential location. As in behavioral economics and psychology, the concept is that one is influenced by the choices made by one's peers. However, using such a social influence variable in a behavioral model causes complications because it is likely endogenous; unobserved factors that impact the peer group also influence the decision maker, yielding correlation between the field <b>effect</b> <b>variable</b> and the error. The contribution of this paper is the use of the Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (BLP) method to correct the endogeneity in a choice model. The two-stage BLP introduces constants for each peer group to remove the endogeneity from the choice model (where it is difficult to deal with) and insert it into a linear regression model (where endogeneity is relatively easier to deal with). We test the method using a mode choice data set from the Netherlands and readily available software and find there is an upward bias of the field effect parameter when endogeneity is not corrected. The procedure outlined presents a practical and tractable method for incorporating social influences in choice models.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method for {{inferring}} whether X causes Y {{or vice versa}} from joint observations of X and Y. The basic idea is to model the observed data using probabilistic latent variable models, which incorporate the effects of unobserved noise. To this end, we consider the hypothetical <b>effect</b> <b>variable</b> to {{be a function of}} the hypothetical cause variable and an independent noise term (not necessarily additive). An important novel aspect of our work is that we do not restrict the model class, but instead put general non-parametric priors on this function and on the distribution of the cause. The causal direction can then be inferred by using standard Bayesian model selection. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and real-world data and report encouraging results. ...|$|E

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - Aseptic {{loosening}} is a {{main cause of}} late revision in total knee replacement (TKR). Migration of implants as measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) can predict future loosening. This migration is associated with bone resorption. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to receptors on osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. This prevents osteoclast formation, resulting in less bone resorption in cortical and trabecular bone. We investigated whether denosumab can reduce migration of TKR, as measured with RSA. Patients and methods - In this 2 -center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 50 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were treated with an injection of either denosumab (60 mg) or placebo 1 day after knee replacement surgery and again after 6 months. RSA was performed postoperatively and after 6, 12, and 24 months. The primary <b>effect</b> <b>variable</b> was RSA maximal total point motion (MTPM) after 12 months. We also measured other RSA variables and the knee osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS). Results - The primary <b>effect</b> <b>variable,</b> MTPM after 12 months, showed that migration in the denosumab group was statistically significantly less than in the controls. Denosumab MTPM 12 months was reduced by one-third (denosumab: median 0. 24 mm, 10 % and 90 % percentiles: 0. 15 and 0. 41; placebo: median 0. 36 mm, 10 % and 90 % percentiles: 0. 20 and 0. 62). The secondary MTPM variables (6 and 24 months) also showed a statistically significant reduction in migration. There {{was no significant difference}} in MTPM for the period 12 - 24 months. KOOS sub-variables were similiar between denosumab and placebo after 12 and 24 months. Interpretation - Denosumab reduces early migration in total knee replacement, as in previous trials using bisphosphonates. As migration is related to the risk of late loosening, denosumab may be beneficial for long-term results. Funding Agencies|Eli Lilly Corp; Amgen</p...|$|E
