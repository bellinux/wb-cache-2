5|$|The two white-tailed {{cockatoo}} {{species were}} called short-billed and long-billed black cockatoos in scientific works, {{yet they were}} called Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoo in Western Australia. Hence ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles pushed for the latter two names to be used. The International Ornithologists' Union <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> this suggestion and uses these names as their official common names. The local Noongar people did not distinguish between Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoos. Nyungar names recorded include ngolyenok, ngoolyoo (from Northampton), and G'noo-le-a (from Geraldton).|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
