50|$|In {{the latter}} {{decades of the}} ninth century, Scandinavian {{settlers}} arrived in Britain, bringing with them their own pre-Christian beliefs. No cultic sites used by Scandinavian pagans have been archaeologically identified, although place names suggest some possible examples. For instance, Roseberry Topping in North Yorkshire was known as Othensberg in the twelfth century, a name which derived from the Old Norse Óðinsberg, or 'Hill of Óðin'. A number of place-names also contain Old Norse references to mythological entities, such as alfr, skratii, and troll. A number of pendants representing Mjolnir, the hammer of the god Thor, have also been found in England, reflecting the probability that he was worshipped among the Anglo-Scandinavian population. Jesch argued that, given {{that there was only}} evidence for the worship of Odin and Thor in Anglo-Scandinavian England, these might have been the only deities to have been actively venerated by the Scandinavian settlers, even if they were aware of the mythological stories surrounding other Norse gods and goddesses. The English church found itself in need of conducting a new conversion process to Christianise this <b>incoming</b> <b>population.</b> It is not well understood how the Christian institutions converted these Scandinavian settlers, in part {{due to a lack of}} textual descriptions of this conversion process equivalent to Bede's description of the earlier Anglo-Saxon conversion.

Worse, new municipalities have been created for political reasons without any consideration of their capacity for implementing their required legal tasks. These tasks are especially not being achieved in the field of spatial planning. Instead, Slovenia is witnessing an imprudent construction of infrastructure at the micro level.

40|$|Global {{patterns}} of ethnolinguistic diversity vary tremendously. Some regions show very little variation even across vast expanses, whereas others exhibit dense mosaics of different languages spoken alongside one another. Compared {{with the rest}} of Native North America, prehistoric California exemplified the latter. Decades of linguistic, genetic, and archaeological research have produced detailed accounts of the migrations that aggregated to build California’s diverse ethnolinguistic mosaic, but there have been few have attempts to explain the process underpinning these migrations and why such a mosaic did not develop elsewhere. Here we show that environmental productivity predicts both the order of migration events and the population density recorded at contact. The earliest colonizers occupied the most suitable habitats along the coast, whereas subsequent Mid–Late Holocene migrants settled in more marginal habitats. Other Late Holocene patterns diverge from this trend, reflecting altered dynamics linked to food storage and increased sedentism. Through repeated migration events, <b>incoming</b> <b>populations</b> replaced resident populations occurring at lower densities in lower-productivity habitats, thereby resulting in the fragmentation of earlier groups and the development {{of one of the most}} diverse ethnolinguistic patterns in the Americas. Such a process may account for the distribution of ethnolinguistic diversity worldwide...|$|R

The thesis is that this creative class has actually in its hands the future of Milan’s symbolic economy and can connect the big protagonists and the many who are discarded by the city. Starting from these considerations, the six neighborhoods taken into account were classified into a typology according to the importance of the small cultural enterprises for their regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Historically in {{the centre}} of migratory questions, France {{represents}} today, in a wider European frame, a paradigmatic and evident example of the growing difficulties concerning the integration of “new foreigners”, i. e. refugees, immigrants coming from ex colonies or minorities. The so called “forced emigration”, which regards a considerable and articulated {{part of the world}} population, absolutely needs a peculiar sensibility of the social worker: he has to know non solum the perspectives of the profession and its imposing regulations sed etiam the culture, the uses and customs of the <b>incoming</b> <b>populations,</b> to better plan an aimed, specific social action. For this reason, the approach of the social worker has to be necessarily transnational, and, of course, interdisciplinary. In the last few years France has been carrying out some meaningful legislative reforms, producing a revolution in the world of social activism concerning those populations generically defined as “immigrates”: the absorption of the whole principle structures that for decades used to manage the social politics referring to immigration, in two main Agencies. Even if this act could be considered as the rationalisation of a farraginous system of social intervention, anyway it gives rise to several doubts and worries, because of the new meaning that French politicians want to give to the primar...|$|R

30|$|Finally, to {{generate}} the more rarely seen beam distributions (12 % of observations), a number of mechanisms may play a role. If electrostatic fields indeed prove responsible for the observed energy dependent electron reflection, these fields will also accelerate secondary electrons and/or pho-toelectrons from the surface, producing an upward-going beam. This beam should prove unstable to various streaming instabilities, naturally spreading it in energy and angle, commensurate with observations. These instabilities would also affect the <b>incoming</b> <b>population,</b> possibly leading to the isotropized downward-going flux that we observe for beam distributions, either directly through a streaming instability, or via production of whistlers that could then cause pitch angle diffusion.|$|E

Currently, new immigration has reopened {{the debate about}} the ‘Other Catalans’ triggered by concern with the integration of the <b>incoming</b> <b>population.</b> An ‘intersectional approach’ to social divisions suggests that class and ethnic school segregation responds to strategic parental choice and informal policy arrangements. School segregation indices report a more even distribution in most localities, reinforced isolation of ‘foreign students’ in a few public schools in some large cities and a persistent divide between more comprehensive public schools and selective private‐dependent schools in a variety of towns. According to these findings, the analytical approach points at some clues to make sense of impact of distributive policies, the influence of policy contradictions and the success of mobilisation and lobbying political strategies...|$|E

30|$|At first glance, a non-monotonic {{potential}} structure {{above the}} dayside surface seems implausible, but several intuitive explanations exist. First, consider {{the interface between}} the near-surface photoelectron sheath, which contains a cold electron population, and the solar wind, which contains a warmer <b>incoming</b> <b>population.</b> This physical situation, with two populations with unequal temperatures in contact, favors {{the formation of a}} double layer, with a potential drop on the order of the electron temperature difference (Ishiguro et al., 1985). The superposition of this new double layer with the original sheath naturally results in a non-monotonic potential. In addition, the non-monotonic potential helps to maintain quasi-neutrality upstream from the Moon. As an interplanetary magnetic field line contacts the dayside lunar surface, sunward-going electrons rapidly vacate the field line (because the Moon blocks additional sunward-going electrons from refilling these flux tubes), leaving only a portion of the solar wind electron distribution on the field lines upstream from the Moon. This population cannot balance the charge of the solar wind ion beam. The non-monotonic potential provides a resolution to this situation, by reflecting most of the incoming solar wind electrons, and accelerating enough photoelectrons to the electron temperature to balance any remaining deficit, thus much more closely maintaining quasi-neutrality upstream.|$|E
40|$|Developing {{countries}} experience high {{population growth}} and pronounced agglomerations with extreme population increases in metropolitan centers which lack relevant infrastructure. Frequently, urban development in developing countries can not proceed in an environmentally friendly fashion, urban plans are not implemented correctly, and green areas are lost due to constructions. Occupying 1 % of the Turkish land area and accommodating over one sixth of the Turkish population, Istanbul is one of such cities and its population has increased from one million to 13 million in the last 60 years. Urban area including settlements has been increasing continuously throughout those years {{at the expense of}} losing the green areas. The amount of green areas had diminished from 27325 to 8908 hectares in the last 60 years with a reduction of 67 % as opposed to settlement areas increasing by more than five fold from 3417 to 22178 hectares in the study area. The most significant reason behind that is that Istanbul has to live through a vast population increase. Although green areas kept increasing constantly in the 30 years between 1975 and 2004 from 1695 hectares to 5435, the amount of urban green per capita had dropped from 6. 7 m 2 /person in 1975 to 5. 5 m 2 /person in 2004 even though the total amount of green areas had increased, to show that the enhancement of the green areas could not keep up with the pace of <b>incoming</b> <b>population...</b>|$|E

The research was undertaken at the LSE by a team of research professionals led by Ricky Burdett and Tony Travers and its conclusions are of profound significance to the future development of London. While it focused on the issue of density in urban neighbourhoods and what makes them successful, it has practical lessons for the whole approach towards sustainable communities in the UK and internationally. “Density” has become a key policy issue in London. After decades of decline, the city is set to grow. The London Plan envisages 700, 000 new households and 400, 000 new jobs by 2016 and the Mayor has decided to accommodate this growth within London’s existing boundaries. A growing population contained within the same footprint implies higher residential densities. Yet higher densities are often associated with town cramming, deprivation and anti-social behaviour even though London has many affluent, safe and popular higher density neighbourhoods. But London’s population is not only growing: it is changing.
