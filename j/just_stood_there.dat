He was later arrested, {{but when he}} started to black out police didn't do {{anything}} and <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and watched. He was restrained by handcuffs which made the matters worse and he wasn't released because police lost the keys. After 15 minutes, an ambulance was called but never arrived. Finally, a volunteer took Baharuddin to a nearby hospital but it was already too late. Police said he died of heart complications.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E

500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room and he was so... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b> He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and went, [...] "This is so cool.

York and Broom were members of a Northampton-based band called The Apex Group, fronted by bass player and band leader Frank Short. Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to British Timken in Northampton, and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar. Hunter recalls jumping around like a lunatic on stage: [...] "Music affected me so much.

Jackson, and Kevin Bacon. During the filming of a scene with Barbra Streisand on All Night Long in which Streisand was playing a character who could not sing, Brown remembered, [...] "...when we started to film that scene, she opened her mouth and this incredible voice came out.
