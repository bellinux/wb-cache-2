5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> {{propagating}} the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on {{the branches of}} suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.|$|E
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E

5|$|Chemical defense <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae {{use their}} posture for {{releasing}} noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes {{other than just}} protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E

5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase {{is also important}} in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.|$|E

5|$|Research <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> 4X {{games because}} {{technological}} progress is an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part.

5|$|The bill's {{appearance}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> {{the interactions}} of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.|$|E
5|$|The krypton {{fluoride}} laser <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> {{nuclear fusion}} energy research in confinement experiments. The laser has high beam uniformity, short wavelength, and the spot size can be varied to track an imploding pellet.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectroscopy}} {{of molecular}} oxygen {{is associated with}} the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow. The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann–Runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the chemistry of the middle atmosphere. Excited state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution.|$|E

5|$|This {{classification}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> geochemistry. Minerals such as olivine, (Mg,Fe)SiO4 are classed as ultramafic; olivine is {{a compound}} of a very basic oxide, MgO, with an acidic oxide, silica, SiO2.|$|E

5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} way that the independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E

5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> this species, {{despite its}} restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside {{or leave the}} nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated {{in response to}} viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
