5|$|Available on a free transfer, Holroyd {{attracted}} {{the interest of}} Macclesfield Town, having <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> five months on loan with the club. However, no permanent transfer materialised, and, on 17 January 2013, he signed for League Two side Morecambe on a contract {{until the end of}} the 2012–13 season. Holroyd made his debut a day after signing for the club, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 0–0 home draw against Cheltenham Town.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day, Liz {{goes to her}} dentist {{appointment}} and tells the receptionist {{that she did not}} sign the waiver. After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no effect on her and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E
5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and {{found themselves in}} a similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives in their home countries or some combination of these factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men.|$|E

25|$|The West German Federal Government {{was very}} {{reluctant}} to prosecute Tiede and Ruske because of the West German policy of supporting the right of East Germans to flee oppression in the GDR.

Instead they ended up on the planet Zeta Minor (Planet of Evil), located at the far edge of the known universe. From this point on the Doctor and Sarah travelled alone.|$|E
25|$|When Eden {{was taken}} mortally ill with liver cancer, he and Lady Avon had <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> their final Christmas {{together}} at Hobe Sound, Florida as guests of former New York Governor Averell Harriman, elder statesman of the Democratic Party, and his English-born wife Pamela. (Mrs Harriman was Lady Avon's exact contemporary, a débutante of 1938 {{who had also}} taken {{a room at the}} Dorchester during the Second World War. She had previously been married to Lady Avon's cousin Randolph Churchill and in the 1990s was President Bill Clinton's Ambassador to Paris, where she died in 1997.) The Edens were flown back to Britain in a Royal Air Force VC-10 that was diverted to Miami after Prime Minister James Callaghan had been alerted to the situation by Pamela Harriman's son, Winston.|$|E

25|$|The text of {{the first}} of the three books of the Principia was {{presented}} to the Royal Society at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication. Samuel Pepys, as President, gave his imprimatur on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> its book budget on a History of Fishes, and the cost of publication was borne by Edmund Halley (who was also then acting as publisher of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society): the book appeared in summer 1687.|$|E
25|$|The early Premier League years saw the {{transfer}} record fee in English football broken {{many times in}} {{a relatively short period of}} time, and rise at a rate barely comparable with even that of the late 1970s. The biggest fee paid by an English club during the Football League era was the £2.9million paid by Liverpool for Dean Saunders in July 1991. The national record was broken the following summer when Blackburn Rovers paid £3.3million for Alan Shearer. The national record was broken again in June 1993 when Manchester United signed Roy Keane for £3.75million. Blackburn then broke the national record in the 1994 close season by signing 21-year-old Norwich City striker Chris Sutton for £5million. In 1995, the record fee was broken three times in the space of six months. At the turn of the year, Andy Cole arrived at Manchester United in a deal worth £7million. After the season's end, Arsenal paid £7.5million to Inter Milan for Dutch forward Dennis Bergkamp, but Bergkamp had <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> days with his new club when Liverpool paid £8.5million for Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore. A year later, Alan Shearer became the most expensive player not only in England but in the world when he left Blackburn Rovers to sign for Newcastle United in a £15million deal. This fee, however, remained unsurpassed for more than four years.|$|E
500|$|Barrett's long tenure {{with the}} Expos ended in December 2003. The team traded Barrett to the Oakland Athletics in {{exchange}} for Minor League pitcher Brett Price. The Athletics then traded Barrett to the Chicago Cubs for Damian Miller, only days after the initial transaction. Barrett, who had <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> six days with three teams, shortly signed a one-year contract with the Cubs, which was worth nearly $1,550,000. He first practiced with Cubs during their annual spring training sessions, and reported receiving a cold reception from teammates. Barrett {{went on to become}} one of their top hitters during the 2004 season. He {{played a crucial role in}} their wild card chase; Barrett maintained a [...]287 batting average and hit sixteen home runs and sixty-five RBI during the 2004 season. He finished the season as one the league's top defensive catchers (fielding at [...]994 with six errors), and led the Cubs in triples and sacrifice flies.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 July, Hitler summoned Kluge and Manstein to his {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg in East Prussia. Two days earlier, the Western Allies had invaded Sicily. The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to move forces from Kursk to Italy and to discontinue the offensive. Kluge welcomed the news, as {{he was aware that}} the Soviets were initiating a massive offensive against his sector, but Manstein was less welcoming. Manstein's forces had <b>just</b> <b>spent</b> a week fighting through a maze of defensive works and he believed they {{were on the verge of}} breaking through to more open terrain, which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle. Manstein stated, [...] "On no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he [...] committed [...] completely beaten." [...] Hitler agreed to temporarily allow the continuance of the offensive in the southern part of the salient, but the following day he ordered Manstein's reserve – the XXIV Panzer Corps – to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army. This removed the force Manstein believed was needed to succeed.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the Champions League final {{performance}} and having {{established himself as}} a valuable player in his first year in Madrid, the arrival of a new club president in Florentino Pérez, closely followed by former Barcelona superstar midfielder Luís Figo in a club record transfer, saw the club forced to sell several key players to reduce debt. Fernando Redondo, Nicolas Anelka, Christian Karembeu and McManaman were suddenly told they were surplus to requirements {{before the start of the}} 2000–01 season and were sold. When McManaman refused to leave unlike the others, manager Vicente del Bosque told McManaman that he had [...] "little chance of playing this year", and in case he did not understand his position, the club also declined to give him a squad number for the forthcoming season.

The guys in the good record bars dug what we were doing and they got in all the latest English R records for us.
