5|$|Goldman made funeral {{arrangements}} for Berkman. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> {{desire to be}} cremated and have his ashes buried in Waldheim Cemetery in Chicago, near the graves of the Haymarket defendants who had inspired him, {{but she could not}} afford the expense. Instead, Berkman was buried in a common grave in Cochez Cemetery in Nice.|$|E

5|$|This series {{also saw}} leprechaun Mr Onion return, however Shamrock, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> replacement, {{remained}} meaning the show now had three leprechaun puppets. More {{often than not}} though, it would be Mr Sage with either Mr Onion or Shamrock as his sidekick rather than all three together.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> fateful resignation; {{perhaps it}} may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> {{exceeding}} readiness,--but {{there was no}} response. He sat down again, and again swung his hat slowly and gloomily to and fro under his chair.|$|R

Writing textbooks <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> full-time job, writing fiction <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> second job.|$|R
5|$|After Kerr {{resigned}} as Governor-General, he still sought a government position, reasoning that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> intent to remain {{for ten years}} as Governor-General. However, Fraser's attempt to appoint Kerr as ambassador to UNESCO (a position later held by Whitlam) provoked such public outcry that the nomination was withdrawn. The Kerrs spent {{the next several years}} living in Europe, and when he died in Australia in 1991, his death was not announced until after he was buried.|$|E
5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> wish, however, {{to be buried}} at the family's traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, {{and this is where}} he was finally buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may have been inspired by a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E
5|$|Cane later {{explains}} to Rose that Polk <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> commander of an artillery battery at a battle {{which could have}} been a victory but that Polk panicked and ran, depressing his men, with those who didn't desert their positions being decimated, including Cane's brothers, or captured like Cane himself. Rose makes Cane promise not to harm Polk, but still has Polk placed in protective custody.|$|E

5|$|Green was {{identified}} by county prosecutor David Gorcyca, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> neighbor. On November 30, Palace Sports and Entertainment, {{the owner of}} the Pistons, banned Green and Haddad from attending any events at Palace properties (including the Palace of Auburn Hills and the DTE Energy Music Theatre), revoked their season tickets and issued them refunds. Green had several previous criminal convictions, including counterfeiting, carrying a concealed weapon, felony assault, and three drunken driving convictions, and he was on court-ordered probation from a DUI conviction {{at the time of the}} brawl.|$|E
5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken little {{interest}} in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Fleetwood married {{twice and}} had several children, {{most of whom}} died in infancy. His new town flourished, but the expense of {{building}} it left him close to bankruptcy and forced him to sell most of his estates including Rossall Hall, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> family home. He left Lancashire and died in London, succeeded by his son Louis.|$|E

5|$|In the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a race-ending collision whilst trying to lap David Coulthard in heavy spray. After the race he stormed into the McLaren garage and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him, and McLaren and Ferrari team members had to separate the drivers. Coulthard admitted some five years later that the accident <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> mistake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{leg of the}} semi-finals of the 2011–12 Champions League, against his former club Real Madrid, which was then managed by José Mourinho (who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> manager at Chelsea), after Bayern fell behind 2–0, Robben {{converted}} a penalty to level the tie at 3–3. Bayern advanced to the final after winning the resulting penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|Jenner later shows Rick's group what he {{had learned}} from Test Subject 19, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> wife but volunteered to be {{recorded}} after she was bitten in hopes of discovering a cure; the infection kills the carrier but causes the brain to re-activate and re-animate the body shortly thereafter, eliminating any conscious human traits. Jenner had been in communication with other facilities worldwide before they went silent, knowing the French had been close to a cure, but affirms that human civilization is ceasing to exist.|$|E

5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The {{centrality}} of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> source of inspiration for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May, in Saint-Malo, {{he married}} Marie Blaize, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> fiancée for two years; {{over the course}} of their marriage, they had five {{children}} together. Around 1805, Surcouf started to arm privateers in Saint-Malo in partnership with his father-in-law Louis Blaize de Maisonneuve, notably Caroline which captured four ships in the Indian Ocean under Nicolas Surcouf; Marsouin; and Confiance, which took two prizes under Joseph Potier.|$|E

5|$|The Turks {{took the}} castle {{and most of}} the {{defenders}} were slain. A few of the captured defenders were spared by Janissaries who had admired their courage, with only seven defenders managing to escape through the Ottoman lines. Zrinski's corpse was beheaded and his head taken to the new Sultan while his body received an honourable burial by a Turk who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> prisoner, and well treated by him.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} of doing his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>his</b> greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
