5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate, there was no overwhelming <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E

Yet, despite his result in the Interzonal, Fischer only {{finished}} fourth out of eight with 14/27 (+8−7=12), far behind Tigran Petrosian (17½/27), Efim Geller, and Paul Keres (both 17/27). Tal fell very ill during the tournament, and had to withdraw before completion. Fischer, a friend of Tal, was the only contestant who visited him in the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Fonville was {{considered}} the <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the 1948 Olympic gold medal but a back injury prevented him from qualifying for the Games. After undergoing back surgery in November 1948, Fonville sat out the 1949 season, but came back in 1950 to win his third Big Ten Conference shot put championship. Fonville later became a lawyer and practiced law in Detroit, Michigan for 40years. He {{was inducted into the}} University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1979, as part of the second class of inductees.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four men, all former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the nomination {{at the outset of the}} Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers in the western part of the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E

5|$|Mickiewicz {{was welcomed}} into the leading {{literary}} circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, {{where he became}} a great <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation.

A number of candidates quickly emerged, including General Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, California Senator Hiram Johnson, {{and a host of}} relatively minor possibilities such as Herbert Hoover (renowned for his World War I relief work), Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, and General John J. Pershing.|$|E

5|$|Astana {{participated in}} the Volta a Catalunya in May, while the Giro d'Italia was ongoing. The team did not win any stage, but Haimar Zubeldia took third overall in the event, and the team won the teams classification. In the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in June, Contador {{was thought to be}} a <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> victory, but he did not seem to try his hardest to win, not attacking or taking any pulls on the mountainous Stage 5 and seeming to work for Alejandro Valverde on the race's last two days. The team next took part in the Tour de Suisse, with Klöden in fourth their highest-placed rider.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown {{seemed to}} be the <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the nomination. On the first ballot, he {{garnered}} the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

5|$|The 2011–12 Ivy League men's {{basketball}} season marked {{the continuation of}} the annual tradition of competitive basketball among Ivy League members that began when the league was formed during the 1956–57 season, continuing from the predecessor Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League, which was formed in 1902. Harvard was the preseason <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the first time and spent most of the season receiving vote in the 2011–12 national rankings. The season marked the first time that four Ivy League teams (Harvard, Penn, Princeton and Yale) participated in the postseason. The season marked the second time that the Ivy League had three 20-win teams (Harvard, Penn and Princeton).|$|E
5|$|The team's biggest {{success in}} 2009 was Contador's overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France. Elsewhere, their main successes in 2009 were in small stage races, with Contador winning the Volta ao Algarve and the Vuelta al País Vasco {{as well as two}} stages in Paris–Nice, and Leipheimer winning the Tour of California and the Vuelta a Castilla y León. The team also won the team {{classification}} at numerous events. The team {{failed to live up to}} lofty expectations in the Giro d'Italia; Leipheimer was widely considered a <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> victory, as was Armstrong before a collarbone injury sustained weeks before, but Leipheimer finished sixth overall and the team did not win any stage.|$|E
5|$|Galvis {{was born}} in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Venezuela, and played Little League Baseball {{including}} the Little League World Series there before being discovered {{by one of the}} Phillies' scouts in the area. At age 16, he signed a contract with the Phillies despite not receiving much attention from scouts. He went on to spend the next several years in their minor league system, including a particularly lengthy stint with the Reading Phillies, the Phillies' Double-A (AA) affiliate. In 2012, he made his major league debut on opening day at second base, substituting for the injured Chase Utley. He became a fan <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> his performance early in the season, especially on defense, until he sustained an injury, and subsequently was suspended 50 games after a positive test for performance-enhancing drugs. He missed the remainder of the season. Over {{the course of the next}} two seasons, he split time between the Lehigh Valley IronPigs – the Phillies' Triple-A affiliate – and the major league ball club, but struggled to establish himself offensively. Entering 2015, his future with the club was uncertain, though with the departure of Jimmy Rollins he was a candidate to be the team's starting shortstop.|$|E

5|$|Jackson won the Democratic primary with 48% of {{the vote}} to Jones's 39%, with the rest {{of the vote}}s {{scattered}} among the other three candidates. The Republicans nominated Thomas Somer. Since the district was overwhelmingly Democratic, Jackson was the <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the December 12, 1995 special election. Jackson won the general election with 76% of the vote; his victory was widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known he would be a liberal voice in opposition to Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. He took office on December 15, 1995. Jackson was perceived as less charismatic than his father and less credentialed than his predecessor, but his family pedigree was expected to help him politically. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no major party opposition in the November 1996 general election. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, Burke {{broke his}} {{right index finger}} below the middle knuckle. He had been a <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> NBA Rookie of the Year, but was listed as out indefinitely. On October 14, an October 15 surgery to insert {{surgical}} pins was announced. The 2013–14 Jazz were scheduled to begin the 2013–14 NBA season on October 30. Although early reports suggested an 8‑to12-week hiatus, ESPN The Magazine Chris Broussard reported only a 6-week absence was expected. On November 11, Burke's finger was reevaluated. Without Burke, the Jazz began the season 0–8 with Lucas and Jamaal Tinsley playing point guard. On November 12, the Jazz announced that Burke had only been cleared to begin individual drills, {{that he would be}} reevaluated November 25 and that Tinsley had been waived. Jazz head coach Tyrone Corbin reported that by November 13 Burke was dribbling a basketball painfree. On November 20, Burke announced he would make his career debut against the New Orleans Pelicans for the 1–11 Jazz, but he was not expected to start.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary casting began during March 1987, and {{the main}} cast was {{announced}} on May 15. The initial press release highlighted the casting of LeVar Burton, known for appearing in the miniseries Roots, as Geordi La Forge. Burton had auditioned for the role following a suggestion from executive producer Robert H. Justman, who had previously worked {{with him on a}} TV movie. The only other two members of the cast mentioned were Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker. Stewart was cast in the lead role after being spotted by Justman at a dramatic reading at the University of California, Los Angeles. However, the show's creator, Roddenberry, wanted a French actor and was considering the role of Data for Stewart. Both Justman and Berman campaigned for Stewart to have the part of Captain Picard, and Roddenberry relented. Frakes became Roddenberry's <b>favorite</b> <b>for</b> the role of Riker after the actor went through seven auditions for the role.|$|E
