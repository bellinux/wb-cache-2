2500|$|During the pre-World War II {{military}} buildup, {{and throughout}} the war, all Japanese officers were required to wear a sword. Traditionally made swords were produced during this period, {{but in order to}} supply such large numbers of swords, blacksmiths with little or no knowledge of traditional Japanese sword manufacture were recruited. In addition, supplies of the Japanese steel (tamahagane) used for swordmaking were limited, so several other types of steel were also used. Quicker methods of forging were also used, {{such as the use of}} power hammers, and quenching the blade in oil, rather than <b>hand</b> <b>forging</b> and water. The non-traditionally made swords from this period are called shōwatō, after the regnal name of the Emperor Hirohito, and in 1937, the Japanese government started requiring the use of special stamps on the tang (nakago) to distinguish these swords from traditionally made swords. During this period of war, older antique swords were remounted for use in military mounts.

50|$|Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1956, {{the oldest}} of four siblings, Joyce {{attributes}} accompanying his father on summer archeological excavations conducted for the University of Oklahoma in the 1960s as a significant influence toward choosing a life of working with his hands. Joyce stated in a 2008 lecture at the Segal Design Institute at Northwestern University in Chicago: “As a pre-teen adolescent, unearthing disparate shards of once complete objects, made from diverse materials, and attempting to visualize the whole form from fragments, has instructed my practice as an artist to the present day.” When {{his family moved to}} El Rito in Northern New Mexico in 1970, at age 14 Joyce began an informal apprenticeship with neighbor Peter Wells, a letterpress printer and blacksmith. Joyce learned to handset type on foot-operated 19th century printing presses and was taught the rudiments of <b>hand</b> <b>forging</b> while assisting Wells on the restoration of historic printing equipment for the Museum of New Mexico's Print Shop and Bindery. At 16, after three summers of working with Wells, Joyce was offered the blacksmith shop when Wells relocated his printing business, the former Sunflower Press. Joyce quit high school to devote himself full-time to learning the trade and developed a classically oriented curriculum of studying historic ironwork in the storage collections of New Mexico’s many museums. He supported himself through a wide range of commissions from farmers, ranchers, builders, architects, designers, and other artists.|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{industry}} is facing stiff challenges: The market demands more flexible reaction capability {{in combination with}} high level reliability. Especially for forging industry, which is characterized by long set-up times and large order quantities, the improvement of production planning and control accuracy is getting more exigent. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>forging</b> companies aim the reduction of their stock level to minimize capital commitment. However, the reduction of stock level frequently induces missing parts or raw material and consequently the risk of decreasing the deliver reliability. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>forging</b> {{industry is}} situated in a turbulent logistic environment caused by continuously fluctuating demands and unreliable raw material suppliers. Combined with the mentioned reduction of stock level, achieving the desired logistic performance is barely possible. Hence, logistic risk management is needed to improve the production planning and control (PPC) through an early identification, quantification and assessment of logistic risks in the supply chain. This paper introduces methods for risk control as part of logistic risk management. These methods encompass a simulation-based plan-parameter adaptation for a long term risk control {{as well as a}} sequence replanning and an order splitting for a short term risk control...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the testing and modeling results from an NRC project on short/small 1 crack model development for aircraft structures. Fatigue {{tests were conducted}} for 7075 -T 73 <b>hand</b> <b>forging</b> aluminium material using precracked compact tension (C(T)) and naturally cracked single edge-notch tension (SENT) coupons, under various stress ratios. The adjusted compliance ratio (ACR) method {{was used for the}} C(T) coupon tests aiming to quantify remote closure due to plasticity and forging-induced residual stresses. For the SENT coupons, three-dimensional StressCheck finite element (FE) models were developed to accurately calculate the stress intensity factors of surface and corner cracks. Both C(T) and SENT test data were combined to develop short-long fatigue crack growth rate models. These models were then used in crack growth life analyses for coupon and component cases, taken from transport aircraft under spectrum loadings. It was shown that the newly developed models resulted in more accurate fatigue life estimations. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop mathematical models based on modified UBET for forging processes as well as forging preform design of axisymmetric parts. In the modified UBET, the velocity fields are derived based on volume mapping approach and evaluated by minimizing the total energy rate of UBET. The model developed for forging processes is based on MUBET using forward simulations. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>forging</b> preform design model is based on MUBET using backward simulations. FEM simulations were conducted in order to validate the developed models. The significance of various process parameters such as the intermediate/preform geometry, the optimum aspect ratio of billet, and forming load were determined using the developed method. The results showed that this research was successful in predicting the optimal preform in which maximum material utilization can be achieved. Comparison showed that MUBET can predict the process variables with reasonable accuracy and short run time...|$|E

40|$|A 1000 -lb {{piece of}} {{nickel-iron}} base alloy 706 was forged to a four-level stepped <b>hand</b> <b>forging.</b> This induced 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 (in/in) true strain into the four sections, respectively. Pieces from each strain section were annealed at three different {{solution heat treatment}} temperatures (1785 ºF, 1800 ºF, and 1815 ºF) for times ranging from 0 minutes (unannealed condition) to 5. 5 hours. The samples were then measured for Rockwell B hardness and metallographically examined to determine the degree of recrystallization. Results showed that all combinations of strain (i. e. 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5) and annealing temperature (i. e. 1785 ºF, 1800 ºF, and 1815 ºF) achieved complete recrystallization.

25|$|Materials : Early {{windlasses}} were individually <b>hand</b> <b>forged</b> from {{a single}} piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, drop forging and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their windlasses 'silvered' (or chrome plated) for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. Windlasses are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and rustproof surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a single eye, but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.|$|R
