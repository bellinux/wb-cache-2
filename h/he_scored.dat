5000|$|Exact scoring with set penalty: A {{player who}} makes {{the exact number of}} tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid score only one point for each trick. Players who overbid have [...] "gone set" [...] and lose 10 points, {{regardless}} of the number of tricks taken. For example, if a player who has bid four takes exactly 4 tricks, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> 14. If <b>he</b> takes 5 tricks, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> 5. If <b>he</b> takes 3 tricks, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> -10.|$|R
50|$|If the declarer {{makes his}} bid, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> one point for every book he took {{after the initial}} six. If he fails to take enough books for his bid, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> nothing for his books; instead, his opponents gain the number of points equal to his bid.|$|R
5000|$|Exact scoring with {{progressive}} penalty: A {{player who}} makes {{the exact number of}} tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid or overbid lose the amount of the bid, plus ten points for each trick under or overbid. For example, a player bids 4: If he takes exactly 4 tricks, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> 14. If <b>he</b> takes 3 or 5 tricks, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> -14. If <b>he</b> takes 2 or 6 tricks, <b>he</b> <b>scores</b> -24.
