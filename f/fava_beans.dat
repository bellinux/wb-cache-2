Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

40|$|Seventeen leguminous species {{common to}} the Pacific Northwest were {{evaluated}} as potential hosts of the pea cyst nematode, Heterodera goettingiana, in both greenhouse and field experiments. In all experiments, juveniles of H. goettingiana penetrated roots of these 17 species {{with the exception of}} greenhouse-grown chickpea. Nematodes molted and developed into swollen third-stage or fourth-stage juveniles in many of the plants, but cyst development occurred only in the field on green pea, edible dry pea, and faba bean. More H. goettingiana cysts developed on <b>fava</b> <b>bean</b> than on green pea or edible dry pea. In H. goettingiana-infested soils, cropping sequences that include <b>fava</b> <b>bean</b> and pea should be avoided.
