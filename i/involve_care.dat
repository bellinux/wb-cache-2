Objective: To {{assess the impact of}} an educational intervention on involvement of clinical department staff in the quality process. Setting: Twelve voluntary clinical departments (six experimental and six controls) in a French 2000 -bed university hospital comprising 40 clinical departments. Intervention: Three day training seminar to a group of 12 – 20 staff members from each department. Design: Quasi-experimental post-test only design study with control group conducted 12 months after the intervention with a questionnaire completed in a face-to-face interview. Subjects: 98 trained staff and 100 untrained staff from the six experimental departments and 100 staff from the six control departments. Principal measurements: Declared knowledge of the CQI methods and participation in quality management activities. Results: 286 people (96 %) were involved in the study. More of the trained staff knew the CQI methods (62. 4 %) than staff in the control departments (16. 5 %) (adjusted odds ratio (ORa) = 10. 6 (95 % CI 4. 97 to 22. 62)). More trained staff also participated in quality improvement work groups than control department staff (76. 3 % v 14. 0 %; ORa = 27. 4 (95 % CI 11. 6 to 64. 4)). In the experimental departments the untrained staff's knowledge of CQI methods and their participation in work groups did not differ from that of control department staff.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relative}} pay of occupations involving care, such as teaching, counseling, providing health services, or supervising children. We use panel {{data from the}} National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Care work pays less than other occupations, after controlling for the education and employment experience of the workers, many job characteristics, and (via individual fixed effects) unmeasured, stable characteristics of those who hold the jobs. Both {{men and women in}} care work pay this wage penalty. However, the penalty is paid disproportionately by women since more women than men do this kind of work. As you read this, parents around the world comfort crying children. Teachers instruct children in reading. Child care workers exhort children to get along with each other. Aides in a nursing home wash the body of an elder. Counselors work with men who batter women to reduce their violent reactions. Professors give lectures. Librarians show students how to find journal articles on the web. Mid-wives deliver babies. Doctors and nurses scramble to give emergency care to accident victims.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} care as concept and action and to see how care can be expressed in different conditions. The dissertation contains a survey of non-feminist and feminist theories of care and an empirical study of views of care and caring acts in four professional groups: janitors, neighbourhood police, district nurses, and home-helpers. The study, which is based on interviews, participant observation, and a questionnaire, shows that the concept of care is perceived differently in different professional groups and that the caring acts performed in different teams are of different kinds. I make a primary distinction between acts which <b>involve</b> <b>care</b> (personal responsibility) and those which do not (technical responsibility), and a secondary distinction between situational care (caring acts which are confined to the situation) and continuous care (caring acts extending over a certain time). The type of caring acts performed proved to depend on the ideals of the team. These ideals differ in different work teams within the professional groups, mainly depending on whether the practitioners are autonomous or collectivistic. Autonomous practitioners mainly give continuous care, while collectivistic practitioners mainly give situational care. Whether the practitioner is a man or a woman or the profession is male- or female-dominated proves to be of subordinate importance. One difference, however, is that men in the male-dominated professions have greater regard for the other person’s integrity, whereas women in the female-dominated professions act to a higher extent out of a sense of responsibility for the other person’s well-being. The analysis showed that this difference in the stress on integrity and responsibility in male and female practice is also found in the difference between non-feminist and feminist theories and philosophies...|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was by means of {{qualitative}} methods to explore the meaning of EASW for young women with self-harm problems in residential treat- ment. Seen from the eyes of the clients and the staff members, what role and meaning is devoted to the hor- se as used in EASW? How does the interaction with the horse contribute to the clients and staff ́s perception of autenticity and the possibilities to be in an authentic relation?  Definition EASW represents an alternative or a supplement to conventional treatment and social work, and involves a triangular relationship between staff, client and the horse. The activities in EASW can <b>involve</b> <b>care</b> of the horse, training with the horse, riding, carriage driving and vaulting (gymnastics on horseback). The program will always depend on the staff ’s skills and educational background, the horse ́s abilities as well as the client ́s skills and wishes.   Method Data were initially collected by in-depht interviews with 8 staff members and 9 clients. In-depth interviews that lasted between 40 - 60 minutes based on 6 - 7 themes were conducted separatly with the clients and the staff mem- bers Observations of the human-horse interaction were videotaped and conducted three times with each pair of staff and client that worked together in EASW. After the observations indepht interviews were conducted with clients and staffmembers in direct conjunction with one of the observations.   Results Based on the narratives of the staff members and the clients; it seemed that the horse’s ability to read human emotions made the staff and clients aware of their emotions. In order not to alienate the horse or make the situation dangerous, the clients and staff said that they had to regulate their emotions, which intensified their sense of being in the moment. The participants felt the horse read their intentions, and gave them a direct feedback on their ex- pressed emotions. Furthermore, this feedback was given to them in a way that did not raise their defence mechanisms. The horse seemed to function as an emotional mirror for the participants. They detected and recognized their own emotions, and subsequently had to regulate them in order to interact with the horse and others in a positive way. Finally the horse seemed to set the framework for the interaction between the staff-members and the young women, which became more informal and dynamic. Stable-based relations- hips experienced as based on trust, respect and negotiation can accordingly be interpreted as being representing as more authentic relationships compared to relationships outside of the stable.   Implications for clinical work The clients found it easier to bond with the horse because it was not ha- ving expectations of the clients. The staff members, however, could be expe- rienced as if they had expectations of clients. The client perceives the horse as nojudgemental, honest, reliable, have no prejudices, offer physical contact and give direct feedback. The stable provided other opportunities for interac- tion than the therapy room, as other rules apply and staff and clients became more equal and perceived their relations as more ”authentic”. The horse was a door opener for the clients to get rid of anxiety and agression resulting in calmness and relaxation. This open up for communication between staff and client, which in turn could increase new insights. ...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary]: In 2006, the Centre for Rural and Remote Area Health (a {{research}} {{centre of the}} University of Southern Queensland and the University of Queensland) {{was funded by the}} Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing to undertake a study examining the experiences of universities in relation to aged care clinical placements for undergraduate nursing students. The study involved collecting and analysing quantitative and qualitative data from 32 heads of schools of nursing and midwifery on an Australia-wide basis. The research was driven by concerns about the recruitment and retention of aged care nurses. The aim was to review the different means by which undergraduate nursing students undertake aged care clinical placements in Australia. The research found a paucity of literature specifically focusing on clinical experiences in aged care for undergraduate nursing students. However, the prevailing view is that aged care is not a favourite career option for many student nurses (Happell, 1999; McKinlay & Cowan, 2003; Nielsen, 1999). Method The research employed a cross-sectional, descriptive design to provide a baseline upon which future data on aged care clinical placements could be compared. All Australian universities with a Faculty, Department or School of Nursing were invited to participate. Results Universities held similar understandings and expectations as to what is meant by the term ‘aged care clinical placements’. This usually incorporated some notion of placements that <b>involve</b> <b>care</b> of patients/clients over the age of 65 and/or in a setting where students come into contact with an older person. The health services used for aged care clinical placements were primarily private and public residential aged care facilities or hospital rehabilitation units located in areas convenient to the university. The number of students placed in health services that offered aged care per semester varied widely. The universities that had the largest numbers of students placed on a per-facility basis were those in close proximity to, and had forged close links with, health services that provided opportunities for aged care clinical placements. The most common reasons given for the refusal of placement from health services was competition from other universities or competition from other academic years of the same university. However the majority of universities reported they were “always” or “very often” able to place students for aged care clinical placements. Around half of the universities were required to pay for aged care clinical placements, the method of payment most commonly used being the health service invoicing the university. The selection process most commonly applied when choosing health services for aged care clinical placements was based on whether or not the facility had received accreditation. As we point out in this report, this may not be a particularly valid or satisfactory basis for selection. The educational activities and experiences offered by health services were quite varied with those related to dementia care and palliative care being the most common. Universities primarily ran orientation sessions involving both staff and students as a means of preparing staff to support and supervise students. Universities most commonly utilised the services of a registered nurse employed by the health service to supervise students while they were on clinical placement. This was generally in combination with an adequately trained clinical facilitator employed by the university. Academic staff involved in supporting and supervising students during clinical placement usually had a mix of both academic and clinical aged care experience. However it was not always possible to achieve this mix. It was not uncommon to use generalist nurses with tertiary qualifications or experienced aged care nurses with no tertiary qualifications. Aged care clinical placements were commonly undertaken in the first and third years of academic study. Universities typically reduced the number of third-year students placed per health service to ensure that students received adequate attention from the supervisory staff. Universities made concerted attempts to ensure that placements were tailored to meet the clinical needs of students but this was not always possible due to the competition for places from other universities. Universities claimed that their students were prepared for undertaking aged care clinical placements primarily through the academic course-work undertaken. Recommendations •	Aged care clinical placements need to be spread more evenly across health services and universities need to expand their definition to include other sites that offer aged care specific services. •	There needs to be a commitment to underwrite the financial costs for student travel and accommodation so as to be able to access rural and remote health services. This may also help to ease skill shortages in rural areas. •	Universities need to have better internal co-ordination of aged care clinical placements to eliminate conflict between first and third year placements. •	A more coordinated approach to placements should be negotiated between competing universities to ensure all students have equal access to an aged care placement. •	The development of more formal agreements between universities and health services should be able to ease the pressure on competing universities. •	The financial aspects of aged care clinical placements should be standardised to make this an attractive placement for the universities. •	There is a need {{for the development of a}} clinical audit tool to be used across universities to assess health service suitability for an aged care clinical placement. This will ensure that students will undergo similar standards of aged care clinical experience. •	More support is needed so that health services are better able to support their staff in taking on students for aged care clinical placement. •	Incentives should be offered to specialist aged care nurses to participate in further training to enable them to be good educators either in academia or in the workplace. •	There is a need for more emphasis on university staff to have aged care qualifications and relevant experience. •	University curricula should include specific aged care content to better prepare students in the complexity of caring for older people. This educational content should be consistent across all universities. •	Supervision of students on aged care clinical placements should be provided by suitably qualified educators. •	Supervisors of students on aged care clinical placements should ensure that the focus does not remain just on acquiring basic nursing skills, but should also focus on acquiring aged care specific skills. •	There needs to be more promotion of aged care as a fulfilling and challenging career choice...|$|E
40|$|With this 2004 Change of Pace update, WOMEN'S WAY {{makes good}} on {{its promise to}} {{carefully}} monitor {{the status of women}} and girls in our region. Statistical data has been updated where possible through January 2004, and text and policy recommendations revised as appropriate. Through A Change of Pace, WOMEN'S WAY capped its 25 th Anniversary with a powerful call to action [...] a call that resonates just as clearly one year after the initial release of the report. This report, the first product of a unique collaboration between WOMEN'S WAY, the University of Pennsylvania's Alice Paul Center for Research on Women & Gender and Solutions for Progress, takes stock of women's status in our region. Its findings are sometimes encouraging, but more often startling and disturbing measures of life for American women in the 21 st century. While the findings demonstrate that women have made tremendous strides since WOMEN'S WAY's founding, A Change of Pace concludes that many of these victories ring hollow, particularly for women of color and low income women. The cumulative effects of poverty wages, scarce affordable housing, child care and health care, threats of violence and insufficient social supports create barriers for women struggling to attain the economic self-sufficiency and sense of security necessary to provide adequate care for themselves and their families. Even for middle-class white women whose relative economic security affords them a greater sense of well-being, the dream of equal pay for equal work, a life free from gender-based violence, a secure retirement and true reproductive freedom is far from realized. Are Women Worth Three-Fourths of Men? In 1976, women working full time earned 61 cents for every $ 1 earned by men. In 2002, women earned 77 cents for every $ 1 earned by men. In a quarter century, the gender wage gap has decreased 16 cents. That leaves another 23 cents to go. Every dollar women lose to gender inequality is a dollar they and their families do not have to pay for housing, child care, health care or food. White, Blue and Pink Collar Jobs Despite gains in the last quarter century, women are still concentrated in low-paying "pink collar" occupations such as health care support and personal care. They remain underrepresented in higher-paying ones such as management and architecture. Even within the same occupations, women working full time are paid less than men. Women's Business A growing number of women are taking their livelihoods into their own hands by becoming entrepreneurs. However, with less access to capital, loan financing or bonding to start a business or bid on a larger project, women's businesses struggle to survive. Women owned businesses in the Philadelphia metropolitan area account for less than 5 % of total sales and 10 % of total employment. Hard Times Above and Below the Poverty Line Women {{are more likely to be}} poor than men, and families headed by women are disproportionately poor. Families headed by single mothers are 15 % of all families in the region, but more than 54 % of the region's poor. For many women, work and poverty go hand in hand. In Pennsylvania, 20 % of full-time working women have "low earnings" [...] less than $ 8. 77 per hour [...] compared with 11 % of fulltime working men. Penalized for Caregiving Women are penalized in the labor market as paid and unpaid caregivers. They are more likely than men to work part-time or be out of the workforce because of care responsibilities, and more likely to hold jobs that <b>involve</b> <b>care</b> work for children, people with disabilities and the elderly. While hourly earnings in the Philadelphia area averaged $ 18. 65 in 2002, "care work" jobs averaged less than $ 11 per hour. Retirement Insecurity For many women, retirement means insecurity. The "three-legged stool" on which retirees depend [...] Social Security, personal savings and employer pensions [...] fails for many women. In the Philadelphia region, one in ten women 65 and older lives below the official poverty line. Older women in the Philadelphia region have only 52 cents to every $ 1 of income of older men. Scarce Affordable Housing Affordable housing is central to economic security for women and their families, but it is in short supply. In the Philadelphia region, 43 % of renters and 25 % of homeowners spend more than the affordability standard of 30 % of their income on housing. Nearly one in four renters spends more than half her income on housing. Fewer than one in four families eligible for federal housing assistance receives it. Health Care Not Ensured One in nine women in Pennsylvania is uninsured. Lack of health insurance typically means lack of preventive care, delayed or substandard treatment, and greater risk of disease, disability and death. Uninsured and low-income women in the region are much less likely to receive preventive cancer screenings. Women are more likely to forgo or delay medical care for financial reasons. Defending Reproductive Freedom WOMEN'S WAY agencies have been at the forefront advocating for and protecting reproductive rights. Their struggle has been uphill. Underfunded family planning services in Philadelphia can meet only half the current need for services. Pennsylvania limits access to abortion through state-mandated lectures, waiting periods and parental consent laws. Access by low-income women is particularly limited because Pennsylvania excludes abortion from Medicaid coverage except in cases of rape, incest and threat to a woman's life. Women Under Assault With continued pressure from women's organizations, law enforcement officials and the medical community have improved their response to sexual assault and domestic violence. There is a partial safety net of shelters and other services. Despite this progress, however, violence against women is still endemic in our community and the resources for survivors too few. Corporate Brass and Glass Ceilings Women have made progress in entering administrative and managerial ranks over the last four decades, but when it comes to top leadership roles, women are still woefully underrepresented. Eight out of nine corporate board members and top executives at the largest 120 public companies in the Philadelphia region are men, and nearly 45 % of the largest companies in the region have no women in top executive positions. Political Underrepresentation Pennsylvania has only one U. S. Congresswoman and no women in the U. S. Senate. If the State Legislature were representative of Pennsylvania's adult population, women would hold 133 seats instead of the 35 they currently hold; the Philadelphia region would have 43 women legislators instead of just 20. Only 14 states rank worse than Pennsylvania in appointing women to key state policy positions. The gross underrepresentation of women in corporate and government leadership positions suggests primary reasons why many of the foregoing inequities persist. What is clear and encouraging, however, is that women and men in our region recognize the barriers facing women today and are ready for a change of pace. 2002 WOMEN'S WAY Change of Pace Survey The Change of Pace Survey, conducted in September and October 2002, provides insight into the views of men and women in the five county Philadelphia region on issues of importance to women and their families. A majority of respondents surveyed: Agree women face discrimination in the workplace; Are concerned about domestic violence; Favor increasing the minimum wage; Favor extending family leave to cover all workers; and Support expanded health care, affordable housing, education and training programs. If we are to address these community concerns and create that long-discussed level playing field, each of us must play a part. And so, WOMEN'S WAY issues A Change of Pace as a call to action, an invitation to become a positive agent of change for women and girls in our community. For its part, WOMEN'S WAY commits to leading critical community dialogues, challenging our region's business and government leaders and mobilizing all who are committed to eradicating inequities that hamper the safety, health and well-being of our entire region.
