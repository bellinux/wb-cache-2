He worked as {{assistant}} to the chairman of the National Taxpayers Union, and by 1990 he was a lobbyist representing the National Inholders Association, campaigning against federal policies which restricted property owners in U.S. national parks and national forests. He worked for this organisation, which was renamed the American Land Rights Association (ALRA), on such policy topics as tobacco regulation and endangered species. In 1995 he sent a nine-page memo to staff at the United States House Committee on Natural Resources opposing Newt Gingrich's proposals to reform the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Ebell wrote that Gingrich's [...] "soft feelings for cuddly little critters is still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a big problem", and [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get <b>some</b> of the freshmen and women to work on him."

40|$|Tuesday, March 10, 1998 WRITER: Kathy R. Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172 CONTACT: Ronald L. Carlson, (706) 542 - 5186 STARR SHOULD 2 ̆ 2 SHOW US THE EVIDENCE! 2 ̆ 2 IN WAKE OF MCDOUGAL 2 ̆ 7 S DEATH, SAYS UGA LAW PROFESSOR ATHENS, Ga. [...] Echoing {{the call}} of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, UGA law {{professor}} and criminal law expert Ron Carlson has called for special prosecutor Kenneth Starr to 2 ̆ 2 show his cards 2 ̆ 2 and reveal the evidence derived from numerous interviews with James McDougal, the convicted Whitewater partner and former Clinton ally who {{died of a heart}} attack in federal prison on Sunday. McDougal, a key Whitewater witness, had recently supplied a steady stream of information to Starr in exchange for a reduced sentence. 2 ̆ 2 I would expect that in McDougal 2 ̆ 7 s case, there are paper documents that reflect his testimony, tape recordings and videotape recordings of what McDougal has to say, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Because of his death, by and large, those documents are inadmissible evidence. A live witness has to appear and be open to cross-examination. In the absence of the author of the remarks, the tape recordings are hearsay evidence, which judges exclude from trials. 2 ̆ 2 According to Carlson, the time for public accountability is near, and 2 ̆ 2 nothing makes more sense 2 ̆ 2 than for Starr to release his star witness 2 ̆ 7 words to the press and public. 2 ̆ 2 It would not compromise his trial evidence, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson, 2 ̆ 2 so this seems the perfect opportunity for independent counsel Starr to inform the public, respond to Majority Leader Lott 2 ̆ 7 s call to show something of what he has, and finally, let us all out here in the public judge for ourselves whether he has anything or not. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says Starr 2 ̆ 7 s next move will be dictated by the amount of pressure he feels from lawmakers, particularly if more Republicans demand a swift end to the investigation. 2 ̆ 2 I expect there will be enough pressure on Starr that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make <b>some</b> important disclosures, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Nobody knows precisely what McDougal has said because his dialogues with the independent counsel have been private. His statements might close the doors on Whitewater or they might throw them wide open. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the U. S. Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials. - 30...|$|R

50|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} after a road was {{built into the}} area in the 1950s that the Bennett was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> protection from visitors. The first attempt was the formation of the Bennett Juniper Association. Other than a monument being placed in 1963 the group apparently did nothing. Joseph W. Martin (Sr.) the owner of the land on which the Bennett resides and Clarence Bennett were getting on in their years and decided that establishing a formal nature preserve and transferring it to a major established conservation organization was the best method of long term protection for the Bennett. Martin carved out a 3+ acre piece of land from his holdings in the area. It was donated to Nature Conservancy in 1976. As it turned out the Conservancy was {{not in a position to}} manage the preserve. Cumulative impact from an increasing number of visitors was taking its toll. John B. Dewitt, the Executive Director of Save-the-Redwood League, had been a regular visitor to the Bennett for many years. He could see how the site was being degraded and foresaw irreversible damage was on the verge of happening. He convinced his Board of Directors that the League should acquire the property and take on the responsibility for the protection of the Bennett. Nature Conservancy transferred title to the League in 1987. The following year the League hired a summer resident steward to manage the visitation and repair previous impacts. The preserve has been staffed since then.|$|E
