500|$|McCartney asked Klein to {{dissolve}} the Beatles' partnership, but was refused. Exasperated, he took {{the case to the}} High Court in London in early 1971, naming Klein and the other Beatles as defendants. Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, ABKCO, had caused [...] "intolerable interference" [...] by overdubbing [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of Let It Be to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: [...] "We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down." [...] Starr added: [...] "And then suddenly he didn't want it to go out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Josh Brolin was {{revealed}} {{as the voice of}} Thanos, with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character. Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula. In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are [...] "the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into Avengers films in the future." [...] On casting Brolin, Feige said, We reached out to him {{and it was one of}} those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it’s very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [...] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of Avengers. Then we shot him and recorded for it.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} Bono and The Edge's {{acoustic}} [...] "Original of the Species" [...] (2004). Turlington {{said of the}} track, [...] "Bono wrote the song with his daughters in mind. It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh dear, yes,' cried Tom, greatly relieved, for {{his mind}} was running upon Martin. 'Certainly. <b>I</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> before to-night, sir!' ...|$|R
60|$|He turned quickly {{away from}} me when he had said the last words. He had never once looked fairly at me since <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at I like your music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ When you know very well we never even touched each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{was staring}} {{straight}} ahead, shaking like a leaf. [...] Even when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he paid absolutely no attention. [...] I {{have never seen}} a man so completely wrecked. — Jack Thayer, First Class passenger on Titanic ...|$|E
2500|$|Ağca {{was caught}} and {{restrained}} by a nun and other bystanders until police arrived. He {{was sentenced to}} life imprisonment. Two days after Christmas in 1983, John Paul II visited Ağca in prison. John Paul II and Ağca spoke privately for about twenty minutes. John Paul II said, [...] "What we talked about will have to remain a secret between him and me. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as a brother whom I have pardoned and who has my complete trust." ...|$|E
60|$|She never 'as {{believed}} it. I {{sent for}} Mr. Alfredi {{to come and}} take Kumbo away, and when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>'im</b> about Rupert he said I was dreaming, and asked me whether I wasn't ashamed o' myself for carrying off a pore black gal wot 'ad got no father or mother to look arter her. He said that afore my missis, and my character 'as been under a cloud ever since, waiting for Rupert to turn up and clear it away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you can't exactly call <b>him</b> that. <b>I</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> till jest {{before this}} thing happened. I want ter git him right out, on 'portant business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss Nickleby,' cried Madame Mantalini, {{when this}} sound met her ear, 'make haste, for Heaven's sake, he will destroy himself! <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> unkindly <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and he cannot bear it from me. Alfred, my darling Alfred.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On December 14, 2008, when Quinn {{was asked}} about his {{relationship}} with Blagojevich, he said, [...] "Well, he's a bit isolated. I tried to talk to the Governor, but the last time <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> was in August of 2007. I think {{one of the problems is}} the Governor did sort of seal himself off from all the statewide officials... Attorney General Madigan and myself and many others." [...] Blagojevich had announced in 2006 that Quinn was not to be considered part of his administration.|$|E
2500|$|It was me {{who brought}} Poulidor to Mercier where, like Desbats and me, he spent all his career. In a criterium, I saw this unknown who was riding all around us. I {{saw him again}} in the Bol d'Or and <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He said he hadn't yet got a team {{but that he was}} in talks. When I got home, I spoke {{straight}} away to Antonin Magne, who asked me: [...] "You're sure that he rides well?" [...] I said I was and he contacted him and took him on.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on the phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to}} do the same thing over and over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with Fritz the Cat. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not know}} what answer you want. When George was here, <b>I</b> hardly <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> If Uncle Michel is afraid of me, I will give him my solemn promise never to marry any one without his permission.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys!" [...] he said, at last. [...] "That’s {{the third}} time this week, and yet if I was to catch one and skin ’im alive I suppose I should get into trouble over it. Even ’is own father and mother would make a fuss, most like. Some people have boys, and other people ’ave the trouble of ’em. Our street’s full of ’em, {{and the way they}} carry on would make a monkey-’ouse ashamed of itself. The man next door to me’s got seven of ’em, and when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>’im</b> {{friendly}} about it over a pint one night, he put the blame on ’is wife.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> of his wounded hand, [...] And {{now he is}} gone. (She looks out.) [...] I cannot see him, for all is dark outside. [...] Would my {{imagination}} and my heart [...] Were as little shaken as this holy flame! ...|$|R
60|$|Before him was {{the easel}} and he was painting. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{about other}} matters, {{and all the}} while watched the monkey.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't know,' says he, 'but I expect they're some o' {{the other}} {{boarders}}. The {{man said he}} had other boarders when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about takin' us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--that {{will be so}} {{difficult}} to explain. I wish you had been behind the curtain to hear it all. It is so necessary that you should know, {{and yet it is}} so hard <b>to</b> tell. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and was quite high-spirited." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{she spoke}} {{her eyes had}} been roving up the path and down. [...] "He's coming," [...] she interrupted. She hesitated. [...] "Would you mind if <b>I</b> went and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> first, Daddy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} more wont, housekeeper, to trust to my own arm than to bought friends. But tell me, for at the least thou art far-seeing, how may this be done? As things are, though <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> roughly <b>to</b> <b>him</b> last night, I am {{inclined}} to let Eric Brighteyes take Gudruda. I have always loved the lad, and he will go far." ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> no more {{on his own}} affairs. His servant {{brought in}} the letters and papers, poked the fire, and {{announced}} that breakfast was ready.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very slightly. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> an hour ago. He {{thanked me}} for some ambulances. He {{is the chief}} {{inspector}} of hospitals, I think--Major Thomson, his name is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} believe that the news is true," [...] Ezra said, in astonishment. [...] "There must be some mistake. Why, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on 'Change last Monday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, well, I wash {{my hands}} of it altogether, Monsieur Philip. I am sorry <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you about <b>him,</b> but I never {{for a moment}} thought you would take him. If harm comes of it, don't blame me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> again. Yet <b>I</b> {{feel sorry}} for him, feeble old soul, flitting about in the Illimitable, and always so {{punctual}} to hurry to the telephone, so happy, so feeble-witted and courteous; a better man, perhaps, {{take it all in}} all, than he was in life; lonely, too, it may be, out there in the Vastness. Yet I never called him up again. He is happy. Let him stay.|$|R
6000|$|I don't {{know what}} devil {{prompted}} me, for <b>I</b> seldom <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{even when we}} were told off on duty together; but I said at last, after a moment's pause, [...] "If you are engaged to be married, as I suppose you are from what you say, I wonder you could bear to come away on such a long business as this, when you couldn't get a word or a letter from the lady you're engaged to for a whole winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have seen," [...] said Blood. [...] "He {{died before}} I left the Cinco Llagas. He was hanging {{dead in his}} bonds when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> before leaving." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{kindness}} of this language {{was more than}} matched by the {{kindness of}} his manner. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> freely and fully--I told him my strange story without the slightest reserve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely! <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as one {{old friend}} to another, sprayed the bills {{all over the}} place; and he sang a few bars from 'Rigoletto,' and signed on the dotted line." ...|$|E
60|$|At length he {{came back}} {{grinning}} and washing the blade of his knife in the water. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> fiercely <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in my own language, and still he grinned on, making no answer. When we were mounted again and riding away from that horrible boat with its groaning prisoner, watching Bes whose behaviour and silence I could not understand, I saw him sweep his hand across his great mouth and thrust it swiftly into his bosom. After this he spoke readily enough, though {{in a low voice}} lest someone who understood Egyptian should overhear him.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I was a {{child of}} seventeen," [...] she confided, [...] "a young farmer down at Mandeleys kissed me. If I had been one year younger," [...] she went on, [...] "I should have spat at him. As it was, <b>I</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> again. Then, {{a few months after}} that, the {{schoolmaster}} at the school where I was teaching made an awkward attempt at the same thing. He missed me, but his lips just touched my cheek. Then Reginald came. Let me see, that was nineteen years ago, and since then no one else has kissed me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lydia {{considered}} far {{before she}} replied. At last she said, [...] "I am sorry <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> harshly <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> since, driven {{as he was}} by circumstances, I cannot see how he could have acted otherwise than he did. And I overlooked the economic conditions of his profession. In short, I am not used to fisticuffs; and what I saw shocked me so much that I was unreasonable. But," [...] continued Lydia, checking Mrs. Skene's rising hope with a warning finger, [...] "how, if you tell him this, will you make him understand that I say so {{as an act of}} justice, and not in the least as a proffer of affection?" ...|$|R
