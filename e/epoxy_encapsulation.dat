This phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a hermetically sealed metal case, initially by Telectronics of Australia in 1969 followed by Cardiac Pacemakers Inc of Minneapolis in 1972. This technology, using titanium as the encasing metal, became the standard by the mid-1970s.|$|R

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) estimates the radiosensitive basal layer to be at an average depth of 0. 070 mm. Current commercially available MOSFETs utilize an <b>epoxy</b> bubble <b>encapsulation,</b> making measurements at equivalent depths of 0. 070 mm difficult. The MOSkin utilizes a novel packaging design that allows the measurement of doses at this equivalent depth. The MOSkin has shown excellent agreement with the Attix chamber for surface measurements in a 6 MV photon beam of various field sizes and has minimal angular dependence due to the encapsulation.

40|$|Thermally {{activated}} batteries use an <b>epoxy</b> for <b>encapsulation</b> of {{the electrical}} feedthroughs in the header of the battery. When the thermal battery is thermally abused, the encapsulant can pyrolyze and generate large internal pressures. This causes the battery to vent in extreme cases. The {{nature of these}} gases has never been adequately documented. Therefore, a study was undertaken to address this deficiency. The pyrolysis of various encapsulants that have been used, or are being considered for use, in thermally activated batteries was studied over a temperature range of 155 to 455 C. The composition of the pyrolysis decomposition products was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS). This determination is helpful in assessing the potential environmental and health effect for personnel exposed to such gases.

Most failures were due to an internal short circuit of one of the cells of the multicell battery due to the growth of metallic dendrites; or the result of water vapour diffusing though the <b>epoxy</b> resin <b>encapsulation.</b> The only suitable cell available at the time was the mercuric oxide-zinc cell, so the battery problems remained. In 1967 Telectronics commenced research into the technologies which could allow hermetic sealing of the pacemaker to preclude water vapour penetration and, as an interim measure contracted AWM a subsidiary of Amalgamated Wireless Australia Limited (AWA) to develop integrated circuits for the electronics. These early integrated circuits were developed by David R Money who later joined Telectronics and later still led development of the cochlear implant for the profoundly deaf. The circuits were analogue type, housed in hermetically sealed ceramic military 'flat packs' with redundant double gold bonding of the terminations.

The results show that implementation of flat roughness layer onto cell surface reduces the maximum current inducing on average 2. 7 % less power with respect to a cell before any encapsulation. The losses of power and, in consequence, the less production of energy are explained by resin light absorption, reflection and partially neutralization of non-reflective coating...|$|R
40|$|The microelectronic {{industry}} {{continues to}} grow rapidly in size and importance. The industry has already reached the size of other major industries with sales of product and equipment totalling {{billions of dollars a}} year. Among all the options available for semiconductor assembly, plastic packaging by using <b>epoxy</b> based <b>encapsulation</b> process is less expensive and accounts for approximately 80 % of the worldwide packaging share and this percentage is increasing. Microchip encapsulation based on transfer molding is one of the important processes of semiconductor manufacturing. Quality is heavily dependent on the encapsulation mold design, selection of molding compound and process parameter setting of encapsulation molding. In current practice, encapsulation mold design and parameter setting of the transfer molding are done manually in a trial-and-error manner which would result in long lead time for obtaining acceptable molding quality. In this paper, an artificial intelligence technique, Case Based Reasoning with Fuzzy Retrieval, is described to perform process design of microchip encapsulation from which a case based system for microchip encapsulation, named CBS-ME, was developed. The system aims to automate the design of the key elements of encapsulation molds, suggest process parameters for transfer molding and improve its own design know-how through a learning process. A validation test was performed and the system solutions were benchmarked with the solutions obtained from the actual molding. Deviation of the two sets of solutions for mold design parameter setting and process parameter setting are 3. 5 % and 6 % respectively. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the work completed in Chapter 4, further studies of silicon wire arrays as photoelectrochemical solar cells were conducted. By using longer wires and optimizing the <b>epoxy</b> <b>encapsulation,</b> significantly improved short circuit current densities (Jsc) and fill factors were observed compared to previous results. Simultaneous with the improvement in Jsc and fill factor, a reduction in open circuit voltage (Voc) was observed, but the overall energy conversion efficiency was still significantly improved over that observed in Chapter 4. Furthermore, verification that the photoactivity {{was due to the}} Si wires as opposed to the single-crystalline Si substrate was obtained by measuring the substrate after removal of the wires and by using scanning confocal microscopy to selectively excite the wires rather than the substrate. The observed energy conversion efficiencies can be significantly improved by correcting the raw data for both concentration overpotential losses and series resistance losses, and the validity of the concentration overpotential correction was verified by the use of a photoelectrochemical cell exhibiting significantly reduced concentration overpotentials.

40|$|The DIII-D tokamak {{has been}} {{operated}} since June 1995 with constrained ohmic heating capability as {{imposed by the}} abandonment of half of it`s solenoid system due to a cooling water leak. The solenoid is comprised of A and B windings with separate multiple power leads to each. The cooling water leak occurred in {{the lead of the}} B winding. This leak occurred in a remote area under the DIII-D vessel and is believed to be caused by magnetic forces developing cyclic bending loads on the conductor. Visual inspection of the lead using flexible bore scopes indicated that the structural fiberglass overwrap intended to band the supply and return leads into a primary-force canceling group had failed allowing individual conductors to become inadequately supported against bending loads. The overwrap failed as a result of poor <b>epoxy</b> <b>encapsulation</b> of the lead which was manufactured in 1978. Inspection of the A lead confirmed no overwrap failure and that the vacuum encapsulation of the A lead was proper and to specification. In order to continue operations, it was decided to abandon the B winding of the solenoid and operate under reduced (5 V-sec) capability. An in-situ repair approach was mandated by the extensive and lengthy effort required to disassemble, repair, and reassemble the tokamak. Access from outside the tokamak was severely limited. A plan to repair the damaged lead was developed and implemented over a 10 month period. This paper describes the repair of the solenoid lead. A VCR video tape of these remote installation efforts has been assembled and will be shown...|$|E
40|$|With the {{shrinking}} size and increasing density of electronic packages, reliability {{becomes one of}} the most critical issues. Especially delamination, such as the weak adhesion between copper substrate and <b>epoxy</b> <b>encapsulation,</b> is prone to happened in high temperature and high moisture environment typified by the ageing test undergone by integrated circuit packages. In order to solve this problem, thiol-based self-assembly material of different chemical configurations is applied to serve as coupling agent between copper and epoxy. This thesis focuses on studying the behavior of copper/epoxy interface reliability under moisture condition with the thiol-based material treatments. Two main aspects studied in this thesis are 1) treatment conditions and process and 2) thiol material configurations. Parameters of treatment condition mainly include the treatment time and solution concentration. For the thiol materials, three effects are studies: the functional group that reacts with epoxy, backbone structures (alkane chain structure and benzene ring structure), and chain length of alkanethiol. Adhesion strength is tested with the tapered double cantilever beam (TDCB) test setup, and fracture toughness (GIC) is calculated for comparison. Moisture reliability is tested by applying the moisture sensitivity level 1 (MSL 1) standard, which is 85 ℃/ 85 RH for 168 hour. Thermal stability is also evaluated. With the SAM H treatment, best adhesion is recorded at 244. 4 ± 39. 5 J/m 2. Compared with control one, which adhesion is only 4. 8 ± 0. 8 J/m 2, a 50 fold improvement is demonstrated. To have better understanding of the thiol coating and fracture enhancement, surface characterization and investigation of fracture surface are carried out. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is conducted to evaluate the theoretical bonding energy of the interface with thiol layer of different structures. Correlation between the surface hydrophobicity and the moisture reliability for the alkanethiols are found. Optimum chain lengths for each of the alkanethiol structures are also determined...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Silica filled <b>epoxy</b> resins as <b>encapsulation</b> in chip {{packages}} {{reveal a}} major influence on the reliability and functionality of microelectronic devices. In this study, the resulting effects of post-mold curing (PMC) on the thermomechanical and chemical properties of different mold compounds were observed. Polymer systems of the investigated mold compounds were based on two orthocresol novolacs (OCN), one biphenyl and one multifunctional resin (MFR). It could be shown, that longer thermal treatment after curing leads in general to further cross-linking of the polymer chains and increases the glass transition temperature Tg. Therefore, the temperature resistance of the mold for following process steps after package assembling, like soldering, can be improved as well as the reliability during temperature cycle tests. However, PMC treatment also increases the moisture absorption. Here, MFR mold exhibit the highest moisture absorption. Also the high Tg of the MFR mold is not much influenced by PMC. Hence, further thermal treatment after curing of the MFR mold is not necessary. In case of OCN and biphenyl mold types, the advantages of PMC are predominating...|$|R
40|$|BGA {{packages}} {{have become}} increasingly popular for microprocessor device packaging and MCM assembly. This {{is due to the}} advantages the ball grid array offers with regard to high lead count combined with large pitches, processable with standard SMT equipment. For BGA package <b>encapsulation,</b> <b>epoxy</b> resins are mostly used, either as glob top or molding compound. For cost effective encapsulation of large numbers of BGA packages, the transfer mold process offers various advantages. The process is fully automated with short process times and the molding compound glass transition temperature (Tg) is very high (> 200 degrees C) compared to glob top encapsulants (160 degrees C) offering higher reliability at elevated temperatures. However, BGA packages challenge both material suppliers and packagers as this package type is asymmetric and is thus very sensitive to encapsulant material properties. Properties to consider are reduced encapsulation material shrinkage after molding to provide low warpage, and optimized molding compound adhesion to the materials present in a BGA to avoid delaminations that might cause electrical failures. Fraunhofer IZM and Toshiba Chemical have designed test vehicles to investigate different BGA molding compounds with regard to substrate adhesion with various types of solder resist after molding and after package reliability testing. Results of these investigations are reported and investigations regarding humidity sensitivity (according to JEDEC Std. 020) of the encapsulated BGA and the relationship between adhesive strength of EMC to solder mask and humidity uptake of the package are described...|$|R
40|$|Lab-on-chip (LOC) {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular for biomedical science as they present the opportunity to combine compact and efficient microelectronics together with microfluidics enabling new applications in point-of-care diagnostics. This system integration however, poses significant challenges in the assembly of such devices for mass manufacture. Specifically, to achieve a robust fluidic isolation, an insulating material must be deposited to seal the chip and wire bonds but allow fluid to access the sensing surface. This is typically achieved by using an insulating <b>epoxy</b> for <b>encapsulation</b> but requires several processing steps {{in order to become}} planar and reliably interface with the microfluidics; a technique with many limitations. Towards addressing these challenges, this thesis proposes to develop a non-galvanic means of achieving both power transfer to the chip and bi-directional data communication such that the system requires no bond pads (or delicate bond wires). The aim is to achieve this specifically via a free space optical link (i. e. to external discrete optoelectronic devices) with the additional constraint that any structures designed on chip are implementable in a commercially available, unmodified CMOS technology. Furthermore, {{in order to maintain the}} desired benefits of a “bondpad-less” chip, the platform must utilise no off-chip components. This thesis develops the underlying devices required towards achieving the aim whilst satisfying all constraints. Specifically devices tasked with optical energy harvesting, optical data input and optical data output are tackled. The thesis begins by outlining the motivations for this research (Chapter 1) and reviewing the relevant state-of-the-art (Chapter 2) including a concise overview of alternative methods for achieving the underlying aims. The relevant theory, pertinent to electro-optical phenomena at semiconductor junctions is then developed within the context of CMOS technology (Chapter 3). More fundamental, background theory is also included in appendix A. That pertains to the propagation of light in Silicon and mechanisms of photon absorption in doped Silicon. Original contributions within the domain of theory include developing the phenomenon of free-carrier absorption (FCA) applied to a realistic, CMOS-based junction, identifying key variables, expressions and analyzing the expected level of performance. Then, for the first time, this thesis demonstrates free-space optical modulation in a standard CMOS technology. A large portion of this work (Chapter 4 - for design repository see appendix B) is thus devoted to the design, implementation and testing of prototype devices for use as data read-out elements. A variety of modulator devices featuring differing geometries, created by distinct doping procedures and implemented in different CMOS technological nodes (UMC 0. 13 [mu]m, IBM 0. 18 [mu]m and AMS 0. 35 [mu]m) are presented, tested and compared. This allows for modulator performance to be examined in relation to key design choices made at the physical device layout and technology choice levels. This thesis then develops the common data read-in and power scavenging mechanism, along with associated circuits (Chapter 5). Once again structures designed with different geometries and created by different manufacturing processes in different technological nodes are presented, tested and compared, yielding an indication towards underlying trends. Key contributions here include extracted photodiode model parameters that express the contributions of vertical and lateral junction components to photocurrent generation, by junction 'family' and by CMOS process. This provides a powerful resource to circuit designers requiring a first estimate to phototransduction efficiency in technologies with unspecified optoelectronic devices. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|High-brightness, high-efficiency GaN-based LEDs {{have already}} found many applications, and are {{extremely}} promising devices for solid-state lighting, including general illumination [1]. While reliability of LEDs is significantly better in most aspects compared to traditional light sources, lumen maintenance {{remains one of}} the critical issues concerning this new technology. Early reliability studies [2] observed a rapid loss of light output, severe degradation of the transparent encapsulating material under blue and UV illumination and elevated temperatures; non-optimized packaging also induced other reliability problems due to difficulties in thermal management. As the packaging technology improves, the interest is focussing on failure modes and mechanisms related with the semiconductor material and the die technology, which have been less investigated in the past. This work presents the results of extensive high-current accelerated aging tests carried out on blue InGaN/GaN LEDs packaged with the usual <b>epoxy</b> <b>encapsulation</b> (lamps) as well as mounted without encapsulation (chips), in order to isolate the chip-related failure modes. As a result, 5 distinct failure modes were identified: (i) in encapsulated devices, testing at high current levels and, consequently, at high junction temperatures, induces degradation of the epoxy material in contact with the heated device surface, leading to the formation of an opaque layer on the device surface; (ii) high current and temperature affect the semi-transparent ohmic contact on top of the device, leading to increase in series resistance, with consequent current crowding effects that reduce the optical power; (iii) an increase in doping of the p-type layer takes place, possibly due to decomposition of Mg complexes [3, 4], and Mg reactivation; (iv) Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) detects changes in the distribution of deep levels already present in untreated devices, and also a generation of shallow traps; (v) both DLTS and photocurrent spectra indicate the creation of extended defects in devices treated at high current density. Identification of the specific failure mechanisms allows an accurate extrapolation of LED lifetime, and suggests specific actions for improving device reliability...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper was in partial fulfillment of a Masters of Science in the OSU College of Engineering. The major professor was Merrick Haller. The degree was awarded in June 2011. The paper {{was completed in}} December 2010. The motion of floating objects are of importance to engineers and scientists {{in a range of}} applications. For example, in the design of ships and wave energy convertors and the study of debris mobilized by tsunamis. Measuring the movement of floating objects in the laboratory can be challenging. Six degrees of freedom are required to capture the full range of motion; three translational and three rotational. Onboard systems such as gyroscopes often cannot be included without altering the movement of the object. Motion capture systems provide a relatively non-intrusive method to quantify the movement of a floating object and record the data digitally. They were originally developed as a tool to record the movement of actors for the generation of computer generated imagery. Manufacturers still design the systems for animation applications. However, accuracy information suitable for experimentation and research has not been determined by manufacturers (DeLuzio et al. 1993). The O. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University operates a Phase Space Impulse® motion capture system. The system is configured with a measuring field of 6 m x 6 m in length and width and up to 6 m in height, which is suitable for use over portions of the 104 m x 3. 7 m Large Wave Flume or the 48. 8 m x 26. 5 m Tsunami Wave Basin. In order to validate motion measurements of objects in the flume or the tsunami basin the accuracy of the Phase Space Impulse® system must be determined. The project goal is to quantify the accuracy and precision of position measurements using the Phase Space Impulse® motion capture system and to determine if these measurements are affected by a protective <b>epoxy</b> <b>encapsulation,</b> calibration, location in the measurement field or rigid body velocity...|$|E

40|$|High {{concentration}} photovoltaics (HCPV) {{promise a}} more efficient, higher power output than traditional photovoltaic modules. This {{is achieved by}} concentrating sunlight onto a small 1 cm 2 triple junction (CTJ) InGaP/InGaAs/Ge cell by using precision optics. In order to achieve high performance, careful and informed design decisions must {{be made in the}} development of a HCPV module. This project investigated the design of a HCPV module and is divided into sections that concentrate on the optical design, thermal dissipation and electrical characterization of a concentration triple junction cell. The first HCPV module (Module I) design was based on the Sandia III Baseline Fresnel module which comprised of a Fresnel lens and truncated reflective secondary as the optical elements. The parameters of the CTJ cell in Module I increased with increased concentration. This included the short circuit current, open circuit voltage, power and efficiency. The best performance achieved was at 336 times operational concentration which produced 10. 3 W per cell, a cell efficiency of 38. 4 percent, and module efficiency of 24. 2 percent Investigation of the optical subsystem revealed that the optics played a large role in the operation of the CTJ cell. Characterization of the optical elements showed a transmission loss of 15 percent of concentrated sunlight for the irradiance of which 66 percent of the loss occurred in wavelength region where the InGaP subcell is active. Characterization of the optical subsystem indicated regions of non-uniform irradiance and spectral intensity across the CTJ cell surface. The optical subsystem caused the InGaP subcell of the series monolithic connected CTJ cell to be current limiting. This was confirmed by the CTJ cell having the same short circuit current as the InGaP subcell. The performance of the CTJ cell decreased with an increase in operational temperature. A form of thermal dissipation was needed as 168 times more heat needs to be dissipated when compared to a flat plate photovoltaic module. The thermal dissipation was achieved by passive means with a heat sink which reduced the operational temperature of the CTJ cell from 50 oC to 21 oC above ambient. Cell damage was noted in Module I due to bubbles in the <b>encapsulation</b> <b>epoxy</b> bursting from a high, non-uniform intensity distribution. The development of the second module (Module II) employed a pre-monitoring criteria that characterized the CTJ cells and eliminated faulty cells from the system. These criteria included visual inspection of the cell, electroluminescence and one sun current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curves. Module II was designed as separate units which comprised of a Fresnel lens, refractive secondary, CTJ cell and heatsink. The optimal configuration between the two modules were compared. The CTJ cells in module II showed no form of degradation in the I-V characteristics and in the detected defects. The units under thermal and optical stress showed a progressive degradation. A feature in the I-V curve at V > Vmax was noted for the thermally stressed unit. This feature in the I-V curve may be attributed to the breakdown of the Ge subcell in the CTJ cell. Based on the results obtained from the two experimental HCPV modules, recommendations for an optimal HCPV module were made...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of Integrated Circuit (IC) devices are encapsulated in wire-bonded plastic IC packages. Epoxy molding compound {{is used as}} the encapsulation material and gold {{was used as the}} bonding wire material. However, the increase of gold material price from 400 USD/ounce in year 2005 to 1400 USD/ounce in year 2013 results in a major cost issue in IC assembly and prompt industry to search for alternative bond wire materials. Due to its cost and performance advantages, copper wire bonding is steadily replacing traditional gold wire bonding in IC assembly. The share of copper wire bonding has increased from 1 % in year 2007 to 10 % in year 2010 and is expected to reach 30 % in year 2013. In package level failure analysis, decapsulation is an important step to open the IC package to inspect the condition of internal components and locate possible failure sites for root cause analysis. Thus the requirement of a good decapsulation process is to selectively remove the <b>epoxy</b> molding compound <b>encapsulation</b> layer, while not damaging the semiconductor chip and metal bonding wires that locate inside the IC package. The mostly used conventional decapsulation technique is to use hot nitric or nitric and sulfuric mixture acid to etch away the molding compound, such process has been routinely used for gold wire bonded plastic IC package decapsulation. However, because copper wires are more susceptible to be corroded and damaged by the acid, the switching to copper wire bonding in IC industry has raised a problem for acid decapsulation. Copper bond wires suffer inevitable corrosion after acid decapsulation, thus further failure analysis on copper/aluminum bonding becomes difficult {{especially in the case of}} IC packages that went through thermal stressing conditions after quality tests. Conventional plasma decapsulation and laser-ablation also have inherent disadvantages, thus their application in copper-wired IC package decapsulation are limited. In this thesis, we introduce a solution to the copper-wired IC package decapsulation by using a Microwave Induced Plasma (MIP) system. The MIP system combines the high etching selectivity of a plasma with the speed and absence of RF fields of acid decapsulation. Characteristics of the MIP system are high power density, atmospheric pressure operation and absence of exposure of the samples to ions. As a result, fast, selective and safe decapsulation of copper wire bonded IC packages is achieved. The performance of this MIP system outperforms acid decapsulation in preservation of fine surface details on the copper wire bonds. Compared to conventional plasma etchers, the MIP system is at least 20 times faster and does not damage the functionality of the chip. The prototype setup of the MIP decapsulation system is described in Chapter 2. The core component in the MIP system is a Beenakker-type TM 010 mode microwave resonant cavity, which is the plasma source that determines the plasma etching performance. Chapter 3 investigates problems when using the original Beenakker cavity as the source of the plasma. Modifications are proposed that enable generation of an atmospheric pressure high-power density stable Ar/O 2 /CF 4 plasma. High power reflection in the MIP system is reduced by adding a variable antenna to the original coupling loop inside the cavity. Broad and stable plasma process window is achieved by adding another modification element that reduces the cavity’s quality factor. The power efficiency of the MIP system is estimated to be 80 %, while the volume power density of MIP sustained by the modified Beenakker cavity is 1600 W/cm 3 under 40 W input power. Based on the plasma chemistry, MIP afterglow etching recipes for a variety of materials are developed in Chapter 4. Ar/O 2 /CF 4 plasma etching of epoxy molding compound, Si, SiO 2, Si 3 N 4, silicone, copper, aluminum, palladium, and gold are conducted. Those materials are of special interest because they are commonly used in semiconductor packages. The optimal recipes for high etching rates as well as the rate-limiting factors of etching each material are given. The results provide reference to plasma etching selectivity and preservation of certain materials during MIP decapsulation of IC packages. Chapter 5 focuses on the application of MIP afterglow etching in IC package decapsulation. Four different MIP decapsulation processes are proposed and their pros & cons are analyzed. These four processes covers all types of plastic IC package decapsulation tasks, including thermally stressed package decapsulation that cannot be handled by other techniques. After MIP afterglow decapsulation, Si 3 N 4 passivation layer, Si die, Cu bond wires, Pd-coated Cu bond wires, Au bond wires, and Al bond pads inside the IC package can be cleanly exposed without any process-induced damage. Comparison of MIP decapsulation with the currently used alternative solution of cold acid decapsulation is made. The superior ability of preserving minute surface features by MIP decapsulation in a reasonable time that facilitates further failure-site analysis is demonstrated through case studies. The application of MIP afterglow etching in LED package decapsulation is explored in Chapter 6. High-power LED packages are cleanly decapsulated by MIP afterglow etching without influencing the functionality of the LED die. Different decapsulation processes for flip-chipped and gold wire-bonded LED packages are developed. Typical decapsulation duration for single LED package is 7 minutes for flip-chipped packages and 12 minutes for wire-bonded packages, which is at least 10 times shorter than conventional wet etching alternatives. The business development of the MIP system is described in Chapter 7. A review of the milestones in both scientific research and business development are given to show how both matter progressed together. Experiences and thoughts are shared which hopefully could be a reference for entrepreneurs in scientific world.
