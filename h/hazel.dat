5|$|<b>Hazel</b> and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for <b>Hazel.</b> The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts <b>Hazel</b> for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where <b>Hazel</b> struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells <b>Hazel</b> that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. <b>Hazel</b> is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E

40|$|The {{hazelnut}} tree {{has a great}} social {{an economic}} value in the NE of Spain, nowadays sunk in economic crisis. 15000 Hectares of these groves lay on potential truffle producing areas. Tuber melanosporum and Tuber brumale fruit in some of them naturally. Our aim is to develop inoculation techniques in mature groves and later to coordinate the truffle and hazelnut cultivation, {{trying to get an}} added value to the traditional harvest. In this work, large inoculations have been carried out in mature <b>hazels</b> with Tuber brumale on 3230 <b>hazels,</b> and Tuber melanosporum on 1300 <b>hazels,</b> in a total area of 11, 3 hectares. They were carried out two inoculations with sporal inoculum in all the trial fields, spring-fall within the same year or spring-spring with one year delay. Percentage of trees that got mycorrhizae of Tuber melanosporum one year after the first inoculation are between 28, 6 % and 45, 2 % of the inoculated <b>hazels.</b> The <b>hazels</b> that present mycorrhizae of Tuber brumale are between 24, 1 % and 56, 2 % after the first inoculation...|$|R
