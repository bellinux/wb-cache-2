40|$|For wood beams, it {{is often}} assumed that the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> {{is located at the}} {{centroid}} of the beam. The <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> of isotropic, homogeneous materials is located at the centroid of the material, but wood is neither isotropic nor homogeneous. The varying grain patterns and knots located throughout wood are points of discontinuity that make wood anisotropic and non-homogeneous. In fact, wood is an orthotropic material, meaning that it has properties that are different in three mutually perpendicular directions. Because of this, {{research is needed to determine}} the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> of wood materials to gain a better understanding of the behavior of wood beams. This project used Digital Image Correlation and VIC- 3 D software to analyze 1 in by 1 in and nominal 2 in by 4 in wood beams when loaded in bending. Axial strain plots were used to determine the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> From the data obtained, it was determined that the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> of 1 in by 1 in wood beams is located below the centroid and for 2 in by 4 in beams the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> is located above the centroid. Additionally, it was determined that knots will change the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> depending on their location in the beam...|$|R
50|$|The <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> is an axis in {{the cross}} section of a beam (a member {{resisting}} bending) or shaft along {{which there are no}} longitudinal stresses or strains. If the section is symmetric, isotropic and is not curved before a bend occurs, then the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> is at the geometric centroid. All fibers {{on one side of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> are in a state of tension, while those on the opposite side are in compression.|$|R
50|$|A beam under bending sees high {{stresses}} {{along the}} axial fibers that are farthest from the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> To prevent failure, {{most of the}} material in the beam must be located in these regions. Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> This observation {{is the basis of}} the I-beam cross-section; the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> runs along the center of the web which can be relatively thin and most of the material can be concentrated in the flanges.|$|R
40|$|In a {{homogenous}} and isotropic material, {{the location}} of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> coincides with {{the location of}} the centroid of the beam. Wood is anisotropic, meaning that it has different properties in different directions. It is also non-homogenous, meaning that the beam exhibits different properties at different locations throughout its length due to the presence of knots as well as grain characteristics. Since wood is not homogenous or isotropic, {{the location of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> varies throughout the length of the beam and is different for each individual beam. Because of this variability, research is needed to better understand the movement of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> as it reacts to different combinations of knots and grain angles. This thesis explores this in 38 mm by 89 mm (nominal 2 X 4) Douglas Fir beams with different patterns of knots. The analysis was done using Digital Image Correlation equipment and VIC- 3 D software which displays the strains and thus the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> It was found in a clear nominal 2 in x 4 in beam that the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> was slightly above the center of the beam. In the beams containing knots, the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> tended {{to move away from the}} knots except in situations where the knots were located longitudinally close to each other.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted {{that for the}} analysis of wood beams, the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> coincides with the centroid of the beam. Although this assumption is used in analysis, wood is not an isotropic material, as it has different elastic properties in the tangential, radial and longitudinal directions, nor is it homogenous, as it contains characteristics, such as knots, at various locations in the material. Because of this, {{there is a need for}} an analysis of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> for anisotropic, non-homogenous materials, such as wood, in order to better predict the deformations and strains in such materials. Specifically, with the use of Digital Imaging Correlation, a non-contact technique used to measure the deformation of an object’s surface, this project examines how knots in wood influence the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> The output from the VIC- 3 D digital imaging correlation software provides a clear image of the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> From this project it is apparent that the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> in the clear beam remained close to the centroidal axis throughout loading, while the location of a knot within the beam determines the size of the compression and tension zones as well as the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis...</b>|$|R

Such methods, if successful, streamline the data analysis across large bridge networks and provide a basis for bridge managers to reach efficient, effective, yet safe and sustainable maintenance decisions. The first step towards this goal is to identify an appropriate parameter and validate that {{it can be used to}} detect damage in real-life settings. The centroid of stiffness is a universal parameter and its position in a cross-section can be evaluated for any load-carrying beam structure as the position of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> under conveniently chosen loads. Thus, a change in the position of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> within a cross-section can indicate change in the position of the centroid of stiffness, i. e., unusual structural behaviors. This research focuses on the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> because of its universal applicability to beam-like structures and its direct correlation with unusual structural behaviors (e. g., damage). In this paper two examples of successful damage detection in real-life settings using the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> are presented. In both cases the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> is evaluated with long-gauge fiber-optic strain sensors installed on the structure in a parallel topology.

The {{position of the}} stator <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> to the stator contact surface {{is one of the}} factors that influences the deflection amplifier. Stator deflection directly effects on motor performance. In this study, the modification of the comb-teeth stator design is proposed to see its effect on motor efficiency. The modification is done so that the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> position is further distance from the stator top contact surface. The proposed solution is to remove a selected mass element from the comb-teeth structure. Modeling, simulation and experimental work of the proposed concept is carried out utilizing Shinsei USR 60 as the chosen TWUSM. The modeling and analyses are conducted through multi-physic finite element simulation MSC Marc Mentat. The results of the analyses and experimental work reveal that the modified comb-teeth stator increases the position of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> from the stator top surface. Due to the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> shifting, the results also confirm that the proposed modified motor has higher efficiency compared to the non-modified motor...|$|R
40|$|The <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> depth is {{considered}} the best parameter for quantifying the moment redistribution in continuous concrete beams, as exemplified in various design codes worldwide. It is therefore important to well understand the variation of <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> depth against moment redistribution. This paper describes a theoretical investigation into the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> depth and moment redistribution in concrete beams reinforced with fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) and steel bars. A finite element model has been developed. The model predictions are in favourable agreement with experimental results. Three types of reinforcement are considered, namely, glass fibre, carbon fibre and steel. Various levels of reinforcement ratio are used for a parametric evaluation. The results indicate that FRP reinforced concrete continuous beams exhibit significantly different response characteristics regarding the moment redistribution and variation of <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> depth from those of steel reinforced ones. In addition, {{it is found that}} the code recommendations are generally unsafe for calculating the permissible moment redistribution in FRP reinforced concrete beams, but the neglect of redistribution in such beams may be overconservative...|$|R

Thus, both the initial configuration and the current configuration are fully defined by the positions of the points along the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> of the beam, with rotations obtained from the derivative of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> As a result, in order to identify individual points on the interpolant with elements of a Lie group, one would necessarily need to take the location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> in a neighborhood of the respective points into account.|$|R
