40|$|The flow {{velocity}} of solid 4 He through a porous membrane frozen into a crystal has been {{measured in the}} temperature interval 0. 1 - 1. 8 K. A <b>flat</b> <b>capacitor</b> consisting of a metalized plastic porous membrane and a bulk electrode is applied and {{the gap in the}} capacitor was filled with examined helium. The flow of helium through the membrane pores is caused by a d. c. voltage applied to the capacitor plates. Above T~ 1 K the velocity of solid 4 He flow decreases with lowering temperature following the Arrhenius law with the activation energy of the process closed to that of vacancies. At low temperatures the velocity is practically independent of temperature, which suggests a transition in 4 He from the classical thermally activated vacancy-related flow to the quantum plastic flow.

40|$|Abstract- Capacitive sensors can {{be applied}} for {{measuring}} different kind of non-electrical quantities, such as geometrical dimensions of subjects, thickness of films, displacement and vibration of grounded surfaces, position of the object and others. Existing three-electrode micro-displacement sensors, made {{in the shape of}} <b>flat</b> <b>capacitor</b> geometry, do have high values of sensitivity, but they also have notable non-linear behaviour over their whole gauge characteristics. A three-electrode coplanar sensor, subject of this paper, can be designed by calculation in such a way, that its gauge characteristic does have relatively large section with relative error of the non-linearity of its gauge characteristic equals 0, 051 % within certain ratio of sensor dimensions. The method of direct field-strength determination, in combination with the method of conformal mapping, is used for a precise analytical calculation of the sensor capacitance. Analysis of the capacitance and special cases of sensor design has been discussed...|$|E
40|$|This Master's {{thesis is}} focused upon charge storage in a {{nanopore}} of a capacitor. It introduces a simple model, {{where the only}} present interactions are electrostatic and steric effects, which allows only one ion {{to be at a}} lattice point. The nanopore which is modelled is a defect nanopore, where only the end of the pore interior has the potential of the electrode. Monte Carlo simulations are used for studying the behaviour of the model. Interesting behaviour found in the model is overscreening, charge density oscillations and oscillating differential capacitance as function of the imposed charge, which all disappear at high temperatures. If the electrolyte is a filled ionic liquid, the differential capacitance curves are found to have camel-shape. When the electrolyte is diluted, the peaks of the oscillating differential capacitance are shifted and at the point of zero charge the differential capacitance has a bell-shape. This findings are the opposite of when the ions are not confined, studied previously as a <b>flat</b> <b>capacitor</b> by Démery et al...|$|E
40|$|Contamination {{of silicon}} with trace amounts of copper during {{processing}} can adversely affect the gate oxide integrity of integrated circuits, resulting in substantial yield loss and reliability problems. Because of {{increased use of}} copper as interconnect material, cross-contamination during the production process must be avoided. Establishing adequate protocols for wafer handling and tool use requires understanding of the mechanisms by which copper affects the gate oxide and knowledge of acceptable contamination limits. The effect of copper contamination on thin gate oxide integrity was studied by purposely introducing small amounts of copper in controlled contamination experiments. Copper contamination causes gate oxide defects by precipitating near the Si/SiO₂ interface when the silicon is cooled from the processing temperature. The concentration at which defects start to appear on <b>flat</b> <b>capacitors</b> decreases with decreasing oxide thickness. When copper contamination from a contaminated ammonium hydroxide peroxide mixture cleaning solution occurs, deposition of more than 7 x 10 ¹⁰ atoms/cm² is required before the gate oxide integrity of 3 nm oxides is affected. Such levels are not readily exceeded in {{state of the art}} integrated circuit fabrication facilities using high-grade chemicals. Copper deposition from contaminated hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions results in oxide lifetime degradation for 3 nm oxides even when less than 1 x 10 ¹⁰ atoms/cm² is deposited. The copper catalyzes hydrogen evolution, which in turn causes dissolution, and thus roughening, of the silicon surface. Roughening of the silicon is responsible for the reduced oxide quality. Thus, removal of the copper after contamination has occurred does not lead to recovery of the oxide quality. A copper contaminated silicon surface, which is immersed in uncontaminated HF, will also have reduced oxide lifetime. Precipitation occurs more readily at field overlap regions, since these regions have a large amount of mechanical stress, which getters contaminants and allows precipitates to nucleate and grow more easily. Field overlap precipitates result in a large field overlap-related defect density when copper contamination occurs. Copper contamination from contaminated HF also results in bumps in an oxide that is subsequently grown on the surface. These local regions of thicker oxide can lead to threshold voltage non-uniformity...|$|R

In this study, we present a CUCap (cyclic ultracapacitor), which is comprised of two reservoirs and one <b>flat</b> flow <b>capacitor</b> cell with a cyclic continuous flow mode and independently tunable power rating and energy capacity. CUCap provides fast-charging and high capacity technology with a simple and practical design for high density and large-scale energy storage systems. The best performance appeared in slurry ratio (electrode to electrolyte) 1 to 7 with the total reservoir volume of 150 mL and the flow rate 300 ml/min, resulting in volumetric energy density, specific capacitance, and discharge time of 7. 7 Wh L- 1, 14. 2 F ml- 1, 100 min, respectively.

3000|$|The film {{parameters}} (dielectric {{constant and}} current density) were calculated using the partial capacitance method [26]. According to this approach, the measured multilayer system was represented as three simple planar capacitors with uniform filling and connected in parallel. For normal electric field components {{at the film}} interfaces, zero boundary conditions were assumed. The deposited film was conditionally divided into two parts (Fig.  5): the inner parallelepiped (width d and thickness h 2) and the outer parallelepiped (width l and thickness h 3). The capacity of the multilayer system (C) can be found as the sum of three partial capacitances C[*]=[*]C 1 [*]+[*]C 2 [*]+[*]C 3, where C 1, C 2, and C 3 are the capacitances of {{the parts of the}} planar capacitor, which are scattering fields in (1) the substrate, (2) the inner parallelepiped of the film, and (3) the outer parallelepiped of the film. The capacitance of the inner part of the film (part 2) is determined by the usual equation of a <b>flat</b> <b>capacitor,</b> C_ 2 =εε_ 0 (w×h_ 2)/d. The capacity of the substrate (part 1), as well as the capacity of the outer part of the film (part 3), was determined using the Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mapping transformation adapted by Gevorgian [27]. According to this method, the ellipse of electric fields in the sample is conditionally transformed into a rectangle. In this case, the capacitance of the substrate will be expressed by the formulas C_ 1 =εε_ 0 K(k^')/ 2 K(k) and k^'=√(1 -k^ 2), where K (k) is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind; k is the modulus of the elliptic integral; ε 0 is the permittivity of free space; and εr is the relative permittivity of the substrate. Glass of E class (radio engineering) with low dielectric loss and ε[*]=[*] 6.6 was used as the substrate [28]. To solve elliptic integrals, we used the approximation proposed in [29]. Using a similar formula, the capacity of the outer part of the film was calculated. The experimental permittivity ε[*]=[*] 52 was determined, and this value is in agreement with the published data. The calculations based on density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory showed that the optical contribution to permittivity is ε∞[*]=[*] 5.6 – 6.5, and the dielectric contribution is ε 0 [*]=[*] 18.0 – 37.3 for the low-temperature cubic phase (Pm- 3  m) [30]. Direct measurements yielded ε [...] [*] 15 – 18 for low-temperature cubic phase (Pm- 3  m) and ε [...] [*] 60 for the room temperature tetragonal phase (I 4 /mcm) [31].|$|E

40|$|Silicon carbide (SIC) {{is a wide}} bandgap {{semiconductor}} thathas {{been suggested}} {{as a replacement for}} silicon in applicationsusing high voltages, high frequencies, high temperatures orcombinations thereof. Several basic process steps need to bedeveloped for reliable manufacturing of long-term stableelectronic devices. One important process step is the formationof an insulator on the silicon carbide surface that may be usedas a) a gate dielectric, b) for device isolation or c) forpassivation of the surface. Silicon dioxide and aluminumnitride have been suggested for these purposes. This thesiscovers the investigation of some formation methods for boththese materials on 4 H and 6 H silicon carbide, and theelectrical characterisation of the resulting films. Commercially available n-type and p-type 4 H and 6 H SICwafers have been used, and both the silicon face and the carbonface have been investigated. Silicon dioxide has been formed byseveral methods: a) dry thermal oxidation with or without theaddition of TCA (trichloroethane), b) wet oxidation inpyrogenic steam or with awater bubbler, c) oxide deposition byPECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) or LPCVD (lowpressure chemical vapor deposition) and d) oxidation of aevaporated or LPCVD deposited sacrificial layer of silicon. Theinfluence of various cleaning methods prior to oxidation hasbeen studied, as well as post-oxidation and post-metallisationannealing. The aluminum nitride films were grown by MOCVD(metal organic chemical vapor deposition) under various processconditions. Oxidation kinetics have been studied for dry thermaloxidation at 1200 0 C. The redistribution of aluminum (p-typedopant in SiC) during dry thermal oxidation has beeninvestigated using SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry). Themorphology of the aluminum nitride was determined using x-raydiffraction rocking curves, RHEED (reflection high energyelectron diffraction) and AFM (atomic force microscopy). Thequality of the silicon dioxide used as gate dielectric has beendetermined using breakdown field measurements. High frequencycapacitance-voltage measurements have been used on bothinsulators to a) verify thickness measurements made with othermethods, b) to determine fixed oxide charges by measuring theflatband voltage shifts and c) to quantitatively compare theamount of interface states. For electrical characterisation either aluminum, titanium ordoped polysilicon circular gate contacts of various sizes wereformed on the insulator surface. <b>Flat</b> MOS <b>capacitors</b> weremainly used for the electrical characterisation. U-grooved MOScapacitors, manufactured by RIE (reactive ion etching), wereused to test the quality of oxides grown on vertical surfaces.
