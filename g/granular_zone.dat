Enhanced grain rolling alone does not explain the low frictional strengths of simulated <b>granular</b> assemblages.

The simulated fault gouge zones exhibit two distinct stages of evolution, i. e., fast growth and slow growth, distinguished by a switch in deformation mechanism from dominantly wear of the fault blocks to dominantly shearing of existing fault gouge. During the fast growth stage, the rates of gouge thickening and bond breakage decrease exponentially and are proportional to sigman and inversely proportional to sigmaucs the rates become relatively constant and the dependency reverses during the slow growth stage.

40|$|Introduction: The adult {{mammalian}} brain retains neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) that continually generate new neurons within two restricted regions, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus (HC). This process is called adult neurogenesis. Controlled stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis {{might be an}} elegant way to treat neurodegenerative diseases. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} molecular signals, which govern the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endogenous NSCs in the neurogenic niches. Regulatory mechanisms in the so-called neurogenic niches have already been shown by in vivo studies for various factors, including numerous neurotransmitters, and behavioral and environmental factors. However, our knowledge is still insufficient to exploit adult neurogenesis for controlled brain repair or for stimulation of its physiological function. The sleep disorder narcolepsy {{is considered to be a}} neurodegenerative disease because there is a massive progressive loss of neurons containing the neuropeptide orexin. Consequently narcoleptic patients have very low cerebrospinal fluid levels of orexin. Narcolepsy is defined as a sleep-wake disorder with REM and non-REM sleep associated symptoms existing longer than 6 months, such as daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, fractionated sleep at night and automatic behaviors. The postulated pathophysiology of human narcolepsy is mimicked very closely in a transgenic mouse model called orexin/ataxin- 3 mouse, in which orexin-containing neurons are ablated progressively by specific overexpression of a truncated cytotoxic ataxin- 3 gene product under the orexin-promoter. Aim: We aimed to study the possible role of the protein orexin in the regulation of adult neurogenesis in the orexin/ataxin- 3 mouse. Study design: Adult neurogenesis in the SGZ, SVZ and rostral migratory stream (RMS), where the cells migrate from the SVZ to the olfactory bulb (OB), was studied by immunohistology. For the evaluation of the stem cell proliferation in SVZ and SGZ and migration in the RMS, orexin/ataxin- 3 mice (n = 8) and wild type (WT) mice (n = 8) received a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) /kg body weight 2 hour prior to sacrifice. For the analysis of differentiation and survival of newly built cells, BrdU was administered intraperitoneally on 5 consecutive days once per day to orexin/ataxin- 3 mice (n = 8) and WT mice (n = 8) and they were sacrificed 30 days after the last injection. Results: We found a significantly higher proliferation of stem/precursor cells in the orexin/ataxin- 3 mice in both neurogenic regions, the SGZ and the SVZ. Also in the RMS, higher levels of newly built cells in the orexin/ataxin group were found, but these differences were not significant. We were able to demonstrate a significantly higher survival of newly built cells in the <b>granular</b> <b>zone,</b> but not for the periglomerular zone of the OB in the orexin/ataxin group. A tendency for higher survival rates could be shown for the HC of the orexin/ataxin- 3 mice (not significant). By triple staining we could show that the proportion of newly born neurons relative to the total number of newly built cells in the HC was significantly higher with 90 % in the orexin-ataxin group compared to 83 % in the control group. In both the <b>granular</b> <b>zone</b> and the periglomerular zone of the OB, over 90 % of the total amount of new built cells differentiated into neurons in both groups. Also the rate of differentiation into a dopaminergic phenotype of the newly born neurons in the periglomerular zone of the OB was not significantly changed with 93 % in the orexin/ataxin- 3 mice compared to 91 % in the WT mice. Conclusion: In the absence of orexin in the adult mouse brain, the proliferation of adult neural stem/precursor cells was increased, the survival rate was significantly increased in the <b>granular</b> <b>zone</b> of the OB and a consistent not significant trend was seen in the HC. The proportion of newborn neurons among all newly born cells was higher in the HC, however, no significant differences in the differentiation of newly built cells could be found in the OB. Together, these observations lead to the assumption that orexin suppresses the proliferation of adult NSC, affects the survival rate in the OB negatively and hinders the differentiation of newly built cells into neurons in the HC...|$|E

Here we report on laboratory experiments designed to reproduce the conditions of numerical models and to test the role that grain characteristics play in controlling frictional behavior. Friction and microstructural data are compared for direct shear experiments on thin layers (2 – 3 mm) of angular quartz sand and spherical glass beads. We study the effect of grain shape, roughness, size distribution, and comminution. In a nonfracture loading regime, sliding friction for smooth spherical particles (m 0. 45) is measurably lower than for angular particles (m 0. 6). A {{narrow particle size distribution}} (PSD) of spherical beads (105 – 149 mm) exhibits unstable stick-slip behavior, whereas a wide PSD of spheres (1 – 800 mm) and the angular gouge display stable sliding. At higher stress, where grain fracture is promoted, initially spherical particles become stable with accumulated slip, and friction increases to the level observed for angular gouge. We find that frictional strength and stability of a <b>granular</b> shear <b>zone</b> are sensitive to grain shape, PSD, and their evolution.

40|$|Strain {{localization}} during coseismic slip in fault gouges is {{a critical}} mechanical process that has implications for understanding frictional heating, the earthquake energy budget {{and the evolution of}} fault rock microstructure. To assess the nature of strain localization during shearing of calcite fault gouges, high-velocity (vmax= 1 m/s) rotary-shear experiments at normal stresses of 3 – 20 MPa were conducted under room-dry and wet conditions on synthetic calcite gouges containing dolomite gouge strain markers. When sheared at 1 m/s, the room-dry gouges showed a prolonged strengthening phase prior to dynamic weakening, whereas the wet gouges weakened nearly instantaneously. Microstructural analysis revealed that a thin (< 600 μm) high-strain layer and through-going principal slip surface (PSS) developed after several centimeters of slip in both dry and wet gouges, and that strain localization at 1 m/s occurred progressively and rapidly. The strain accommodated in the bulk gouge layer did not change significantly with increasing displacement indicating that, once formed, the high-strain layer and PSS accommodated most of the displacement. Thus, a substantial strain gradient is present in the gouge layer. In water-dampened gouges, localization likely occurs during and after dynamic weakening. Our results suggest that natural fault zones in limestone are more prone to rapid dynamic weakening if water is present in the <b>granular</b> slipping <b>zones...</b>|$|R

These results reveal that the absence of the LPA₁ receptor aggravates the chronic stress-induced impairment to hippocampal neurogenesis and its dependent functions. Thus, modulation of the LPA₁ receptor pathway may be of interest with respect to the treatment of stress-induced hippocampal pathology...|$|E

Within the first 4 days following irradiation, over 30 % of the neurons display chromatolytic reactions (cccentrlc nuclci, peripheral dispersal of Nissl substance, central <b>granular</b> <b>zone)</b> as well as abnormal nuclcolar changes and dissociation of ribosomes from endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. Some satellite cells undergo retraction or acute degeneration, leaving only basement membrane to cover the neuron in these areas. 8 days after irradiation, neurons also exhibit (a) arcas in which ribosomes are substantially reduced, (b) regions of cytoplasmic sequestration, (c) extensive vacuolization of granular endoplasmic rcticulum and Golgi complex, and (d) diversely altered mitochondria (including the presencc of ribosome-like particles or association with abnormal glycogen and lipid deposits). Nucleolar components become altered or reoriented and may form abnormal projections and ringlike configurations. Sizeable areas of the neuronal soma are now denuded of satellite cells; underlying these areas, nerve processes arc found abnormally invaginated into the neuronal cytoplasm. By the 14 th day following irradiation, most neurons display markcd degenerative changes including extensive regions of ribosome depletion, sequestration, vacuolization, autolysis, and, in some areas, swirls of filaments, myelin figures, and heterogeneous dense bodies. These observations demonstrate that X-irradiation produces profound cytopathological changes in nervous tissue isolated from the host and {{that many of these}} changes resemble the effects of radiation on nervous tissue in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Valproic acid (VPA) is {{commonly}} prescribed as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. A recent study has demonstrated that VPA reduces histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, an action which is believed to contribute to the effects of VPA on neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation which may explain the cognitive impairments produced in rodents and patients. Asiatic acid is a triterpenoid derived from the medicinal plant Centella asiatica. Our previous study has shown that Asiatic acid improves working spatial memory and increases cell proliferation in the sub <b>granular</b> <b>zone</b> of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In the present study we investigate the effects of Asiatic acid in preventing the memory and cellular effects of VPA. Male Spraque-Dawley rats were orally administered Asiatic acid (30 mg/kg/day) for 28 days, while VPA-treated animals received injections of VPA (300 mg/kg) twice a day from Day 15 to Day 28 for 14 days. Spatial memory was determined using the novel object location (NOL) test and hippocampal cell proliferation and survival was quantified by immuostaining for Ki- 67 and Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), respectively. The results showed that VPA-treated animals were unable to discriminate between objects in familiar and novel locations. Moreover, VPA significantly reduced numbers of Ki- 67 and BrdU positive cells. These results indicate that VPA treatment caused impairments of spatial working memory, cell proliferation and survival in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, these abnormalities were restored to control levels by co-treatment with Asiatic acid. These data demonstrate that Asiatic acid could prevent the spatial memory and neurogenesis impairments caused by VPA...|$|E
40|$|Soil-bentonite (SB) slurry {{walls are}} one of the most popular {{techniques}} for minimizing the horizontal migration of contaminants. Backfill arching, or “hang-up” of the backfilled slurry, on the wall trench has the potential to significantly reduce the effectiveness of these barriers. This research was conducted to supplement the design and installation of an 11, 000 m long slurry wall at PotashCorp’s mine in Rocanville, Saskatchewan. The slurry wall is being installed through low permeability glacial till containing permeable <b>granular</b> <b>zones.</b> This study was undertaken to improve the understanding of vertical stress distribution in these deep barriers. In particular, the objective of this study was to develop an understanding of the factors controlling arching and hydraulic conductivity (k) of SB walls. Slurry wall “hang-up” or arching is dependent on shear along the wall of the trench and on a coefficient of lateral earth pressure (K). Consolidated drained (CD) shear box tests were conducted to study the shear strength parameters of the backfill mixes. Six inch proctor mold was modified with load cells on the side walls to measure horizontal stresses along with consolidation. This was used to calculate coefficient of lateral earth pressure, K (which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical effective stress). The results of the laboratory testing program found that K was relatively independent of the percentage of fines present in the SB mix. It also showed that backfill angle of internal friction and k of the backfill decreased with increased fines content. The results of the laboratory testing program were used to model the vertical stress distribution in deep walls. An analytical model (discrete model) and a coupled seepage stress-strain finite element model (FEM) were used to predict vertical stress changes with time and depth for the different backfill materials. The primary conclusion of this research is that slurry wall backfill arching or “hang-up” significantly delays the magnitude and timing of vertical stress build-up in backfill. This loss of vertical stress results in backfill with lower density and higher hydraulic conductivity. The situation was found to be most critical for deep narrow slurry walls. Any advantage in using a coarser graded backfill was offset by higher backfill hydraulic conductivity. The net result is that the upper portions of slurry walls may not be able to achieve their hydraulic conductivity objectives as soon as expected, if at all. In addition, the backfill in the upper portion of the trench may be susceptible to chemical attack and osmotic consolidation. Construction of a 2 m high surcharge berm over the slurry wall was found to increase vertical effective stress and result in significantly lower (2 to 8 times) hydraulic conductivity values in the top 5 metres of the trench. The final hydraulic conductivity (k) at a depth of 5 m was approximately 75 % lower with a surcharge berm. Thus, construction of a surcharge berm over the slurry wall helps to satisfy the k requirement for SB walls and lowers the risk of osmotic consolidation...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} no {{previous}} systematic study of bullous skin diseases with <b>granular</b> basement membrane <b>zone</b> deposition exclusively of C 3. In this study we collected 20 such patients, none of whom showed cutaneous vasculitis histopathologically. Oral dapsone and topical steroids were effective. Various serological tests detected no autoantibodies or autoantigens. Direct immunofluorescence for various complement components revealed deposition only of C 3 and C 5 –C 9, indicating that no known complement pathways were involved. Studies of in situ hybridization and micro-dissection with quantitative RT-PCR revealed a slight reduction in expression of C 3 in patient epidermis. These patients may represent a new disease entity, for which we propose the term “granular C 3 dermatosis”. The mechanism for granular C 3 deposition in these patients is unknown, {{but it is possible}} that the condition is caused by autoantibodies to skin or aberrant C 3 expression in epidermal keratinocytes...|$|R
40|$|Several {{mechanisms}} cause a {{granular material}} to strengthen over time at low applied stress. The strength is determined from the maximum frictional force F_max experienced by a shearing plate {{in contact with}} wet or dry granular material after the layer has been at rest for a waiting time τ. The layer strength increases roughly logarithmically with τ -only- if a shear stress is applied during the waiting time. The mechanisms of strengthening are investigated by sensitive displacement measurements and by imaging of particle motion in the shear <b>zone.</b> <b>Granular</b> matter can strengthen due to a slow shift in the particle arrangement under shear stress. Humidity also leads to strengthening, but is found not to be its sole cause. In addition to these time dependent effects, the static friction coefficient can also be increased by compaction of the granular material under some circumstances, and by cycling of the applied shear stress.
