In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different [...] "natural places" [...] therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their [...] "natural place" [...] (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to [...] "natural motion", and unnatural or <b>forced</b> <b>motion,</b> which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.|$|E

5000|$|There is now general {{agreement}} that the annual component of polar motion is a <b>forced</b> <b>motion</b> excited predominantly by atmospheric dynamics.

50|$|The {{first case}} is when natural {{convection}} aids forced convection. This is seen when the buoyant motion {{is in the}} same direction as the <b>forced</b> <b>motion,</b> thus enhancing the heat transfer. An example of this would be a fan blowing upward on a hot plate. Since heat naturally rises, the air being forced upward over the plate adds to the heat transfer.|$|E
50|$|The third case is {{referred}} to as transverse flow. This occurs when the buoyant motion acts perpendicular to the <b>forced</b> <b>motion.</b> This enhances fluid mixing, and enhances the heat transfer. An example of this is air flowing horizontally over a hot or cold pipe. This can encourage phase changes, which often creates a very high heat transfer coefficient. For example, steam leaving a boiler can pass through a pipe that has a fan blowing over it, cooling the steam back to a saturated liquid.|$|E

The unsteady flow is studied through solutions of the two-dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations together with a strongly coupled two-equation model of turbulence. Two motions are studied. The first motion is that of an aerofoil subjected to harmonic in-plane oscillations. The influence of advance ratio and reduced frequency is investigated. It is shown that, {{in the absence of}} shock waves, the flow is periodic with a reduced frequency equal to that of the <b>forcing</b> <b>motion.</b> However, the flow development lags behind the <b>forcing</b> <b>motion.</b> Furthermore, for constant reduced frequency the phase lag is independent of advance ratio. In addition to harmonic motion, the aerodynamic response to a step change in Mach number is investigated. Using an assumed form of the response of lift coefficient to a step change in Mach number, a lift transfer operator for step changes in Mach number is obtained in the Laplace domain. An analytical expression for the response to harmonic Mach number oscillations is then obtained from the transfer operator. The resulting formulation for the aerodynamic response confirms that the lag between the <b>forcing</b> <b>motion</b> and the aerodynamic response is independent of advance ratio...|$|R

40|$|Non-linear effects, {{either of}} {{structural}} or aerodynamic nature, are of high importance in aeroelasticity. These effects can cause limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs), which result in high loads on the oscillating structure. Possible sources of non-linearity {{in the flow}} are trailing-edge/shock-induced separation or shock dynamics. Investigations into these sources are limited due to the high computational costs of coupled fluid-structure simulations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In this work LCOs are analysed using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations and <b>forced</b> <b>motion</b> simulations of a two-degree-of-freedom airfoil system. The mean flow conditions from which LCOs might develop, are determined from the moment polar. The LCO analysis shows a slightly non-linear behaviour of the aerodynamic power.

40|$|Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) are a {{critical}} {{problem in the}} offshore industry, where interaction between flexible immersed marine structures and natural currents result in large structural oscillations. These vibrations can result in fatigue life reductions, increased factors of safety, risk of unplanned failure, reduction in operational time, and may require costly mitigation strategies. Present methods of modeling VIV used largely in industry are limited to considering motion restricted to the transverse direction relative to flow. Semi-empirical prediction methods of VIV offer a good estimate for these vibrations, but expanding them to include inline body motion would create a prohibitive {{increase in the number}} of experiments required to properly characterise VIV, even at a single Reynolds number. This thesis documents the research, development, and implementation of a novel simulation method which combines VIV prediction with on demand experiments to significantly reduce the experimental effort. ^ Previous semi-empirical prediction methods use large databases of hydrodynamic force coefficients, obtained from <b>forced</b> <b>motion</b> experiments to predict VIV. The new method developed in this thesis conducts experiments on-demand, using the Newton-Raphson method to select new experiment conditions, in order to obtain a prediction using significantly fewer experiments. On-demand experimentation with autonomous test runs in a fully integrated experimental tank inform the simulation at each step in the iteration. The system is demonstrated to reproduce observed free vibration VIV data for cases of data varying by Reynolds number, and varying mass-damping parameters. ^ Results of the implementation of the system suggest a vast reduction in the time required to characterize VIV at unfamiliar Reynolds numbers, with the output verified in comparison to existing free vibration VIV data and prior <b>forced</b> <b>motion</b> experiments done at limited Reynolds numbers. In doing so, the reduction in time and complexity makes possible the desired future objective of adding in-line oscillations to the prediction method, without the burden of an unwieldy number of <b>forced</b> <b>motion</b> experiments to perform. ...|$|E
