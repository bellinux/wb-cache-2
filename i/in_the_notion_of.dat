25|$|The {{question}} concerning corporeity connects {{also with}} Merleau-Ponty's reflections on space (l'espace) and {{the primacy of}} the dimension of depth (la profondeur) as implied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> being in the world (être au monde; to echo Heidegger's In-der-Welt-sein) and of one's own body (le corps propre).|$|E

500|$|The {{significance}} of the Gallipoli Campaign is felt strongly in both New Zealand and Australia, despite their being {{a small minority of}} the Allied forces; the campaign is regarded in both nations as a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and had been linked to their emergence as independent states. Approximately 50,000 Australians served at Gallipoli and from 14,000 to 17,000 New Zealanders. It has been argued that the campaign proved significant in the emergence of a unique Australian identity following the war, which has been closely linked to popular conceptualisations of the qualities of the soldiers that fought during the campaign, which became embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> an [...] "Anzac spirit".|$|E
500|$|Matrices can be {{generalized}} in different ways. Abstract algebra uses matrices with entries in more general fields or even rings, while linear algebra codifies properties of matrices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> linear maps. It {{is possible to}} consider matrices with infinitely many columns and rows. Another extension are tensors, which {{can be seen as}} higher-dimensional arrays of numbers, as opposed to vectors, which can often be realised as sequences of numbers, while matrices are rectangular or two-dimensional arrays of numbers. Matrices, subject to certain requirements tend to form groups known as matrix groups. Similarly under certain conditions matrices form rings [...] known as matrix rings. Though the product of matrices is not in general commutative yet certain matrices form fields known as matrix fields.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} in architectural criticism {{have investigated the}} relationship between architecture and the body, sexuality, sex, power, and place. Feminists in particular, such as Margrit Kennedy, perceive high-rise phallic-like buildings on the urban landscape as [...] "phallic symbols of male domination, power and rational instrumentality." [...] Esther M. K. Cheung believes the form of monumental high-rise building which grew up in 20th century America can [...] "be read as a phallic symbol of power". [...] The present trend symbolises [...] "Science and technology over nature, [...] incorporating all the maleness which that with sci-fi utopias." [...] Elizabeth Grosz, however, offers a counter argument to phallocentrism in urban design theories, saying [...] "not so much {{the dominance of the}} phallus as the pervasive unacknowledged use of the male or masculine to represent the human. The problem, then, is not so much to eliminate as to reveal the masculinity inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> the universal, the generic human, or the unspecified subject." [...] Marc C. Taylor discusses phallic architecture and what makes a building masculine or feminine in his book Disfiguring: Art, Architecture, Religion.|$|E

500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Howard Gordon was originally working on an episode about someone {{who appeared to be}} immortal, but after discussions with consulting producer Ken Horton he added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> xenophobia and [...] "melanin-sucking albino vampires". Series creator Chris Carter approved the storyline, but the first draft of the script was met with disapproval by the writing staff, and the story was restructured and rewritten. As the episode entered pre-production, Carter asked Gordon to refine the script to give it a purpose, and it was then that Gordon came up with the theme of [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate". This phrase is first spoken by Scully in conversation with Mulder after the post mortem on Owen Sanders, the fourth missing man. Mulder later throws the same phrase back at her in frustration as he leaves the Mt Zion Medical Center (where Aboah has been examined) to meet Diabra, the Burkinabe diplomat. And Scully finally uses the phrase in her field journal during her closing sentiments.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} {{critical}} understanding {{is closely related}} to the concept of Critical Thinking, described as, ‘reasonable reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do.’ Critical thinking has also been described as, ‘thinking about thinking’, specifically in relation to John Dewey’s work on ‘the problem of training thought’. Critical understanding has its roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> pluralism, the idea of multiple approaches, methods and interpretations in which dialogue plays an important role. In a pedagogical sense it is closely linked to the theory of Education for Critical Consciousness, outlined by Paulo Freire, Brazilian educator and critical theorist, who wrote, ‘Only dialogue, which requires critical thinking, is also capable of generating critical thinking. Without dialogue there is no communication, and without communication there can be no true education.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|...Nietzsche's 'will to power' and Chinese 'virtuality' (de)" [...] is a {{comparative}} essay by Roger T. Ames, considering {{the relationship between}} Nietzsche's will to power {{and the notion of}} de in Chinese philosophy. Ames attempts to reconstruct the disparate notions of de into a single [...] "classical Chinese notion" [...] by drawing out the cosmological and aesthetic principles underlying the ethical notion of de in Confucianism, and the ethical and social implications of the primarily cosmological de in Daoism. He interprets Nietzsche's will to power as [...] "an alternative to mechanistic physics", an undogmatic cosmology; the term [...] "cosmology" [...] must be redefined if applied to Nietzsche. For Ames, Nietzsche's notion of [...] "power" [...] is the separating factor between Nietzsche's [...] "aesthetic perspectivism" [...] from an [...] "anything-goes relativism". Having outlined his understanding of the two notions, Ames goes on to compare de with the will to power, concluding that there is [...] "some common ground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> overcoming ego-self", but that there remain significant differences; for instance, while de celebrates [...] "enjoyment", Nietzsche's Übermensch strives for personal joy.|$|E
2500|$|Moltmann {{cites the}} English pacifist and anti-capitalist theologian Geoffrey Anketell Studdert Kennedy as being highly regarded. However the {{inspiration}} for his first major work, Theology of Hope, was the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch's [...] "Principle of Hope". Bloch is concerned to establish hope as the guiding principle of his Marxism and stresses the implied humanism inherent in mystical tradition. Bloch claims to identify an atheism {{at the core of}} Christianity, embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> the death of God and the continued imperative of seeking the Kingdom. The whole theme of the Theology of Hope was worked out in counterpoint to the theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg, who had worked alongside Moltmann at Wuppertal, and had also undergone a conversion experience during Germany's defeat in World War II. With its slogan of [...] "History as Revelation", Pannenberg's theology has many parallels, but Moltmann was concerned to reject any notion of history as a closed system and to shift the stress from revelation to action: hope as the principle of revolutionary openness to the future.|$|E
