Wood chips are most often used under trees and shrubs. When used around soft stemmed plants, an unmulched zone is left around the plant stems to prevent stem rot or other possible diseases.

50|$|Cartridge filter {{technology}} {{was invented in}} the mid-1960s, cartridge filters have a large surface areas enabling them to operate for long periods. Cartridge filter systems also permit better water flow - thus, placing less strain on the filter pump. These types of filters are also easiest to clean by using a flow of high-pressure water from a hose. The filters are made of polyester or other material that can provide a superfine filtering surface. The pleats {{are the key to}} the filter's operation. The tight pleats, or folds, allow for a large amount of material to be used in a small container.

40|$|The {{growth in}} {{environmental}} regulations governing the landfilling of used products {{and in the}} environmental awareness of consumers poses two challenges for manufacturers as they go to market with their products. First, landfilling fees and bans increase the cost of disposing of used products that they maintain ownership of, such as products coming off operating leases or previously sold products recovered via trade-in programs. Second, it is becoming important for firms {{to have a better}} understanding of the total environmental impact of their decisions. In this paper, we characterize the optimal integrated pricing, recovery, remarketing and disposal strategy of a monopolist manufacturer under leasing and selling. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we provide insights to manufacturers about how production cost, <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> and durability should shape their decisions. Second, while the question of whether a firm should lease or sell its product has been studied, little is known about which strategy dominates when disposal is costly and when a firm can recover previously sold products through trade-ins. We find that leasing performs at least as well as selling with respect to profitability. Third, to investigate claims in the industrial ecology literature that leasing is environmentally preferable to selling, we characterize under what conditions each strategy dominates from an environmental impact perspective. We find that while leasing dominates in the presence of high production cost, environmental impact depends on <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> when production cost is low: For low <b>disposal</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|E

40|$|Animal {{production}} in the Flemish region and pig {{production in}} particular is intensive and causing external problems related to manure disposal. At a regional level, manure disposal {{can be regarded as}} a problem of distributing the manure from farms with a surplus to farms with a shortage or to disposal alternatives. Total disposal costs will depend on the amount of manure surplus and on the location dependent <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> per unit. Disposal costs are an economic incentive for structural changes and cost abatement investments at farm level which will, in turn, influence the regional disposal. In order to simulate these interactions, an integrated system of models describing the regional manure disposal coordination system is developed, composed of a farm level component, an aggregation module and a regional disposal model. The possibilities for <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> abatement at farm level are analysed through LP modelling of representative farms. Incentives for structural change are derived from the shadow prices of the housing and land constraints in the model. Manure separation is analysed as an example of cost abatement investments.
