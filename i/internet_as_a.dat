25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the <b>Internet</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.|$|E
