5|$|Moving east-southeast into {{southern}} Middlesex County, it continued producing severe winds (gusting up to 90mph; 145km/h) and very heavy rain. Another tornado touched <b>down</b> <b>very</b> briefly in Norfolk County, {{followed by two}} more brief touchdowns in Plymouth County near 5:30PM. The storm then weakened, but still managed to produce 60mph (95km/h) winds on Cape Cod, before finally moving out into the Atlantic and dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} {{horns and}} the muscular neck {{may have been}} used in fighting conspecifics. According to separate studies, rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of Carnotaurus remain unclear: some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt <b>down</b> <b>very</b> large prey such as sauropods, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. Carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Richardson's consistency and strenuous work, Lockwood was never capable of long bowling spells. He bowled off a much shorter run than Richardson {{and tended to}} come <b>down</b> <b>very</b> heavily in his delivery stride. Lockwood could break back, though rarely as sharply as Richardson, but what really set Lockwood apart was his unpredictability, with extremely subtle variations of pace and pitch characterising his bowling. Frequently Lockwood would deliver a slow ball without change of action and the batsman would claim they never expected it.|$|E
25|$|At 0430 hours, the two {{companies}} deployed their automatic weapons and began to fire at strong well-fortified enemy positions {{at the top of}} the feature. The enemy was bringing <b>down</b> <b>very</b> effective small arms fire and sniper fire, which effectively blocked the advance of the Indian troops. At around 1015 hours on 5 July, the commanding officer of 'C' company spoke to the battalion commanding officer and explained his company's predicament and the area from where the enemy was bringing in effective fire on to them. Brigadier Kakkar was personally supervising operations.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{hydroelectricity}} {{is relatively}} low, {{making it a}} competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. With a dam and reservoir {{it is also a}} flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or <b>down</b> <b>very</b> quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than fossil fuel powered energy plants.|$|E

25|$|Hydropower is a {{flexible}} source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and <b>down</b> <b>very</b> quickly {{to adapt to}} changing energy demands. Hydro turbines have a start-up time {{of the order of}} a few minutes. It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants. Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation. Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs. Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{hydroelectricity}} {{is relatively}} low, {{making it a}} competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and <b>down</b> <b>very</b> quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered energy plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} created in 1978 when Great American Recreation (GAR), the new owners of the {{recently}} combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, {{wanted to do something}} with the ski area during the off season. Two years earlier, in 1976, they had followed the trend of many other ski areas at the time and opened a -long alpine slide <b>down</b> <b>very</b> steep ski trails. Gradually, Waterworld and Motorworld came together {{at the base of the}} mountain to form one of North America's earliest modern water parks, which was originally called the Vernon Valley Summer Park. They started out with two water slides and a LOLA race car track in the summer of 1978, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year, as well as tennis courts and a softball field. Finally, Motorworld was carved out of the swampy areas the ski area owned across Route 94. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).|$|E

500|$|Rogers and his {{decimated}} company {{returned to}} Fort Edward on March 15. [...] Rogers himself was originally {{reported by the}} French to have been killed, but had actually survived. The report stemmed from the manner of Rogers’ escape during which he discarded some of his belongings, including his regimental coat, which contained his military commission. This episode also {{gave rise to a}} local legend that Rogers escaped the battle by sliding 400 feet down the side of a hill to the frozen surface of Lake George.

500|$|Following Beyoncé's performance, American {{journalist}} Anderson Cooper who {{was present}} at the Hall and served as a host jokingly asked the crowd, [...] "Is this what happens at the U.N. every Friday night? Because, I've gotta tell you ... I wanna be here every Friday night if this goes on." [...] Diane Warren described the performance as [...] "one of the best experiences ever" [...] in her life. The performance and the music video received positive reviews from critics, who praised Beyoncé's live vocals. Pamela Falk of CBS News described the performance as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "stunning". Jim Farber of Daily News was also positive about the performance saying that she [...] "delivered a powerful live vocal to the song's musical track". Molly O'Brien of Prefix Magazine commented that the video was [...] "simple and powerful: Beyoncé gives an impeccable live performance of the song... On the album, 'I Was Here' is pompous and a little cloying; live and accompanied by those images, it's got the same change-the-world flavor as Michael Jackson's 'Man in the Mirror.'" [...] Nadeska Alexis of the same publication wrote that Beyoncé belted out her vocals while members of the audience sang along further noting that the moment ended [...] "all too quickly". A writer of OK! magazine praised Beyoncé for being [...] "striking as always" [...] while belting out [...] "I Was Here" [...] in the video. MTV Act's Jose Iniguez described the performance as [...] "phenomenal, flawless, goosebump-inducing, inspiring" [...] adding that it gave him life and made him feel [...] "gobbled up" [...] by the presence of Beyoncé. He added that [...] "I Was Here" [...] couldn't have been a better fit for the campaign and concluded that [...] "Bey was simply flawless. Her voice, her dress, her touching (yet short) address after her performance sent chills <b>down</b> <b>very</b> limb." [...] Mike Larkin from the Daily Mail described the performance as [...] "spectacular" [...] while praising the [...] "virtual galaxy" [...] created on the stage with [...] "lavish" [...] production values, Beyoncé's [...] "spine-tingling" [...] vocal rendition while hitting the high notes and her [...] "fantastic" [...] look complete with [...] "dazzlingly glamorous white frock, which hugged her spectacular post pregnancy body in all the right places".|$|E

From 1946 until he retired {{at the end of the}} 1980 season, Arlott covered every single home Test match.
