5|$|Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> {{after the}} Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic <b>Hebrew,</b> which ceased being spoken and {{developed}} into a literary language around 200 CE. <b>Hebrew</b> continued {{to be used as}} a literary and liturgical language in the form of Medieval <b>Hebrew,</b> and <b>Hebrew</b> began a revival process in the 19th century, culminating in Modern <b>Hebrew</b> becoming the official language of Israel. Currently, Classical <b>Hebrew</b> is generally taught in public schools in Israel, and Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> forms are sometimes used in Modern <b>Hebrew</b> literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature. Since Modern <b>Hebrew</b> contains many biblical elements, Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> is fairly intelligible to Modern <b>Hebrew</b> speakers.|$|E

5|$|The term Classical <b>Hebrew</b> {{may include}} all pre-medieval dialects of <b>Hebrew,</b> {{including}} Mishnaic <b>Hebrew,</b> {{or it may}} be limited to <b>Hebrew</b> contemporaneous with the <b>Hebrew</b> Bible.

5|$|Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> as {{preserved}} in the <b>Hebrew</b> Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers. The consonantal skeleton of the text is the most ancient, while the vocalization and cantillation are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language. These additions were added after 600 CE; <b>Hebrew</b> had already ceased {{being used as a}} spoken language around 200 CE. Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> as reflected in the consonantal text of the Bible and in extra-biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of possible significant parallels of the Roman imperial cult (Caesar-Nero) {{in the book of}} <b>Hebrews.</b> The book of <b>Hebrews</b> was no doubt greatly impacted by Jewish influence, context, and background. Yet there may be other significant influences that have formed the New Testament book of <b>Hebrews.</b> One such possible influence to the book of <b>Hebrews</b> is the Roman Empire, and more specifically, the Roman imperial cult, the worship of living Roman emperors in god-like terms and the deification of dead emperors. The writer of <b>Hebrews</b> may have used language, forms, and images of the Roman ruler cult to contrast, compare, or clarify their theology and interpretation of Jesus and God. There is the possibility of correspondences between worship of the Roman emperors and the book of <b>Hebrews.</b> Are there significant parallels of the worship of the Caesars to God in the book of <b>Hebrews?</b> Did the writer of <b>Hebrews</b> use illusions, motifs, and images of the Roman emperor cult in parallel to Jesus Christ? Is the Roman imperial cult influence portrayed in the book of <b>Hebrews?</b> If yes, how and to what degree are they portrayed? If no, {{what are some of the}} divergences? This thesis attempts to answer these questions in an investigation for possible parallels of the Roman imperial cult (Caesar-Nero) in the New Testament book of <b>Hebrews.</b> I hypothesize there are significant parallels of the Roman imperial cult (Caesar-Nero) in the book of <b>Hebrews.</b> Through my findings I conclude that parallels with words and images on a broad level do exist, but discovery of significant parallels of direct influence were lacking. The parallels between <b>Hebrews</b> and the Roman imperial cult were more likely due to common sources, cultural settings, or universal ideas. The three strongest parallels of the emperor cult (Caesar-Nero) in the book of <b>Hebrews</b> were: divine sonship, enthronement after death, and benefaction. These parallels in combination with the weaker ones do not constitute significant parallelism. The Roman emperor cult does not appear to be a major influence which produced significant parallel for material contained in the book of <b>Hebrews.</b> Dissertation (MTh (New Testament Studies)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

5|$|A {{native of}} the Bronx, Weider {{graduated}} from Rutgers University, and was ordained at <b>Hebrew</b> Union College in Cincinnati in 1973 (he would be granted a Doctor of Divinity degree by <b>Hebrew</b> Union College in 1998). Before joining Beth Elohim, he served as Assistant Rabbi of Temple Ohabei Shalom of Brookline, Massachusetts, and as the Associate Rabbi of Washington <b>Hebrew</b> Congregation in Washington, D.C.

5|$|Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> from {{after the}} Babylonian exile in 587BCE {{is known as}} 'Late Biblical Hebrew'. Late Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> shows Aramaic {{influence}} in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and this trend is also evident in the later-developed Tiberian vocalization system.|$|E
5|$|Biblical <b>Hebrew</b> {{has been}} written {{with a number of}} {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day. However, the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern <b>Hebrew</b> alphabet. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical <b>Hebrew,</b> though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in <b>Hebrew</b> manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E

5|$|By 1955, Phoenix's Jewish {{population}} {{had grown to}} over 3,000 families, and the city still had two Jewish congregations, Beth Israel and Beth El. That year, {{with the support of}} Krohn, Albert Plotkin joined Beth Israel as rabbi. Born in 1920 and raised in South Bend, Indiana, his parents were immigrants from Russia. After getting an undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame, he entered <b>Hebrew</b> Union College in 1943 – on academic probation, because he had taken no <b>Hebrew</b> at Notre Dame. He was ordained by <b>Hebrew</b> Union College in 1948, graduating with a Master of <b>Hebrew</b> Letters. Plotkin had started his rabbinic career as assistant rabbi of Temple De Hirsch in Seattle, his first pulpit after ordination. There he met his future wife Sylvia Pincus, whose family were long-time members of Temple De Hirsch. They married a year later, and shortly after moved to Spokane, Washington, where Plotkin became senior rabbi at Temple Emanuel.|$|E
