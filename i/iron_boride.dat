5000|$|Boriding, {{also called}} boronizing, {{is the process}} by which boron is {{introduced}} to a metal or alloy. It is a type of surface hardening. In this process boron atoms are diffused into the surface of a metal component.

Their favorable properties are manifested even when they are {{a small fraction of the}} bulk solid. [...] Boronized metal parts are extremely wear resistant and will often last two to five times longer than components treated with conventional heat treatments such as hardening, carburizing, nitriding, nitrocarburizing or induction hardening. Most borided steel surfaces will have <b>iron</b> <b>boride</b> layer hardnesses ranging from 1200-1600 HV.

The concentration and temperature dependencies of the thermodynamic properties of the Fe–B melts have been approximated using the associated-solution model {{under the assumption that}} FeB and Fe 3 B complexes exist in the melt. The phase equilibria computed {{on the basis of the}} obtained thermodynamic properties and the developed model are shown to agree with available experimental information. The suggested complete thermodynamic description of the iron–boron system has been applied to analyse the thermodynamic and kinetic (viscosity) characteristics of transition of liquid Fe–B compositions into the amorphous state. The association concept allows quantitative interpretation of the behaviour of these properties and the relative stability of the liquid, crystalline and amorphous states...|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: steel 40 H, HVG, ShH 15, H 12 M. Purpose of the work: {{development}} of new methods of boronizing in a vibration fluid bed and of compositions of boronizing media which {{make it possible to}} decrease the temperature and time parameters of the chemical thermal treatment and to lessen brittleness. The investigation included the study of the influence of mixture composition and conditions of the boronizing and boron copper plating on the thickness, structure and phase composition of boron coatings applied by diffusion saturation in the vibration fluidized bed and the study of the influence of copper and its compounds on boronizing process. The work determiness the intensifying and plasticizing effect of copper on <b>iron</b> <b>borides.</b> Practical steps are worked out for optimization of the saturating mixture composition and boron copper plating conditions in order to intensify the saturating process and increase the plasticity of the produced boride layers. Practical recommendations are developed on the boron copper plating in the vibration fluidized bed and are now in useAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} a crystallization process of Fe-based amorphous materials. The aim {{of work is}} presentation {{of the influence of}} annealing temperature on structural changes and magnetic properties of Fe 72 B 20 Si 4 Nb 4 metallic glasses. Design/methodology/approach: The studies were performed on metallic glasses as ribbons. Crystallization behaviour of the studied alloy was examined by differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Mössbauer spectroscopy methods. The soft magnetic properties examination of tested material contained magnetic permeability, coercive field, saturation induction and magnetic after-effects measurements. Findings: The XRD, TEM and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations revealed that the studied alloy in as-cast state was amorphous. A two stage crystallization process was observed for studied material. The first stage of crystallization corresponding to the partial crystallization of α-Fe phase was followed by the formation of <b>iron</b> <b>borides.</b> It has shown that appropriate increasing of annealing temperature, significantly improved soft magnetic properties of examined alloy. The maximum of initial magnetic permeability is correlated with a minimum of coercive field. Practical implications: The soft magnetic properties of metallic glasses can be optimized by applying the appropriate conditions of heat treatment. Originality/value: The applied investigation methods are suitable to determine the changes of structure and the improvement of soft magnetic properties of examined Fe-based alloy in comparison with as-cast state...|$|R
