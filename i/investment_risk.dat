The rapid growth of money supply came from high demands for borrowing capital at the rate of 12% the banks offer, imposed by the Government to make credit accessible to average Iranians and small entrepreneurs. However, this rate is lower than the rate of inflation.

2500|$|Investment and {{accumulation}} goals: planning how {{to accumulate}} enough money – for large purchases and life events – {{is what most}} people consider to be financial planning. [...] Major reasons to accumulate assets include, purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and {{when you need to}} withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals. [...] A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation. [...] Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments. [...] In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. [...] Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify <b>investment</b> <b>risk</b> and opportunity. [...] This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments. [...] The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.|$|E

40|$|The Chinese {{stock market}} with its unique {{institutions}} is rather different from western stock markets. The average underpricing of Chinese IPOs is 247 %, {{the highest of}} any major world market. We model this extreme underpricing with a supply-demand analytical framework that captures critical institutional features of China's primary market, and then empirically test this model using a sample of 1377 IPOs listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges between 1992 and 2004. We find that Chinese IPO underpricing is principally caused by government intervention with IPO pricing regulations and the control of IPO share supplies. Besides the regulatory underpricing, this paper also documents some specific <b>investment</b> <b>risks</b> of IPOs in China's stock market.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the sustainability implications of demographic and <b>investment</b> <b>risks</b> in the Finnish private sector pension system (TyEL). The {{results show that}} current contribution rate {{is likely to be}} too low to finance the future higher expenditure. The main sustainability problem is not, however, the generally projected increase in the contribution rate, but the outstanding probability of the contribution being much higher than expected in the long term. A recent reform aimed at lowering the expected increase in the contribution rate by increasing the share of stocks in the portfolios of the pension funds. It is likely to do so, unless the increased risk causes unforeseen changes to the pension system, with sustainability implications that may outweigh the expected gains from better asset yields. A long-lasting solution to the sustainability problem could be the adoption of a Swedish type NDC pension system. Our simulations show, however, that the implied adjustment rules may not react early enough to the realized demographic or <b>investment</b> <b>risks,</b> and therefore risk sharing between generations would not be sufficient. Future research should study adjustment mechanisms that restrict the probability of large hikes in the contribution rate without fixing the contribution rate permanently. sustainability, demographic <b>risks,</b> <b>investment</b> <b>risks,</b> pension funds...|$|R

On this basis, using MATLAB software with BP Neural Network model, we carried out example simulations and results were analyzed. The results showed that the combination model of Analytic Hierarchy Process with BP Neural Network model (AHP-BPNN) is effective.
