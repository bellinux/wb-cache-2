40|$|In this paper, by {{comparing}} the time scales associated with the velocity relaxation and correlation time of the random force due to dust charge fluctuations, memory effects in the velocity relaxation of an isolated <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> exposed to the random force due to dust charge fluctuations are considered, and the velocity relaxation process of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> is considered as a non-Markovian stochastic process. Considering memory effects in the velocity relaxation process of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> yields a retarded friction force, which is introduced by a memory kernel in the fractional Langevin equation. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the dust grain is derived from this equation. The mean-square displacement and the velocity autocorrelation function of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> are obtained, and their asymptotic behavior, the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> temperature due to charge fluctuations, and the diffusion coefficient are studied in the long-time limit. As an interesting feature, {{it is found that}} by considering memory effects in the velocity relaxation process of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle,</b> fluctuating force on the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> can cause an anomalous diffusion in a dusty plasma. In this case, the mean-square displacement of the dust grain increases slower than linearly with time, and the velocity autocorrelation function decays as a power-law instead of the exponential decay. Finally, in the Markov limit, these results are in good agreement with those obtained from previous works for Markov (memoryless) process of the velocity relaxation.

5|$|Halley is {{the most}} active of all the {{periodic}} comets, with others, such as Comet Encke and Comet Holmes, being one or two orders of magnitude less active. Its day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapor, 17% carbon monoxide and 3–4% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more-recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> {{were found to be}} primarily a mixture of carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the outer Solar System, and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> decreased in size down to the limits of detection (~0.001µm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.|$|E

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of a spherical <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> {{caused by an}} interstellar gas flow depends on the drag coefficient which is, for the given particle and flow of interstellar gas, a specific function of the relative speed of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> {{with respect to the}} interstellar gas. We investigate the motion of a <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> in the case when the acceleration caused by the interstellar gas flow represent a small perturbation to the gravity of a central star. We present the secular time derivatives of the Keplerian orbital elements of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> under the action of the acceleration from the interstellar gas flow for arbitrary orbit orientation. The semimajor axis of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> is a decreasing function of time for an interstellar gas flow acceleration with constant drag coefficient and also for such an acceleration with the linearly variable drag coefficient. The decrease of the semimajor axis is slower for the interstellar gas flow acceleration with the variable drag coefficient. The minimal and maximal values of the decrease of the semimajor axis are determined. In the planar case, when the interstellar gas flow velocity lies in the orbital plane of the particle, the orbit always approaches the position with the maximal value of the transversal component of the interstellar gas flow velocity vector measured at perihelion. The properties of the orbital evolution derived from the secular time derivatives are consistent with numerical integrations of the equation of motion. If the interstellar gas flow speed is much larger than the speed of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle,</b> then the linear approximation of dependence of the drag coefficient on the relative speed of the <b>dust</b> <b>particle</b> with respect to the interstellar gas is usable for practically arbitrary (no close to zero) values of the molecular speed ratios (Mach numbers).

5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave {{planetary scientists}} their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases <b>dust</b> <b>particles,</b> which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{molecules}} exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1μm <b>dust</b> <b>particles.</b> The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared {{images of the}} dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, with <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.|$|E
5|$|However some {{properties}} have so {{far gone}} unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which {{may be due to}} unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. One possible explanation of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it loses its electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> partially corotate with the planet, they will move outward during the shadow pass creating an outward extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain a dip in the particle distribution and ring's brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.|$|E

5|$|The clumpy {{structure}} of the dust belt {{may be explained by}} gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 orbital resonance. In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.3. Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos.|$|E
5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings {{originates}} in essentially {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{peak in the}} {{brightness}} just inside of the Amalthea's orbit and, therefore, the vertical asymmetry the Amalthea gossamer ring {{may be due to}} the <b>dust</b> <b>particles</b> trapped at the leading (L4) and trailing (L5) Lagrange points of this moon. The particles may also follow horseshoe orbits between the Lagrangian points. The dust may be present at the leading and trailing Lagrange points of Thebe as well.

If the attractive potential well is deep enough, the two particles will combine, thereby creating macro-particles.
