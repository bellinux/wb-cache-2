5|$|In July 2017, Square Enix {{released}} Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age, a high-definition remaster of the Japanese-only International Zodiac Job System for the PlayStation 4. The Zodiac Age adds trophy support, a remastered soundtrack with a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> tracks, {{and improved}} technical performance.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being one}} of a short group of non-championship games still {{detailed}} in the Official Rules and Records Book of the Billiard Congress of America, as of 2006, bottle pool was known only to be the billiard sport of general choice at a <b>few</b> <b>New</b> York City social clubs such as the two mentioned previously. A veteran member of both those clubs opined in 2006 that there were then fewer than 1,000 dedicated bottle pool players nationwide.|$|E

5|$|Following a short tour in March 2009 with Ceremony, Coliseum, Pulling Teeth, Rise and Fall, Converge {{entered the}} studio to begin {{recording}} in May 2009. During this short tour, the band debuted a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> songs live, and footage could be seen online. The album was self-produced by Converge's guitar player, Kurt Ballou, in his own GodCity Studios located in Massachusetts. Ballou has produced and co-produced several Converge albums. Throughout the recording process, the band updated their fans via Twitter of their progress in the studio.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, there were <b>few</b> <b>new</b> {{insights}} {{into the nature of}} noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E
5|$|Newly issued Irish {{postage stamps}} are {{available}} from the Philatelic Bureau of An Post in the Dublin, General Post Office. Commemorative and special issue stamps are usually available for one year from the date of issue. Until the mid-1960s the Irish stamp-issuing policy was very conservative, with only a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> ones each year; up to four or five commemoratives, usually of two values, plus the occasional updated, or new, definitives. During the 1970s and beyond, the quantity produced rose considerably.|$|E

5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form <b>few</b> <b>new</b> stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{downloadable}} content The Warpath Campaign was criticised by Game Watcher for not integrating {{into the}} original campaign and for only adding a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> units. Concerns were also voiced {{about the difficulty}} curve, though the reviewer felt the DLC provided players a challenge by playing as the technologically backward Native Americans against the European interlopers.|$|E
5|$|The more {{powerful}} hardware of the PlayStation 3 gave Team Ninja {{the opportunity to}} overhaul the game graphics to use larger and more detailed textures. Changes {{were made to the}} game world, with a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> areas and several additional save points and shops, and alterations to the game engine let players shoot arrows in mid-air, fight on water surfaces, and play as Rachel in some chapters and missions.|$|E
30|$|This {{heuristics}} {{is similar}} to its offline counterpart; i.e., Offline-R. The objective here is to reduce energy consumption by utilizing established links and, additionally, favoring paths that require the <b>fewest</b> <b>new</b> links.|$|R
50|$|Old favourites {{from the}} elder poets, with a <b>few</b> <b>newer</b> friends. A {{selection}} by M. Sharpe. Williams and Norgate, London, 1881. Second revised edition, Methuen, 1912. An anthology of nine women poets, particularly Anna Laetitia Barbauld.|$|R
25|$|The 1960s Civil Rights Movement, anti-war protests, {{and various}} {{university}} student movements brought {{new life to}} the IWW, albeit with many <b>fewer</b> <b>new</b> members than the great organizing drives of {{the early part of}} the 20th century.|$|R
5|$|The white {{supremacist}} scientist Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed Animal Coloration in Science in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful {{summary of the}} subject. He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> ideas. He recommends the book to all working American naturalists.|$|E
5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Although there had been only a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E
5|$|As Sadness reinstalls {{the core}} memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives {{home to her}} parents and breaks down crying, confessing that she misses Minnesota. As her parents comfort her, they tell her that they also miss Minnesota and Joy and Sadness work the console together, {{creating}} a new core memory that combines their emotions; a new island forms representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco. In the end, a year later {{at the age of}} 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to her old hobbies, and adopted a <b>few</b> <b>new</b> ones (fueled by new, more nuanced core memories from combinations of her emotions). Inside Headquarters, her emotions all work together on a new expanded console with room for them all, allowing Riley to lead a more emotionally complex life.|$|E
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} must be less ad hoc {{than any}} other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must include <b>fewer</b> <b>new</b> suppositions about the past which are not already implied to some extent by existing beliefs.|$|R
50|$|Improved {{material}} flows. A {{zero waste}} strategy would use far <b>fewer</b> <b>new</b> {{raw materials and}} send no waste materials to landfills. Any material waste would either return as reusable or recycled materials or would be suitable for use as compost.|$|R
50|$|Its {{southern}} slopes, nearest to the city, {{include many}} spacious late Victorian and Edwardian houses, {{while on the}} steep higher hills, heading north out of Exeter, the housing is mainly 1920s-1970s, with a <b>few</b> <b>newer</b> estates on the city's extremities.|$|R
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its <b>few</b> <b>new</b> uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>New</b> Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers {{to make the most of}} the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|Having {{released}} the Empress, Stephen focused on pacifying the south-west of England. Although {{there had been}} <b>few</b> <b>new</b> defections to the Empress, his enemies now controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south-west into Devon and Cornwall, west into the Welsh Marches and east as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Stephen started by attacking Wallingford Castle, held by the Empress's childhood friend Brien FitzCount, only to find it too well defended. Stephen left behind some forces to blockade the castle and continued west into Wiltshire to attack Trowbridge, taking the castles of South Cerney and Malmesbury en route. Meanwhile, Miles of Gloucester marched east, attacking Stephen's rearguard forces at Wallingford and threatening an advance on London. Stephen was forced {{to give up his}} western campaign, returning east to stabilise the situation and protect his capital.|$|E
50|$|A <b>few</b> <b>newer</b> {{homes are}} still {{occupied}} in Chivington, but the town consists mostly {{of a few}} abandoned but still-standing ruins, more partially collapsed buildings (the former school house degrades, year-by-year), and many piles of bricks mark where the town once stood.|$|R
50|$|The more {{predictions}} {{a theory}} makes, {{the greater the}} chance is of some of them being cheaply testable. Modifications of existing theories make many <b>fewer</b> <b>new</b> unique predictions, increasing {{the risk that the}} few predictions remaining will be very expensive to test.|$|R
5000|$|Reilly championed a [...] "no pilot season" [...] {{strategy}} (designed {{to nurture}} <b>fewer</b> <b>new</b> FOX shows with more investment), {{during which he}} was responsible for greenlighting hit shows Gotham, The Last Man on Earth, and Empire. He left Fox in May 2014.|$|R
5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture <b>few</b> <b>new</b> riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, the capacity of the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very <b>few</b> <b>new</b> hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
5|$|Key {{entered the}} New Zealand Parliament {{representing}} the Auckland electorate of Helensville {{as one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>new</b> National members of parliament in the election of 2002 following National's significant defeat of that year. In 2004, he was appointed Finance Spokesman for National and eventually succeeded Don Brash as the National Party leader in 2006. After two years as Leader of the Opposition, Key led his party to victory at the November 2008 general election, and repeated this feat at both the November 2011 and September 2014 elections. He was expected to lead National into the 2017 election, but on 5 December 2016 announced that he would resign as Prime Minister and leader of the National Party. He was succeeded by Bill English on 12 December 2016.|$|E
30|$|Since news pages change more {{frequency}} {{and are more}} relevant, B has stricter QoD requirements, and therefore is processed faster (i.e., activated more often). Its divergence bounds are lower, meaning {{that it will take}} less time (200 vs 300 seconds), <b>fewer</b> <b>new</b> documents crawled (100 vs 500), and/or <b>fewer</b> modifications on <b>new</b> versions of crawled documents (10 % vs 20 % of contents), in order to activate it.|$|R
30|$|Glyphosate {{use in the}} {{agricultural}} sector rose 300 -fold from 1974 to 2014 (0.36 – 113.4 million kg; 0.8 – 250 million pounds). Non-agricultural uses rose less dramatically, by 43 -fold {{in the same time}} period, because there were far <b>fewer</b> <b>new,</b> non-agricultural uses registered.|$|R
50|$|The FEMRR {{operated}} up to nine {{diesel-electric locomotives}} built between 1944 and 1954. The 1958 roster shown below is probably representative of FEMRR motive power through the mid-1960s, though a <b>few</b> <b>newer</b> locomotives replaced some older ones listed here, particularly as steam was phased out.|$|R
