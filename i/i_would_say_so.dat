'Then, in very sober earnest,' {{answered}} his friend, 'I am {{very glad to}} hear it; and so highly do I think of Flora, {{that you are the}} only man in England for whom <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much.

The grand master and the council {{have the right to}} expel a knight from the Order after due trial and investigation, but not to condemn him to such penalties as the galleys.

As to the other matter, that also is my business. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> if <b>I</b> had not plenty of funds, but what with my pay as interpreter, and the year of back pay that I got when the Gazette came out, I have plenty out of my income to pay for it, without breaking in upon the amount I told you I had got for those rubies." ...|$|R

O! my friend, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> to my mother, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not be tempted by any sufferings to pain for an instant her pure and affectionate heart; but indeed, Doctor Masham, indeed, indeed, what I tell you is true, all my late illness, my present state, all, all are {{attributable}} but to one cause, this mystery about my father!' ...|$|R

They will merely declare themselves man and wife in the presence of an official; he will enter them as such in a register, and the affair will be over. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> to Arnold, but I have serious doubt whether the American authorities would recognize the ceremony as a legal one, did she ever appear there to claim possession. Of course, if he gets away also, it can be put right by another marriage when they get out, or they can stop for a few weeks on their way through England, and be married again there." ...|$|R

[...] The Baron de Frénilly, who knew her in the 1790s, described her as [...] "the good, amiable, and eternally young Vicomtesse d'Houdetot ... a laugher at etiquette, cheerful, vivacious, witty, prolific in ingenious thoughts and happy phrases" [...] despite [...] "an ignoble ugliness, a raucous voice, and a treacherous eye which was always looking sideways when {{it seemed to be}} looking you in the face." ...|$|R

It is certainly not the very best way to publish on one's own accompt; for the booksellers set their face against the circulation of such works as do not pay an amazing toll to themselves. But they have lost the art of altogether damming up the road in such cases between the author and the public, which they were once able to do as effectually as Diabolus in John Bunyan's Holy War closed up the windows of my Lord Understanding's mansion.

60|$|Perhaps the ode to Leuconoe, which Mr. Austin Dobson has {{rendered}} so prettily in a villanelle, {{may come}} {{within the scope}} of this Muse, for it has a playfulness mingled with its melancholy, a sadness in its play. Perhaps, too, if Horace is to be done into verse, these old French forms seem as fit vehicles as any for Latin poetry that was written in the exotic measures of Greece. There is a foreign grace and a little technical difficulty overcome in the English ballade and villanelle, as in the Horatian sapphics and alcaics. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much, on my own responsibility, nor trespass so far on the domain of scholarship, but this opinion was communicated to me by a learned professor of Latin. I think, too, that some of the lyric measures of the old French Pleiad, of Ronsard and Du Bellay, would be well wedded with the verse of Horace. But perhaps no translator will ever please any one but himself, and of Horace every man must be his own translator.|$|R

While you are in your present mood <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> for the world. I almost wish, indeed, that I had a different nature, that I might repress even this slight confession of weakness; which I cannot disguise from you; which I feel is humiliating; but which you will have the goodness to excuse.

The government are now unprovided of men and ammunition; {{in a few weeks}} they will have enough of both: the country is now in a flame against them; in a few weeks, betwixt the effects of self-interest, of fear, and of lukewarm indifference, which are already so visible, this first fervour will be as cold as Christmas.

Oh, how I hate inventing dinners! and how I admire the enviable slowness of mind and laziness of body which have saved Eunice from undertaking the worries of housekeeping in her turn! She can go and work in her garden, while I am racking my invention to discover variety in dishes without overstepping the limits of economy.
