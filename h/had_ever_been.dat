5|$|On June 16, 2012, {{a revival}} of the musical by Lyric Opera of Chicago was {{broadcast}} by WFMT-Radio of Chicago. This production of Show Boat reinstated the songs Mis'ry's Comin' Round, Till Good Luck Comes My Way and Hey, Feller!. It marked the first time a virtually complete version of Show Boat <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> broadcast on radio.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> seen in the east. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.|$|E

5|$|Promotions for the DVD release {{occurred}} {{across the}} United States. The Empire State Building was illuminated yellow, {{the first time}} the building <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> used as part of a film promotion. In the United Kingdom, Fox launched a £5 million advertising campaign. They also signed a £1.6 million deal with the yogurt company Yoplait, to produce a The Simpsons Movie design for their brand Frubes. In its first week it topped the U.S. DVD chart, and generated $11.8 million in rental revenue.|$|E
5|$|The current bridge along Grand Avenue {{over the}} Colorado River and I-70 {{just east of}} the highway's western {{terminus}} dates to 1953. It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then has added a second lane in either direction. By the early 21st century it, like the Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> expected to and was in poor structural condition.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E

5|$|Burnley used 23 {{different}} players {{during the}} season and had nine different goalscorers. Their top scorer was Scottish forward Joe Anderson, with 31competitive goals, including 25 in the league. Eight new players were signed by Burnley {{during the course of}} the season, and nine were released. Match attendances were the highest they <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> at Turf Moor, with an average gate of over 30,000. The highest attendance of the campaign was a crowd of 42,653, who saw Burnley beat Bolton Wanderers 3–1 on 26February 1921; the lowest was 22,000, for the match against Sunderland on the final day of the season.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, foreign work (such as the Bosporus Bridge in Turkey, {{completed}} 1974) was accelerating while domestic {{orders were}} receding, {{according to the}} company's annual report of 1975. By 1980, foreign work {{accounted for more than}} 50% of Hochtief's business. A major factor was the contract for King Abdulaziz International Airport (completed 1981), the largest airport in Saudi Arabia, and the most valuable contract Hochtief <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> involved with. The architecture of the airport is highly rated aesthetically, and it has several unusual features, including Terminal Three, used only during the Hajj, reserved for pilgrims travelling to Mecca. It has a tent-shaped fibreglass roof, contains a mosque, can accommodate 80,000 travellers at once, and {{is believed to be the}} largest terminal in the world.|$|E
5|$|For the 2006–07 season, Danny Wilson was {{appointed}} the new manager, Wilson had previously managed Humphreys at Sheffield Wednesday. On 22 August 2006, Humphreys was dropped for Hartlepool's match against Hereford United. After making 230 consecutive appearances, {{this was the}} first time Humphreys had not played since October 2001. Shortly after that match, Humphreys joined Port Vale on a month's loan. This was the third time that Danny Wilson had loaned Humphreys out during his career, the only times Humphreys <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> loaned out. Port Vale tried to extend Humphreys' loan deal by at least another month, but Hartlepool refused and Humphreys returned. Humphreys later stated that he had no intentions of leaving Hartlepool.|$|E

5|$|However, {{contemporary}} {{records show}} that his grandfather, Lafayette Waterbury, was a veterinarian, not a rancher, and was not wealthy. Hubbard was actually raised in a townhouse {{in the center of}} Helena. According to his aunt, his family did not own a ranch but did own one cow and four or five horses on a few acres of land outside the city. Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation. While some sources support Scientology's claim of Hubbard's blood brotherhood, other sources say that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence has been found that he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a Blackfeet blood brother.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy {{staged a}} strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President Hubert Humphrey ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were {{both from the}} {{neighboring}} state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, {{which resulted in a}} strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> to that point in his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of the year 1799, a {{translation}} of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.|$|E

5|$|Maurice Binder {{was hired}} to design the title sequence, and was {{involved}} in a dispute with Eon Production to have his name credited in the film. As Thunderball was the first James Bond film shot in Panavision, Binder had to reshoot the iconic gun barrel scene which permitted him to not only incorporate pinhole photographic techniques to shoot inside a genuine gun barrel, but also made Connery appearing in the sequence {{for the first time a}} reality, as stunt man Bob Simmons had doubled for him in the three previous films. Binder gained access to the tank at Pinewood which he used to film the silhouetted title girls who appeared naked in the opening sequence, which was the first time actual nudity (although concealed) <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> seen in a Bond film.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation in human history — more men, tanks, guns and aircraft were committed than <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> deployed before in a single offensive. The invasion opened up the Eastern Front of World War II, the largest theater of war during that conflict, and it witnessed clashes of unprecedented violence and destruction for four years {{that resulted in the}} deaths of more than 26 million Soviet people. More people died fighting on the Eastern Front than in all other fighting across the globe during World War II. Damage to both the economy and landscape was enormous for the Soviet Union as approximately 1,710 towns and 70,000 villages were razed.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, {{comprised}} the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, the 1st(Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers and the 1st(Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery. The airlanding anti-tank battery were {{equipped with the}} 1st Para Brigade's only anti-tank guns, the British 6pounder. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, {{the only way to}} transport the anti-tank guns and the jeeps required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider. Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> flown into combat.|$|E

5|$|The chapel {{underwent}} a two-year, $10 million restoration between 2000 and 2002. Despite {{the complexity of}} the work, the chapel remained open throughout the restoration. The project earned a New Jersey Historic Preservation Award in 2002, and the stone work won the 2004 Tucker Award for Renovation and Restoration from Stone World magazine. At the time, two experts working on the stained glass restoration called it the largest such project that <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> undertaken in the United States; too large for a single studio, it was divided among studios in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York.|$|E
5|$|The rock {{supposedly}} {{found in}} the lake, said to be taken from the Park's garden wall, has been challenged as evidence in multiple places. Both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it, and he claimed {{that if he had}} found it, he would have placed it back. Professor Kenneth Pye, a defense witness, said that {{there was no evidence that}} the rock <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> on the lake bed at all. The article in the Sunday Herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still denying that he ever found it.|$|E
5|$|To {{film the}} final scene at Westminster, the area from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall up to Parliament and Big Ben had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5am. This {{was the first time}} the security-sensitive area (home to 10 Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence) <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> closed to {{accommodate}} filming. Prime Minister (at the time of filming) Tony Blair's son, Euan, worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from MP David Davis due to the film's content. However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal, stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies.|$|E
