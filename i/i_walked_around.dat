2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> with a big smile on my face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E

Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E

60|$|Early {{the next}} morning <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> to a pier where I had noticed a good-sized yacht was moored. It was still there; {{apparently}} no one had left the island.

I found the lady who had called herself a Person and the one of whom I did not like to think as an Interpolation sitting together upon the piazza. I joined them.|$|E

60|$|I {{found the}} {{quilting}} party at supper. I {{could see them}} through the open windows of the large living-room, and I heard their chatter and laughing when I was still a considerable distance from the house. With my mind quivering with the emotions excited by {{what had happened in}} the woods, it was impossible for me to join a party like this. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> the barn and into a little orchard, where, between two gnarled apple-trees, there hung an old hammock, into which I threw myself.|$|E

Riding her once, Pincay chose to {{continue}} riding her. He said, “Normally, I am not a superstitious man, but <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> these days hoping nothing happens to her.

60|$|The {{appearance}} of the house amazed me. All the shutters were closed and the door locked. I knocked and knocked, {{but there was no}} answer. Then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> the house to the only window that hadn't shutters--a tiny one upstairs. I knew it was the window in the closet off the room where the girls slept. I stopped under it and called Prissy. Before long Prissy came and opened it. She was so pale and woe-begone looking that I pitied her with all my heart.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went into}} the yard to get Orso. He was lying down when I {{approached}} him, but I think he knew from my general appearance that I was prepared to take the road, and he {{rose to his feet}} as much as to say, [...] "I am ready." [...] I unfastened the chain from the post, and, with the best of wishes for good-luck from John, who now seemed to be very well satisfied with me, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> the side of the house, the bear following as submissively {{as if he had been}} used to my leadership all his life.|$|E

40|$|Some {{years ago}} {{my wife and}} I used to visit Acapulco in Mexico in the winter.

60|$|With a vague uneasiness I {{turned away}} from the contemplation of those walls. The {{companion}} mansions were closed, their blinds tightly drawn; the neighbourhood was as quiet as the country, save for a slight but persistent noise that impressed itself on my consciousness. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> the house to spy in the back yard; a young girl rather stealthily gathering laths, and fragments of joists and flooring, and loading them into a child's express-wagon. She started when she saw me. She was little, more than a child, and the loose calico dress she wore seemed to emphasize her thinness. She stood stock-still, staring at me with frightened yet defiant eyes. I, too, felt a strange timidity in her presence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> the sumptuously {{furnished}} chamber, {{looking at}} the pictures and bric-à-brac; I wondered that {{the master of the}} house was willing to put me in a room like this--I had expected a hall bed-room, at the best; I sat down by an open window, for it was very early yet and I {{did not want to go}} to bed, but I had scarcely seated myself when I heard a tap at the door. I could not have explained it, but this tap made me jump, and I went to the door and opened it instead of calling out. There stood the butler, with a tray in his hand on which was a decanter of wine, biscuits, cheese, and some cigars.|$|E
6000|$|I stopped, {{for there}} was a sudden stillness. The storm had passed; and, perhaps in sympathy with nature's silence, my heart seemed to cease to beat. But this was only momentarily; for {{suddenly}} the moonlight broke through the clouds, showing me that I was in a graveyard, and that the square object before me was a great massive tomb of marble, as white as the snow that lay on and all around it. With the moonlight there came a fierce sigh of the storm, which appeared to resume its course with a long, low howl, as of many dogs or wolves. I was awed and shocked, and felt the cold perceptibly grow upon me till it seemed to grip me by the heart. Then while the flood of moonlight still fell on the marble tomb, the storm gave further evidence of renewing, as though it was returning on its track. Impelled by some sort of fascination, I approached the sepulchre to see what it was, and why such a thing stood alone in such a place. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> it, and read, over the Doric door, in German: ...|$|E

[...] Martinez, who typically attended classes wearing only sandals and a backpack, became a cause célèbre at the university for a while, participating in a number of nude events on campus and performances by the Bay Area nude performance group the X-Plicit Players. He appeared on national talk shows, was profiled in a photo essay in Playgirl and was parodied in the 1994 college comedy PCU. As a response to [...] Martinez's actions, UC Berkeley issued its [...] "Policy Statement Concerning Public Nudity and Sexually Offensive Conduct" [...] banning public nudity on December 7, 1992.|$|R
