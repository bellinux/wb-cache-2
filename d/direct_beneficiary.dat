25|$|On 22 January 1808, {{the ship}} {{of the prince}} regent and two others arrived in Baía de Todos os Santos, Brazil. The streets of Salvador were deserted, because the governor, the Count of Ponte, {{preferred}} to await the prince's orders before permitting the people to receive him. Finding this attitude odd, John ordered that all could come as they wished. However, to allow the nobility to compose themselves after such an arduous journey, the landing was postponed until the next day, when they were received joyfully amidst a procession, the ringing of bells and a celebration of a Te Deum at the Cathedral of Salvador. In the following days, the prince received all who wished to give homage, granting the ceremony of the beija-mão (the kissing of the monarch's hand) and conceding various mercies. Among the latter, he decreed {{the creation of a}} public lecture series on economics and a school of surgery, but his most decisive action at this moment was the Decree of Opening the Ports to Friendly Nations (Decreto de Abertura dos Portos às Nações Amigas), a measure of vast political and economic importance and the first of many that went to improve conditions in the colony. Britain, however, whose economy depended in great part on maritime commerce, and for whom the Portuguese and Brazilian monarchy was now something of a protectorate, was the most <b>direct</b> <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|E

The Critic was a {{short-lived}} animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman. For the second season of The Critic, Brooks {{cut a deal with}} the Fox network to have the series switch over. The episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] was pitched by Brooks, who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox, and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would {{be a good way to}} introduce Sherman. In addition, Jean and Reiss returned to produce two episodes ("A Star is Burns" [...] and [...] "'Round Springfield") with the staff of The Critic, to relieve some of the stress on The Simpsons writing staff. Groening felt that the crossover was a thirty-minute advertisement for another show and blamed Brooks, calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows. After unsuccessful attempts to get the episode pulled, he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired and had his name removed from the credits. In response, Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al [...] and Mike [...] were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the socio-economical impacts of the payment for environmental services (PES) program in forest plantation in northern Costa Rica. The research methodology was based on a standard of principles, criteria and indicators (PC&I) in order to characterize the socioeconomic impacts of the program. The standard was the key factor for developing a semi-structured interview, with which the field information was collected. This information was afterwards analyzed quantitatively and statistically to identify the socio-economical impacts on each one of the beneficiaries. The study demonstrated that the PES program did not contribute to increase the economic welfare of the <b>direct</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> questioning therefore the sustainability of the mechanism over time. Nevertheless, the study showed that the PES program improved the economic welfare of the indirect beneficiaries and related institutions, strengthening the relationships of the <b>direct</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> with financial institutions and forestry sector. Also, the program improved the perception of beneficiaries regarding the sustainable use of natural resources. In conclusion, the mechanism had positive impacts on indirect beneficiaries and related institutions, although it did not improve the socio-economic conditions of the <b>direct</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> because the forest plantations had to compete with other activities such as agriculture and livestock.

40|$|Many public {{programs}} and operations by multilateral organisations include {{technical assistance to}} the <b>direct</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> {{of the program in}} addition to pure financing. However, there is no substantial body of studies that calculates the additional impact; in the sense of exclusively attributable to, of technical assistance on the outcome of interest of the program.

We illustrate the technique for two potable water and sewerage programs where the <b>direct</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are local governments, although the method is applicable for different types of {{programs and}} beneficiaries. The impact calculations reveal that technical assistance does matter as it has an impact over and above that of only financing.

5000|$|This {{represents}} a disadvantage for the selling party, which must wait to receive its money {{after it has}} {{lost control of the}} company. It is also dependent, if an earn-out is used, on the returned profits being increased significantly following the acquisition, in order for the deal to represent a gain to the seller in comparison to the situation pre-sale.

The optimum structure would be to convert the earn-out to contracted deferred consideration which has compelling benefits for the seller as it legally fixes the total future amount paid to them. It's paid like a quarterly annuity, and then the seller needs to secure the annuity by taking out a deferred consideration surety guarantee from an independent surety institution. The <b>direct</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the surety is the seller and should the sold firm become insolvent, following its sale, with any outstanding deferred payments due the seller, then the surety will pay the money to the vendor on the purchaser's behalf.|$|E

This differential treatment arose from Iowa's adoption of the definition of [...] "net income" [...] used by the Internal Revenue Service. For federal income tax purposes, dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation. The Iowa Supreme Court rejected a Commerce Clause claim because Kraft failed to show [...] "that Iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to Iowa's taxing scheme." [...] Considering an Equal Protection Clause challenge, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the use of the federal government's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was [...] "rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency". The Supreme Court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce.
