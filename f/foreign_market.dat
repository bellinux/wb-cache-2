Nevertheless, the film played at both King Cinema in Rangoon, Burma and Tai Khoon Theatre in Sandakan, Malaysia, in 1958. The film did help Daiei achieve some success in the genre. It was passed for release, anglicized as Warning from Space, by the BBFC in the United Kingdom in 1957, {{and later in the}} United States in 1963. The film was also released as The Mysterious Satellite in some areas. It was shown in the U.S. by American International Television later in the 1960s as Warning From Space.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden was Team Ninja's first action title. Its initial concept {{had nothing}} in common with the {{original}} Ninja Gaiden series that was released for the NES. However, for retail reasons Tecmo wanted to retain a link with the previous games, which had many adherents in the West, so Itagaki was asked to rethink his ideas to target the <b>foreign</b> <b>market.</b> Analysing the earlier games, he concluded that their violence appealed to players, and included gory content, such as beheadings, in the Xbox game to retain that spirit. He also aimed to make his new game hard but alluring; it would challenge players on their reflexes rather than on their memories of layouts and timings. His team made a point of designing smoothly-flowing gameplay with high-quality animations that reacted quickly to the player's input. Itagaki paid homage to the earlier Ninja Gaiden series by including updated versions of foes and special attacks. Team Ninja based their 3D computer models, from the pistols of the henchman upwards, on real world material. Character models were taken from studies of human anatomy, and the team hired martial artists in order to digitally capture their movement. Rather than import the motion captures directly into the game, however, the animators used them as templates to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated movements. Itagaki found it more interesting to design nonhuman creatures than human enemies.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the dra of the method for quantifi cation of the factors, which {{determine}} the success of the SMEs in <b>foreign</b> <b>markets.</b> In the proposed method the ultidimensional assessment of indicators of success of SMEs in <b>foreign</b> <b>markets</b> are used, ie. not only the proportion of sales from exports is observed, but also the profi tability of international activities in an absolute and in a relative rate. Other indicators of success are the satisfaction of the company management with international activities and the success of achieving defi ned targets for business activities in <b>foreign</b> <b>markets.</b> Evaluation is made up of both the objective and the subjective indicators of success. Among the objective indicators of success is included the intensity of international activities of SMEs, which is detected as the sum of revenues generated from international activities in relation to total sales company, the profi tability of international activities, (ie. whether the foreign activities are profi table or not), and the relative profi tability of international activities, where it is ascertained whether the foreign activities generate higher profi t than the activities at the domestic market. The next subjective indicator of success is the success of objectives – it was found how many objectives related to operations in <b>foreign</b> <b>markets</b> has been achieved. Another indicator is the subjective satisfaction of the company management with existing activities on <b>foreign</b> <b>markets.</b> Overall performance on <b>foreign</b> <b>markets</b> of the company is quantifi ed using an assessment of objective and subjective indicators of success. Using the defi ned evaluation {{it will be possible to}} determine which of the SMEs are more and which are less successful in <b>foreign</b> <b>markets.</b> Finally, this evaluation model is used for the research aimed at identifying characteristics aff ecting the success of dairy SMEs in the <b>foreign</b> <b>markets.</b> ...|$|R

Although Italy is the strongest <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> for the chick lit sold by single-title imprint Red Dress Ink, in that country romance readers do not care to read books about cowboys, as this type of occupation was not common in their culture. The paranormal romance genre is not popular {{in countries such as}} Poland and Russia, although historical romance tends to be very successful. Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe, where romances that feature babies are very popular. German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels, and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories. The alternate scenario also occurs, as other German translators censor the love scenes.|$|E
25|$|China's chief {{interest}} {{in the region of}} the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade has been a very significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China. Chinese merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan – where the Mekong River, previously used for illegal migration, flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control – the region was the last stronghold of anti-communist forces. It has for years sought a <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.|$|E
25|$|The {{total market}} {{worldwide}} for high-tech toilets was about US$800 million in 1997. The largest producer is Toto, with 65% {{of the market}} share, while the second largest is Inax at 25%. The main market for washlets is still in Japan, and TOTO reports that overseas sales account for just 5% of its revenue. The primary <b>foreign</b> <b>market</b> is China, where Toto sells over one million washlets each year. In the US for example, sales are well below Japanese levels, even though sales improved from 600 units per month in 2001 to 1,000 units per month in 2003. In Europe, Toto sells only 5,000 washlets annually. While most Europeans would probably regard Japanese washlets as quite a curiosity, {{the number of such}} toilets being installed in Europe is on the rise. This is mainly for the special purpose of toilets for the handicapped. Depending on the type of disability, handicapped persons may have difficulties reaching the anus region in order to clean themselves after toilet use. Hence, the introduction of toilets with a water jet cleaner and blow dryer allows such persons to clean themselves without assistance.|$|E

We show that firms enter additional export markets only gradually - on average one market in two years. Second, we demonstrate that, on average, exporting firms are not always more productive than firms supplying only domestic market. Also, we confirm a conjecture that higher productivity level is required for firms starting to export to advanced countries as opposed to starting to export to developing countries. Finally, we observe that firms can gain significant productivity improvements when serving <b>foreign</b> <b>markets.</b> Significant productivity improvements occur only when serving advanced, high-wage <b>foreign</b> <b>markets.</b> In a small open country, exporting per se does not warranty such effects...|$|R
