25|$|At Lee's sentencing, as {{required}} by Utah Territory statute, {{he was given the}} option of being <b>hanged,</b> <b>shot,</b> or beheaded, and he chose to be shot. In 1877, before being executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 23, 1877, Lee professed that he was a scapegoat for others involved. Brigham Young stated that Lee's fate was just, but not a sufficient blood atonement, given the enormity of the crime.|$|R
5000|$|The American Civil Liberties Union {{reported}} {{that by the}} end of 1940, [...] "more than 1,500 Witnesses in the United States had been victimized in 335 separate attacks". Such attacks included beatings, being tarred and feathered, <b>hanged,</b> <b>shot,</b> maimed, and even castrated, as well as other acts of violence. As reports of these attacks against Jehovah's Witnesses continued, [...] "several justices changed their minds, and in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the Court declared that the state could not impinge on the First Amendment by compelling the observance of rituals." ...|$|R
50|$|A no-win situation, {{also called}} a “lose-lose situation”, {{is one where}} a person has choices, but no choice leads to a net gain. For example, if an executioner offers the {{condemned}} the choice of death by being <b>hanged,</b> <b>shot,</b> or poisoned, all choices lead to death; the condemned is in a no-win situation. This bleak situation gives the chooser no room: whichever choice is made the person making it will lose their life. Less drastic situations may also be considered no-win situations - if one has a choice for lunch between a ham sandwich and a roast beef sandwich, but is a vegetarian or has a wheat allergy, that might also be considered a no-win situation.|$|R

50|$|Skoblin was a cavalry {{officer in}} the Kornilov Division of the White Russian Army during the Russian Civil War, 1918-1920. He was known for both bravery and cruelty. Red Army {{soldiers}} captured by Skoblin's men were <b>hanged</b> or <b>shot</b> on the spot. It is said he met his wife, Nadezhda Plevitskaya, during the war. The romantic version is that Skoblin captured her during a raid against the Red Army. Plevitskaya was a committed Bolshevik {{considered to be a}} great beauty, who had been traveling the front singing and entertaining Red Army troops.|$|R
5000|$|He lived there, chiefly {{employed}} in chemical work, until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, {{when he was}} pardoned and returned to Hungary. [...] The surrender, and particularly {{the fact that his}} life was spared while his generals and many of his officers and men were <b>hanged</b> or <b>shot,</b> led to his being accused of treason by public opinion. The main cause of these accusations was the letter written by Kossuth, already in exile, from Vidin in 12 September 1849, declaring unfairly that Görgei betrayed Hungary and its nation, when he put his weapons down.|$|R
5000|$|In his palace, the Emperor gives battle {{orders and}} {{monitors}} {{the progress of}} the universal war.

Fearful that his power will not endure without death, the Emperor announces that he has decided to reward his subjects with the gift of eternal life. More honestly, he asks: [...] "Death, where is thy sting? Where is thy victory, Hell?" ...|$|R
5|$|Six years later, in 1919, {{the city}} {{was caught up in}} the Red Summer riots when {{thousands}} of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1,000,000 damage. They <b>hanged</b> and <b>shot</b> Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the black community in North Omaha.|$|R
50|$|In later centuries, Russian Tsars would {{declare a}} state of {{emergency}} and use death squad tactics in order to suppress domestic uprisings like Pugachev's Rebellion and the Russian Revolution of 1905. During the latter, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia ordered the Imperial Russian Army to ally itself with the Black Hundreds, an ultra-nationalist paramilitary group. Those captured in arms against the Tsar's forces were tried by military tribunals before being <b>hanged</b> or <b>shot.</b> According to Simon Sebag Montefiore, being caught wearing similar clothing to Anti-Tsarist militias was often enough for court martial followed by execution. These tactics were continued by the anti-communist White Movement during the Russian Civil War (1917-1920).|$|R
50|$|While {{the number}} of executions had dropped by 1980, {{after the start of}} the Iran-Iraq War a {{crackdown}} on dissidents, political opponents, and common criminals was responsible for another increase in executions. From 1981-1984, (after Mujahedeen-e-Khalq bombings killing many government officials) a crackdown against opponents and terrorist groups such as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq organization resulted in the execution of hundreds if not thousands of people, many who were simply low level members, sympathizers, and even some innocent people. As many as 2,000-8,000 people were shot for political reasons during this time, possibly more. Many others were <b>hanged</b> or <b>shot</b> for other crimes such as adultery, robbery, murder, and drug trafficking.|$|R
2500|$|The {{conditions}} {{imposed by}} Zarrouk were pitiless. [...] The {{leaders of the}} revolt were <b>hanged</b> or <b>shot.</b> [...] Notables were imprisoned and tortured to make them reveal the names of ringleaders. Even women and old men were tortured. Hundreds of sheikhs suspected of disloyalty were chained together by the ankle. [...] Soldiers who had abandoned their posts were interned and sent back to Tunis, where they were treated as prisoners of war. Religious leaders were dismissed. The zouaoua and those tribes which had remained loyal, or returned to loyalty early enough, laid waste to the countryside and subjected it to a reign of terror. To consolidate his authority, Zarrouk was made caïd of Sousse and Monastir.|$|R
50|$|In January 1912, the lynching of a {{black woman}} and three black men in Hamilton {{attracted}} national attention from the press and widespread outrage. Dusky Crutchfield, Eugene Harrington, Burrell Hardaway, and Johnie Moore had been held for questioning {{in the death of}} a white landowner. They were later shown to have been utterly innocent. They had never even been arrested. A mob of white men took them outside town, <b>hanged</b> and <b>shot</b> them. While many white families tried to build walls of silence around the murders, the effects of these crimes were long-lasting. Coverage by local white newspapers at the time suggested the four were guilty. The Montgomery Advertiser did not even report their names correctly.|$|R

5000|$|The {{immediate}} {{consequence of}} Bloody Sunday was a strike movement that {{spread throughout the}} country. Strikes began to erupt outside of St. Petersburg {{in places such as}} Moscow, Riga, Warsaw, Vilna, Kovno, Tiflis, Baku, Batum, and the Baltic region. In all, about 414,000 people participated in the work stoppage during January 1905. [...] Tsar Nicholas II attempted to appease the people with a Duma; however, the autocracy eventually resorted to brute force near the end of 1905 in order to curtail the burgeoning strike movement that continued to spread. It is estimated that between October 1905 and April 1906, 15,000 peasants and workers were <b>hanged</b> or <b>shot,</b> 20,000 injured, and 45,000 sent into exile.|$|R

5000|$|On March 24, the San Francisco, California, {{newspaper}} the Call {{noted that}} Joe King’s crime {{was to say}} that Stockton should have been murdered even earlier.

The next day, the New York Times reported that Joe King and Moses Jones had been <b>hanged</b> or <b>shot,</b> and a third man had been found near them in the Red River bottoms between New Boston and Rocky Comfort, stripped totally naked. According to the Times, a {{justice of the peace}} had held an inquest to look into these deaths and proclaimed that the victims had died “by natural causes or were frozen to death.

50|$|During {{the state}} of {{emergency}} in World War II, increased IRA activity led to six executions.
