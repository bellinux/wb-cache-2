5|$|The early Church Fathers {{believed}} {{there was only one}} Jewish–Christian gospel, perhaps in different versions; however, scholars have long recognized the possibility there were at least two or three. Jerome's references to a <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Hebrews, or variants of that name, are particularly problematic because it is unclear which gospel he is referring to as the source of his quotations. Hegesippus, Eusebius, and Jerome all used an Aramaic gospel, which Jerome referred to as the gospel used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes. <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe the fragments of quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic gospel that was based on traditions similar to the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Matthew. A third gospel was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis, which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites. Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek gospel harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Ebionites. The existence of three independent Jewish–Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus. However, that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of the gospel known to the Nazarenes and its relationship to the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Hebrews. The relationship between the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Hebrews and the other Jewish–Christian gospels, as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel, is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Ebionites, the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Hebrews, and the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Nazarenes remains unclear. All the Jewish–Christian gospels survive only as fragments in quotations, so {{it is difficult to}} tell if they are independent texts or variations of each other. Scholar Albertus Klijn established the modern consensus, concluding that the gospel harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius. Scholar Marie-Émile Boismard has claimed the Ebionite gospel is partly dependent upon a hypothetical Hebrew gospel as a source; however this conjecture remains a minority view. Its putative relationship to the gospel text known to Origen as the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve remains a subject of scholarly debate.|$|E

According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Thomas, the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Mary, and the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Philip.|$|E

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Mark and the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|The Ebionite gospel is {{one example}} of a type of gospel harmony that used the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Matthew as a base text but did not include the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E

Some scholars explain the apparent disparity as an error {{on the part of the}} author of the <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Luke, concluding that he was more concerned with creating a symbolic narrative than a historical account, and was either unaware of, or indifferent to, the chronological difficulty.|$|E
