25|$|The first {{substantial}} Jewish {{population in}} England arrived after the Norman Conquest, reportedly migrating from Rouen in Normandy. By the mid-12th century, there were Jewish communities {{in most of}} England's major cities. Although there were violent anti-Jewish massacres and riots in several cities, Jews were theoretically {{under the protection of}} the Crown because of the their financial importance. However, in 1275, King Edward <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Statute of Jewry, which compelled Jews to be identified by a yellow badge and outlawed usury, the lending of money for interest, which was the main source of income for many Jewish families. Following increasing state persecution and attempts to force conversion to Christianity, Edward finally expelled all Jews from England in 1290.|$|E
25|$|Markets and fairs were a {{key element}} in the town's economy in medieval times. The Market Square came to {{prominence}} in 1235 when Henry III ordered that the selling of goods in the churchyard of All Saint's should be relocated to the Market Square. Street names in the town give an indication of trades and market centres; Corn Hill, Malt Hill, Mercer Row, Gold Street, Sheep Street and Horse Market. Cloth and wool were very important but these industries declined. In the 13th century, Northampton had a large Jewish population centred on Gold Street. In 1277two years after Edward <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Statute of the Jewrysome Jewish residents were executed while the remainder were driven out of town. Archaeological sites include a medieval Jewish cemetery and the Northampton Medieval Synagogue.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> test." ...|$|E

"You will excuse me," [...] {{said the}} gentleman contemptuously, [...] "if I am {{too much in}} advance of common {{humanity}} to trouble myself at all about it. <b>I</b> have <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> night--as indeed <b>I</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> whole of my time now--in spiritual intercourse." ...|$|R

2500|$|The book {{consumed}} Naipaul. [...] In 1983, he wrote:The book {{took three}} years to write. [...] It felt like a career; {{and there was a}} short period, {{towards the end of the}} writing, when I do believe I knew all or much of the book by heart. [...] The labour ended; the book began to recede. [...] And I found that I was unwilling to re-enter the world I had created, unwilling to expose myself again to the emotions that lay below the comedy. [...] I became nervous of the book. [...] I haven't read it since <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> proofs in May 1961.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of Wallace's fondness for the colour pink. Shortly after being elected, while {{referring}} to Mary Mitchell O'Connor in Dáil Éireann, he said [...] "Miss Piggy has toned it down a bit today". He accepted full responsibility and later apologised, saying [...] "It was my fault. <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> reference because of her handbag. I'm completely out of order. I don't have a leg to stand on [...] Clearly it was in bad taste." [...] He called Mitchell O'Connor to apologise and said he would write a letter of apology to her as well. In reference to his fondness for pink, Wallace dyed his hair that colour to raise awareness of cancer in February 2015. Since being elected to the Dáil {{together for the first time}} in 2011, Wallace and Dublin North TD Clare Daly have become friends and political allies, and have worked together on many campaigns, including opposition to austerity and revelations of various alleged Garda malpractices, including harassment, cancellation of penalty points in questionable circumstances and involvement of officers in the drug trade. In July 2014 they were both arrested at Shannon Airport while trying to inspect a military aircraft. Wallace said, [...] "All we wanted to do was confirm whether we are being told the truth." [...] Wallace was fined €2,000 for being in an airside area without permission, and chose not to pay. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison in default, and in December 2015 was arrested for non-payment of the fine.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> great {{tree that}} stands up like an obelisk {{in the midst}} of the plain beyond the deserted Matabele village. <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> low clumps of dry karroo-bushes by the rocky kopje. <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> fork of the rubbly roads where I had parted from Hilda. At last, I reached the long, rolling ridge which looks down upon Klaas's, and could see in the slant {{sunlight}} the mud farmhouse and the corrugated iron roof where the oxen were stabled.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> dark {{window of}} the spare room, trying the leaden roof at each step with my foot before I risked resting my weight on it. <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> dark windows of Laura's room ("God bless her and keep her to-night!"). <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> dark window of Sir Percival's room. Then I waited a moment, knelt down with my hands to support me, and so crept to my position, under the {{protection}} of the low wall between the bottom of the lighted window and the verandah roof.|$|E
