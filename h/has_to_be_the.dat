5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> proudest day of our lives. And for {{people all over the}} world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, {{there was a girl}} who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

Moreover, {{the dimension of}} the considered phase spaces can be different, {{but the number of}} the considered states <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same for all the sub-systems. Joint recurrence plots can be used in order to detect phase synchronisation.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{constraint}} in Tagalog on {{the position}} {{from which a}} noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> subject within the relative clause in order {{for it to be}} relativised. The phrases in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} Perso-Arabic inflow, English {{became the}} current foreign source of new vocabulary. English had and {{continues}} to have a considerable influence over Indian languages. Loanwords include new innovations and concepts, first introduced directly through British colonialism, and then streaming in {{on the basis of}} continued English language dominance in the post-colonial period. Besides the category of new ideas is the category of English words that already have Gujarati counterparts which end up replaced or existed alongside with. The major driving force behind this latter category <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> continuing role of English in modern India as a language of education, prestige, and mobility. In this way, Indian speech can be sprinkled with English words and expressions, even switches to whole sentences. See Hinglish, Code-switching.|$|E
25|$|The {{net sounder}} is an echo sounder with a {{transducer}} {{mounted on the}} headline of the net {{rather than on the}} bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.|$|E

Birchwood Park <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> main technical business park in the North West. The Bank of England MPC's Agency for the North West is on Birchwood Park near the HQ of GB Oils, the UK's leading fuel oil supplier (owned by DCC), and the operator of Gulf Oil petrol stations in the UK. Electricity North West (the North West's distribution network operator) is near by, with ESR Technology, who did work for the Philae space probe and owns the National Centre of Tribology at Whittle House in Risley, with TalkTalk Business to the west, near International Nuclear Services and Sellafield Ltd at Hinton House. Terberg Matec UK (Dutch) supply lifts for bin wagons next to M62 junction 11. Also west of the park is Nuvia UK (part of Soletanche Freyssinet). Betfred (having the largest turnover in the region—£13.3bn) is at {{the western end of}} Birchwood itself, next to the M6 and Birchwood railway station. Birchwood was built on the former ROF Risley.|$|E

500|$|The dissent argued that, for {{a section}} 1983 {{claim to be}} valid, [...] "harm alone is not enough; it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> right kind of harm."

This would obviously violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.|$|E

500|$|Doppelgänger {{is given}} a rating of two-and-a-half stars out of five in a {{negative}} review published on the Film4 website, which praises the effects work and costume design but criticises the scenes with the character of Dr Hassler for their irrelevance to the main plot, and the subtext of the Rosses' troubled marriage as an unnecessary diversion from the narrative. Although Ross and Kane's mission through space {{is described as a}} [...] "brief, trippy light show", the review questions the originality of having a parallel Earth as the focus, and the depth of the script's vision: [...] "Anderson's <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> cheapest alternate Earth ever. Whereas audiences might expect a world where the Roman Empire never fell or the Nazis won World War II, here the shocking discovery is that people write backwards. That's it."

500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of."

Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in what <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving {{an example of how}} he was perceived by the media.|$|E
500|$|With {{the changes}} to the show, Moffat wanted to reassure the {{audience}} that [...] "nothing has really been lost" [...] {{and it was the}} same show and the same character of the Doctor.

Moffat wanted to make sure the show appealed to even young children; if they could not follow the plot, there would be [...] "big pictures" [...] to entertain them. Moffat believed that Doctor Who was fundamentally for children but it was something everybody loved, comparing it to Star Wars and Toy Story. He considered the [...] "most popular form of entertainment" [...] to be a children's story. Of the series, he said they [...] "pushed the fairytale side of it" [...] as Doctor Who [...] "now <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most fantastical of the fantasy shows" [...] to be more vibrant and [...] "bonkers" [...] than any other fantastical show.|$|E
