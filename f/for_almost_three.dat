5|$|After an {{agreement}} with Great Britain, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes. The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. The most widely known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888. The German settlers called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The Germans ruled Nauru <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> decades. Robert Rasch, a German trader who married a Nauruan woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death during one of the system's test runs.|$|E

She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street.

As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 308, Maxentius {{allowed the}} Christians to hold another {{election}} for the city's bishop, which Eusebius won. Eusebius was a moderate, however, in a still-divided church. Heraclius, {{head of the}} rigorist faction, opposed readmission of the lapsed. Rioting followed, and Maxentius exiled the combative pair from the city, leaving Eusebius to die in Sicily on October 21. The office was vacant <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> years, until Maxentius permitted another election. Miltiades was elected on July 2, 311, as Maxentius prepared to face Constantine in battle. Maxentius, facing increasingly strong domestic opposition to his rule, now agreed to the restitution of Christian property. Miltiades sent two deacons with letters from Maxentius to the prefect of Rome, {{the head of the}} city, responsible for publishing imperial edicts within the city, to ensure compliance. African Christians were still recovering lost property as late as 312.|$|E

While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Acre, Edward's {{international}} role changed {{from that of a}} diplomat to an antagonist. He had long been deeply involved in the affairs of his own Duchy of Gascony. In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates Otto de Grandson and the chancellor Robert Burnell, which caused the replacement of the seneschal Luke de Tany. In 1286, Edward visited the region himself and stayed <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> years. The perennial problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal. On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, Philip IV, but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors (that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of La Rochelle).|$|E

In March 2007, he finally returned to the team in its 3–1 win over Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne appearing as a substitute. During the season, Diarra complained twice with regards to playing time, which led to Houllier equivocally questioning Diarra's ego. The feud culminated on 6 April when Houllier dropped Diarra from the squad to face Valenciennes the following day and then ordered him {{to play for the}} club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. Diarra refused the orders and Houllier responded by reportedly threatening not to play him {{for the rest of the}} season. The Lyon manager later stated the Diarra should issue an apology to him and the team. The defensive midfielder did not budge and, subsequently, missed the team's next four league matches, as well as the 2007 Coupe de la Ligue Final. Diarra returned to the team on 28 April playing the entire match in a 3–1 win over Le Mans. He repeated this feat in three of the team's last five matches as Lyon were crowned champions for the sixth consecutive season. Included in one of those three matches was Diarra's first league goal for the club, which came in a 3–0 victory over his former club Lens.|$|E

5|$|Katia tracked west-northwestward {{for several}} days, steered by an {{expansive}} mid-level ridge to the cyclone's north. The strong upper-level winds that were affecting the cyclone gradually slackened, {{allowing for the}} expansion of a central dense overcast, the formation of a large curved band in the southern semicircle, and development of a banding eye on microwave imagery. Satellite intensity estimates increased accordingly, prompting the NHC to upgrade Katia to hurricane intensity at 00:00UTC on September1, while the storm was situated about 1,350miles (2,175km) east of the Leeward Islands. Although conditions were forecast to remain conducive for further intensification, water vapor satellite and microwave imagery indicated that mid-level dry air began eroding eyewall convection immediately after the storm's upgrade, and upper-level winds eventually became less favorable as Katia approached a sharp upper-level trough. As a result, the storm maintained its status as a minimal hurricane <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> days, with only a partial eyewall or banding-eye feature appearing on satellite.|$|E

5|$|The raids {{continued}} periodically <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> decades, until in 1749 when Spanish {{settlers and}} the Lipan Apache peoples made peace. But the treaty angered {{the enemies of}} the Apache, and resulted in raids on Spanish settlements by the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes.

The threat of attacks did not decrease until 1785, when Spain and the Comanche peoples made a peace agreement. The Comanche tribe later assisted in defeating the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes, who had continued to cause difficulties for settlers. An increase in the number of missions in the province allowed for a peaceful Indian reductions of other tribes, and by the end of the 18th century, only a few of the nomadic hunting and gathering tribes in the area had not been converted.|$|E
