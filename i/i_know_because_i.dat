2500|$|In {{keeping with}} his {{democratic}} ideals, Mackenzie refused {{the offer of}} a knighthood three times, and was thus {{the only one of}} Canada's first eight Prime Ministers not to be knighted. [...] He also declined appointment to the UK Privy Council and hence does not bear the title [...] "Right Honourable". His pride in his working class origins never left him. Once, while touring Fort Henry as prime minister, he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them. The embarrassed escort confessed that he didn't and Mackenzie replied, [...] "I do. It is five feet, ten inches. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> built it myself!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1927, Beban began {{assisting}} aspiring {{actors to}} break into the motion picture business. [...] He described his goal {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times:"There is no agony so poignant as the feeling that one has the spark of genius with no opportunity to satisfy that ambition that goes with it. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have had my own struggles. [...] The stage and screen have been good to me. [...] I have accumulated all the money I need, for a few years at least, and I am going to devote at least a year of my life to helping young men and women of talent who are denied the chance to display it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1991, the {{existence}} of the RAM Plan was leaked by Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Marković and its details were published in the Belgrade weekly Vreme. He says [...] "the line has been clearly established [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> heard Milošević give the order to Karadžić to get in contact with General Uzelac and to order, following the decisions of the meeting of the military hierarchy, that arms should be distributed and that the TO of Krajina and Bosnia be armed and utilized in the realization of the RAM plan.". He accused the JNA of having [...] "placed itself directly in the service of one side" [...] and requested that Yugoslav Defense Minister Veljko Kadijević and Adžić resign, claiming the two were [...] "waging their own war in Croatia" [...] and that they had arranged a secret arms deal with conservative Soviet Union military leaders during their March 1991 visit to Moscow. Marković pressed Kadijević to comment on the RAM plan. The transcript of the tape leaked said: ...|$|E

60|$|This <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{heard their}} voices close to me. They {{seemed to me}} to be very merry fellows, for they laughed heartily as they went. What the joke was I could not understand. Though I speak their {{language}} fairly well I could not hear anything comic in the scraps of their conversation which met my ear.|$|R

6000|$|... "There are cups all right. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> smashed two the {{day before}} yesterday. I'll nip round the corner for some milk, shall I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cold water {{turns to}} fire, and burns [...] <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> fell in A stream, {{which came from}} one bright dame [...] Who drank at Ballyspellin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be a silly flatterer, Fan. She is beautiful, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw her; and I was {{not mistaken}} when I {{knew that her}} beauty would enslave you." ...|$|E
60|$|That was all. He {{had had no}} time to see me at the poop-rail. It {{was merely}} the day's work, the ship's work, the MAN'S work--all capitals, if you please, in MAN. I was the only one aft who <b>knew,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had chanced to see. Had I not been on the poop at that early hour no one aft ever would have known those gray, storm-morning deeds of his.|$|R
60|$|This {{touched my}} heart a little, and brought tears {{out of my}} eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account; {{and this was the}} more strange to me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw near it still, all along {{by the side of the}} rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had seen it grow in Africa when I was ashore there.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} done. People really would not stand it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>because</b> [...] <b>I</b> have tried."--Extract from an {{unpublished}} paper upon George Borrow [...] and his writings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He was not ill, {{as far as}} our {{comprehension}} extended. But he {{had slept}} very little for three nights. This <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw him walking much, and specially {{in the heart of the}} night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, one thing. I saw {{no women}} in their camp, nor any sign of children. This <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> gave orders that such were to be spared and it was {{reported}} {{to me that there}} were none, so I supposed that they had fled away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, mother, I {{have told}} you all of my news; let us hear about {{everyone}} here. How are all the old house hands, and how is Dinah? Tony is at Washington, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw {{in the paper that}} he had made a sudden attack upon Jackson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Congratulate you. I'm glad <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> {{otherwise}} <b>I</b> {{might have}} formed quite a wrong impression when I {{came here and}} found you with money to burn. Quite the old English squire now, Mr. McEachern, what?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{they began}} to feed, walking forward and {{slightly}} to the right as they gathered great bunches of the sweet mealies and thrust them into their mouths. All this time they {{were more than a}} hundred and twenty yards away from me (this <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had paced the distances from the tree to various points), much too far to allow of my attempting a shot at them in that uncertain light. They fed in a semicircle, gradually drawing round towards the hut near my tree, in which the corn was stored and the old woman slept.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the above}} list, not all vessels were steamers: for example Clan Graham, built 1962, {{had a very}} big Diesel engine inside it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> this <b>because</b> <b>I</b> worked on it as a cadet in 1967. (Anon).|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Adam; [...] "I'll {{tell you}} what <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> believe you can keep a still tongue in your head if you like, and I hope you'll not let drop a word till it's common talk, for I've {{particular}} reasons against its being known." ...|$|E
60|$|It is futile {{to advance}} the {{argument}} that glasses are unromantic. They are not. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wear them myself, and I am a singularly romantic figure, whether in my rimless, my Oxford gold-bordered, or the plain gent's spectacles which I wear {{in the privacy of}} my study.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{because of}} poor James and his friends whom he used to bring here. By the way, Colonel Quaritch," [...] she went on with a sudden {{softening}} of the voice, [...] "you have been in Egypt, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have so often seen your name in the papers; did you ever meet my brother there?" ...|$|E
3000|$|I do now.

6000|$|... "Old Billy Possum is dead. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw Farmer Brown's boy {{carrying}} him {{home by the}} tail," [...] said Reddy. [...] "So you see he wasn't so smart as you thought he was," [...] he added maliciously.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you would}} not write to me, Constance, nor even to your mother! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wrote to her to ask for your address, and she replied {{that she did not}} <b>know</b> it, that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> more about your {{movements}} in London than she did." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{was a clear}} case {{of mental}} telegraphy; of mind-transference; of my mind {{telegraphing}} a thought into hers. How do <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> telegraphed an error. For {{it turned out that}} the pictures did not represent the killing of Lulu at all, nor anything connected with Lulu. She had to get the error from my head--it existed nowhere else.|$|E
60|$|So it {{was that}} I reached the Marquesas the {{possessor}} of a real man's size thirst. And in the Marquesas were several white men, a lot of sickly natives, much magnificent scenery, plenty of trade rum, an immense quantity of absinthe, but neither whisky nor gin. The trade rum scorched the skin off one's mouth. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> tried it. But I had ever been plastic, and I accepted the absinthe. The trouble with the stuff was that I had to take such inordinate quantities in order to feel the slightest effect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{when your}} body is all dead, and you are all there yet, you just skin out and leave your body. And when you leave your body you leave the cell. Stone walls and iron doors are to hold bodies in. They can't hold the spirit in. You see, you have proved it. You are spirit outside of your body. You can look at your body from outside of it. I tell you <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have done it three times--looked at my body lying there with me outside of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you ask me}} the question! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you. Your silence, dearest, {{has never}} lowered you in the {{estimation}} of your true friends. The disappearance of your precious birthday gift may seem strange; your unexplained connection with that event may seem stranger still." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Dictated, January 23, 1907.]--The proverb {{says that}} Providence protects {{children}} and idiots. This is really true. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have tested it. It did not protect George {{through the most}} of his campaign, but it saved him in his last inning, and the veracity of the proverb stood confirmed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't tell you, dear, {{because the}} mere mention of {{smallpox}} always upsets you so much, especially just now with all this election worry going on; and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was at the Smiths' cottage and nursing the baby when the doctor came in and said it was smallpox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so Mr. Chuck {{slept on}} until the tender young green things began once more to grow. The cold could not reach him, and the fat he had stored under his skin took the place of food. When he awoke in the spring, he knew nothing of the hard times his neighbors were talking about. And ever since then the Chuck family has slept through the winter, {{because it is the}} most {{comfortable}} and sensible thing to do. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{have done the same thing}} for years. Good-by, Peter Rabbit! No more stories until spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I pity {{any woman}} who is foolish enough to marry," [...] she said solemnly. [...] "No man is to be trusted, Joyce--no man. They are all ready to break a trusting woman's heart for the sport of it. Never you allow any man the chance to break yours, Joyce. I shall never consent to your marrying anybody, so mind you don't take any such notion into your head. There oughtn't to be any danger, for I have instilled correct ideas on this subject into you from childhood. But girls are such fools. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was one myself once." ...|$|E
6000|$|Adam. What am I? or from whence? For that I am [...] [Rising. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think; but whence I came, Or {{how this}} frame of mine began to be, What other being can {{disclose}} to me? I move, I see, I speak, discourse, and know; Though now I am, I {{was not always}} so. Then that, from which I was, must be before, Whom, as my spring of being, I adore. How full of ornament is all I view, In all its parts! and seems as beautiful as new: O goodly-ordered work! O Power Divine, Of thee I am, and what I am is thine! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it isn't, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{read about}} it in a story in a magazine. And they were eating it. On the terrace.... What is that shish kibub?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> It is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am Leslie Gray's daughter, isn't it? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{that father}} loved you--his brother, Uncle Willis, {{told me all}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> already," [...] {{answered}} Ujarak, [...] "that {{you come}} from the far-away there," [...] pointing southward; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am an angekok. You {{have come from a}} spot near to the land where the Kablunets have settled, and you are bringing iron and other things to exchange with my kinsmen for horns of the narwhal and tusks of the walrus." ...|$|R
