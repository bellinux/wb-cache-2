The immobilized Rh(I) complexes were employed as recoverable catalysts for hydromamination and hydroalkoxylation reactions. A series of aforementioned N,N ligands and one N,P ligand precursor were functionalized with aniline and aniline hydrochloride respectively. The treatment of the aniline-functionalized ligands and aniline hydrochloride-functionalized ligand precursor with HNO 2 resulted in the transformation of the NH 2 functionality into diazonium one. The electrochemical reduction of the diazonium functionality of the N,N ligands and N,P ligand precursor resulted in the surface attachment of these compounds onto glassy carbon electrode surfaces. The treatment of the surface-bound N,P ligand precursor with LiPPh 2 resulted {{in the formation of the}} surface-bound N,P ligand (dmPyP). The complexation of [Rh(CO) 2 (μ-Cl) ] 2 with the immobilized N,N and N,P ligands led to the formation of immobilized Rh(I) complexes of these ligands. XPS confirmed the surface attachment of the N,N ligands and N,P ligand precursor as well as the success of the synthesis of the N,P ligand on the surface and complexation between immobilized ligands and the Rh precursor. The surface coverage of immobilized Rh(I) complexes was evaluated using CV and was found to be close to being a monolayer. The immobilized Rh(I) complexes were active as catalysts for the intramolecular hydroamination and dihydroalkoxylation reactions with extremely high TONs in comparison with their homogeneous counterparts. Studies of the recovered catalyst samples showed that Rh leached from the surface while the ligand remained intact. The aniline-functionalized N,N ligands were also attached onto glassy carbon electrodes without electrochemical assistance by <b>dipping</b> the <b>electrode</b> into a solution of aryl diazonium salt. Complexation of the ligands immobilized without electrochemical assistance and [Rh(CO) 2 (μ-Cl) ] 2 resulted in immobilized Rh(I) complexes with these ligands. XPS confirmed that the immobilized species had the same nature as those immobilized using electrochemical reduction and they were effective catalysts for dihydroalkoxylation. The surface coverage of these complexes was evaluated by means of CV and was found to be close to being a monolayer. The ligand bpm was also immobilized onto carbon powders (GCB and XC) without electrochemical assistance. The immobilized support-[Rh(bpm) (CO) 2] complexes were obtained by the treatment of bpm-functionalized supports with [Rh(CO) 2 (μ-Cl) ] 2. XPS confirmed the ligand attachment onto the surface of carbon powders and complexation with Rh. TGA also confirmed the covalent immobilization of the ligand and was used to determine the surface coverage of ligand. The immobilized complex XC-[Rh(bpm) (CO) 2] was active as a catalyst for the intramolecular hydroamination and dihydroalkoxylation of alkynes reactions. The recovered catalyst XC-[Rh(bpm) (CO) 2] had significantly lower activity in the hydroamination and slightly decreased activity in the hydroalkoxylation reaction in comparison with the fresh catalyst. It was found that Rh leached from the surface of XC support during the catalytic reaction due to the cleavage of N-Rh bonds. The structure of a 13 CO-labelled complex [Ir(PyP) (13 CO) Cl] was examined using a series of solid-state NMR techniques. 1 D 1 H MAS, 13 C and 31 P CP MAS NMR spectra provided structural information similar to that obtained using NMR in solution. High resolution 2 D solid-state correlation spectroscopy provided information about the dipolar coupling between protons and carbon/phosphorus. The use of the BABA pulse sequence to create and reconvert back double quantum coherences revealed the dipolar coupling contacts between immediately adjacent protons. The internuclear distance 13 CO- 31 P was determined using REDOR.

Copper corrosion inhibition by gramine [3 -(dimethylaminomethyl) indole] in the 0. 5 M sulphuric acid solutions was {{studied in the}} temperature range 25 - 55 °C using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques (EIS). Gramine was dissolved at various concentrations (from 5 ∙ 10 - 4 to 7. 5 ∙ 10 - 3) in 0. 5 M sulphuric acid. The surface preparation of the specimens was carried out using silicon carbide paper up to grade 1200. EIS measurements were performed after <b>dipping</b> the working <b>electrode</b> into the 0. 5 M sulphuric acid solutions with or without inhibitor at Ecorr with an a. c. voltage amplitude of 5 mV. The frequency range was swept between 100 kHz and 10 mHz with 10 point for hertz decade. The presence of gramine led to changes of the impedance plots in both shape and size. The plots of Nyquist exhibited that some impedance spectra consisted of one capacitive loop at the higher frequencies which was attributed to a faradaic process involving a charge transfer resistance in parallel with double-layer capacitance element [1]. The size of the capacitive arc increased by increasing the concentration of gramine. This indicated that gramine increased the charge transfer resistance and then it had an inhibiting effect on copper corrosion in 0. 5 M sulphuric acid solutions. Inhibition efficiencies {{results showed that the}} gramine inhibited the copper corrosion in the temperature range 25 - 55 °C reaching the maximum value of 86 % at 55 °C. Impedance spectra also showed a depression of Nyquist-plot semicircles that can be related to the surface heterogeneity due the microscopic roughness of the electrode surface and inhibitor adsorption [2]. Moreover at the lower frequencies in both the uninhibited solutions and inhibited ones by lower inhibitor concentrations, the Warburg impedance appeared. In the copper corrosion in oxygenated sulphuric acid solutions at Ecorr the anodic reaction is copper dissolution and cathodic reaction is oxygen reduction being the hydrogen discharge current density negligible as compared to oxygen reduction current density. Then the Warburg impedance could be attributed to oxygen transport from the bulk solution to the copper surface [3]. The adsorption behaviour of gramine followed Temkin’s isotherm. The values of the standard free energy of adsorption of the gramine at 25 °C, 35 °C, 45 °C and 55 °C were calculed. A structural model of the interface copper/ 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 was proposed. [1] O. E.

In order to cross and overcome certain limits by improvement in the knowledge, specific electrodes should be constructed and devoted to the deepening of the electrochemical behaviour of the COx system in different situations. Iron {{is one of the}} most common redox species in soils and sedimentary rocks. Iron-bearing phyllosilicates play key roles in various biogeochemical processes. The complexity of the physical and chemical (along with structural) changes involving their structural iron makes the studies of its redox properties challenging. Most of the recent reported efforts were focused on probing Fe redox on finely powdered clay (and often micas) particles, and have been hampered by inadequate interactions between particles and electrodes. Moreover, such experiments usually involve redox probe ions, thus adding supplementary difficulties in the determination of structural iron redox parameters such as redox potential (Eh) and kinetics. The present study aims at qualitatively investigating the above mentioned phenomena on minerals like iron-bearing micas. In the current work, we present initial insights regarding efforts to build a direct electrical interface between solid electrodes and conveniently shaped macroscopic mica crystals in order to investigate the redox properties of structural iron in dry and aqueous environments, in the presence of representative perturbations. A classical three electrode system has been used for voltammetric measurements. Platinum plate (1 cm²) was the counter electrode. Potentials have been measured against either silver-silver chloride electrode (Ag-AgCl/ 3 M KCl) or Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE/KClsat) as reference electrodes. Open Circuit Potential (OCP) measurements and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) were realised as well as Long term OCP measurements, along with pH and other parameters, are also measured. Most of the experiments discussed here have been conducted in unbuffered NaCl or KCl 0. 1 M solutions, at 25 °C. Anoxic conditions were maintained by first bubbling N 2 and then maintaining a gas layer in the head space of the reactor. Long term measurements showed that in these conditions, pH stays at a value around 8. 9 and is stable for several weeks. Experiments realised in buffered solution, at pH 7. 5, using 1 mM Piperazine- 1, 4 -bis(2 -ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) and 2 mM NaOH did not show any observable change. In some experiments, 5 mM ferricyanide (Fe(CN) 63 -) have also been used as a redox probe. High resistivities previously have been reported for this type of material, ranging from 1010 to 1015 Ω. cm at room temperature. Given the current flows detection limit of the apparatus used for measuring (~nA), the mm-thick pieces used in first experiments should normally behave like insulating screens on Ag (or maybe Cu-Ag) electrodes, e. g. no current could be measured across the sample with low iron content. OCP measurement consists in measuring the electrode rest potential against a reference electrode, in absence of observable current. It provides a first indication on the type of material present on the support electrode; normally no potential should be measured in absence of an electrically conductive path. Unfortunately, first records showed that OCP can be measured immediately after the immersion of all the first electrodes prepared (Figure 1, left) even on muscovite and lepidolite, clearly indicating the presence of water in the different samples. However, signals obtained for lepidolite and muscovite are less stable and can only be conveniently recorded in absence of external perturbation around the electrode such as vibration or even air movement, whereas signals obtained for the different biotite samples are very stable. Changing parameters in the electrolyte such as pH (figure 1, right) removal of O 2, or change in Cl- does not seems to affect the measured OCP of this type of electrode as it stay stable for days. Several week-longs monitoring on ten biotite <b>electrodes,</b> <b>dipped</b> in unbuffered NaCl 0. 1 M, showed that the OCP slowly decreases and stays stable, at values between 0. 1 and 0. 14 mV/NHE (data not shown), despite occasional pH oscillation between 4 and 9. Results of these experiments show that several aspects of the designs of such electrodes have to be improved for further experiments. From these observations, we can't preclude that water might participate in the electrical contact between the support electrode and the solution, but we can still hypothesize that it could be due to interlayer traces of water, offering a poorly electrically conductive path in lepidolite and muscovite, whereas another mechanism might participate in the biotite sample. First, lowering of the water content in the mineral must be realised, using smaller crystals, longer drying and vacuuming time, and using more penetrating and impregnating resins. Platinum plates and evaporated platinum or carbon are envisioned for the inert support electrode. Using thinned slices should reduce electrical resistivity of the whole bulk structure, allowing a more convenient observation of the coupled electrons transfers that might occur between separated crystal surfaces. Hence, more suitable cutting techniques, such as wire sawing, should be planned to obtain thinner slices. More mica samples must also be selected, with higher and lower iron contents than the one used in the present experiments. This first set of experiments in interfacing solid electrodes and conveniently shaped mica crystals offers hope that this will be a valuable technique for probing structural iron. ...|$|R
40|$|Radionuclides play an {{important}} role in the field of nuclear medicine both for therapy and diagnosis. These radionuclides are produced by nuclear reactions in a nuclear reactor or in a cyclotron. The knowledge of the cross-sections of the nuclear reactions, which yield these radionuclides and other competing reactions, is imperative. In this work, thermal neutron induced 235 U fission neutron spectrum averaged cross-sections were measured by the activation technique in combination with radiochemical separation and high resolution y-spectroscopy. Using Zinc as target material the cross-sections of 64 Zn (n, p) 64 Cu, 67 Zn (n, p) 67 Cu, 8 Zn (n, p) 6 i and 64 Zn (n, 2 n) 63 Zn reactions were estimated. Values of cross sections estimated are 34. 72 : 1 : 4. 82, 1. 37 : 1 : 0. 18, 0. 067 : 1 : 0. 008, and 0. 051 : 1 : 0. 006 milibams respectively. No carrier free 64 Cu and 67 Cu were obtained by the precipitation technique while carrier-ftee 64 Cu and 67 Cu were obtained by spontaneous electro-deposition. 67 Cu formed could not be chemically separated ftom 64 Cu. Fission neutron spectrum averaged cross-sections were measured by the activation technique in combination with radiochemical separation and high resolution y-spectroscopy for few (n,p) (n, 2 n) and (n,a) reactions on isotopes of Palladium. The cross-sections of 102 Pd(n,p) 102 Rh, 105 Pd(n,p) 105 Rh, 102 Pd(n, 2 n) 10 Ipd, 104 Pd(n, 2 n) 103 Pd and 1 Â° 6 pd(n,a) 103 Ru reactions were estimated. The values of cross sections for these reactions estimated in milibams were 506 : 1 : 97, 180 : 1 : 34, 165 : 1 : 31, 420 : 1 : 80 and 4. 9 : 1 : 1. 0 respectively. The reaction of interest was 104 Pd (n,p +d + n'p) 103 Rhp-. 103 Pd. But as the production of 103 Pd via this route is very little and it is produced by several routes simultaneously and decays, so the measurement of the cross-section of this reaction was impossible with the facilities available. Fortunately, a new separation technique was explored during the study of these reactions and was later applied for other purposes. This was the first application of the spontaneous electro-deposition technique for the separation of carrier- ftee radioisotopes of palladium ftom neutron-irradiated cadmium or palladium targets. The deposited radio palladium was removed by <b>dipping</b> the platinum <b>electrode</b> in nitric acid giving a highly pure yield of carrier-fteelO 9 pd and orlO 3 Pd. The process is very simple and needs little manipulation and amenable to automation and remote processing. The process was found insensitive to the concentrations of Cd(N 03) 2 and lIN 03. Deposition velocity of (4. 119 :: 1 : 0. 353) x 10 - 2 min- 1 and deposition constant 0. 1211 cm min- 1 was calculated and from the temperature dependence of the deposition velocity constants, activation energy of 0. 1155 :: 1 : 0. 3169 eV was also determined. The thermodynamic spontaneity was found to be satisfied at different concentrations of Pd+ 2 ions. The process was. found to be irreversible. Fission neutron spectrum averaged cross-sections were measured by the activation technique in combination with radiochemical separation and high resolution y-spectroscopy for several (n,p) and (n,a) reactions on isotopes of Cadmium. The cross-sections of l 06 Cd(n,a) 103 pd, 106 Cd(n,p) 106 m Ag, 108 Cd(n,p) 108 mAg,lIOCd(n,p) llOmAg,I 11 Cd(n,p) 11 IAg, 112 Cd(n,a) 109 Pd, 1 I 2 Cd(n,p) 112 Ag, 1 I 3 Cd(n,p) 1 l 3 Ag and 1 I 4 Cd(n,a) 1 IIPd reactions were estimated. The values of cross sections for these reactions estimated in milibarns were 2. 29 :i: 0. 69, 5. 55 :i: 0. 76 0. 65 :i: 0. 090. 18 :i: 0. 03 2. 02 :i: 0. 29 0. 73 :i: 0. ll 15. 7 :i: 2. 3 0. 102 :i: 0. 015 and 0. 17 :i: 0. 02 respectively. For separation by precipitation, the solution of Cadmium in lIN 03 was treated with NaOH giving precipitates of Cd(OH) 2 which were separated by filtration and the filtrate was subjected to counting. To obtain highly pure yield of 103 Pd, the spontaneous electro-deposition method was applied. To get rid of interfering isotopes of Silver, the solution was first treated with HCI giving precipitates of AgCI which were removed by filtration. Fission neutron spectrum averaged cross-sections were also measured by techniques mentioned earlier for few (n,p) and (n,a) reactions on isotopes of Zirconium. The cross-sections of reactions 90 Zr(n,p) 9 omy, 90 Zr(n,p) 90 gy, 9 IZr(n,p) 9 Imy, 9 IZr(n,p) 9 Igy, 92 Zr(n,a) 89 Sr and 94 Zr(n,a) 9 ISr were estimated. The values of cross sections for these reactions estimated in milibams were found to be 0. 32 : 1 : 0. 06, 0. 76 : 1 : 0. 15, 0. 11 : 1 : 0. 02, 0. 42 : 1 : 0. 08, 0. 032 : 1 : 0. 006 and 0. 02 : 1 : 0. 004 respectively. For separation by precipitation, Zirconyl nitrate irradiated with neutrons was dissolved in HCI with gentle heating and then treated with Mendalic acid. Precipitates of Zirconium Mendalate were removed by filtration and the filtrate was subjected to counting on y-ray spectrometer Electro-deposition technique was also tried to separate Yttrium but no deposition was observed even applying a voltage of 6 V for six hours. Nuclear model calculations were carried out for the following nuclear reactions: Nuclear model calculations were performed using the computer code STAPRE. The experimental data has been found to be in good agreement with the values obtained from model calculations. Therefore, experimental and theoretical studies carried out in this work show that the fission neutron spectrum averaged cross sections of some threshold reactions can be described well by the statistical model incorporating precompound effects. Production feasibility studies showed that at a fast flux neutron density of 7. 5 x 1013 cm- 2 s- 1 and using 100...|$|R
