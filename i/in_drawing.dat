5|$|Around 1917 at Mrs. Dow's School, an art {{assistant}} taught classes <b>in</b> <b>drawing,</b> painting, and modeling. In {{addition to}} their daily tasks, the students prepared monthly compositions which would be critiqued by the school's art director Frank DuMond through a lecture. Art history classes included that of Italian Renaissance painting and sculpture, Western European painting, {{and the history of}} Greek sculpture, architecture, and interior decoration.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss's {{academic}} rankings remained {{generally the}} same in his following year at the academy. His scores <b>in</b> <b>drawing,</b> mathematics, and physics were above average, while his merits in French language and history were among the worst. He finished 33rd {{in the class of}} 66. He maintained his spot as the most disciplined in his class, earning fewer than half the demerits than the second-best.|$|E
5|$|Despite the British training, the SLA was {{not large}} enough or {{strong enough to}} enter into combat with the RUF while also holding the ground it had recaptured, so the British persuaded UNAMSIL to move forward behind the {{advancing}} SLA to defend its recaptured ground. Additional British liaison officers were attached to UNAMSIL, and the British facilitated a daily coordination meeting for SLA and UNAMSIL commanders, while also assisting the UN forces <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> up a campaign plan.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York, Koppelman continued {{his study of}} Aesthetic Realism, and under the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Amédée Ozenfant School and became Ozenfant's assistant. While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the subtleties of light and shade <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> and painting.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss {{was born}} on October 14, 1859 in Petersburg, Virginia. He grew up in Central Virginia until he was {{appointed}} to the United States Naval Academy at the age of sixteen years and eight months. He began classes at the academy on June 21, 1876 and was the only member of his class from Virginia. Cabaniss was an average student while at the Naval Academy; he finished 40th in his class of 69 in his second year, earning near-top marks <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> and mathematics but very low marks in history and French language. He also spent the mandatory two months and eighteen days at sea. Cabaniss had the fewest demerits of any member of his sophomore class and earned a spot on the academy's summer cruise on the USS Constellation.|$|E

5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{was born}} in Long Branch, Ontario in 1926, the younger of two children. Her father, Thomas Howard, a {{secondary}} school teacher, was an English immigrant. Her mother, Helen Mackintosh, who {{was born in}} Winnipeg, was of Scottish ancestry. Having decided early to become an artist, Howard studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto from 1948 to 1951, where she was a pupil of Will Ogilvie, who taught her figure drawing, and Jock Macdonald, who taught her painting and composition. In her final year she won the silver medal <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> and painting.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{civil war}} {{broke out in the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when the Bar Confederation sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski. One of Kościuszko's brothers, Józef, fought {{on the side of the}} insurgents. Faced with a {{difficult}} choice between the rebels and his sponsors—the King and the Czartoryski family, who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination—Kościuszko chose to leave Poland. In late 1769, he and a colleague, the noted artist Aleksander Orłowski, were granted royal scholarships, and on October 5 they set off for Paris. They wanted to further their military education, but as foreigners they were barred from enrolling in French military academies, and so they enrolled instead in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. There Kościuszko pursued his interest <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> and painting and took private lessons in architecture from the noted French architect Jean-Rodolphe Perronet.|$|E

5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. <b>In</b> <b>drawing</b> {{many of the old}} vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted a friend of his, Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le Brillant, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Johns {{initially}} {{served at}} the United States Military Academy as an instructor in the Department of Tactics but in July 1916 he was posted to the 1st Battalion of Mounted Engineers on the Mexican Border. He served with the Pancho Villa Expedition from November 1916 to February 1917, when the 8th Engineers returned to El Paso, Texas. Johns was promoted to captain in May 1917 and major in May 1918. He commanded the 8th Engineers from April to August 1918. Returning to the United States Military Academy in August 1918, he became an instructor <b>in</b> <b>Drawing</b> from August to December 1918, and in Tactics from November to December 1918. From December 1918 to mid-1919 he was an instructor in Mathematics.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for {{abortive}} {{talks with}} the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably in this time too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Of the 55Japanese-born {{players who}} have played in MLB, 15 have entered the league using the posting system. Since the system's {{creation}} in 1998, the 22players that have used it have experienced a range of success. Of these 22, eleven were immediately signed to Major League contracts and one player who drew no bids on his first posting was signed to a Major League contract on his second posting. These contracts range from $1.4million to $155million. Of the remaining nine, three were signed to Minor League contracts, two were unable to reach a contract agreement and five were unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> bids from any Major League clubs (one player failed to draw bids during two separate postings). The following tables outline each posting and its outcome.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} {{flank of the}} 2nd Canadian Division, the 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Division {{executed}} a diversionary operation which proved successful <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> German retaliatory fire away from the main operation. Four hours later, the 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Division attempted to exploit the weakened German force by pushing strong patrols towards the centre of Lens. This ultimately failed as the Germans used local counter-attacks across the 4th Canadian Division's front to drive the patrols back to the city's outskirts.|$|E
5|$|Relatively isolated, gentry {{families}} {{spent much}} of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours. As a result, hospitality was an important part of life. Leisure activities pursued by the gentry included hunting, cards and chess. Music remained important in noble houses, with accounts listing professional musicians hired to entertain the family and guests. However, professional musicians were expensive to maintain. In the eighteenth century members of the household often provided musical entertainment on the harpsichord, organ and piano. House libraries often contained considerable quantities of music, as at Dalkeith Palace, where the Duke of Buccleuch's daughter collected vocal music between 1780 and 1800. In the nineteenth century it was the women of the family who were the chief performers and men were not expected to play the piano <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> rooms.|$|E

5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series has progressed. Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs, but because it took too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt was {{primarily}} of significance as the opening chapter in, and causative {{agent of the}} Greco-Persian Wars, which included the two invasions of Greece and the famous battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis. For the Ionian cities themselves, the revolt ended in failure, and substantial losses, both material and economic. However, Miletus aside, they recovered relatively quickly and prospered under Persian rule for the next forty years. For the Persians, the revolt was significant <b>in</b> <b>drawing</b> them into an extended conflict with the states of Greece which would last for fifty years, over which time they would sustain considerable losses.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} {{of seven children}} of Hjálmtýr E. Hjálmtýsson, a bank clerk, and Margrét Matthíasdóttir, a writer, Paul Oscar was born on 16 March 1970 in Reykjavík. As a child he displayed artistic talent <b>in</b> <b>drawing,</b> writing fairy tales and singing – his mother had him sing for the women in her sewing club and at family birthday parties. He also spent much time singing in choirs and in media commercials, and recorded his first album {{at the age of}} seven. His first leading role in a professional theatre production was at 12years of age in the musical version of Rubber Tarzan, a popular Danish children's novel by Ole Lund Kirkegaard (1940–1979). His voice broke two weeks after the musical's last performance, and he did not sing for the next few years.|$|E
