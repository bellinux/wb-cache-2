5|$|Andrey Lugovoy {{has said}} he flew from London to Moscow on a 3 November flight. He stated he arrived in London on 31 October to attend the {{football}} match between Arsenal and CSKA Moscow on 1 November. When the news broke that a radioactive substance <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> murder Litvinenko, {{a team of scientists}} rushed to find out how far the contamination had spread. It led them on a trail involving hundreds of people and dozens of locations.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus {{found that it}} was {{due to a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms {{about the}} ISA {{and the state}} of freedom of speech and {{assembly}} in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations. A 2007 report by Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada, Rule of Law in Singapore, alleged that defamation and bankruptcy law <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> oppress the political opposition, and expressed concern about stringent limits on the freedom of assembly and detention under the ISA.|$|E

5|$|Security experts {{found that}} the {{ransomware}} {{did not use the}} EternalBlue exploit to spread, and a simple method to vaccinate an unaffected machine running older Windows versions was found by October 24, 2017. Further, the sites that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> spread the bogus Flash updating have gone offline or removed the problematic files within a few days of its discovery, effectively killing off the spread of Bad Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{continued to}} serve as the headquarters for the Perth City Council from its completion until 1994, when it was vacated to allow for the removal of asbestos which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> insulate the building's steel frame. The Council moved to office space in the Westralia Square building.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Seychellum {{are the two}} species of Deckenia from the African mainland. The two-lobed shape of the last segment of the mandibular palp, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> argue for a close relationship between Seychellum and Indian crabs of the family Gecarcinucidae, {{does not appear to}} be a reliable phylogenetic character.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17 {{a few hundred}} miles east of the Leeward Islands. It was upgraded to a tropical storm late that evening. This marked the third time that the 'P' name <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950. The previous times were for Pablo in 1995 and Peter in 2003. In subsequent seasons, 'P' names would be given to Paloma in 2008, Paula in 2010, Philippe in 2011, and Patty in 2012.|$|E
5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The aim of the act was to improve the government's {{ability to deal with}} terrorism. It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E

Kodecytes have also demonstrated that FSL-FLRO4 is a suitable reagent for labelling packed {{red blood cells}} (PRBC) at any point during routine storage and look to facilitate the development of immunoassays and transfusion models focused on addressing the mechanisms involved in tansfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM). Murine kodecytes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> experimentally <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine in vivo cell survival, and create model transfusion reactions. Zebrafish kodecytes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine real time in vivo cell migration. Kodecytes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> create influenza diagnostics. Kodecytes which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> modified with FSL-GB3 were unable to be infected with the HIV virus.|$|R
5|$|Before September 2, 2002, WWE {{recognized}} {{only one}} world champion, the WWE Undisputed Champion, {{for both the}} Raw and SmackDown! brands. After SummerSlam, then WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown!, leaving Raw without a world champion. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff then awarded Triple H the World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the Big Gold Belt (which previously <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> represent the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Heavyweight Championship), making him the first World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H retained his title against Rob Van Dam at Unforgiven when Ric Flair hit Van Dam with a sledgehammer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> initiate the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston {{had used}} it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it {{through a series of}} stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had {{used it to}} separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, who had used the process to separate gases.|$|E
5|$|However, Newcastle and his Lieutenant General, Lord Eythin, {{were opposed}} to any pitched battle and {{possibly}} offended by Rupert's high-handed attitude. Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised, claiming {{that it would take}} time to clear the earth and rubble which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> block the city gates of York during the siege. Newcastle's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment, a dispute which Eythin may have fomented. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city, and had yet to return.|$|E
5|$|In August 2002, the Israeli Military Intelligence Chief {{alleged that}} Arafat's {{personal}} wealth {{was in the}} range of US$1.3 billion. In 2003 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted an audit of the PNA and stated that Arafat diverted $900 million in public funds to a special bank account controlled by Arafat and the PNA Chief Economic Financial adviser. However, the IMF did not claim that there were any improprieties, and it specifically stated that most of the funds <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> invest in Palestinian assets, both internally and abroad.|$|E

5|$|In {{early to}} mid-2009, several {{narcotics}} and bomb-making facilities were raided by British forces, supported by Apaches. In April 2009, {{it was reported}} that an Apache <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> intercept a suicide bombing attack in Helmand province. During the Summer of 2009, British Apaches were an integral component of Operation Panther's Claw, which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in the runup to the 2009 Afghan Elections. During this major offensive, Apaches from the UK routinely flew alongside US Cobra helicopters to provide air support to soldiers of 3rd Battalion Black Watch and the Royal Marines conducting ground operations. During the Summer 2009 operations, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, and several accomplices were killed in a precision strike launched by an Apache.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, a man {{allegedly}} gave Murray's {{father a}} rusty, stained knife {{that belonged to}} the man's brother, who had a criminal past and lived {{less than a mile from}} where the car was discovered. His brother and his brother's girlfriend were said to have acted strangely after the disappearance, and the man's brother claimed he believed the knife <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> kill Murray. Several days after the knife was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo. Family members of the man who turned in the knife claimed he had made up the story in order to obtain reward money in the investigation, and that he had a history of drug use.|$|E
