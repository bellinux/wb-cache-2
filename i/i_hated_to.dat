500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son– but I am glad of it... Now [...] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers." ...|$|E

Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that [...] "I really had nothing to tell him, but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke." ...|$|E

[...] During this time of transition, she came to regard the Qur'an as relative – it was a historical record and [...] "just another book." ...|$|E

'It does arise {{directly}} from the consideration of the struggle {{to get away from}} speaking Cornish dialect and to speak correct English, a struggle which I began thus early and pursued constantly with no regret, for was it not the key which unlocked the door to all that lay beyond—Oxford, the world of letters, the community of all who speak the King’s English, from which I should otherwise have been infallibly barred? But the struggle made me very sensitive about language; <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be corrected; nothing is more humiliating: and it left me with a complex about Cornish dialect.
