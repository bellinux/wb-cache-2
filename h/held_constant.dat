5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol {{is not well}} understood. In animals, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge {{has been shown to}} precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion. This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: estrogen receptor alpha, which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and estrogen receptor beta, which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship. However, in humans {{it has been shown that}} high levels of estradiol can provoke abrupt increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are <b>held</b> <b>constant,</b> suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the shaft speed is <b>held</b> <b>constant,</b> test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is <b>held</b> <b>constant,</b> test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM.

25|$|The consumer's preferences, {{monetary}} income and prices {{play an important}} role in solving the consumer's optimization problem (choosing how much of various goods to consume so as to maximize their utility subject to a budget constraint). The comparative statics of consumer behavior investigates the effects of changes in the exogenous or independent variables (especially prices and money incomes of the consumers) on the chosen values of the endogenous or dependent variables (the consumer's demands for the goods). When the income of the consumer rises with the prices <b>held</b> <b>constant,</b> the optimal bundle chosen by the consumer changes as the feasible set available to him changes. The income–consumption curve is the set of tangency points of indifference curves with the various budget constraint lines, with prices <b>held</b> <b>constant,</b> as income increases shifting the budget constraint out.|$|E

25|$|Figure 1 {{illustrates}} {{velocity and}} acceleration vectors for uniform motion at four {{different points in}} the orbit. Because the velocity v is tangent to the circular path, no two velocities point in the same direction. Although the object has a constant speed, its direction is always changing. This change in velocity is caused by an acceleration a, whose magnitude is (like that of the velocity) <b>held</b> <b>constant,</b> but whose direction also is always changing. The acceleration points radially inwards (centripetally) and is perpendicular to the velocity. This acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration.|$|E

25|$|In two dimensions, {{if one of}} the {{coordinates}} in a point coordinate system is <b>held</b> <b>constant</b> and the other coordinate is allowed to vary, then the resulting curve is called a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system the coordinate curves are, in fact, straight lines, thus coordinate lines. Specifically, they are the lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes. For other coordinate systems {{the coordinates}} curves may be general curves. For example, the coordinate curves in polar coordinates obtained by holding r constant are the circles with center at the origin. Coordinates systems for Euclidean space other than the Cartesian coordinate system are called curvilinear coordinate systems. This procedure does not always make sense, for example there are no coordinate curves in a homogeneous coordinate system.|$|E

Snowshoe hares were studied at two distinct seasonal periods: winter, before reproductive activity; and summer, during reproductive midseason. Winter animals experienced greater viremia than did summer hares when exposed to fluctuating temperatures, suggesting a seasonality in the hare's susceptibility to host modification by environmental influences. These findings implicate the snowshoe hare as a possible mammalian amplifying host for WEE virus in the boreal forest...|$|R
25|$|There are two typical {{protocols}} of SMD: one {{in which}} pulling velocity is <b>held</b> <b>constant,</b> and {{one in which}} applied force is constant. Typically, part of the studied system (e.g., an atom in a protein) is restrained by a harmonic potential. Forces are then applied to specific atoms at either a constant velocity or a constant force. Umbrella sampling is used to move the system along the desired reaction coordinate by varying, for example, the forces, distances, and angles manipulated in the simulation. Through umbrella sampling, all of the system's configurations—both high-energy and low-energy—are adequately sampled. Then, each configuration's change in free energy can be calculated as the potential of mean force. A popular method of computing PMF is through the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), which analyzes a series of umbrella sampling simulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} function {{is essentially a}} measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product.

In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass {{objective function}}. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some biotechnologically relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a chemostat or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are <b>held</b> <b>constant.</b> Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on whether varying plate size {{has an effect}} on consumption is mixed and contradictory. This meta-analysis of 56 studies from 20 papers shows that varying the size of the container holding food (e. g., plate orbowl) has a substantial effect on amount self-served and/or consumed (Cohen’s d 5. 43). More generally, we found adoubling of plate size increased the amount self-served or amount consumed by 41 %. Our analysis resolves the variouscontradictions of past reviews: we found that the plate-size effect had a substantial effect on amount self-served (d 5. 51) and on amount consumed when the portion was self-served (d 5. 70) or manipulated along with (confoundedwith) plate size (d 5 48).
