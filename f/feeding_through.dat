25|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is usually}} treated with intravenous fluids, pain medication, and sometimes antibiotics. Typically no eating or drinking is allowed and a tube may be placed into the stomach. A procedure {{known as an}} endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be done to open the pancreatic duct if blocked. In those with gallstones the gallbladder is often also removed. In chronic pancreatitis, {{in addition to the}} above, temporary <b>feeding</b> <b>through</b> a nasogastric tube may be used to provide adequate nutrition. Long-term dietary changes and pancreatic enzyme replacement may be required. And occasionally surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage cylinders <b>feeding</b> <b>through</b> a pressure regulator which will be set to the required supply pressure for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in surface-supplied diving. Bulk cylinders are also quiet in operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.|$|E
2500|$|Svendborg lies on {{the south}} coast of Funen. By road, Svendborg is located [...] {{southwest}} of Copenhagen, [...] south of Odense, [...] southeast of Middelfart, and [...] south-southeast of Faaborg. The Port of Svendborg is accessed by several channels, <b>feeding</b> <b>through</b> the islands of [...] Tåsinge and Thurø. Svendborg Sund approaches the town from the southwest, along which ferries coming from Ærøskøbing pass the smaller islands of Drejø, Hjortø, and Skarø. Between Tåsinge and Thurø is Thurø Sund, which passes Bregninge forest (Bregninge Skov) on the northeast coast of Tåsinge, approaching the port of Svendborg from the south. From the east, between mainland Funen and the island of Thurø, is the narrow Skårupøre Sund.|$|E
40|$|DE 102009013355 A 1 UPAB: 20101002 NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} has a {{base body}} (14) {{provided with a}} <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> (13) for an optical waveguide. The optical waveguide {{is led by the}} <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> in a region of ends, and includes a core (11) and a cladding (12). The optical waveguide is partly metalized in region of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> on the cladding. An electroplating (15) is in thermal contact with the base body. An optical reflector (16) is arranged between ends of the optical waveguide and the <b>feed</b> <b>through.</b> The optical reflector encloses the optical waveguide, and reflects scattered radiation. USE - Coupling arrangement for an optical waveguide i. e. optical fiber. ADVANTAGE - The optical waveguide is partly metalized in the region of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> on the cladding, and the electro plating is in the thermal contact with the base body, thus reducing cost, and achieving higher performances. The micro drilling is performed such that the electro plating is preferably located in direct contact with the inner wall of the <b>feed</b> <b>through,</b> thus providing an additional heat conducting medium between electroplating and the inner wall of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> to improve the heat conducting contact...|$|R
40|$|This paper, we {{analyzed}} that the measured {{data of the}} radiated power spectrum of electromagnetic waves of the normal spark ignition system and the spark ignition system with <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser. The {{results show that the}} strength of power spectrum radiated from the system with <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser is weaker than the normal system, and the density of power spectrum radiated from the system with <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser is smaller than the normal system. From these results, the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser can reduce the electromagnetic waves radiating from the spark ignition system which is the spurious emission, and it can be concluded that the ignition coil of the spark ignition system generating high voltage pulse is equivalent to the radio frequency oscillator which is oscillating hig...|$|R

6000|$|The uses of this Dante? We {{will not}} say much about his [...] "uses." [...] A human soul who has once got into that primal element of Song, and sung forth fitly {{somewhat}} therefrom, {{has worked in the}} depths of our existence; <b>feeding</b> <b>through</b> long times the life-roots of all excellent human things whatsoever,--in a way that [...] "utilities" [...] will not succeed well in calculating! We will not estimate the Sun by the quantity of gaslight it saves us; Dante shall be invaluable, or of no value. One remark I may make: the contrast in this respect between the Hero-Poet and the Hero-Prophet. In a hundred years, Mahomet, as we saw, had his Arabians at Grenada and at Delhi; Dante's Italians seem to be yet very much where they were. Shall we say, then, Dante's effect on the world was small in comparison? Not so: his arena is far more restricted; but also it is far nobler, clearer;--perhaps not less but more important. Mahomet speaks to great masses of men, in the coarse dialect adapted to such; a dialect filled with inconsistencies, crudities, follies: on the great masses alone can he act, and there with good and with evil strangely blended. Dante speaks to the noble, the pure and great, in all times and places. Neither does he grow obsolete, as the other does. Dante burns as a pure star, fixed there in the firmament, at which the great and the high of all ages kindle themselves: he is the possession of all the chosen of the world for uncounted time. Dante, one calculates, may long survive Mahomet. In this way the balance may be made straight again.|$|E
